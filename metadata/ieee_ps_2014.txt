Abstract: Intermittence and variability of renewable resources is often a barrier to their large scale integration into power systems. We propose a stochastic real-time unit commitment to deal with the stochasticity and intermittence of non-dispatchable renewable resources including ideal and generic energy storage devices. Firstly, we present a mathematical definition of an ideal and generic storage device. This storage device definition has some mathematical advantages: 1) it can be easily integrated within complex optimization problems, 2) it can be modeled using linear programming, suitable for practical large-scale cases. Secondly, a stochastic unit commitment with ideal and generic storage devices and intermittent generation is proposed to solve the joint energy-and-reserves scheduling and real-time power balance problem, reflecting the minute-by-minute intermittent changes and the stochasticity of renewable resources. We also compare our results with those obtained using a deterministic unit commitment with perfect information. The proposed model is illustrated with a 24-bus system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for corrective voltage control (CVC) of power systems in presence of uncertain wind power generation and demand values. The CVC framework deals with the condition that a power system encounters voltage instability as a result of severe contingencies. The uncertainty of wind power generation and demand values is handled using a scenario-based modeling approach. One of the features of the proposed methodology is to consider participation of demand-side resources as an effective control facility that reduces control costs. Active and reactive redispatch of generating units and involuntary load curtailment are employed along with the voluntary demand-side participation (demand response) as control facilities in the proposed CVC approach. The CVC is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The objectives are ensuring a desired loading margin while minimizing the corresponding control cost. This problem is solved using-constraint method, and fuzzy satisfying approach is employed to select the best solution from the Pareto optimal set. The proposed control framework is implemented on the IEEE 118-bus system to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: The fault ride-through capability (FRTC) of a full-rated converter wind turbine relies on the operation and control of the grid-side converter. To enhance the FRTC of the wind power generation system (WPGS), this paper investigates a novel controller for the grid-side converter, based on nonlinear adaptive control (NAC). Lumped perturbation terms are defined in the NAC to include all unknown and time-varying dynamics and external disturbances of the WPGS, and can be estimated by designing perturbation observers. The estimate of the perturbation terms is used to compensate the real perturbations and finally achieve an adaptive feedback linearizing control of the original nonlinear system, without requiring the accurate system model and full state measurements. The proposed NAC is an output feedback control and adaptive to parameter uncertainties and unknown nonlinearities of the WPGS, and time-varying external disturbances including grid faults, voltage dips and intermittent wind power inputs. The effectiveness of the proposed NAC is verified by simulation studies and compared with conventional vector controller and feedback linearizing controller, which show that it can provide better FRTC even though the grid voltage levels are far below their nominal values.

Abstract: Extreme power fluctuations in wind farms are rare but high-impact events, so proper characterization of these extreme fluctuations would assist with power systems operations planning in a power system with a high penetration of wind power. This work applies extreme value analysis methods to the statistical characterization of wind power ramps with 10-min resolution. The annual maxima series (AMS) method and peaks over threshold (POT) method are used to determine the probability of extreme wind power ramp events in a wind farm.

Abstract: An affine arithmetic (AA) method is proposed in this paper to solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem with uncertain generation sources. In the AA-based OPF problem, all the state and control variables are treated in affine form, comprising a center value and the corresponding noise magnitudes, to represent forecast, model error, and other sources of uncertainty without the need to assume a probability density function (pdf). The proposed AA-based OPF problem is used to determine the operating margins of the thermal generators in systems with uncertain wind and solar generation dispatch. The AA-based approach is bench-marked against Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) intervals in order to determine its effectiveness. The proposed technique is tested and demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus system and also a real 1211-bus European system.

Abstract: Short-term and very short-term load forecasting are essential for power grid management operations such as automatic generation control, unit commitment scheduling, and transmission loss estimation. Most existing forecasting techniques require that the load data be available up to the current time step. In recent years, cyber attacks increasingly threaten the secure operation of power grids. One potential cyber threat is communication failure which will affect load forecasting. When communication failure happens and actual load data are not available, forecasting accuracy suffers. To overcome this problem, we propose a time-forward kriging based approach to forecast load with and without communication failure. This technique has the ability to forecast the load by utilizing load information from neighboring regions. The proposed method has been tested using NYISO and PJM load data with 5-min and 1-h intervals, respectively. Our results show that the proposed method is capable of forecasting load under communication failure with acceptable accuracy and improved accuracy when compared with other forecasting techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified algorithm for optimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement in power system state estimation. Considering the similarity of the cases that the system is unobservable and that the system becomes unobservable if a critical measurement or a critical pair is removed from the measurement set, a unified algorithm of PMU placement for state estimation combining observability analysis and bad data detection into a single iterative procedure is presented. In each iteration of the algorithm, PMU placement is performed to make the system observable, or make critical measurements become non-critical, or make critical pairs become non-critical pairs, respectively. Based on Theorem 3.1 in "A direct numerical method for observability analysis" (Gou and Abur, IEEE Trans. Power Syst., vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 625-630, May 2000), this paper presents an improved optimal PMU placement algorithm wherein each iteration is performed by a significantly smaller integer linear programming (ILP) model whose size is governed by the rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix resulting from the configuration of conventional measurements. The proposed formulation thus leads to a far more smaller and simpler ILP problem compared to existing methods. Additional results are also presented to identify critical measurement pairs. The proposed approach is illustrated on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus systems.

Abstract: When the system is in normal state, actual SCADA measurements of power transfers across critical interfaces are continuously compared with limits determined offline and stored in look-up tables or nomograms in order to assess whether the network is secure or insecure and inform the dispatcher to take preventive action in the latter case. However, synchrophasors could change this paradigm by enabling new features, the phase-angle differences, which are well-known measures of system stress, with the added potential to increase system visibility. The paper develops a systematic approach to baseline the phase-angles versus actual transfer limits across system interfaces and enable synchrophasor-based situational awareness (SBSA). Statistical methods are first used to determine seasonal exceedance levels of angle shifts that can allow real-time scoring and detection of atypical conditions. Next, key buses suitable for SBSA are identified using correlation and partitioning around medoid (PAM) clustering. It is shown that angle shifts of this subset of 15% of the network backbone buses can be effectively used as features in ensemble decision tree-based forecasting of seasonal security margins across critical interfaces.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-control area framework for explicit modeling, managing, and accounting of simultaneous bilateral transactions with specified contract paths. Our framework provides a modular and multi-layered electrical network representation with zooming-in and zooming-out capabilities. The zoomed-out representation concerns interconnections and inter-area transactions, while the zoomed-in representation concerns a single area and its internal transactions. The framework allows explicit modeling of bilateral transactions with contract paths through a transformation of a meshed electrical network into a spanning tree. Loop flows are introduced to represent a deviation between the contract paths of bilateral transactions and physical line flows. The effects of both intra-area and inter-area bilateral transactions and loop flows can be graphically traced in the framework. Moreover, these tracing methods allocate bilateral transactions to line flows and loop flows, essential for accounting and flow control. Our tracing methods differ from the distribution factor based method because the distribution factor matrix handles nodal injections only and it cannot account for contract paths of bilateral transactions and the resulting loop flows. The multi-layered network transformations and tracing methods are illustrated on the IEEE 14-bus system.

Abstract: Integration of renewable energy resources into the power system has increased the financial and technical concerns for the market-based transmission expansion planning. This paper proposes a stochastic framework for transmission grid reinforcement studies in a power system with wind generation. A multi-stage multi-objective transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) methodology is developed which considers the investment cost, absorption of private investment and reliability of the system as the objective functions. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) optimization approach is used in combination with a probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) to determine the Pareto optimal solutions considering the power system uncertainties. Using a compromise-solution method, the best final plan is then realized based on the decision-maker preferences. The proposed methodology is applied to the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Tests System (RTS) to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the developed planning strategy.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the modeling and prediction of power frequency. Power frequency is one of the most essential parameters in the monitoring, control, and protection of power systems and electric equipments because when a significant disturbance occurs in a power system, the frequency varies in time and space. It is critical to employ a dependable model in order to optimize the efficiency and reliability of power systems in the Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET [ 1]), and thus, prevent frequency oscillation in power grid. This paper describes the use of a state-space model and basis functions to predict power frequency. In the state-space method, expectation maximization (EM) and prediction error minimization (PEM) algorithms are used to dynamically estimate the model's parameters. In the basis functions method, we employ random basis functions to predict the frequency. The algorithms are easy to implement online, having both high precision and a short response time. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed techniques are able to achieve good performance in frequency prediction.

Abstract: In this paper, a joint scheduling scheme for the electric supply and demand of Home Energy Management System (HEMS) and Building Energy Management System (BEMS) via energy management in houses and buildings is presented. To reflect ongoing policy, the Korea Electric Power COoperation (KEPCO) tariff is employed to formulate the optimization problem in terms of the sequential management procedure of prediction, supply control and demand control. As a result, an optimal electric supply pattern to produce the minimum energy cost can be obtained under a given curtailment. From simulation, the proposed scheduling scheme demonstrates greater reliability and adaptation for the interruptible load (IL) than the day-ahead method.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimization approach for the placement of geomagnetically induced current (GIC) blocking devices (BDs) on power system transformers to mitigate the adverse effects of a geomagnetic disturbance (GMD). Solar storms lead to GMDs which, in turn, drive GICs along transmission lines and through transformer windings. GICs cause half-cycle saturation in power transformers, increase their shunt reactive power loss, lead to a significant lack of power system reactive power support, and, as a result, create voltage instability and, potentially, large-scale voltage collapse. To mitigate these detrimental effects, a long-term remedy is to install GIC BDs at the neutral point of transformers. Since these devices are fairly costly, their placement should be performed in an optimal manner. The optimization problem proposed in this paper minimizes the cost of BD placement while satisfying power system voltage and generator maximum reactive power limits. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in maintaining an acceptable voltage profile for the power system in case of GMDs with any degree of severity.

DER units are divided into voltage-controlled and power-controlled DER units. The frequency of each DER unit is determined by its independent internal oscillator and all oscillators are synchronized by a common time-reference signal based on a global positioning system (GPS). The power management system (PMS) specifies the power and voltage set points for the local controllers of each DER unit. A linear, time-invariant, multivariable, robust, decentralized control system is designed to track the setpoints. Each control agent guarantees fast tracking, zero steady state error, and robust performance despite uncertainties of the microgrid parameters, topology, and the operating point. Existence conditions, control design procedures, eigenanalysis and robust stability analysis of the closed-loop system, and performance of the control strategy based on digital time-domain simulation studies in PSCAD/EMTDC platform, are reported. Performance of the control system is also verified based on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) studies in the RTDS environment.

Abstract: Common power system disturbances are characterized by oscillations that either damp out, sustain or grow. This oscillatory response can be measured and analyzed to extract modal information of the system. In this paper we apply a nonlinear least-squares optimization method known as the variable projection method to power system models and data. The variable projection method is compared against several linear methods such as Prony analysis, Matrix-Pencil and ERA, and the results suggest the nonlinear least-squares approach is superior.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical demand response (DR) bidding framework in the day-ahead energy markets which integrates customer DR preferences and characteristics in the ISO's market clearing process. In the proposed framework, load aggregators submit aggregated DR offers to the ISO which would centrally optimize final decisions on aggregators' DR contributions in wholesale markets. The hourly load reduction strategies include load shifting and curtailment and the use of onsite generation and energy storage systems. The ISO applies mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to the solution of the proposed DR model in the day-ahead market clearing problem. The proposed model is implemented using a 6-bus system and the IEEE-RTS, and several studies are conducted to demonstrate the merits of the proposed DR model.

Abstract: This paper discusses the transmission planning problem in a transmission network with multiple transmission planners. Each transmission planner is responsible for a region of the transmission network and maximizes its own region social welfare taking into account the transmission planning decisions of other transmission planners. The mathematical formulation of non-cooperative transmission planning problem is proposed. This problem is modeled using the multiple-leaders single-follower game in applied mathematics. The solution concept of the worst-Nash equilibrium is introduced to solve the set-up game. Different mathematical techniques are employed to formulate the worst-Nash equilibrium solution as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. A discussion on two possible applications of the derived mathematical structure is provided. The computational complexity is also discussed. The Three-Region IEEE-RTS96 example system is employed and modified to suit the purpose of analysis. The cooperative solution where the transmission planners merge into one single transmission planner is assumed as the benchmark in this study. The cooperative transmission planning is formulated in Appendix A of the paper. The results demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution in multi-regional transmission planning.

Abstract: A constant or voltage-dependent load model is usually assumed in most distributed generation (DG) planning studies. However, this paper proposes several different types of time-varying voltage-dependent load models to determine the penetration level of photovoltaic (PV) units in a distribution network. Here, a new analytical expression is first proposed to size a PV unit, which can supply active and reactive powers. This expression is based on the derivation of a multiobjective index (IMO) that is formulated as a combination of three indices, namely active power loss, reactive power loss and voltage deviation. The expression is then adapted to allocate PV units while considering the time-varying load models and probabilistic PV generation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated on 69- and 33-bus test distribution systems. The results showed that PV allocation with different types of time-varying load models can produce dissimilar penetration levels.

Abstract: This paper studies the multi-area voltage and reactive power management regarding the voltage stability. In this respect, the maximization of effective reactive power reserve is proposed using centralized and decentralized implementations. The proposed formulations benefit from the detailed modeling of generators reactive power limits as well as the distributed slack bus model for the compensation of active power imbalances. In addition, the generator switch between the constant terminal voltage and the constant reactive power output is modeled by the complementarity constraints. The simulation results demonstrate that the well-known decentralized implementation does not converge whenever there are PV generators at border buses. It is illustrated that this problem occurs when the complementarity constraints are considered. Appropriate modifications are proposed for the formulation of the decentralized optimization in order to consider the effect of the complementarity constraints at border buses. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation to handle such optimization problems is evaluated using the New England 39-bus system with three areas.

Abstract: Uncertainty in consumption is a key challenge at energy utility companies, which are faced with balancing highly stochastic demand with increasingly volatile supply characterized by significant penetration rates of intermittent renewable sources. This paper proposes a methodology to quantify uncertainty in consumption that highlights the dependence of the cost-of-service with volatility in demand. We use a large and rich dataset of consumption time series to provide evidence that there is a substantial degree of high-level structure in the statistics of consumption across users which may be partially explained by certain characteristics of the users. To uncover this structure, we propose a new technique for extracting typical statistical signatures of consumption-energy demand distributions (EDDs)-that is based on clustering distributions using a fast, approximated algorithm. We next study the factors influencing the choice of consumption signature and identify certain types of appliances and behaviors related to appliance operation that are most predictive. Finally, we comment on how structure in consumption statistics may be used to target residential energy efficiency programs to achieve greatest impact in curtailing cost of service.

Abstract: Customers of different contract types have different shapes in daily load profiles in the manner of different characteristics. Therefore, maximally capture local and global shape variability is essential in load profiling which exhibits the customers' different behaviors and characteristics. Existing approaches are focusing on the global property by considering all dimensions in the data set. However, the load shapes are determined by subspace of dimensions in most of the time. In this paper, we use subspace projection methods (subspace clustering and projected clustering) to capture such subspaces of load diagrams which maximize the difference between particular load shapes in different groups of customers. Also, we have treated clustering as classification to select most appropriate cluster numbers. The contribution of our study is that we have interpreted the strength and weakness of subspace projection method in load profiling. The result shows that subspace projection based method outperforms traditional clustering algorithms.

Abstract: Repeated simulations have been most widely applied in analyzing the sensitivities of the power system dynamics with respect to controller inputs. This approach is computationally intensive and it does not explicitly show the physical insights. A transfer function matrix based approach is proposed in this letter for control input sensitivity analysis. A bottom up method is also presented to build the respective transfer function matrix. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a procedure for estimating the optimum allocation of distributed generation (DG) units in large distribution systems by using a multicore computing environment. The main goal of this work is to explore the application of a refined parallel Monte Carlo method for energy loss minimization in three-phase distribution systems when considering the intermittent nature of some distributed resources and the time varying shape of the loads. The procedure has been implemented in an open environment in which OpenDSS is driven from MATLAB. Some examples illustrate the scope of the proposed procedure.

Abstract: This paper seeks to improve the computational time needed to solve transmission switching problems. Transmission switching provides an effective way to reduce operating costs in power system operations by altering the topology of the transmission network. However, determining the optimal set of lines to switch creates an enormous computational burden. Transmission switching formulations add binary decision variables for many transmission lines in the system to indicate if they are switched. This creates a very weak formulation that is difficult to solve. Altering the transmission topology by switching lines can affect the reliability of the network, for instance, by creating islands. Additional reliability constraints need to be added to the problem formulation. These constraints can potentially make an already difficult problem even harder. This paper takes a different approach to the transmission switching problem. Rather than preventing islanding by using constraints in the problem formulation, we look at how they can be used to improve the solution process. Specifically, we develop a cutting plane algorithm to generate valid inequalities and fix variables based on the fact that optimal solutions to the transmission switching problem that do not contain islands exist.

Abstract: This paper explores a technique denoted LASCA to solve large scale optimization problems with metaheuristics by reducing the search space dimension with autoassociative neural networks. The technique applies autoencoders as a reversible mapping between the original problem space and a reduced space. A metaheuristic then evolves in the latter, having its objective function assessed in the original space. The technique is illustrated with an application of an Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) algorithm to four benchmarking unconstrained optimization functions and to a wind-hydro constrained coordination problem. The new technique allows an improvement in the quality of the solutions attained.

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) problem determines power generations/demands that minimize a certain objective such as generation cost or power loss. It is non-convex and NP-hard in general. In this paper, we study the OPF problem in direct current (DC) networks. A second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation is considered for solving the OPF problem. We prove that the SOCP relaxation is exact if either 1) voltage upper bounds do not bind; or 2) voltage upper bounds are uniform and power injection lower bounds are negative. Based on 1), a modified OPF problem is proposed, whose corresponding SOCP is guaranteed to be exact. We also prove that SOCP has at most one optimal solution if it is exact. Finally, we discuss how to improve numerical stability and how to include line constraints.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the dc line fault transient stability characteristics of AC/DC power systems with three different modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current (MMC-HVDC) configurations. The first configuration is half bridge sub-module based MMC (H-MMC) HVDC configuration, which clears dc line faults by tripping the ac circuit breakers. The clamp double sub-module (CDSM) basedMMC (C-MMC) HVDC configuration with dc line fault clearance ability constitutes the second configuration. A line-commutated converter (LCC) and MMC hybrid HVDC configuration with dc line fault clearance ability, named LCC-diode-MMC (LCC-D-MMC), is the third configuration. The detailed processes of clearing dc line faults in three MMC-HVDC configurations are analyzed. The equal area criterion is utilized to analyze the dc line fault transient processes. Besides, to evaluate the power system transient stability characteristics in three MMC-HVDC configurations, an index, called critical ac transmitted power (Pac-critical), is proposed. Under the same dc line to ground fault, transient stability characteristics of three test systems based on the three different MMC-HVDC configurations are compared. Excellent performance of the LCC-D-MMC HVDC configuration under the dc line fault is demonstrated through comparison of Pac-critical in the three test systems. Finally, the study is extended to a modified New England 39-bus system, and the simulation results also correspond with the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Distribution system restoration (DSR) is aimed at restoring loads after a fault by altering the topological structure of the distribution network while meeting electrical and operational constraints. The emerging microgrids embedded in distribution systems enhance the self-healing capability and allow distribution systems to recover faster in the event of an outage. This paper presents a graph-theoretic DSR strategy incorporating microgrids that maximizes the restored load and minimizes the number of switching operations. Spanning tree search algorithms are applied to find the candidate restoration strategies by modeling microgrids as virtual feeders and representing the distribution system as a spanning tree. Unbalanced three-phase power flow is performed to ensure that the proposed system topology satisfies all operational constraints. Simulation results based on a modified IEEE 37-node system and a 1069-node distribution system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper defines flow control algorithms for loop flow cancellation based on the allocation and tracing of bilateral transactions and loop flows. In Part I of this paper, we have shown that the main difference between transportation and electrical networks is caused by the existence of loop flows. We have introduced a distributed framework for the modeling and tracing of bilateral transactions and the corresponding loop flows. Its zooming-out capability provides a valuable mechanism for representing external (inter-area) loop flows based on simplified topologies of individual areas. The tracing information accurately allocates bilateral transactions with associated contract paths to line flows and loop flows. Furthermore, this information can be used for determining the set points of control equipment so that loop flows are minimized. In this framework, phase angle regulators (PARs), commonly used for line flow control, are represented through their effects on loop flows. We define sufficient conditions for achieving complete loop flow cancellation. A new distributed algorithm for determining PAR set points in a coordinated way without revealing operating conditions of individual areas is introduced in this part. Finally, complete loop flow cancellation and the distributed algorithm for finding PAR set points are demonstrated in the Reliability Test System (RTS) 96-bus system with wheeling loop flows.

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal charging strategy for a plug-in electric taxi (PET) to maximize its operating profit by choosing proper charging slots, subject to uncertain electricity prices and time-varying incomes. As PET consumes more electricity and possesses different charging behaviors from the widely studied private electric vehicles, this problem deserves special treatment. First, in order to tackle the uncertain electricity prices, a simple thresholding method is proposed to determine the optimal charging slot, where the thresholds are computed via a backward induction algorithm. Then, the properties that reveal the insights of the algorithm are presented. Then, several practical factors are included in algorithm design to approach a more realistic solution, such as an accurate battery model, the additional power consumption of driving PET to charging station, and the battery loss during charging and discharging processes. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is able to improve the profit and significantly reduce the expense.

Abstract: This paper presents a new reliability-based incremental phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement method via an enumeration-based integer linear programming optimization approach. By evaluating the proposed reliability indices for node and system observability, incremental PMUs are sequentially placed on the locations where the reliability of entire system's observability can be best improved at each step. As a result, a pre-set desired reliability of the system's observability can be achieved while using the minimal number of PMUs. The proposed method is generic and flexible in a way that different kinds of failures that impact the reliability of system observability can be easily included in the method. The 1st-order and 2nd-order failures of PMUs and lines are considered in this paper. The proposed method is validated using a 4-node system, the IEEE 14-node system and the IEEE RTS 96 test system. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient in enhancing the reliability of observability for any system regardless of what the initial PMU placement of the system may be.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel perturbation observerbased multiloop control method for the integrated control of the doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbine (DFIG-WT) in a multimachine power system. The DFIG-WT is decoupled into four independent subsystems in accordance with four outputs. A perturbation state is introduced into each subsystem, and the optimal output feedback control of each subsystem is achieved with the estimate of perturbation obtained by a sliding-mode perturbation observer. Thus a four-loop perturbation observer-based control (POC) scheme is adopted to achieve the integrated control of the DFIG-WT. The design of the four-loop POC does not require any accurate system model, and it is robust to external disturbances and parameter variations. Meanwhile, the four-loop POC presents a fast tracking rate and shows the capability of damping the oscillations of output variables. Moreover, interactions between two DFIG-WT-based wind farms and their influence to the stability of power system are also investigated. Simulation studies reveal that superior integrated control of DFIG-WT can be achieved by the four-loop POC under various conditions compared with the conventional vector control scheme.

Abstract: A novel method for estimating parameters of a dynamic system model is presented using estimates of dynamic system modes (frequency and damping) obtained from wide area measurement systems (WAMS). The parameter estimation scheme is based on weighted least squares (WLS) method that utilizes sensitivities of the measured modal frequencies and damping to the parameters. The paper concentrates on estimating the values of generator inertias but the proposed methodology is general and can be used to identify other generator parameters such as damping coefficients. The methodology has been tested using a wide range of accuracy in the measured modes of oscillations. The results suggest that the methodology is capable of estimating accurately inertias and replicating the dynamic behavior of the power system. It has been shown that the damping measurements do not influence estimation of generator inertia. The method has overcome the problem of observability, when there were fewer measurements than the parameters to be estimated, by including the assumed values of parameters as pseudo-measurements.

Abstract: Supplementary excitation damping controller (SEDC) has been widely acknowledged as one of the effective measures to stabilize subsynchronous resonance (SSR). However, how to quantify its stabilizing ability is still an open issue raising widespread concerns. There are few in-depth studies or conclusions in this aspect yet. This paper presents a quantitative measure of SEDC's ability to damp SSR, namely stabilizing ability index (SAI). It is defined as the percentage margin of the effective gain relative to the critical stability gain (CSG). The CSG is the minimum gain of SEDC to guarantee SSR stability, while the effective gain is the control gain of SEDC actually functioning following system disturbances. A practical system is used to investigate the various factors determining the effective gain, the CSG and thus the SAI, based on eigenvalue analysis as well as time-domain simulation. The dominant factors identified include: the total equivalent series-compensation degree of system, the parameters and operating status of the generator, the response time and ceiling voltage of the exciter, and the severity of the disturbance. Why and how these factors affect the control capability of SEDC is examined and thus a practical method is offered for the assessment of SEDC's ability to stabilize SSR.

Abstract: Wind energy is present in many countries throughout the world. The main types of wind sales in electricity markets are via regulated tariffs or pool-based markets. Production companies choose cost-effective options for selling wind energy, and some markets, like the Irish electricity market, use regulated tariffs to remunerate wind production. This paper aims to provide some answers to explain what effect wind offers may have in an electricity market if wind power producers participated in the day-ahead market without receiving any premium or aid. A price-maker optimization model is used to detect its effect on prices. The model encompasses energy offers by other technologies using residual demand curves and detailed modeling of wind imbalances. It is observed that wind acting as price-maker reduces electricity prices and the imbalance penalties help the system operator to reduce imbalances. A realistic case study using data from the Irish electricity market illustrates the methodology used comparing the effect of imbalance penalties in the models in terms of profit and total imbalance of the system.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the significant growth in electricity consumption. The emerging smart grid aims to address the ever-increasing load through appropriate scheduling, i.e., to shift the energy demand from peak to off-peak periods by pricing tariffs as incentives. Under the real-time pricing environment, due to the uncertainty of future prices, load scheduling is formulated as an optimization problem with expectation and temporally-coupled constraints. Instead of resorting to stochastic dynamic programming that is generally prohibitive to be explicitly solved, we propose dual decomposition and stochastic gradient to solve the problem. That is, the primal problem is firstly dually decomposed into a series of separable subproblems, and then the price uncertainty in each subproblem is addressed by stochastic gradient based on the statistical knowledge of future prices. In addition, we propose an online approach to further alleviate the impact of price prediction error. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Adynamic positioning (DP) systemon a diesel-electric ship applies electric power to keep the positioning and heading of the ship subject to dynamic disturbances due to the winds, waves and other external forces using electric thrusters. Vice versa, position and heading errors can be allowed in order to implement energy storage in the kinetic and potential energy of the ship motion using the DP control system to convert between mechanical and electrical power. New simple formulas are derived in order to relate the dynamic energy storage capacity to the maximum allowed ship position deviation, as a function of the frequency of the requested dynamic energy storage. The benefits of DP dynamic energy storage are found to be reduced diesel-generator-maintenance need, reduced fuel consumption and emissions, reduced risk for blackout, and increased operational flexibility allowing power-consuming operations such as drilling and lifting to be safely prioritized over DP for short periods of time.

Abstract: This paper studies the fundamental dimensionality of synchrophasor data, and proposes an online application for early event detection using the reduced dimensionality. First, the dimensionality of the phasor measurement unit (PMU) data under both normal and abnormal conditions is analyzed. This suggests an extremely low underlying dimensionality despite the large number of the raw measurements. An early event detection algorithm based on the change of core subspaces of the PMU data at the occurrence of an event is proposed. Theoretical justification for the algorithm is provided using linear dynamical systemtheory. Numerical simulations using both synthetic and realistic PMU data are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed frequency regulation framework for prosumer-based electric energy systems, where a prosumer (producer-consumer) is defined as an intelligent agentwhich can produce, consume, and/or store electricity. Despite the frequency regulators being distributed, stability can be ensured while avoiding inter-area oscillations using a limited control effort. To achieve this, a fully distributed one-step model-predictive control protocol is proposed and analyzed, whereby each prosumer communicates solely with its neighbors in the network. The efficacy of the proposed frequency regulation framework is shown through simulations on two real-world electric energy systems of different scale and complexity. We show that prosumers can indeed bring frequency and power deviations to their desired values after small perturbations.

Abstract: Synchronous island power systems, such as the combined Ireland and Northern Ireland power system, are facing increasing penetrations of renewable generation. As part of a wider suite of studies, performed in conjunction with the transmission system operators (TSOs) of the All-Island system (AIS), the frequency stability challenges at high and ultra-high wind penetrations were examined. The impact of both largest infeed loss and network fault induced wind turbine active power dips was examined: the latter contingency potentially representing a fundamental change in frequency stability risk. A system non-synchronous penetration (SNSP) ratio was defined to help identify system operational limits. A wide range of system conditions were studied, with results showing that measures such as altering ROCOF protection and enabling emulated inertia measures were most effective in reducing the frequency stability risk of a future Ireland system.

Abstract: This paper considers a trajectory-based approach to determine control signals superimposed to those of existing controllers so as to enhance the damping of electromechanical oscillations. This approach is framed as a discrete-time, multi-step optimization problem which can be solved by model-based and/or by learning-based methods. This paper proposes to apply a model-free tree-based batch mode reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to perform such a supplementary damping control based only on information collected from observed trajectories of the power system. This RL-based supplementary damping control scheme is first implemented on a single generator and then several possibilities are investigated for extending it to multiple generators. Simulations are carried out on a 16-generator medium-size power system model, where also possible benefits of combining this RL-based control with model predictive control (MPC) are assessed.

The combination allows different PSS tuning strategies to be evaluated as objective functions of optimization under constraints. Feasibility of the method is demonstrated by numerical results from a 69-generator system. Two objective functions are used as illustrative examples. Index Terms-Damping, eigenvalue, eigenvalue

Abstract: Employment of multi-agent system (MAS) principle in power systems can provide a discipline for interrelations between the host computers in different substations in order to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of remedial actions and consequently power system operation against disturbance occurrence. In this paper, two types of these disciplines, each of which constructs an organization for agents, are explained and their performances in voltage control of a power system (in the context of steady state regime) are examined and compared on Nordic32 as test power system. These MASs may be implemented as the main structure of a wide area monitoring, protection and control (WAMPAC) system.

Abstract: This paper concerns a novel approach to the modeling and control design for transient stabilization of electric power systems using Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices. A nonlinear dynamic model of general interconnected electric power systems in the ordinary differential equation (ODE) form is proposed in terms of time-varying phasors of all dynamic components. This model captures previously unmodeled fast dynamics of inductors and capacitors of FACTS. Additionally, it allows us to observe the active power which is flowing through FACTS during transients. Using the derived model, an ectropy-based FACTS controller is proposed. The proposed controller regulates the active power through FACTS in order to shift the increment in energy created by disturbances. The energy increment is directed from generators into FACTS, preserving the synchronization between generators during disturbances. Simulation results obtained on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the potential of this controller. The controller is shown to increase critical clearing time of the system in the case of a fault.

Abstract: Several studies have recently reported the capability of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind farms in improving the dynamic performance of power systems. Since wind farms are more often located far from the system conventional generation centers, local signals do not comprise enough content for damping inter-area oscillations. This paper presents a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based wide-area damping controller (WADC) for the DFIG wind farms. The proposed controller is designed with a centralized nature on the basis of latest technological development of wide-area measurement system (WAMS). Damping both inter-area and local oscillatory modes are intended in the design process. The most challenging deficiency against WAMS real-time applications is the variable communication latency which can deteriorate the system stability if not properly accounted for in the controller design process. The proposed WADC hence incorporates effective means to compensate for the destructive characteristics of WAMS delayed signals. The PSO technique is applied to normalize and optimize the parameters of WADC. A set of comprehensive case studies are conducted on a 16-bus six-machine test system and the obtained numerical evidences are thoroughly discussed.

Abstract: This paper proposes an expected value and chance constrained stochastic optimization approach for the unit commitment problem with uncertain wind power output. In the model, the utilization of wind power can be adjusted by changing the utilization rate in the proposed expected value constraint. Meanwhile, the chance constraint is used to restrict the probability of load imbalance. Then a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method is used to transform the objective function, the expected value constraint, and the chance constraint into sample average reformulations. Furthermore, a combined SAA framework that considers both the expected value and the chance constraints is proposed to construct statistical upper and lower bounds for the optimization problem. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm with different utilization rates and different risk levels is tested for a six-bus system. A revised IEEE 118-bus system is also studied to show the scalability of the proposed model and algorithm.

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of variable renewable generations, independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission organizations (RTOs) are faced with new challenges for the secure and economic operation of power systems. This paper proposes an effective approach for deriving robust solutions to the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem, which considers load and wind uncertainties via interval numbers. Different from most robust optimization-based SCUC approaches in literature which explore robust unit commitment (UC) solutions for immunizing against the worst economic scenario in terms of the highest minimum dispatch cost, the proposed robust SCUC model minimizes operation cost for the base case while guaranteeing that the robust UC and dispatch solutions could be adaptively and securely adjusted in response to uncertain intervals. Thus, the proposed model achieves smaller unit commitment costs while maintaining the solution robustness as compared with literature. In addition, the proposed model describes base case dispatches and corrective actions in uncertain intervals, which is more consistent with the current day-ahead and real-time markets. Furthermore, besides budget constraints used in literature, this paper also considers load and wind variability correlations in constructing uncertain intervals, which would eliminate unlike-to-happen scenarios and further limit the level of conservatism of the robust solution. The proposed robust SCUC model is solved by Benders decomposition, which decomposes the original problem into a master UC problem for the base case and subproblems for the base case network evaluation and the security checking for uncertain intervals. Feasibility cuts are generated and fed back to the master problem for further iterations when violations are identified in subproblems. Numerical case studies on the modified IEEE 118-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust SCUC model for the secure and economic operation of power systems under various uncertainties.

Abstract: Due to the long planning horizon, transmission expansion planning is typically subjected to a lot of uncertainties including load growth, renewable energy penetration, policy changes, etc. In addition, deregulation of the power industry and pressure from climate change introduced new sources of uncertainties on the generation side of the system. Generation expansion and retirement become highly uncertain as well. Some of the uncertainties do not have probability distributions, making it difficult to use stochastic programming. Techniques like robust optimization that do not require a probability distribution became desirable. To address these challenges, we study two optimization criteria for the transmission expansion planning problem under the robust optimization paradigm, where the maximum cost and maximum regret of the expansion plan over all uncertainties are minimized, respectively. With these models, our objective is to make planning decisions that are robust against all scenarios. We use a two-layer algorithm to solve the resulting tri-level optimization problems. Then, in our case studies, we compare the performance of the minimax cost approach and the minimax regret approach under different characterizations of uncertainties.

Abstract: The potential of plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles (PHEVs) to participate in power system control, via the vehicle-to-grid program, is increasing rapidly. In several recent studies, PHEVs are employed to participate in system frequency regulation; however, no attention has been paid to the impact of single-phase connection of these distributed energy sources. This paper addressed the use of PHEVs to stabilize the frequency in microgrids and/or weak grids which lack enough inertia considering the single-phase nature and communication delays. Small-signal analysis is used to evaluate the performance of both droop and virtual inertia control methods, and show how time delay of a centralized control could impact system stability. Advantages and disadvantages of distributed control are studied, and a new method based on a combination of both centralized and distributed control is proposed to mitigate the impact of asymmetrical virtual inertia while it allows the utilization of all available PHEVs for active power however asymmetric they are. Time-domain simulations are used to verify the analytical studies.

Abstract: Short-term voltage stability is an increasing concern in today's power systems due to the growing penetration of induction motors. This paper proposes a systematic method for optimal placement of dynamic VAR support against short-term voltage instability. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model minimizing two conflicting objectives: 1) the total investment cost and 2) the expected unacceptable short-term voltage performance subject to a set of probable contingencies. STATCOM is employed for its stronger dynamic VAR support capability. Indices for quantifying the short-term voltage stability and the related risk level are proposed for problem modeling. Candidate buses are selected based on the concept of trajectory sensitivity. Load dynamics are fully considered using a composite load model containing induction motor and other typical components. A relatively new and superior multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called MOEA/D is introduced and employed to find the Pareto optimal solutions of the model. The proposed method is verified on the New England 39-bus system using industry-grade models and simulation tool.

Abstract: This paper discusses the power systems stability margin improvement by means of preventive control based on generation re-dispatch using a neural sensitivity model. This model uses multilayer perceptron networks with memory structure in the input layer. The training of this model is made with temporal data samples from time domain simulations, incorporating information about the dynamic behavior of the system, unlike the methods proposed in the literature in which the pre-fault system data are used instead. The sensitivity is used as a guideline in selecting the most effective set of generators in the reallocation of the amount of active power capable of increasing system security. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been demonstrated through the application to a large system.

Abstract: Short-term voltage stability is one of the issues of concern for power system operations. As dispersed power generation is connected tomiddle- and low-voltage transmission networks, the development of analytical methods will become more important. This paper describes a stability boundary line in the P-V plane of the load bus for the analysis of short-term voltage stability. By comparing the operating point of the load with the boundary line, we can visually determine the acceleration or deceleration state of the induction motor, thereby clearly explaining the short-term voltage instability phenomena. In addition, the idea of the stability boundary is applied to voltage stability assessment and emergency controls such as reactive power compensation. Numerical simulations are carried out for a single-load infinite-bus system to explain the basic theory of the proposed method and to provide examples of its application.

Abstract: A modal 2-channel power system stabilizer structure is proposed for multigenerator power plants having units with similar parameters and loading. One channel is designed to damp only the aggregate generator electromechanical mode while the other is designed to damp only the intraplant modes. Simplified analytical models helped to mathematically demonstrate that the dynamics of the two channels of the proposed stabilizer are decoupled by the feedback of specific linear combinations of rotor speeds to each one of the channels. Linear and nonlinear simulation results for a detailed model of a multigenerator plant show the potential gains in using the proposed 2-channel PSS to solve challenging oscillation damping control problems.

The main reason for oscillations is changes in the dynamics of PV units with varying solar irradiance and the decentralized tuning of control parameters for the nominal operating condition. Eigenvalue analysis, nonlinear interaction index, and time-domain simulations are used to assess the degree and impacts of dynamic interactions. Secondly, a decentralized robust control design is proposed to ensure a non-interacting and well-damped response under varying operating conditions for physically close PV units. The control design process uses an estimate of changes in the model due to variations in solar irradiations, changing electric loads, and the dynamics of the physically close PV units. A minimally conservative method is used to capture the estimate as a norm-bounded uncertainty. Time-domain simulations on a test distribution system verify the predictions of the interaction analysis and demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust controller under different system contingencies.

Abstract: This paper presents details of the practical implementation of a coordinated reactive power-voltage controller (CQVC) developed for amulti-machine steam power plant. The CQVC performs optimal coordination of the synchronous generators' reactive power outputs in order to maintain the total reactive power delivered by a steam power plant (SPP) or the voltage at a steam power plant HV busbar. This is required to achieve slow preventive control of generated reactive powers in order to maximize reactive power reserves along with slow high side voltage control. The CQVC is designed to act through existing automatic voltage regulator inputs, thus no modification of an existing excitation system was made. In order to increase the robustness to changes in operating conditions and to achieve the desired shape of the reactive power response, the two-step predictor corrector method is implemented. A newly developed algorithm for steady state detection ensures non-interference of reactive power voltage control with excitation system response. The paper also presents practical design solutions to overcome limitations posed by application to a real system. Acceptance and functional tests carried out during the commissioning of the CQVC are also discussed in this paper.

Abstract: An independent generation company (GenCo) secures its future trading position by managing its portfolio among multiple trading options. Future returns of these trading options are not known during decision making and are traditionally estimated using probabilistic or fuzzy methods. Quantifying such uncertainty of market returns by conventional methods does not reflect the information gap existing between estimated and actual market returns. Based on quantification of this information gap, the paper proposes GenCo's portfolio optimization using a non-probabilistic Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT). This framework comprehensively models GenCo's behavior in deciding its trading strategy. Considering GenCo's risk-averse behavior, the framework provides decisions that are robust towards losses, while considering its risk-seeking behavior the framework offers opportunity to capture windfall gains. The proposed approach has been validated through practical case study of PJM market.

Abstract: The utilization of all the available data sources is a permanent objective of state estimation (SE). In this sense, forecasting-aided state estimation (FASE) is an important alternative to conventional state estimation, especially regarding its expeditious data validation scheme, which comprises bad data (BD) smearing effect elimination, block identification, and adequate replacement. Also, with the availability of synchrophasor measurements, there has been a growing interest in building a phasor-aided state estimation (PHASE) process. This paper presents a novel way of processing BD, whose features are similar to those found in the data validation routines of FASE. The proposed PHASE approach has the advantage of leaving the existing SE application software intact, complementing it with an extra estimation module, capable of processing phasor measurements separately and judging whether the measurement set contains anomalies. The results of a proof of concept study performed on the IEEE 14-bus benchmark system demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. Also, PMU-observability issues are addressed and illustrated through simulation studies conducted on the IEEE 118-bus system.

Abstract: Energy storage resources(ESRs) are being used for secondary frequency regulation in the bulk electric power grid. In order to optimize the economic scheduling of an ESR using look-ahead model predictive control, predictive models of the automatic generation control (AGC) signal and its effect on an ESR's state of charge are needed. In this letter, we suggest a straightforward and effective procedure for forecasting the next state of charge for an ESR that provides regulation service in a liberalized market setting.

Abstract: This paper develops a new electricity market clearing mechanism, called risk-based locational marginal pricing (RLMP). The RLMP is derived from the risk-based security-constrained economic dispatch model, where risk is modeled to capture the system's overall security level. Compared to the traditional locational marginal pricing (LMP) which is composed of three components: energy, congestion, and loss, the RLMP consists of an additional risk component. The risk component is a price signal to reflect the system's overall security level. This paper discusses the features of RLMP, and analyzes its benefits over traditional LMPs. The proposed concept and method are illustrated on a six-bus system and the WECC 240-bus system.

Abstract: With significant investment made in the U. S. in deploying synchrophasor measurement technology, more wide-area measurements will be available and controls based on these signals are likely to be adopted. Communication systems play a critical role in interactive grid control as an indispensable medium to transmit wide-area measurements; however, they are vulnerable to disruptions leading to the risk of destabilizing power systems. This work addresses a critical issue related to engineering resilient cyber-physical systems. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical set of wide-area measurements for control and employs channel switching based on mathematical morphology identification to counteract the impact of communication failures on control effectiveness. The proposed control framework incorporating a set of synchronized wide-area measurements is designed to consist of multiple single-input single-output supplementary damping controllers associated with a static VAr compensator. This work is particularly important with regard to leveraging the large investment in installing phasor measurement units across the nation.

Abstract: Real-Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) is a smart-grid technology that allows electrical conductors to operate at an enhanced rating based on local weather conditions. RTTR also provides thermal visibility of the network, making system operators aware if the actual rating drops below the static seasonal rating. This paper investigates how using these enhanced variable ratings affects power network reliability. A methodology has been developed to assess network reliability with variable conductor ratings. The effect of failures and uncertainties in the RTTR system are also considered, and the effect of the correlation between conductor ratings due to common weather conditions is built into the model. State sampling and sequential Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the reliability of the RBTS 6-bus test network. At low loading levels, the RTTR appears to reduce network reliability but actually illustrates occasions when the existing ratings are being unknowingly infringed. For higher loading, the network reliability is significantly improved by the use of RTTR, with reductions in loss of load expectation of up to 67%.

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing (or augmenting) an electric power system at a minimum cost such that it satisfies the N - k-epsilon survivability criterion. This survivability criterion is a generalization of the well-known N - k criterion, and it requires that at least (1 - epsilon(j)) fraction of the steady-state demand be met after failures of j components, for j = 0, 1,..., k. The network design problem adds another level of complexity to the notoriously hard contingency analysis problem, since the contingency analysis is only one of the requirements for the design optimization problem. We present a mixed-integer programming formulation of this problem that takes into account both transmission and generation expansion. We propose an algorithm that can avoid combinatorial explosion in the number of contingencies, by seeking vulnerabilities in intermediary solutions and constraining the design space accordingly. Our approach is built on our ability to identify such system vulnerabilities quickly. Our empirical studies on modified instances of the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems show the effectiveness of our methods. We were able to solve the transmission and generation expansion problems for k = 4 in approximately 30 min, while other approaches failed to provide a solution at the end of 2 h.

Abstract: Stability-constrained optimal power flow (SOPF) is an effective and economic tool to enhance stability performance by adjusting initial steady-state operating conditions, with the consideration of rotor angle and short-term voltage performance criteria. SOPF belongs to the category of dynamic optimization problems which are computationally expensive. In order to reduce its computational complexity, a hybrid dynamic optimization approach is proposed for efficient and robust solving SOPF problems. Based on the direct multiple shooting method, this approach combines the algorithmic advantages from existing direct sequential and simultaneous approaches. Coarse-grained parallelism among multiple shooting intervals is explored. A modular-based implementation architecture is designed to take advantage of the loose coupling between time-domain simulation and optimization. Case studies on various test systems indicate that the proposed approach is able to reduce computation time compared with other direct approaches for dynamic optimization. Also, the investigated parallelizations are effective to achieve acceleration on a symmetric multiprocessing platform.

Abstract: Low-frequency oscillation is one of the main barriers limiting power transmission between two connected power systems. Although power system stabilizers (PSSs) have been proved to be effective in damping inner-area oscillation, inter-area oscillation still remains a critical challenge in today's power systems. Since the low-frequency oscillation between two connected power systems is active power oscillation, power modulation through energy storage devices (ESDs) can be an efficient and effective way to maintain such power system stability. In this paper, we investigate the integration of a new goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) algorithm to adaptively control ESD to damp inter-area oscillation. A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based power oscillation damper (POD) has also been proposed for comparison. Various simulation studies with residue-based POD controller design, the proposed PSO optimized controller design, and the GrHDP-based controller design over a four-machine-two-area benchmark power system with energy storage device have been conducted. Simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the GrHDP-based approach for inter-area oscillation damping in a wide range of system operating conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved interdiction model to identify maximal electric grid attacks. The contribution of the model is that it incorporates both short-term (seconds to minutes) and medium-term (minutes to days) impacts of the possible attack. The medium-term impacts are examined by an interdicted dc optimal power flow model. The short-term impacts are addressed by a cascading outage analysis model that uses a set of sequentially applied checkers to perform the simulation of the cascading outage events and assess the short-term impacts of a blackout subsequent to specified terrorist attacks. An integer programming heuristic is applied that can utilize standard optimization software (e. g. CPLEX) to solve master problems generated by the heuristic. The proposed model has been verified using the IEEE 300-Bus Test System and IEEE RTS 96 Test System. Discussions of the results and future research plans are also presented in this paper.

Abstract: In interconnected power systems, dynamic model reduction can be applied to generators outside the area of interest (i.e., study area) to reduce the computational cost associated with transient stability studies. This paper presents a method of deriving the reduced dynamic model of the external area based on dynamic response measurements. The method consists of three steps, namely dynamic-feature extraction, attribution, and reconstruction (DEAR). In this method, a feature extraction technique, such as singular value decomposition (SVD), is applied to the measured generator dynamics after a disturbance. Characteristic generators are then identified in the feature attribution step for matching the extracted dynamic features with the highest similarity, forming a suboptimal "basis" of system dynamics. In the reconstruction step, generator state variables such as rotor angles and voltage magnitudes are approximated with a linear combination of the characteristic generators, resulting in a quasi-nonlinear reduced model of the original system. The network model is unchanged in the DEAR method. Tests on several IEEE standard systems show that the proposed method yields better reduction ratio and response errors than the traditional coherency based reduction methods.

Abstract: Calculation of the complex torque coefficient for multi-machine system subsynchronous resonance (SSR) assessment had been proven a hard task. In this paper the concept of complex frequency domain port-equivalence conductance matrix (CPCM) is introduced to model the individual system component which represents the relationship between the terminal voltage and current in frequency domain, and the model of the overall power system can be established easily. Thus the complex torque coefficients of the generator unit under investigation can be calculated for SSR assessment. The advantages of this proposed method are that it can take the shaft dynamics and the rotor angle interactions among the generator units into consideration for the multi-machine power system SSR analysis, as well as it can be used to analyze the effectiveness of SSR damping devices. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by both the eigenvalue analysis and the time domain simulation.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing need to consider issues related to multiple uses of water-such as navigation, fishing, or recreation-in the operation planning of electrical power systems, specially in predominantly hydro systems. In short-term models, it is of particular importance to consider maximum/minimum values and ramp limits for the stream level of a river. However, in order to properly represent such constraints, it is also necessary to model in detail the river routing, i.e., the water wave propagation along the channels that connect reservoirs in cascade. This paper proposes a linear programming model to represent river stream-level constraints and river-routing effects in the short-term hydrothermal dispatch problem. Results show the high accuracy of the proposed approach to represent maximum hourly and daily river-level variations as well as the impacts of taking into account a detailed representation of river routing in the operation of hydrothermal systems.

Abstract: Analytic investigations of interarea oscillation damping of an idealized two-machine system using active-power modulation of three-and four-terminal high-voltage dc (HVDC) transmissions are presented. It is shown that, generally, the pairing of two terminals gives the highest damping. Based on the analytical results, recommendations for how the pairing should be made are developed. Simulations, both on a two-machine system and on a more realistic 23-machine system, verify the analytical results.

Abstract: Energy management systems for the operation of distributed energy resources, distribution storage devices, and responsive loads will be embedded in distribution management systems (DMSs) as advanced functions that rely on accurate input data and fast communication signals. For a proper DMS design, the impact of the state estimation uncertainties and of the communication system delays should be evaluated. The paper presents an integrated software package for the cyber-physical simulation of DMS taking into account the accuracy of state estimation and measurements. The effectiveness of a wireless Wi-Max communication system has been tested on the rural Italian representative network produced by the research project ATLANTIDE. Results proved the need of cosimulation packages in modern distribution systems.

Abstract: A new method on static external equivalent network is proposed. The method represents the equivalence of different component types and ensures the consistency of both power flow states and sensitivities of variables in the internal network before and after equivalence. Compared to the existing equivalent methods that only consider the power flow state consistency but ignore component particularity representation and sensitivity consistency, the proposed method is more accurate and effective. The simulation results of the 39-bus system and an actual 661-bus utility system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new model reduction algorithm for power systems based on an extension of balanced truncation. The algorithm is applicable to power systems which are divided into a study area which requires a high-fidelity model and an external area, making up most of the power system, which is to be reduced. The division of the power system can be made arbitrarily and does not rely on the identification of coherent generators. The proposed algorithm yields a reduced order system with a full non-linear description of the study area and a reduced linear model of the external area.

Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic framework for making decisions about the replacement of ageing power equipment. The framework involves three steps: first, to identify the most important and critical components of the system for overall system reliability; secondly, to performPareto analysis to relate the replacement of the components to the effect on system reliability indices; finally, to determine the optimum scenario for replacement based on a comparison between the cost of unreliability due to deferring the replacement and the saving on reinvestment cost. The proposed approach is illustrated on a meshed test system modeled using U.K. transmission system parameters, a representative transformer age profile and regulatory energy not supplied values. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework for application in the area of power system reliability, and show its feasibility for informing replacement decisions.

Abstract: This paper presents a new family of universal control and management strategies for microgrids in smart distribution grids. The paper also provides a general and computationally-efficient framework for modeling and analysis of power management strategies in a microgrid with multiple-distributed generation (DG) units which eases microgrid dynamic studies and controller parameters selection in large microgrids with multiple DG units. Three different approaches for real and reactive power management are proposed. The controllers offer the following advantages: 1) the proposed topologies can be applied to both voltage-controlled (VC) and current controlled (CC) voltage source converters (VSCs). 2) The controllers are universal and realize requirements of both grid-connected and islanded modes, i.e., they share real and reactive power during islanding with constant frequency operation and act as grid supporting VSCs in the grid connected mode. 3) The drooping variables can be either power or current, thus VC-power drooping, VC-current drooping and CC-power drooping are different available variants. 4) The concept of hybrid polar-vector control is developed in this paper. Thus, it can combine the benefits of both types of controllers in one augmented strategy. 5) The controller emulates the behavior of conventional synchronous generators (SGs) which in turn results in better integration of electronically-interfaced DG units into the power system and prevents instabilities due to interaction of fast response DGs and SGs. 6) The controllers realize seamless and robust transition to the islanding mode. The controllers are developed under new concept of synchronous converters. A theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed controllers yield the aforementioned requirements in one compact structure.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to determine the optimal capacity of renewable distributed generation (RDG). The objective in this paper is to maximize cost-savings of energy not supplied (ENS) as well as cost-savings of energy loss according to RDG installation in a distribution network. Additionally, in order to achieve this multi-objective optimization problem, both a restoration matrix and restoration availability are newly proposed. In this case study, a practical Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) system is presented and discussed, demonstrating the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Maintaining a close balance between power generation and demand is essential for sustaining the quality and reliability of a power system. Currently, due to increased renewable energy generation, frequency deviations and power fluctuations of greater concern are being introduced to the grid, particularly in regions that are weakly interconnected with their surrounding areas, such as small islands. This paper addresses the problem of frequency control in isolated power systems with relevant inclusion of wind power generation. With this aim, we have analyzed the contribution of the demand side to the primary frequency control together with an auxiliary frequency control, which is carried out by variable-speed wind turbines through an additional control loop that synthesizes virtual inertia. We have evaluated both the suitability of these two additional control actions counteracting frequency deviation and their potential reserves and compatibility. The results indicate a substantial improvement in both the dynamic performance and grid frequency stability. Simulations also indicate a decrease in the steady-state frequency error, which may relieve the secondary frequency control.

Abstract: With increasing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging, power grids can take advantage of the distinctive features of EV charging load. In response to outages, the charging load can be interrupted with no penalty until additional generation becomes available, as long as charging requirements can be fulfilled, to improve system health. Moreover, EVs can further provide emergency capacities back to the grid [i.e., vehicle-to-grid (V2G)]. In this paper, the basic well-being analysis framework is extended to include the interruptible load and equivalent rapid start units associated with EV charging during system lead time by developing evaluation methods for the capacities of EVs available for charging interruption and V2G. The daily unit commitment is investigated with multiple well-being criteria. The proposed idea is illustrated by application to the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS). Results show that activating EVs' responsiveness not only mitigates the probability of lower reliability due to EV penetration but also further improves the system well-being, especially when V2G is enabled.

Abstract: Dispersed storage systems (DSSs) can represent an important near-term solution for supporting the operation and control of active distribution networks (ADNs). Indeed, they have the capability to support ADNs by providing ancillary services in addition to energy balance capabilities. Within this context, this paper focuses on the optimal allocation of DSSs in ADNs by defining a multi-objective optimization problem aiming at finding the optimal trade-off between technical and economical goals. In particular, the proposed procedure accounts for: 1) network voltage deviations; 2) feeders/lines congestions; 3) network losses; 4) cost of supplying loads (from external grid or local producers) together with the cost of DSS investment/maintenance; 5) load curtailment; and 6) stochasticity of loads and renewables productions. The DSSs are suitably modeled to consider their ability to support the network by both active and reactive powers. A convex formulation of ac optimal power flow problem is used to define a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem to optimally site and size the DSSs in the network. A test case referring to IEEE 34 bus distribution test feeder is used to demonstrate and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed direct load control scheme for large-scale residential demand response (DR) built on a two-layer communication-based control architecture. The lower-layer network is within each building, where the energy management controller (EMC) uses wireless links to schedule operation of appliances upon request according to a local power consumption target. The upper-layer network links a number of EMCs in a region whose aggregated demand is served by a load aggregator. The load aggregator wants the actual aggregated demand over this region to match a desired aggregated demand profile. Our approach utilizes the average consensus algorithm to distribute portions of the desired aggregated demand to each EMC in a decentralized fashion. The allocated portion corresponds to each building's aforementioned local power consumption target which its EMC then uses to schedule the in-building appliances. The result will be an aggregated demand over this region that more closely reaches the desired demand. Numerical results show that our scheme can alleviate the mismatch between the actual aggregated demand and the desired aggregated demand profile.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to optimize equipment investments in multizonal transmission systems, considering spatial properties of the areas of focus. Together with a probabilistic technique for assessing nodal injection capability, the method in the paper completes the methodology of a long term transmission system planning tool. Transmission topology, line route and technology are optimized through iterative application of linear integer programming and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. By optimizing the transmission route, the spatial properties of the area of focus are taken into account, which in turn can significantly influence the installation costs of transmission equipment. The optimization method considers both AC and DC technology and takes the N-1 security criterion into account.

Abstract: This paper studies the feasibility of utilizing the reactive power of grid-connected variable-speed wind generators to enhance the steady-state voltage stability margin of the system. Allowing wind generators to work at maximum reactive power limit may cause the system to operate near the steady-state stability limit, which is undesirable. This necessitates proper coordination of reactive power output of wind generators with other reactive power controllers in the grid. This paper presents a trust region framework for coordinating reactive output of wind generators-with other reactive sources for voltage stability enhancement. Case studies on 418-bus equivalent system of Indian southern grid indicates the effectiveness of proposed methodology in enhancing the steady-state voltage stability margin.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a flexible mixed-integer linear programming formulation of the AC OPF problem for distribution systems, using convexification and linearization techniques. The proposed formulation allows the representation of discrete decisions via integer decision variables, captures the nonlinear behavior of the electrical network via approximations of controllable accuracy, and can be solved to global optimality with commercial optimization solvers. The formulation is based on conventional variables that describe network behavior, which ensures its flexibility and the possibility of application to various distribution system problems, as we indicate with case studies.

Abstract: This paper benchmarks the economic benefits of a smart charging and a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operating strategy of an electric vehicle (EV) against a zero-intelligence charging strategy in a simulation-based analysis. Smart charging optimizes the timing of EV charging, while V2G additionally allows for selling electricity to the energy market. The strategies internalize the wear on energy storage equipment. The simulation builds on over 11 400 empirical driving profiles from a German mobility panel and applies technical specifications of three currently available EVs. This allows for a realistic analysis of the applicability of smart charging and V2G as well as the extent to which EVs are capable to fulfill current driving needs. Results show that smart charging strategies will reduce charging cost on average by more than 32% in all analyzed cases. V2G could provide additional revenue for EV owners with shorter trip patterns while reducing electricity cost for others.

Abstract: The impact of increasing penetration of converter control-based generators (CCBGs) in a large-scale power system is assessed through a model based small signal stability analysis. Three test bed cases for the years 2010, 2020, and 2022 of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in the United States are used for the analysis. Increasing penetration of wind-based Type 3 and wind-based Type 4 and PV Solar CCBGs is used in the tests. The participation and interaction of CCBGs and synchronous generators in traditional electromechanical interarea modes is analyzed. Two new types of modes dominated by CCBGs are identified. The characteristics of these new modes are described and compared to electromechanical modes in the frequency domain. An examination of the mechanism of the interaction between the CCBG control states and the synchronous generator control states is presented and validated through dynamic simulations. Actual system and forecast load data are used throughout.

Abstract: Distributed optimal power flow (OPF) is a challenging non-linear, non-convex problem of central importance to the future power grid. Although many approaches are currently available in the literature, these require some form of central coordination to properly work. In this paper a fully distributed and robust algorithm for OPF is proposed which does not require any form of central coordination. The algorithm is based upon the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) in a form recently proposed by the author, which, in turn, builds upon the work of Schizas et al. The approach is customized as a region-based optimization procedure, and it is tested in meaningful scenarios.

Abstract: Investing in innovative Smart Grids (SGs) technology can reduce overall investments in distribution systems with unpredictable renewable energy sources (RES). Regulators should, therefore, decide what incentives are desirable and design a flexible economic regulatory framework able to encourage distribution system operators (DNOs) to decide for innovation in the SGs. An innovative method that can support the regulators in encouraging RES exploitation by determining the right incentives to favor investments in innovation in an electrical distribution network is proposed in this paper. The method allows stakeholders like regulators, distribution companies and developers evaluating the longterm economic effects of their decisions. The effectiveness of the proposed method, based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and on multi-period optimal power flow (MPOPF), is verified on an 84-bus network.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal power flow (OPF) model with flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices to minimize wind power spillage. The uncertain wind power production is modeled through a set of scenarios. Once the balancing market is cleared, and the final values of active power productions and consumptions are assigned, the proposed model is used by the system operator to determine optimal reactive power outputs of generating units, voltage magnitude and angles of buses, deployed reserves, and optimal setting of FACTS devices. This system operator tool is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model, whose first-stage describes decisions prior to uncertainty realization, and whose second-stage represents the operating conditions involving wind scenarios. Numerical results from a case study based on the IEEE RTS demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tool.

Abstract: Power system stability analysis becomes more important in the presence of ever increasing variations in operating conditions. Traditionally, the operation of power systems is verified for specific operating conditions. In this work, the stability analysis is performed for a set of operating conditions using reachability analysis, which makes it possible to compute the bounds of all possible system trajectories. Thus, reachability analysis can be used to rigorously check specifications. Contrary to previous work, the presented approach does not require model simplifications when the system is described by semi-explicit, nonlinear, index-1 differential-algebraic equations. The main obstacle in reachability analysis is the scalability towards larger systems, which is addressed by investigating compositional techniques. As a result, transient stability and variable energy production can be analyzed for the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark systems, for which the computation times are orders of magnitude faster than the simulation of all cases starting in the corners of the set of possible initial states.

Abstract: In restructured power systems, the transmission and distribution grids are autonomously utilized by independent system operator (ISO) and distribution companies (DISCOs), respectively. As the operating condition of one grid influences the decisions made by operators of other grids, the ISO and DISCOs should collaborate and cooperate with each other in order to operate the entire power system in a secure and economic manner. According to the concept of system of systems (SoS) engineering, this paper presents a decentralized decision-making framework to determine a secure and economical hourly generation schedule for a transmission system encompassing numbers of active distribution grids. Taking into consideration the physical connections and shared information between ISO and DISCOs, an SoS-based SCUC framework is designed and a hierarchical optimization algorithm is presented to find optimal operating points of all independent systems in the SoS-based power system architecture. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed SoS framework and solution methodology.

Abstract: The MW-Mile method is an embedded cost pricing method, which is widely used to determine transmission pricing. The method is formulated based on the distance and active power flow in each line of the transmission network. This method may be considered as the first pricing strategy proposed for recovering the fixed transmission cost, based on the actual use of the transmission network. However, this method suffers from the provision of unfair charges to the users, since it ignores the quality of the load in allocating the transmission cost. This paper proposes an improved MW-Mile method by considering not only the changes in MW flows but also the quality of the load, i.e., the power factor. In this study, the IEEE 14-bus system was used to illustrate the contribution of the proposed method in allocating transmission cost to the user in a fair manner.

Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive solution methodology for the pricing difficulty when Lagrange multipliers are not unique. A linear optimization model is proposed to solve the congestion-related pricing difficulty. The objective function of the model is set to be minimizing the congestion surplus. In addition, an incentive-based allocation approach is incorporated in the solution procedure for cases when no marginal participant exists. The unique pricing solution obtained through our methodology can achieve proper reallocation of the undetermined surplus. Further, we discuss the reference bus independence property of the proposed pricing methodology. Numerical results are provided to fully test the proposed methodology. Other possible solutions are also presented for comparison.

Abstract: Possible congestion management mechanisms for price-responsive electric vehicle demand in electricity distribution networks are investigated. Because a high penetration of renewable energy sources weakens the correlation between wholesale electricity prices and network demand, cost-minimizing electric vehicles may cause high peaks in network load. Managing congestion is not costly in theory but difficult to implement efficiently. Grid tariffs that are fixed ex ante, based on network load, were found to make the problem worse compared to the base-case scenario of flat tariffs. An optimal dynamic grid tariff yields desirable outcomes but is difficult to determine in case of realistic forecasting uncertainties. An iterative approach of a distribution grid capacity market has practical barriers related to IT infrastructure and computational requirements. Advance capacity allocation is more straightforward to implement, but the inter-temporal constraints of the electric vehicles continue to pose a challenge.

Abstract: A bottom-up modeling approach is presented that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to develop demand profiles. The demand profiles are combined with the electrical characteristics of the appliance to create detailed time-varying models of residential loads suitable for the analysis of smart grid applications and low-voltage (LV) demand-side management. The results obtained demonstrate significant temporal variations in the electrical characteristics of LV customers that are not captured by existing load profile or load model development approaches. The software developed within this work is made freely available for use by the community.

Abstract: Many important issues of power system dynamics are often studied by looking at the dynamic responses of generators connected through the power grid, taking their interactions into consideration. In this paper, we present a specific study on the significant impact of grid structure on the power system dynamics with quantitative evidence. Specifically, it is found that the impact of grid structure heavily depends on two types of grid-structure-related variables: 1) electrical distances among the generator internal buses, and 2) electrical distances between the generator internal buses and the faulted bus. Furthermore, with the examples of coherency identification problem, the significance of grid structure is demonstrated by the strong agreement of identification results between using a set of criteria that only takes into account the grid-structure-related variables and dynamic simulations.

Abstract: In order to optimize hydro power plants generator scheduling according to 24-h system demand, a parallel self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm has been applied. The proposed algorithm presents a novel approach to considering the multi-population and utilization of the preselection step for the improvements of the algorithm's global search capabilities. A preselection step with the best, middle, and worst populations' individuals establishes the new trial vectors. This algorithm has been verified on two different models. The first one consists of eight power plants with real parameters, and the second one consists of four power plants, mostly used as a test model in scientific papers. The main goal of the optimization process is to satisfy system demand for 24 h with a decreased usage of water quantity per electrical energy unit. The initial and final states of the reservoirs must also be satisfied.

Abstract: The electricity price volatility brings challenges to bidding strategies in the electricity markets. In this paper, we propose a minimax regret approach for a market participant to obtain an optimal bidding strategy and the corresponding self-scheduled generation plans. Motivated by recently proposed robust optimization approaches, our approach relies on the confidence intervals of price forecasts rather than point estimators. We reformulate the minimax regret model as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and solve it by the Benders' decomposition algorithm. Moreover, we design a bidding strategy based on the price forecast confidence intervals to generate the offer curve. Finally, we numerically test the minimax regret approach, in comparison with the robust optimization approach, on three types of thermal generators by using real electricity price data from PJM to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper presents comparative analysis of the performance of three efficient estimation methods when applied to the probabilistic assessment of small-disturbance stability of uncertain power systems. The presence of uncertainty in system operating conditions and parameters results in variations in the damping of critical modes and makes probabilistic assessment of system stability necessary. The conventional Monte Carlo (MC) approach, typically applied in such cases, becomes very computationally demanding for very large power systems with numerous uncertain parameters. Three different efficient estimation techniques are therefore compared in this paper-point estimation methods, an analytical cumulant-based approach, and the probabilistic collocation method-to assess their feasibility for use with probabilistic small disturbance stability analysis of large uncertain power systems. All techniques are compared with each other and with a traditional numerical MC approach, and their performance illustrated on a multi-area meshed power system.

Abstract: We propose a stochastic generation expansion model, where we represent the long-term uncertainty in the availability and variability in the weekly wind pattern with multiple scenarios. Scenario reduction is conducted to select a representative set of scenarios for the long-term wind power uncertainty. We assume that the short-term wind forecast error induces an additional amount of operating reserves as a predefined fraction of the wind power forecast level. Unit commitment (UC) decisions and constraints for thermal units are incorporated into the expansion model to better capture the impact of wind variability on the operation of the system. To reduce computational complexity, we also consider a simplified economic dispatch (ED) based model with ramping constraints as an alternative to the UC formulation. We find that the differences in optimal expansion decisions between the UC and ED formulations are relatively small. We also conclude that the reduced set of scenarios can adequately represent the long-term wind power uncertainty in the expansion problem. The case studies are based on load and wind power data from the state of Illinois.

Abstract: This paper presents a time-varying stochastic technique to assess conservation voltage reduction (CVR) effects based on load modeling. A time-varying exponential load model is developed to represent voltage dependences of loads. The recursive least square (RLS) method is applied to identify model parameters in a recursive way. CVR factors can be calculated using the identified model parameters. The time-varying stochastic model for CVR effects can then be constructed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. The proposed CVR assessment method is applied to one-year measurement data from a utility company. The calculated CVR factors are verified by a Euclidian distance-based comparison method. Stochastic models of CVR effects in each time window are constructed. Compared with previous efforts on assessing CVR effects, the proposed method does not require control groups or assumptions of linear relationships between the load and its impact factors. The probabilistic nature of CVR effects is also fully considered.

Abstract: Commutation failures, which may lead to outage of HVDC systems, usually occur in line-commutated HVDC systems, especially in the inverter stations. As a method to reduce the risk of commutation failures, additional angle deducted from the firing order at the inverter station has its inherent limitations. In this paper, by analyzing the inverter transient process of normal commutation and commutation failure especially, it is shown that direct-current control can be used to inhibit the commutation failures and present an improvement strategy of control system on the inverter side. Based on the analysis of commutation failure prevention (CFPREV), an approach of direct current value setting is proposed, the selections of parameters in calculating process are CFPREV-based in order to implement it conveniently, and the dc current predictive control strategy is applied by modifying the conventional control system at the inverter. The validity is proved by simulation of the CIGRE HVDC model and multi-infeed HVDC model based on CIGRE HVDC, where various ac system faults in PSCAD/EMTDC are set manually. The results show that the proposed algorithmis very effective in inhibiting commutation failures or repetitive ones, and even would enhance fault-ride-through capability of HVDC system with commutation failures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-objective fault indicator (FI) placement method in electric distribution systems. The prevalent FI placement problem formulation is extended by considering effects of existing protection and control devices on customers' restoration time. Moreover, the customers' average restoration time index (CARTI) is proposed, as a new technical objective function with respect to uncertainties of automatic switching. Furthermore, a multi-objective solution approach is developed to simultaneously minimize indispensable economic and technical objectives. The resultant optimization problem is solved through a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) based algorithm, accompanied by a fuzzy decision making method to select the best result among the obtained Pareto optimal set of solutions. Assuming SAIDI and CARTI as technical objectives, the proposed method is applied to bus number four of the Roy Billinton test system (RBTS4), as well as a real-life distribution network with about 5500 customers, followed by a discussion on results.

Abstract: Inter-area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically poorly controllable by means of local decentralized control. Recent research efforts have been aimed at developing wide-area control strategies that involve communication of remote signals. In conventional wide-area control, the control structure is fixed a priori typically based on modal criteria. In contrast, here we employ the recently-introduced paradigm of sparsity-promoting optimal control to simultaneously identify the optimal control structure and optimize the closed-loop performance. To induce a sparse control architecture, we regularize the standard quadratic performance index with an l(1)-penalty on the feedback matrix. The quadratic objective functions are inspired by the classic slow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous networks without inter-area oscillations. We use the New England power grid model to demonstrate that the proposed combination of the sparsity-promoting control design with the slow coherency objectives performs almost as well as the optimal centralized control while only making use of a single wide-area communication link. In addition to this nominal performance, we also demonstrate that our control strategy yields favorable robustness margins and that it can be used to identify a sparse control architecture for control design via alternative means.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully adaptive fault location algorithm for series-compensated lines (SCLs) based on synchronized phasor measurements obtained by phasor measurement units (PMUs). The proposed algorithm does not require any knowledge on the exact model of the series-compensation device and, therefore, can be applied to transmission lines with any type of series compensation. In addition, the proposed algorithm utilizes only PMU synchronized measurements and does not require any data to be provided by the electric utility. The SCL parameters and Thevenin's equivalent (TE) of the system at SCL terminals are determined online, utilizing three independent sets of pre-fault PMU measurements, to ensure considering the actual operating conditions of the system. Fault-location accuracy evaluation of the proposed algorithm is performed with respect to various factors such as fault position, fault type, fault resistance, fault inception angle, pre-fault loading and line compensation degree. The proposed algorithm is simulated using both PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB and tested on a 400-kV system. Simulation results revealed that the developed algorithm is capable of producing reliable and highly accurate solutions.

Abstract: In this paper a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) is proposed to solve the dynamic economic dispatch (DED) with valve-point effect (VPE) where the non-linear and non-smooth cost caused by VPE is piecewise linearized. However if the DED with VPE is directly solved by the MIQP in a single step, the optimization suffers convergence stagnancy and will run out of memory. In this paper the multi-step method, the warm start technique and the range restriction scheme are combined with the MIQP. The optimization process can then break the convergence stagnancy and the computation efficiency can be greatly improved. When the system loss is considered, the loss formula is piecewise linearized. A post-processing procedure is proposed to eliminate the approximation error caused by linearization of the loss formula. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by seven cases and the results are compared with those obtained by the previous published methods.

Abstract: Island-capable microgrids can potentially improve customer reliability, but protection-related issues can adversely affect this reliability benefit. At the same time, average annualized indices often do not effectively convey a complete picture of load-point reliabilities in microgrids integrated with multiple weather-dependent microsources. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the impacts of protection system and operating conditions on the reliability indices of a microgrid. The proposed method utilizes a short-term outage model that quantifies the relationship between state variables and the outage rate of component. A hybrid approach is proposed, which combines scenario selection and enumerative analysis. Simulations on a test system illustrate the dependence of operational reliability on factors such as local meteorological conditions, correlation between variable generation and loads, as well as the effects of protection system operations. Finally, some recommendations on the parameter settings of protection system are provided to enhance the system reliability.

Abstract: In medium- and long-term power system models, it is a common approach to approximate the demand curve by load levels in order to make the models computationally tractable. However, in such an approach, the chronological information between individual hours is lost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to power system models which constitutes an alternative to the traditional load levels. In particular, we introduce the concept of system states as opposed to load levels, which allows us to better incorporate chronological information in power system models, thereby resulting in a more accurate representation of system outcomes such as electricity prices and total cost. Moreover, the system states can be defined taking into account various important system features at once, as opposed to load levels which are defined using just one specific feature, i.e., demand or net demand. Therefore the system states approach better captures other results such as reserve prices, which are not driven by the usual feature used to define load levels. In a case study, we compare the newly proposed methodology to a standard load level approach, which validates that the system states approach better captures power system outcomes.

Abstract: Power systems do not always operate under fully balanced conditions because of unbalanced loads and untransposed transmission lines. Under such conditions, commonly used positive sequence equivalent will no longer be valid. On the other hand, use of full three-phase model will add significant computational burden for the considered application. This paper describes a simple approach to address this issue for the specific application of state estimation. The main idea is to exploit the linearity of the estimation problem when the system is measured solely by phasor measurements. The linear problem lends itself to decoupling via modal transformation unlike the nonlinear formulation with SCADA measurements. A further improvement is introduced via the use of the least absolute value (LAV) estimator, which has the desirable property of automatic bad-data rejection. The paper illustrates how a robust LAV estimator designed for a positive sequence model can be efficiently used for the solution of an unbalanced three-phase state estimation problem.

Abstract: A power transmission system can be represented by a network with nodes and links representing buses and electrical transmission lines, respectively. Each line can be given a weight, representing some electrical property of the line, such as line admittance or average power flow at a given time. We use a hierarchical spectral clustering methodology to reveal the internal connectivity structure of such a network. Spectral clustering uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix associated to the network, it is computationally very efficient, and it works for any choice of weights. When using line admittances, it reveals the static internal connectivity structure of the underlying network, while using power flows highlights islands with minimal power flow disruption, and thus it naturally relates to controlled islanding. Our methodology goes beyond the standard k-means algorithm by instead representing the complete network substructure as a dendrogram. We provide a thorough theoretical justification of the use of spectral clustering in power systems, and we include the results of our methodology for several test systems of small, medium and large size, including a model of the Great Britain transmission network.

Abstract: Wind generation variability in an energy-only market such Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) can create significant revenue uncertainties for incumbent generators and substantially increase price risks faced by retailers. This paper presents a Cournot game model to formally analyze how high volatility of wind generation in a concentrated energy-only market can raise the peak/shoulder period (of typically low wind generation) prices to offset the foregone revenue during off-peak periods (of high wind generation). A Monte Carlo simulation around a Cournot game is formulated as an inter-temporal nonlinear optimization problem to assess these issues. The model is implemented for the South Australian zone of the Australian NEM that has experienced high growth in wind generation in recent years. The model results support some of the observed spot pricing behavior in the region in recent years. These findings have significant ramifications for the efficacy of the energy-only market in scenarios with high penetration of intermittent generation.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the relatively unexplored subject of creating limit-preserving equivalents (LPEs). There is a push to develop LPEs for power system interconnections to be used in markets and reliability studies. The equivalents that exist for these interconnections do not capture thermal limits of equivalent lines, which results in their transmission limits being significantly different from the original interconnection limits. Assigning noninfinite and nonzero limits to equivalent lines is the niche of this paper. This is done by considering an unloaded network, which is operating point independent. A solution method is developed and discussed, which is capable of assigning lower, best, and upper estimates for equivalent line limits and is proposed for use towards developing LPEs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system configuration for voltage source converter (VSC)-based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission connected to a large-scale offshore wind power plant (WPP). The proposed scheme is reconfigured at the onshore end to achieve shunt and series compensation, which is named as 'Unified-VSC-HVDC' (U-VSC-HVDC). A mathematical model of the proposed configuration is derived to determine the rating of the employed series and shunt converters. To achieve a flexible control strategy for balanced and unbalanced fault conditions, the proposed transient management scheme employs positive and negative sequence controllers for the series compensation. The negative sequence voltage components are determined in such a way as to minimize power oscillations caused by asymmetrical faults, and hence to reduce DC link voltage overshoots. A test system comprised of a detailed representation of the proposed configuration is simulated and evaluated using PSCAD/EMTDC. A comprehensive study validates the capability of the proposed configuration and transient management scheme for achieving smooth power transfer and superior transient performance of the electrical grid. Also, it minimizes the possibilities of electrical network propagations in response to symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults.

Abstract: Price-based demand response (DR) program is a mechanism for encouraging electricity consumers to dynamically manage their energy consumptions in response to time-varying electricity prices, and thereby reduce peak electricity demands and alleviate the pressure to power systems. However, it brings additional dynamics and new challenges to the real-time supply and demand balance. Specifically, if real-time price based DR programs are widely deployed in the future, price-sensitive DR load levels would constantly change in response to dynamic real-time prices, which will impact the economic dispatch (ED) schedule and in turn affect electricity market clearing prices. This paper adopts two methods for examining the impacts of different DR price elasticity characteristics and DR participation levels on the convergence of volatile power market: a closed-loop iterative simulation method and a non-iterative method based on the contraction mapping theorem. In this paper, convergence refers to the fact that load and/or price values will finally converge to a fixed point after a finite number of iterations between the ED problem and the price-sensitive DR load adjustment. Five price-sensitive DR performance function categories are used to simulate different nonlinear price elasticity characteristics of DR loads. Numerical studies illustrate how the convergence status of power markets will be affected by the nonlinear price elasticity DR curves, the DR penetration levels, and the capacity limits of generating units.

Abstract: Power systems are mostly run under stressed operating conditions due to rapidly increasing demand but inadequate expansion in generation and transmission capacity. Thus voltage stability has become a major concern in present day power system operation which depends on the availability and distribution of reactive power. It becomes very important to ensure the presence of sufficient amount of reactive power source in the network for secure and reliable operation of electrical power system. This paper mainly deals with short-term reactive power procurement (RPP) problem assuming an already established real power market. Contributions of this paper are three fold. First, this paper presents three new RPP methods which are formulated as optimum power flow (OPF) problems. OPFs are solved using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm as population based stochastic solution methods are more suitable for solving reactive power optimization problem. Second, a detailed analysis of voltage stability for proposed RPP problems are performed for both normal and contingency condition to find out how these new formulations affect voltage stability. Third, proposed methods are compared with the classical RPP formulations, e. g., Minimization of L-index and loss Minimization. Finally results are reported for both test system and a large practical system.

Abstract: The paper investigates the effect of a transformer unplanned outage on the failure probability of the remaining transformers in the network. The probability of consequential dependent failures of transformers might ultimately lead to a multiple or cascading failure. New probabilistic indicators based on the transformer's unavailability under outage conditions have been formulated for individual power transformers and transformer sites to help with this assessment. The effect of thermal stress of transformer on its unavailability due to the new loading condition is taken into account as well as the age and the original loading of the transformer. The Arrhenius-Weibull life-stress model was adopted for assessment of the transformer unavailability. The study identifies both transformers whose outage could initiate cascading failure and those that are the most vulnerable to consequential failure. The effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic indicators in identifying the most critical transformers for multiple failure events is demonstrated on a realistic transmission test system with 154 power transformers.

Abstract: This paper discusses the design and usage of a SIMULINK-based phasor measurement unit (PMU) simulator package. The simulator and PMU data is available upon request from the first author. The motivation for developing the package is to provide a flexible environment for teaching phasor measurement and frequency estimation to advanced undergraduate and graduate students, and providing a knowledge base to students for research. This software allows for the exploration of the algorithms and phenomena involved in the phasor estimation process. The package is built on the SIMULINK platform and is able to process simulated signals as well as measured point-on-wave data. The popularity and relevance of the proposed package is evaluated using formal questioners.

Abstract: Hydropower producers need to schedule when to release water from reservoirs and participate in wholesale electricity markets where the day-ahead production is physically traded. A mixed-integer linear stochastic model for bid optimization and short-term production allocation is developed and tested through a simulation procedure implemented for a complex real-life river system. The stochastic bid model sees uncertainty in both spot market prices and inflow to the reservoirs. The same simulation procedure is also implemented for a practice-based deterministic heuristic method similar to what is currently used for bid determination in the industry, and the results are compared. The stochastic approach gives improvements in terms of higher obtained average price and higher total value than the deterministic alternative. It also performs well in terms of startup costs. In the presence of river flow travel delay, the practice-based method is even more outperformed by the stochastic model.

Abstract: Power systems training and education faces serious challenges due to the rising complexity of energy systems. This paper presents a simulation-based training platform for educating students and power systems professionals in complex Smart Grid applications. The system is split into parts like electrical grid or controls and specialized, domain-specific tools are then coupled to be able to simulate the overall behavior. Experiences with the developed education and training material and the corresponding modeling and simulation environment are discussed. The usage of advanced modeling and simulation approaches, especially when providing new functionality via coupling of simulation, is an accessible way to train and educate students efficiently in the complex and interdisciplinary area of power systems.

Abstract: This paper considers the use of phasor angle measurements provided by phasor measurement units to identify multiple power line outages. The problem of power line outage identification has traditionally been formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimal solution of which can be found through an exhaustive search. However, the size of the search space grows exponentially with the number of outages and may thus pose a potential problem for the practical implementation of an exhaustive search, especially when multiple power line outages are considered in a power system. To reduce the complexity while improving outage detection performance, we propose a novel global stochastic optimization technique based on cross-entropy optimization, which has been proven to be a powerful tool for many combinatorial optimization problems, to identify multiple line outages. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the algorithm is tested using IEEE 118- and 300-bus systems, as well as a Polish 2736-bus system. Simulation results demonstrate that the percentage of correctly identified line outages achieved by the proposed method outperforms those obtained by existing sparse signal recovery algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, new formulations of the power flow and continuation power flow that allow for electro-thermal coupling in transmission lines have been proposed. The new formulations capture the overhead lines' electro-thermal coupling effects by treating their series resistances as temperature dependent variables. They generate results that can differ from the results of conventional formulations markedly, particularly for problems centring on line impedances. The paper demonstrates this by applying the new formulations to the power transfer limit calculation. Generally, power transfer limits are defined either by encountering a line's thermal limit or detecting the onset of voltage collapse in the system. Studies based on 2-bus and 14-bus test systems are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the new formulations for both situations. For these studies, specific point-to-point power transfer limits are calculated with and without the lines' electro-thermal coupling effects and the results are compared.

Abstract: This paper presents the robust damping control of power systems with thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC). A SISO output feedback controller is to be designed for TCSC to improve the damping of inter-area oscillations under multiple operating points. The robust damping control problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem considering both regional pole placement and H performance for multi-model system. The multi-objective criterions are described by a set of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMI) regarding different system models at multiple operating points; then, a two-step method is introduced to solve the BMI optimization problem via linear matrix inequality (LMI) algorithm. The proposed controller is evaluated by simulations on real-time digital simulator (RTDS). Numerical results from the simulations show that the proposed controller can increase the damping of inter-area oscillations under different system operating conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a day-ahead stochastic scheduling model in electricity markets. The model considers hourly forecast errors of system loads and variable renewable sources as well as random outages of power system components. A chance-constrained stochastic programming formulation with economic and reliability metrics is presented for the day-ahead scheduling. Reserve requirements and line flow limits are formulated as chance constraints in which power system reliability requirements are to be satisfied with a presumed level of high probability. The chance-constrained stochastic programming formulation is converted into a linear deterministic problem and a decomposition-based method is utilized to solve the day-ahead scheduling problem. Numerical tests are performed and the results are analyzed for a modified 31-bus system and an IEEE 118-bus system. The results show the viability of the proposed formulation for the day-ahead stochastic scheduling. Comparative evaluations of the proposed chance-constrained method and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method are presented in the paper.

Abstract: As a critical data input of security constraint unit commitment, bus load forecasting is currently conducted on a bus-by-bus fashion to improve the forecasting accuracy in most provinces in China. On such substation level forecasting, data quality is much worse than the aggregated power demand for the whole system, and identifying and restoring the inaccurate measurement and abnormal disturbance to retrieve the historical trend of load is urged to improve the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, a two-stage identification and restoration method is presented. The typical patterns of inaccurate measurement and abnormal disturbance are detected in the first stage based on statistical criteria independent with normal distribution. Historical trend is further retrieved in the second stage using frequency domain decomposition, and a typical daily curve is generated to compare with the data measurements. The deviations of the data measurements from the typical daily curve obey normal distribution and are used as criteria in the second stage. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been confirmed by examples in real bus load forecasting systems in this paper.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) has proved to be an inevitable part of the future grid. Much research works have been reported in the literature on the benefits and implementation of DR. However, little works have been reported on the impacts of DR on dynamic performance of power systems, specifically on the load frequency control (LFC) problem. This paper makes an attempt to fill this gap by introducing a DR control loop in the traditional LFC model (called LFC-DR) for a single-area power system. The model has the feature of optimal operation through optimal power sharing between DR and supplementary control. The effect of DR communication delay in the controller design is also considered. It is shown that the addition of the DR control loop increases the stability margin of the system and DR effectively improves the system dynamic performance. Simulation studies are carried out for single-area power systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: A distributed algorithm is presented to solve the economic power dispatch with transmission line losses and generator constraints. The proposed approach is based on two consensus algorithms running in parallel. The first algorithm is a first-order consensus protocol modified by a correction term which uses a local estimation of the system power mismatch to ensure the generation-demand equality. The second algorithm performs the estimation of the power mismatch in the system using a consensus strategy called consensus on the most up-to-date information. The proposed approach can handle networks of different size and topology using the information about the number of nodes which is also evaluated in a distributed fashion. Simulations performed on standard test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for both small and large systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the rationale for developing and disseminating an entire curriculum dedicated to Electric Energy System (EES) education at undergraduate and graduate levels. It presents the benefits of teaching just a few well thought out fundamentals-based courses in this area at the undergraduate level that allow students to take complementary courses and thus be broadly educated. This allows them flexibility upon graduation to work in industry, to go on to graduate school and Ph.D. research, or to work in a field different than power/energy. It describes the graduate courses being developed with the help of experts in their respective fields. Finally, this paper describes the dissemination of this material to other universities and practicing engineers by establishing a Consortium of Universities for Sustainable Power (CUSP (TM)) that as of now has been joined by over 170 universities.

The method is based on chordal conversion techniques: by dropping some equality constraints in the conversion, we obtain semidefinite relaxations that are computationally cheaper, but potentially weaker, than the standard semidefinite relaxation. Our numerical results show that the new relaxations often produce the same results as the standard semidefinite relaxation, but at a lower computational cost.

Abstract: In this paper, a theory is developed that relates the natural response of an electric power system to sudden outages of transmission elements. The key development is in determining, via state-space analysis, the anticipated spectral content of either frequency or phase angle measurements as observed immediately following the sudden outage. This theoretical development mainly focuses on frequency measurements and the elements subjected to sudden outages are generators. For any sudden generator outage, the power system exhibits a very specific natural response in terms of its kinetic and potential energies. Kinetic energy in the system is directly related to each specific generator's rotational speed. It is shown that the effect can be seen directly in bus frequency measurements. Each remaining generator on the system has its own unique response to the sudden outage which contributes to the overall system natural response. This overall response is generally composed of oscillatory components which have specific frequencies. These oscillations, as measured by frequency meters, can be used to identify sudden element outages via their spectral content.

Abstract: With rapid increase in wind power penetration into the power grid, wind power forecasting is becoming increasingly important to power system operators and electricity market participants. The majority of the wind forecasting tools available in the literature provide deterministic prediction, but given the variability and uncertainty of wind, such predictions limit the use of the existing tools for decision-making under uncertain conditions. As a result, probabilistic forecasting, which provides information on uncertainty associated with wind power forecasting, is gaining increased attention. This paper presents a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm for deterministic wind power forecasting that utilizes a combination of wavelet transform (WT) and fuzzy ARTMAP (FA) network, which is optimized by using firefly (FF) optimization algorithm. In addition, support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to minimize the wind power forecast error obtained from WT+FA+FF. The paper also presents a probabilistic wind power forecasting algorithm using quantile regression method. It uses the wind power forecast results obtained from the proposed hybrid deterministic WT+FA+FF+SVM model to evaluate the probabilistic forecasting performance. The performance of the proposed forecasting model is assessed utilizing wind power data from the Cedar Creek wind farm in Colorado.

Abstract: This paper presents a computer-assisted method to teach and understand transmission pricing techniques. The education method is facilitated by specially designed user-friendly transmission pricing software (TPS). The proposed approach helps students fully understand transmission pricing through the fulfillment of the following educational objectives: 1) use of TPS to solve the transmission pricing problem of a small power system as well as a real-world power system; 2) complete understanding of the mathematics involved and development of software code to reproduce part of the results of TPS; 3) analysis of the results, identification and justification of the differences among three transmission tracing techniques and eight transmission cost allocation methods; and 4) extension of TPS methodologies. These methods have been proven effective in the education of students studying power system economics at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece. A full-fledged, robust, comprehensive study of the educational improvements achieved through the use of TPS is provided.

Abstract: In a competitive environment with bid-based markets, power generation companies desire to develop bidding strategies that maximize their revenue. In this paper we ask: What approaches and methodologies have been used to model the bidding problem for hydro-electric producers? We present the problem's developments over time and, through reviewing different variants of the problem, progressively build to the case in which the agent is a price-maker hydro-electric producer. In each variant of the bidding problem, we examine how the approaches used to solve it may or may not be applicable to other variants. Last, for the price-maker hydro-electric producer's bidding problem, we recognize the most recent developments and illuminate a path for future efforts.

Abstract: This paper describes the development of a modern power system laboratory within a Bologna Declaration compliant curriculum at the Department of Energy and Power Systems, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb. The paper describes laboratory components and provides insight into the experiments that students are required to perform. The laboratory course is divided into three major components: power system simulations, computer simulations and high voltage. Power system simulations are performed on a miniature real-world power system that can be synchronized to the actual power system. Computer simulations are performed both on commercially available software solutions commonly used by power utilities and consulting companies, and on software tools developed at the Department of Energy and Power Systems. High voltage exercises are performed in the High Voltage Laboratory, where students are familiarized with high voltage phenomena. Results of student questionnaires collected over the previous four years are analyzed. This feedback, together with industry experts' observations and suggestions, provides the basis for improvements that are constantly introduced.

Abstract: In recent grid codes for wind power integration, wind turbines are required to stay connected during grid faults even when the grid voltage drops down to zero; and also to inject reactive current in proportion to the voltage drop. However, a physical fact, instability of grid-connected converters during current injection to very low (close to zero) voltage faults, has been omitted, i.e., failed to be noticed in the previous wind power studies and grid code revisions. In this paper, the instability of grid side converters of wind turbines defined as loss of synchronism (LOS), where the wind turbines lose synchronism with the grid fundamental frequency (e. g., 50 Hz) during very deep voltage sags, is explored with its theory, analyzed and a novel stability solution based on PLL frequency is proposed; and both are verified with power system simulations and by experiments on a grid-connected converter setup.

Abstract: The analysis of electromechanical oscillatory modes offers essential information on the stability of power systems. This paper investigates the use of the natural excitation technique (NExT) in conjunction with the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) for the modal analysis of power systems. The NExT-ERA is a multivariate method utilizing data that are measured from several locations in the power grid. The method is capable of utilizing synchronously measured data from a wide area monitoring system (WAMS) as well as unsynchronized measurements, such as measurements of individual relays' recorders. The performance of the NExT-ERA method is analyzed by applying it to data generated with test systems. The method is also applied to actual measurements received from the Nordic power system. The results indicate that the frequencies and damping ratios of electromechanical oscillatory modes can be analyzed by using the NExT-ERA method. Thus, the method is a promising identification technique for wide-area monitoring of electromechanical oscillations.

We have designed kits of flexibly configurable components that students use to quickly construct electromagnetic actuators and sensors. They can use these machines to verify design calculations, test their understanding of the machine operating principles, and to test power electronic drives that they also design and construct. In class, the properties of different motor designs and sizing can be related to commercial products, and commercial products can be used as inspiration for design contests in the teaching laboratory.

Abstract: In this paper, a new load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems is developed based on the direct-indirect adaptive fuzzy control technique. LFCs for each area are designed based on availability of frequency deviation of each area and tie-line power deviation between areas. The fuzzy logic system approximation capabilities are exploited to develop suitable adaptive control law and parameter update algorithms for unknown interconnected LFC areas. An tracking performance criterion is introduced to minimize the approximation errors and the external disturbance effects. The proposed controller guarantees stability of the overall closed-loop system. Simulation results for a real three-area power system prove the effectiveness of the proposed LFC and show its superiority over a classical PID controller and a type-2 fuzzy controller.

Abstract: An elaborately designed integrated power distribution and electric vehicle (EV) charging system will not only reduce the investment and operation cost of the system concerned, but also promote the popularization of environmentally friendly EVs. In this context, a multi-objective collaborative planning strategy is presented to deal with the optimal planning issue in integrated power distribution and EV charging systems. In the developed model, the overall annual cost of investment and energy losses is minimized simultaneously with the maximization of the annual traffic flow captured by fast charging stations (FCSs). Additionally, the user equilibrium based traffic assignment model (UETAM) is integrated to address the maximal traffic flow capturing problem. Subsequently, a decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) is employed to seek the non-dominated solutions, i.e., the Pareto frontier. Finally, collaborative planning results of two coupled distribution and transportation systems are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed model and solution method.

Abstract: This paper develops the information fusion based pricing control (IFPC) scheme for the generation-side in the liberalized wholesale electricity market. The market mechanism is described by a feedback system, in which the independent system operator (ISO) interacts with generation companies (GenCOs) via proposing and responding to real-time nodal prices. The linear constrained quadratic optimal tracking problem is formulated; and the solution (nodal price sequence) is repeatedly computed by fusing the recently available information with backward manner and updated over the receding preview horizon. So that the total supply dynamically tracks the demand, the price is stationarized and each GenCO gains the maximal profit for the given price. Numeric results on a 118-bus network validate IFPC's effectiveness and flexibility on incorporating various line rating constraints as well as wind power fluctuation uncertainties. Comparative study demonstrates that IFPC outperforms the negotiated predictive dispatch but elapsing heavier computations. The irrational behavior analysis verifies the convergence to equilibrium; and speculation behavior of GenCOs in the real market is also discussed. Along with the rapid development of smart grid, IFPC is practically enabled by the information and communication technology (ICT); its significance and potentials for renewable energy sources (RES) integration would be realized and exploited.

Abstract: Based on offline studies and past experiences, a novel adaptive coordinated voltage control (ACVC) strategy is proposed in this two-part paper. An efficient adaptive response is realized by searching in a limited solution space which is defined by the prepared system knowledge. The system knowledge is acquired from offline studies and then further accumulated from online experiences by learning. With the prepared control knowledge, the search solution space can be significantly reduced. Hence, the online search can quickly achieve a good system performance. In this first part of the paper, the offline study and online control for prepared faults are presented. For some anticipated faults, an offline search is applied to get knowledge for preparation. When an emergency happens, it is compared with the knowledge in the database. If full control information is found, a fast local search is applied within the solution space. Simulation results on the New England 39-bus power system show that this ACVC strategy is very efficient for real-time applications. The learning technique and online knowledge accumulation will be presented in Part II.

Abstract: This paper presents a maintenance strategy for overhead lines based on condition monitoring and system reliability assessment. A quantitative relationship between the condition monitoring data and failure rate of overhead lines is established. The system reliability is evaluated using monitoring data; the reliability benefit due to the maintenance of each line is quantified; and the maintenance ranking order is created using the benefit/cost ratio index. The proposed strategy can provide the largest reliability improvement at the lowest maintenance cost and within budget. Case studies were performed on a 182-bus, 5474-MW transmission system located in southwest China.

Abstract: Rapidly increasing the penetration level of renewable energies has imposed new challenges to the operation of power systems. Inability or inadequacy of these resources in providing inertial and primary frequency responses is one of the important challenges. In this paper, this issue is addressed within the framework of security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) by adding new constraints representing the system frequency response. A modified system frequency response model is first derived and used to find analytical representation of system minimum frequency in thermal-dominant multi-machine systems. Then, an effective piecewise linearization (PWL) technique is employed to linearize the nonlinear function representing the minimum system frequency, facilitating its integration in the SCUC problem. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem which is solved efficiently by available commercial solvers. The results indicate that the proposed method can be utilized to integrate renewable resources into power systems without violating system frequency limits.

Abstract: This paper describes a new probabilistic model for generation and transmission expansion planning (G&TEP) problem considering reliability criteria. Probabilistic reliability criteria accounts for random generator or line outages with known historical forced outage rates (FOR). The resultant model considers the installation and operation costs as well as the cost of expected energy not supplied (EENS) to optimally determine the number and location of new generating units and circuits in the network, power generation capacity for those units and the voltage phase angle at each node. Also, efficient linear formulations are introduced in this paper to deal with the nonlinear nature of the problem including objective functions and constraints. Modified 6-bus test system, IEEE 24-bus RTS and IEEE 118-bus test system are utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Continuous liberalization and interconnection of energy markets worldwide has raised concerns about the inherent interdependency between primary energy supply and electric systems. With the growing interaction among energy carriers, limitations on the fuel delivery are becoming increasingly relevant to the operation of power systems. This paper contributes with a novel formulation of a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) security-constrained optimal power and gas flow. To this end, an iterative methodology, based on development of linear sensitivity factors, determines the stabilized post-contingency condition of the integrated network. The proposed model allows system operators not only to perform security analysis but also to adjust in advance state variables of the integrated system optimally and fast, so that n - 1 contingencies do not result in violations. Case studies integrate the IEEE 24-bus system and a modified Belgian high-calorific gas network for analyzing the performance of the formulation and solution methodology.

Abstract: This paper proposes improvements in the sequential Monte Carlo (MC) simulation based approaches for reliability evaluation of composite generation and transmission systems. The main idea is to compute a threshold load level to facilitate the process of state evaluation, which is very time-consuming mainly due to optimal power flow computations. Two main sampling techniques namely random sampling (RS) and Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) are applied to the proposed sequential MC simulation technique. Their performances in terms of simulation time as well as solution accuracy are compared. Case studies using the IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE RTS) are utilized to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Reliability indices including loss of load probability, expected unserved energy, loss of load frequency and duration are estimated. It is shown that the proposed approach considerably reduces the computational requirements during state evaluation, and that the application of LHS can further decrease the simulation time and required sample size to reach convergence.

Abstract: In this paper, a nonlinear model for medium-term hydro-thermal scheduling problems with transmission constraints is presented. A nonlinear formulation of hydro power production functions of discharge and storage is used for proper representation of head variation in cascaded reservoirs. Transmission networks are formulated as a direct-current power flow model with support to load attainment over multiple levels representing peak and off-peak hours, enabling varying degrees of both network topology and load balance nodes representation over time stages. Sparse matrix structures that arise from the mathematical formulation allow fast decoupled computation of search directions in a primal-dual interior-point framework. Computational tests with very large case studies are presented. Analysis of numerical algorithm convergence is provided along with insightful optimal solution interpretative commentary.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized methodology to optimally schedule generating units while simultaneously determining the geographical allocation of the required reserve. We consider an interconnected multi-area power system with cross-border trading in the presence of wind power uncertainty. The multi-area market-clearing model is represented as a two-stage stochastic programming model. The proposed decentralized procedure relies on an augmented Lagrangian algorithm that requires no central operator intervention but just moderate interchanges of information among neighboring regions. The methodology proposed is illustrated using an example and a realistic case study.

Abstract: A shortage of U.S. trained power and energy engineers has been predicted in the near future. One approach to solve this problem involves increasing the number of students choosing to study engineering, especially by exposing more students to engineering at an early age, even before high school. This paper presents the curricula and assessment of two summer programs for middle and high school students. We introduced electric and renewable energy concepts, engineering design, and MicroGrid related projects to the students. The survey results indicate that both programs improved students' levels of engineering knowledge, interest in learning and participating in engineering projects, and their intention to choose an engineering career; however, students' confidence in succeeding in engineering or science did not show improvement, which may impact students' willingness to choose engineering as a major. A positive attitude towards engineering among high school students had improved after the program but not among the middle school group. Improving the image of electrical engineering in general, and power systems engineering in particular, remains a challenge.

Abstract: This paper gives the background and role of the market flow in the interregional congestion management process for market-based operating entity and describes the market flow methodology. It proposes that the market flow method calculates the same impact result on a flowgate as the unit dispatch system (UDS) flow does and proves it mathematically. The equivalence of market flow and UDS flow shows that the UDS flow change on a constraint due to the UDS binding will have the same effect on the change in the market flow under the electricity market operations. In addition, it proves that, in an interconnected system, the sum of the market flows of all of the market entities, the generation-to-load impacts of nonmarket entities, and the total tagged transaction impact among the entities is equal to the dc flow for any constraint. The assessment of market flow methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of using the market flow in the congestion management process and coordinated management of transmission constraints. The proposed methodology can help identify the cause of loop flow problem in power systems. The numerical results on a 23-bus test system and a 7917-bus system are also illustrated.

Abstract: An adaptive damping control scheme based on the dual Youla parameterization is proposed in this paper for inter-area low frequency oscillations. First, a set of observer-based feedback controllers are pre-designed using H-2/H-infinity robust control method for a set of nominal operating conditions. Second, the power system and controllers are parameterized using Youla method, respectively. Finally, online measurements are utilized to identify the changing dynamics and adjust the parameterized controllers to adapt to changing operating conditions through the updated Youla parameters. A 127-bus equivalent of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system with three additional controllers of energy storage system is employed as a test system. The results of frequency domain and time domain of different contingences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the Youla based adaptive control scheme.

Abstract: As colleges prepare or revise their power engineering courses to include discussions on the smart grid, the microgrid, distributed energy sources and renewable energy resources, the need for new material suitable for inclusion in a typical 4-year undergraduate engineering course has never been more obvious. Toward this effort, an old machines lab was remodeled and converted into a small power network that can be operated in both grid-connected and grid-islanded microgrid modes. The intent of this paper is to devise laboratory experiments to supplement a course in conventional power systems analysis at the undergraduate level. During the remodeling process, two of six synchronous machines in the lab were converted to represent distributed generating units within a laboratory-based microgrid. The use of electromechanical distributed generators (EDG) with a low start-up time allows the system to operate as a conventional power network with provisions for frequency and voltage variations. Students can experiment with voltage control and power sharing between the EDGs in islanded mode. A Laboratory Grid Central Controller (LGCC) was developed in LabVIEW (R) to coordinate the operation of the EDGs, the utility grid and the loads. Its functions are similar to those of a central dispatch office, albeit on a much smaller scale. A one credit hour lab course held on this laboratory was offered for the first time during the Fall semester of 2012 at Missouri S&T.

Abstract: This paper applies optimal power flow (OPF) to evaluate and maximize network benefits of demand-side management (DSM). The benefits are quantified in terms of the ability of demand-responsive loads to relieve upstream network constraints and provide ancillary services, such as operating reserve. The study incorporates detailed information on the load structure and composition, and allows the potential network benefits, which could be obtained through management of different load types, to be quantified and compared. It is demonstrated that the actual network location of demand-manageable load has an important influence on the effectiveness of the applied DSM scheme, since the characteristics of the loads and their interconnecting networks vary from one location to another. Consequently, some network locations are more favorable for implementation of DSM, and OPF can be applied to determine the optimal allocation of demand-side resources. The effectiveness of the presented approach is assessed using a time-sequential OPF applied to typical radial and meshed U. K. distribution networks. The results of the analysis suggest that network operators could not just participate in, but also encourage and add value to the implementation of specific DSM schemes at the optimum network locations in order to maximize the total benefit from DSM.

Abstract: This paper presents a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based multi-objective planning algorithm for reactive power compensation of radial distribution networks with unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) allocation. A UPQC consists of a series and a shunt inverter. The UPQC model based on phase angle control (UPQC-PAC) is used. In UPQC-PAC, the series inverter injects a voltage with controllable phase angle in such a way that the voltage magnitude at load end remains unchanged. Due to the phase angle shift, the series inverter participates in load reactive power compensation along with the shunt inverter during healthy operating condition. In the proposed approach, the optimal location, the optimal reactive power compensation required at the location, and the optimal design parameters of UPQC are determined by minimizing three objective functions: 1) the rating of UPQC, 2) network power loss, and 3) percentage of nodes with undervoltage problem. These objectives are simultaneously minimized to obtain a set of non-dominated solutions using multi-objective PSO (MOPSO). The performances of two MOPSO variants are compared and the better one is used in all subsequent studies. A load flow algorithm including the UPQC-PAC model is devised. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated with different case studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) technique considering the correlations of wind speeds following arbitrary probability distributions based on the point estimation method (PEM). Correlated wind speeds following different distributions are transformed into random variables following correlated normal distributions and then independent normal distributions so that the traditional 2m + 1 point estimation method can be applied to solve the probabilistic optimal power flow with wind speed correlations. The IEEE 14-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system and an actual utility system in the southwest of China with additional wind farms are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.

Abstract: This paper proposes and implements robust optimization methodologies for making investment decisions in the capacity expansion planning (CEP) of power systems in an uncertain environment. Uncertainties of fuel prices, demand, and transmission capacity are captured in an uncertainty set. With adjustable robust optimization (ARO), we represent all the decision variables as affine functions of multiple uncertain data. This adjustability of decisions provides that the ARO solution has significant less price of robustness than in traditional robust optimization (RO). ARO models uncertainty in terms of parameter ranges, called "uncertainty sets." An attractive attribute of utilizing uncertainty sets is that they facilitate computational tractability when simulating scenarios with multiple uncertainties. We study the 40-year planning of a 5-region, 13-technology US energy portfolio. Results show that 1) by appropriately selecting the decision rules in ARO, the price of robustness can be significantly reduced while maintaining the same levels of robustness; and 2) the RO-based models maintain high levels of robustness even under operational conditions provided by data coming from larger sizes of the uncertainty sets.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe the approach in designing and constructing wind power laboratory experiments for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in power and energy systems. These are separated into basic hands-on laboratory and advanced simulation-based experiments. The basic experiments are integrated into an undergraduate course that includes topics such as the steady-state operation of induction machines, fixed-speed, and variable-speed wind turbines. Advanced experiments are integrated into a stand-alone course dedicated to wind energy and power systems. Topics include the modeling of aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical components for each type of wind turbine along with their steady-state and dynamic operations. The experiments were originally designed at the University of Texas at Austin. Their transferability to a different laboratory platform at the University of Texas Pan American is also discussed.

Abstract: A scalable and analytically tractable probabilistic model for the cascading failure dynamics in power grids is constructed while retaining key physical attributes and operating characteristics of the power grid. The approach is based upon extracting a reduced abstraction of large-scale power grids using a small number of aggregate state variables while modeling the system dynamics using a continuous-time Markov chain. The aggregate state variables represent critical power-grid attributes, which have been shown, from prior simulation-based and historical-data-based analysis, to strongly influence the cascading behavior. The transition rates among states are formulated in terms of certain parameters that capture grid's operating characteristics comprising loading level, error in transmission-capacity estimation, and constraints in performing load shedding. The model allows the prediction of the evolution of blackout probability in time. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis of the blackout probability enables the calculation of the probability mass function of the blackout size. A key benefit of the model is that it enables the characterization of the severity of cascading failures in terms of the operating characteristics of the power grid.

Abstract: In this paper, short-term forecast of wind farm generation is investigated by applying spatio-temporal analysis to extensive measurement data collected from a large wind farm where multiple classes of wind turbines are installed. Specifically, using the data of the wind turbines' power outputs recorded across two consecutive years, graph-learning based spatio-temporal analysis is carried out to characterize the statistical distribution and quantify the level crossing rate of the wind farm's aggregate power output. Built on these characterizations, finite-state Markov chains are constructed for each epoch of three hours and for each individual month, which accounts for the diurnal non-stationarity and the seasonality of wind farm generation. Short-term distributional forecasts and a point forecast are then derived by using the Markov chains and ramp trend information. The distributional forecast can be utilized to study stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch problems via a Markovian approach. The developed Markov-chain-based distributional forecasts are compared with existing approaches based on high-order autoregressive models and Markov chains by uniform quantization, and the devised point forecasts are compared with persistence forecasts and high-order autoregressive model-based point forecasts. Numerical test results demonstrate the improved performance of the Markov chains developed by spatio-temporal analysis over existing approaches.

Abstract: We have developed a hands-on kit for prototyping power electronics. This kit permits students to design and build power circuits capable of processing thousands of watts safely, while preserving design flexibility, i.e., avoiding "cookbook" laboratory assignments. This system exposes students to real-world operating conditions and parasitics that often define and delimit a power electronic design in industry. This hardware and the associated approach to instruction provides flexible, repeated design-and-build experiences in a single-term undergraduate class typically taken by juniors and seniors.

Abstract: Recent research has applied semidefinite programming (SDP) to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Extending SDP formulations to include the ZIP load model, which consists of constant impedance, constant current, and constant power components, is necessary for many practical problems. Existing SDP formulations consider constant power components and can be easily extended to incorporate constant impedance components. With linear dependence on voltage magnitude, constant current components are not trivially formulated in a manner amenable to SDP. This letter details an approximate representation of ZIP loads in an SDP relaxation of the OPF problem.

Abstract: This paper presents the outcome of a summer pre-college engineering enrichment program. The purpose of the summer outreach program is to promote and expose pre-college students to electrical engineering concepts and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) topics as well as hands on research projects. The summer program is typically a six-week summer outreach program that attracts U. S. high school students and international students from abroad. Sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Science Foundation (NSF), the summer program is generally offered to underrepresented high school students who have completed their junior year of high school and for seniors who plan to attend universities in the fall semester in the area of engineering. The program has demonstrated the potential to attract and graduate talented youth, including college students as mentors, who later enrolled in advanced degree programs at college and university levels. This Pre-College for Engineering Systems is a residential program coordinated by the Center for Energy Systems and Control (CESaC), within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Howard University. CESaC hopes that this summer program can serve as a national model for increasing the number of underrepresented groups in electrical engineering and system. Based on the objectives and subsequent outcomes, the program can serve as a national model for increasing the number of underrepresented groups in electrical computer engineering with an emphasis in power and energy specialization.

Abstract: This paper identifies when the transmission network local hosting capacity for a wind harvesting network may be limited because of steady-state bus voltage limits. In addition, the paper addresses how with the wind farm voltage control provision, such constraints may be overcome and the local hosting capacity can be increased. To answer these questions, actual Spanish system data is used on different network models of increasing complexity. Firstly, a simplified model of both transmission network and harvesting network is discussed to show that generally, only buses with low short-circuit power and low or high reactance-resistance ratio may limit local hosting capacity significantly. Secondly, in order to assess how modeling simplifications affect the results, the full model of an actual Spanish harvesting network is considered: the real reactive capability of the harvesting network at the transmission network connection node is computed and the local hosting capacity recalculated. Finally, in the last step, the results of the aforementioned simplified models are validated using the complete model of the Spanish transmission network. In addition, a complementary area hosting capacity analysis is included in order to show the importance of steady-state bus voltage constraints when large amounts of power need to be transported over long distances.

Abstract: Fault indicating devices such as fault indicators (FIs) have been widely used in distribution systems to improve reliability and reduce outage duration. Recently, FIs with communication interfaces are integrated into distribution automation (DA) to further reduce fault-finding time by reporting FIs' statuses back to control center. When faults occur, a lot of alarms and fault information are received from Outage Management System (OMS), Trouble Call System (TCS) and Customer Information System (CIS) and are shown to system operators. As a result, the identification of faulted line sections in a wide-ranging distribution system from FIs' statuses is not an easy task, especially when multiple faults occur simultaneously and/or distributed generators (DGs) are connected. An automatic and fast faulted line-section location method for distribution systems based on FIs is proposed in this paper. The line sections between adjacent FIs can be treated as a possible fault location (PFL) and the fault current detected by the FI can be considered as line current (LC) flowing between the adjacent PFLs. A relationship matrix between PFLs and LCs is then derived and used to design the proposed automatic and fast faulted line-section location method. The faulted line sections can then be located effectively and efficiently by the proposed method. Test results for an actual distribution system demonstrate the validity of the proposed faulted line-section location method.

Abstract: This is the second part of a two-part paper on a new adaptive coordinated voltage control (ACVC) strategy. The overall basic scheme and the online control for prepared faults have been presented in Part I. In this paper, learning control is explored to accumulate knowledge, so that the online control performances can be improved for unknown emergencies. For unknown situations where no past experiences can be exploited, a learning scheme is used by which the control knowledge can be acquired gradually. The learnt knowledge goes into the database and is improved the next time a related situation happens. After full knowledge is acquired, the unknown fault becomes a prepared fault with prepared knowledge. With the learning scheme, control for any emergency can be realized in a rapid and effective response. The learning process is demonstrated by providing control for an unknown emergency in the New England 39-bus power system. The ACVC performance for a sequence of randomly generated fault and load event emergencies is presented at the end of this paper.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem posed by complex, nonlinear controllers for power system load flows employing multi-terminal voltage source converter (VSC) HVDC systems. More realistic dc grid control strategies can thus be carefully considered in power flow analysis of ac/dc grids. Power flow methods for multi-terminal VSC-HVDC (MTDC) systems are analyzed for different types of dc voltage control techniques and the weaknesses of present methods are addressed. As distributed voltage control is likely to be adopted by practical dc grids, a new generalized algorithm is proposed to solve the power flow problems with various nonlinear voltage droops, and the method to incorporate this algorithm with ac power flow models is also developed. With five sets of voltage characteristics implemented, the proposed scheme is applied to a five-terminal test system and shows satisfactory performance. For a range of wind power variations and converter outages, post-contingency behaviors of the system under the five control scenarios are examined. The impact of these controls on the power flow solutions is assessed.

Abstract: This paper presents three new contributions to power flow analysis of unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. First, a complex vector based model in alpha beta 0 stationary reference frame is developed to state the power flow equations using a compact matrix formulation. The proposed model is based on Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). Then, a general and exact power transformer model in the alpha beta 0 reference frame is proposed. Finally, this transformer model is incorporated into the power flow problem. It will be shown that the use of an orthogonal reference frame simplifies the modeling of the distribution network components. In this work, both the network and the power transformer, as well as PQ type loads, PQ and PV type generators and a slack bus are modeled. By using the node incidence matrix instead of the admittance matrix, the information about the grid topology and the grid parameters (including power transformers) is separately organized. As it will be demonstrated, the proposed formulation is ready to incorporate other complex models of loads, generators or storage devices. The model is tested by using the IEEE 4-Node and the IEEE 123-Node Test Feeders with different transformer connections and balanced and unbalanced lines and loads.

Abstract: Growth and penetration of renewable energy has been remarkable during the last few years in many power systems around the world. Essentially, there are two major technologies responsible for the growth, namely wind and photovoltaic. The technologies involved in harnessing energy from wind and sun are distinctly different in dynamic characteristics and limitations. Consequently, their influence on stability of power system should not be overlooked. This paper examines the small-disturbance angle stability with high penetration of renewable energy and proposes a methodology to control. The hierarchical principal component analysis, which is a clustering method corresponding to the eigenvalue sensitivity of reactive power control, is utilized to select the renewable generator clusters for different reactive power control scheme. Then, the framework based on structured singular value has been employed, in which the reactive power controls of renewable generator clusters are selected such that the desired robust stability criterion is satisfied. Results obtained in 16-machine 68-bus test system (typically used for small-signal angle stability studies) show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: The constant current controllers at high voltage direct current (HVDC) rectifier stations and the outer loops which set the reference to the current controller have potential to introduce negative damping on the nearby generating units. It is therefore vital to investigate the torsional interaction behavior between turbine-generator (TG) units and the HVDC systems over a frequency range of interest. In this paper, subsynchronous torsional interaction (SSTI) phenomenon for hydroelectric TG units with small generator-to-turbine inertia (GTI) ratios interconnected to an HVDC system has been investigated. The sensitivity of different system parameters, such as generating capacity and loading, DC power flow, AC network strength and current controller gains, towards electrical damping contribution is also examined. Hydro units with different shaft systems are examined for SSTI proneness by conducting perturbation analysis. The impact of hydroelectric TG units with different GTI ratios has also been examined by applying a three-phase to ground fault at the rectifier station. Simulation studies have been carried out in PSCAD (R)/EMTDC (c) environment. Due to lack of modal damping with relatively low decrement factor and logarithmic decrement, sustained and growing TG torque oscillations are noted for certain operating conditions of hydro units with small GTI ratios interconnected with an HVDC system.

Abstract: This paper investigates and discusses the usefulness of the application of several valid adequacy evaluation protocols to both the IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE RTS) and the entire Brazilian Power System (BPS). Three contributions are worth mentioning: 1) an in-depth evaluation of the IEEE RTS using several adequacy protocols, which may be compared with the set of results already available in the literature; 2) original results from an actual very large non-academic power system (BPS), also using a diverse set of adequacy protocols, which help to interpret the behavior of traditional reliability indices when evaluated in real generation and/or transmission systems; and 3) the establishment, evaluation, discussion, and comparison of a set of assumptions described through adequacy protocols used in both systems, which may be adapted to the systems of other countries.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data corruption on real-time locational marginal price (LMP) in electricity markets. We present an analytical framework to quantify LMP sensitivity with respect to changes in sensor data. This framework consists of a unified LMP sensitivity matrix subject to sensor data corruption. This sensitivity matrix reflects a coupling among the sensor data, an estimation of the power system states, and the real-time LMP. The proposed framework offers system operators an online tool to: 1) quantify the impact of corrupted data at any sensor on LMP variations at any bus; 2) identify buses with LMPs highly sensitive to data corruption; and 3) find sensors that impact LMP changes significantly and influentially. It also allows system operators to evaluate the impact of SCADA data accuracy on real-time LMP. The results of the proposed sensitivity based analysis are illustrated and verified with IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems with both Ex-ante and Ex-post real-time pricing models.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that locational marginal pricing (LMP) model can be extended to the electric distribution system to create better economic and operational signals. Loss sensitivity calculation is an important requirement for calculating distribution LMP. This letter proposes a novel approximate approach for calculating nodal loss sensitivities for large unbalanced radial distribution networks. The method has been further validated through perturbation studies performed with the IEEE 8500-node model. The results from this work can help facilitate further studies and implementation of distribution LMP in practical electrical distribution systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for assessing the performance of alternative design strategies for multivoltage-level distribution networks. The key feature of the proposed methodology is its ability to reproduce realistic network topologies and lengths, as calibrated against real distribution networks. Through year-round power flow analysis and optimization processes, the proposed approach allows comprehensive network studies to be carried out for the decision makers to investigate the sensitivity to different parameters and to draw more robust conclusions than those reached through a specific network study. The output metrics used for comparison of network performance are overall network cost, network losses, and reliability, which represent the three most crucial network performance indicators in network design. The validity of the developed models was demonstrated through the investigation of alternative distribution network design for a real medium voltage (MV) network in the U. K. This investigation includes quantitative performance evaluation and comparison between a four-voltage-levels design (e. g., 132 kV/33 kV/11 kV or 6.6 kV/0.4 kV) with three-voltage-levels network arrangements (e. g., 132 kV/11 kV/0.4 kV or 132 kV/20 kV/0.4 kV) and comparison between the peak demand-driven network design versus the optimal loss inclusive network design.

Abstract: This paper presents a model for microgrid optimal scheduling considering multi-period islanding constraints. The objective of the problem is to minimize the microgrid total operation cost which comprises the generation cost of local resources and cost of energy purchase from the main grid. The microgrid optimal scheduling problem is decomposed into a grid-connected operation master problem and an islanded operation subproblem. The microgrid capability in operating in the islanded mode for multiple hours is scrutinized by a T - tau islanding criterion. The integer scheduling decisions determined in the master problem will be examined against the microgrid islanding feasibility in the subproblem. The scheduling decisions will be revised using proper islanding cuts if sufficient generation is not available to guarantee a feasible islanding. Islanding cuts will revise generating units, energy storage systems, and adjustable loads schedules. Any change in the schedule of adjustable loads outside the operating time interval specified by consumers is penalized by an inconvenience factor in the objective. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed microgrid optimal scheduling model and explore its economic and reliability merits.

Abstract: Designing future capacity mixes with adequate flexibility requires capturing operating constraints through an embedded unit commitment approximation. Despite significant recent improvements, such simulations still require significant computation times. Here we propose a method, based on clustering units, for approximate unit commitment with dramatic improvements in solution time. This method speeds computation by aggregating similar but non-identical units. This replaces large numbers of binary commitment variables with fewer integers while still capturing individual unit decisions and constraints. We demonstrate the trade-off between accuracy and run-time for different levels of aggregation. A numeric example using an ERCOT-based 205-unit system illustrates that careful aggregation introduces errors of 0.05%-0.9% across several metrics while providing several orders of magnitude faster solution times (400 x) compared to traditional binary formulations. Further aggregation increases errors slightly (similar to 2x) with further speedup (2000 x). We also compare other simplifications that can provide an additional order of magnitude speed-up for some problems.

Abstract: Local controllers are essential in distribution networks; they are employed in classical devices such as load tap-changing (LTC) transformers and switchable shunt capacitors, and more recently in distributed generation (DG). The effective use of distribution management system (DMS) applications requires an accurate model of the interaction between the local controllers through the distribution system. This paper presents a new sensitivity matrix approach for modeling such interactions, and demonstrates its application in the implicit Gauss method for power flow computation. The sensitivity method models both PV buses (for the connection of DG) and tap position adjustments through current source injections, and consequently avoids re-factorization of the network bus admittance matrix. Numerical results on distribution networks with up to 3145 buses show that the sensitivity-based power flow method for simulating the operation of local controllers is superior to a sequential control action adjustment approach previously proposed in the literature, and that its computing time is commensurate with the performance requirements in real-time DMS applications.

Abstract: Increasing levels of wind power integration pose a challenge in system operation, owing to the uncertainty and non-dispatchability of wind generation. The probabilistic nature of wind speed inputs dictates that in an optimization of the system, all output variables will themselves be probabilistic. In order to determine the distributions resulting from system optimization, a probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) method may be applied. While Monte Carlo (MC) techniques are a traditional approach, recent research into point estimate methods (PEMs) has displayed their capabilities to obtain output distributions while reducing computational burden. Unfortunately both spatial and temporal correlation amongst the input wind speed random variables complicates the application of PEM for solving the POPF. Further complications may arise due to the large number of random input variables present when performing a multi-period POPF. In this paper, a solution is proposed which addresses the correlation amongst input random variables, as well as an input variable truncation approach for addressing the large number of random input variables, such that a PEM can be effectively used to obtain POPF output distributions.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of identifying the optimal investment of a strategic wind power investor that participates in both the day-ahead (DA) and the balancing markets. This investor owns a number of wind power units that jointly with the newly built ones allow it to have a dominant position and to exercise market power in the DA market, behaving as a deviator in the balancing market in which the investor buys/sells its production deviations. The model is formulated as a stochastic complementarity model that can be recast as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A static approach is proposed focusing on a future target year, whose uncertainties pertaining to demands, wind power productions, and balancing market prices are precisely described. The proposed model is illustrated using a simple example and two case studies.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is essential to power system operation. Given significant uncertainties involved in wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting provides a unique solution to estimate and quantify the potential impacts and risks facing system operation with wind penetration beforehand. This paper proposes a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm approach to directly formulate optimal prediction intervals of wind power generation based on extreme learning machine and particle swarm optimization. Prediction intervals with associated confidence levels are generated through direct optimization of both the coverage probability and sharpness to ensure the quality. The proposed method does not involve the statistical inference or distribution assumption of forecasting errors needed in most existing methods. Case studies using real wind farm data from Australia have been conducted. Comparing with benchmarks applied, experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency and reliability of the developed approach. It is therefore convinced that the proposed method provides a new generalized framework for probabilistic wind power forecasting with high reliability and flexibility and has a high potential of practical applications in power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete wave-to-wire approach to the modeling of wave energy farms. It captures all the main peculiarities of such applications, from the variability of sea waves to the issues related to the grid integration of a multi-MW wave farm, including the hydrodynamic modeling of wave energy converters (WECs). The paper specifically discusses the different levels of control of a wave farm and their integration and coordination. These are crucial to meet the power quality requirements at the point of common coupling (PCC) and ensure the efficiency of the power transfer from the waves to the main electric grid. A specific real-time technique for the centralized control of a wave farm is also proposed, which is exemplified with reference to the PCC voltage control in the real test case of bimep. Critical cases of weaker grids are also considered to extend the validity of the analysis.

Abstract: Conservation voltage reduction (CVR) is widely adopted by utilities for peak demand reduction and energy savings through reducing the voltage level of the electrical distribution system. This paper presents an in-depth review on implementing and assessing CVR. The methodologies to quantify CVR effects are categorized into comparison-based, regression-based, synthesis-based and simulation-based methods. The implementation strategies for voltage reduction are classified into open-loop and closed-loop methods. The impacts of emerging smart-grid technologies on CVR are also discussed. The paper can provide researchers and utility engineers with further insights into the state of the art, technical barriers and future research directions of CVR technologies.

Abstract: Distribution system operators are often challenged by voltage regulation problems, energy losses, and network capacity problems. This paper analyses a real-life 3.9-MVA distribution network in Gujarat State, India. Distributed generation from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, at optimal locations on distribution feeders, may enable energy loss reduction and voltage profile improvement. A methodology is developed and presented for deciding the appropriate location of these embedded renewable generators. Simulations are performed to calculate different scenarios, and the final analysis reveals that the low voltage problem has totally been eliminated on all of the nodes of the distribution network. Complimentary, significant energy loss reductions are also achieved in the distribution, and the network reserve capacity has also increased.

Abstract: Preventive control (PC) and corrective control (CC) are complementary actions in protecting large power systems against the risk of blackout. This paper addresses the optimal coordination between PC and CC via a preventive-corrective security-constrained optimal power flow model. The objective is to minimize the total expected-security-control cost which is the sum of the costs of PC and CC considering the probability of the contingencies. The constraints include system operating limits in pre- and post-contingency states, the existence of the post-contingency short-term equilibrium, and the coupling constraints on the CC actions. To solve the model, a hybrid computational strategy combining evolutionary algorithm and interior-point method is developed. The solution process consists of globally searching the critical feasible region and locally optimizing the operating variables in the found region, the two procedures interact iteratively to progressively tighten the solution region leading to the final solution. The proposed model and computational strategy are demonstrated on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. To speed up the computation, parallel processing of the approach is implemented.

Abstract: A novel fault-tolerant configuration of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) for wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) is proposed in this paper for the seamless operation during all kinds of grid faults. The proposed configuration is developed by replacing the traditional six-switch grid-side converter (GSC) of DFIG with a nine-switch converter. With the additional three switches, the nine-switch converter can provide six independent output terminals. One set of three output terminals are connected to the grid through interfacing inductors to realize normal GSC operation while, the other set of three output terminals are connected to neutral side of the stator windings to provide fault ride-through (FRT) capability to the DFIG. An appropriate control algorithm is developed for the proposed configuration that: 1) achieves seamless fault ride-through during any kind of grid faults and 2) strictly satisfies new grid codes requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed configuration in riding through different kind of faults is evaluated through detailed simulation studies on a 1.5-MW WECS.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated methodology that considers renewable distributed generation (RDG) and demand responses (DR) as options for planning distribution systems in a transition towards low-carbon sustainability. It is assumed that demand responsiveness is enabled by real-time pricing (RTP), and the problem has been formulated as a dynamic two-stage model. It co-optimizes the allocation of renewables [including wind and solar photovoltaic (PV)], non-renewable DG units (gas turbines) and smart metering (SM) simultaneously with network reinforcement for minimizing the total economic and carbon-emission costs over planning horizons. The behavior compliance to RTP is described through a nodal-based DR model, in which the fading effect attended during the load recovery is highlighted. Besides, uncertainties associated with renewable energy generation and price-responsiveness of customers are also taken into account and represented by multiple probabilistic scenarios. The proposed methodology is implemented by employing an efficient hybrid algorithm and applied to a typical distribution test system. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in improving the efficiency of RDG operations and mitigating CO footprint of distribution systems, when compared with the conventional planning paradigms.

Abstract: In most practical cases, traditional methods for assessing the reliability of substations, separately from the electric power network, are not sufficient to a good understanding of the system performance and possible reinforcements. This paper presents a new methodology to evaluate the criticality of electrical substations taking into account their possible operating states, associate probabilities, and consequences on the static and dynamic performance of the electric power system. Two complementary reliability indices are proposed to express the dynamic security and static adequacy levels that a substation provides to the power grid. An application in a test system is presented and the substation criticality ranking is provided and discussed.

Abstract: A reliability study has been carried out recently to find out whether the use of a mobile unit substation (MUS) in redundant customer delivery systems is justified from the economic point of view when the station two companion transformers fail randomly. The transformer failures can be short or long depending on the nature of failure. The study uses a probabilistic method based on Markov models in assessing the benefit of MUS when the two transformers are not in service. The calculated benefit from the MUS is then compared with the cost of carrying the MUS to see whether the MUS is justified or not. The purpose of this paper is to describe the study assessment methodology, its assumption and the study findings.

Abstract: The widespread use of distributed generations (DGs) in utility distribution feeders is a trend, and it brings about several challenges to the operation, planning, and design of general distribution networks. In this paper, a comprehensive tool, Continuation Distribution Power Flow (CDFLOW), is presented and evaluated. CDFLOW can be used for tracing steady-state stationary behaviors of general unbalanced distribution systems due to various types of power injection variations, including high penetration of DGs. The major computation engine behind CDFLOW is the continuation method. Major components, either balanced or unbalanced, grounded or ungrounded, are well modeled in CDFLOW. A detailed description of CDFLOW and its implementation regarding the predictor, corrector, adaptive step-size control and parameterizations are presented. For illustrative purposes, CDFLOW was applied to the IEEE 8500-node test system and a practical 1103-node distribution networks with promising results.

Abstract: A Weierstrass-based numerical method for computing damping torque of a 3-machine power system during transient period is proposed and evaluated. Numerical studies were performed to demonstrate mutual impacts of generators on the damping torque, when one of the generators is presented by a detailed model. The relationship between the averaged self-damping torque coefficient of the detailed model and the damping coefficient of the classical model is numerically studied. One interesting observation from our studies is that the damping torque coefficients tend to become zero at the end of transient stability period if all the generators are represented by the detailed model. This observation can be useful to determine the duration of transient stability period. One application of the proposed Weierstrass-based method is to determine appropriate and accurate damping terms for power system dynamic simulation.

Abstract: The integration of non-dispatchable generation has led to a change in the dynamics of primary frequency response. This change, mostly driven by the limited contribution of non-dispatchable generation to both total system inertia and governor response, may deteriorate the performance of current practices for determining primary reserves to the extend that real time operation reliability may no longer be ensured. This work establishes sufficient conditions for ensuring primary response adequacy through ex-ante dispatch instructions. A simplified dynamic model of primary frequency response (including system inertia, system governors' ramp rates, and dead bands) is developed to formulate a constraint suitable for an OPF framework. A simulation of ERCOT is presented to test the proposed formulation.

Abstract: This paper develops a methodology for optimizing the hydro unit commitment (HUC) for the Three Gorges Project (TGP) in China. The TGP is the world's largest and most complex hydropower system in operation. The objective is to minimize the total operational cost. The decision variables are the startup or shutdown of each of the available units in the system and the power releases from the online units. The mathematical formulation must take into account the head variation over the operation periods as the net head changes from hour to hour and affects power generation. Additionally, the formulation must consider the operation of 32 heterogeneous generating units and the nonlinear power generation function of each unit. A three-dimensional interpolation technique is used to accurately represent the nonlinear power generation function of each individual unit, taking into account the time-varying head as well as the non-smooth limitations for power output and power release. With the aid of integer variables that represent the on/off and operation partition statuses of a unit, the developed HUC model for the TGP conforms to a standard mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. We demonstrate the performance and utility of the model by analyzing the results from several scenarios for the TGP.

Abstract: Demand response programs incentivize loads to actively moderate their energy consumption to aid the power system. Uncertainty is an intrinsic aspect of demand response because a load's capability is often unknown until the load has been deployed. Algorithms must therefore balance utilizing well-characterized, good loads and learning about poorly characterized but potentially good loads; this is a manifestation of the classical tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We address this tradeoff in a restless bandit framework, a generalization of the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. The formulation yields index policies in which loads are ranked by a scalar index, and those with the highest are deployed. The policy is particularly appropriate for demand response because the indices have explicit analytical expressions that may be evaluated separately for each load, making them both simple and scalable. This formulation serves as a heuristic basis for when only the aggregate effect of demand response is observed, from which the state of each individual load must be inferred. We formulate a tractable, analytical approximation for individual state inference based on observations of aggregate load curtailments. In numerical examples, the restless bandit policy outperforms the greedy policy by 5%-10% of the total cost. When the states of deployed loads are inferred from aggregate measurements, the resulting performance degradation is on the order of a few percent for the (now heuristic) restless bandit policy.

An efficiency-oriented fitness assignment strategy based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to guide the iteration process of evolutionary algorithm (EA). Case studies show that the most efficient DMUs for reactive power dispatch can be successfully found by the EREA, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed EREA algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to compute linear sensitivity distribution factors (DFs) in near real-time. The method does not rely on the system power flow model. Instead, it uses only high-frequency synchronized data collected from phasor measurement units to estimate the injection shift factors through linear least-squares estimation, after which other DFs can be easily computed. Such a measurement-based approach is desirable since it is adaptive to changes in system operating point and topology. We further improve the adaptability of the proposed approach to such changes by using weighted and recursive least-squares estimation. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed DF estimation approach over the conventional model-based one in the context of contingency analysis and generation re-dispatch.

Abstract: Conventional power system security analysis based on multiple case studies cannot predict all operational states and hence neither guarantees an adequate security margin nor an economical operation for the power system. Based on the trend analysis method which is used in the field of economics, this paper introduces the concept and a methodology for "trend security analysis" of power systems. This method utilizes the load profile forecast and the contingency occurrence probability and determines the system security trend in the subsequent time window. Based on a recursive algorithm which is developed by utilizing the higher order derivatives of power flow equations, this paper also presents a method for fast determination of the trend variations of the system states and security indices. Three IEEE test systems are used to demonstrate the applications of the proposed concepts, evaluate their performance and verify their accuracy.

Abstract: Wind power has become one of the most prominent renewable energy applications in the power industry. Its annual installation is continuously setting a record high. Due to the large portion of generation mix within the system, it is desirable to operate wind power under the automatic generation control (AGC). This issue also raises another concern on the modeling of wind farms under AGC. The traditional way of portraying wind farm production in simulation is to use an aggregated wind turbine model that is generally operated in maximum power point tracking (MPPT). This approach is not suitable for wind's participation in AGC. Therefore, more studies should be done to investigate how the individual wind turbines affect the wind farm performance under the set-point operation. This paper first illustrates the controllability of wind turbines under the set-point control. Following that, a comprehensive guidance of wind generator modeling is demonstrated to yield different approaches for developing the wind farm model. Two types of wind farm models are derived and demonstrated to portray the capability of set-point tracking under the intermittent wind condition. Associated simulations are presented and compared to show the different characteristics of these two wind farm models in depicting the set-point operation under AGC.

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of gas-turbine-based generation technologies have traditionally been introduced in unit commitment problems by means of simplified formulations (such as the approach of including an additional energy cost adder component). We argue that, in the new context characterized by the increasing need for cycling operation, such simplified approaches do not realistically reflect the impact that these new operation regimes have on the O&M costs for both open and combined cycle gas turbines. We first review the role of the so-called long-term service agreements (LTSA), which is a commonly used type of contract offered by gas-turbine manufacturers to plant owners. We analyze how these contracts implicitly determine the maintenance intervals as a function of the operating regime, and, as a consequence, determine the impact of cycling operation on O&M costs. Based on this analysis, we develop a formulation based on linear constraints that makes possible a realistic modeling of O&M costs (as defined in LTSA contracts) in the unit commitment problem. This formulation is then tested using some examples, so as to illustrate how a proper modeling of these contracts significantly changes the scheduling resulting from the traditional unit commitment problem formulation.

Abstract: A stochastic modeling and simulation technique for analyzing impacts of electric vehicles charging demands on distribution network is proposed in this paper. Different from the previous deterministic approaches, the feeder daily load models, electric vehicle start charging time, and battery state of charge used in the impact study are derived from actual measurements and survey data. Distribution operation security risk information, such as over-current and under-voltage, is obtained from three-phase distribution load flow studies that use stochastic parameters drawn from Roulette wheel selection. Voltage and congestion impact indicators are defined and a comparison of the deterministic and stochastic analytical approaches in providing information required in distribution network reinforcement planning is presented. Numerical results illustrate the capability of the proposed stochastic models in reflecting system losses and security impacts due to electric vehicle integrations. The effectiveness of a controlled charging algorithm aimed at relieving the system operation problem is also presented.

Abstract: This paper presents an equally constrained robust estimator of both the state and the transformer tap positions of a power system able to withstand all types of outliers, including bad leverage points and erroneous zero-injections. The statistical robustness of the estimator stems from the application of the Schweppe-type Huber GM estimator (SHGM) while its numerical robustness originates from the use of an orthogonal iteratively re-weighted least-squares algorithm together with the Van Loan's method for processing the equality constraints. The good performance of the new estimator, termed EC-SHGM estimator for short, is demonstrated on a small test system and on the Brazilian Southern power system with increasing size ranging from 139 buses to 1916 buses. It is shown that it exhibits superior convergence properties in all tested cases while the WLS method may suffer from numerical instabilities or even divergence problems when large weights are assigned to zero power injections modeling false information.

Abstract: This paper proves the practicality of an iterative algorithm for solving realistic large-scale security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problems. This algorithm is based on the combination of a contingency filtering scheme, used to identify the binding contingencies at the optimum, and a network compression method, used to reduce the complexity of the post-contingency models included in the SCOPF formulation. We show that by combining these two complementary ideas, it is possible to solve in a reasonable time SCOPF problems on large power system models with a large number of contingencies. Unlike most results reported for large-scale SCOPF problems, our algorithm uses a nonlinear AC network model in both pre-contingency and post-contingency states, optimizes both active/reactive powers flows jointly, and treats the discrete variables. The proposed algorithm is implemented with state-of-the-art solvers and applied to two systems: a national grid with 2563 buses and 1297 contingencies, and a model of the European transmission network with 9241 buses and 12 000 contingencies.

Abstract: This paper compares the IEEE-specified generator models such as the equivalent circuit (EC) models and the operational inductance (OI) models to understand their damping performances in the IEEE first-benchmark system for subsynchronous resonance study. These models are found to differ from one another only to an extent they accurately represent the standard transfer functions. By carrying out different case studies an effort is made to analyze the influence of these differences among the models on the damping performance of swing-mode and torsional modes. Through a detailed eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulations, it is demonstrated that these models offer differing results with respect to swing-mode, thereby strongly influencing the power system stabilizer (PSS) performances, especially when the system is series compensated. Even the torsional mode interactions are found to exhibit dependency on the models employed for the generators. Such a study is expected to provide better insight into the behavior of generator models and controller design/tuning in system analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to analyze the mechanism of torsional interaction (TI) and its solution for series-capacitor-compensated power systems. The relationship between the oscillation of the generator shaft and the consequent electromagnetic torque is deduced by a time-domain analysis. It is revealed that the subsynchronous currents caused by torsional oscillations provide negative damping electromagnetic torque and are the cause of TI. A family of subsynchronous dampers (SSDs) is proposed, which is based on the controlled injection of super-synchronous and subsynchronous damping currents into the generator stator. The design procedure of subsynchronous damping controller (SSDC) of series SSD is elaborated. Eigenvalue analysis and simulations for the IEEE first benchmark model (FBM) have verified the effectiveness of the proposed SSDs in solving the multimodal subsynchronous resonance problem.

Abstract: In this paper, a flexible optimization-based framework for intentional islanding is presented. The decision is made of which transmission lines to switch in order to split the network while minimizing disruption, the amount of load shed, or grouping coherent generators. The approach uses a piecewise linear model of AC power flow, which allows the voltage and reactive power to be considered directly when designing the islands. Demonstrations on standard test networks show that solution of the problem provides islands that are balanced in real and reactive power, satisfy AC power flow laws, and have a healthy voltage profile.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel iterative approach to contingency filtering for corrective security-constrained optimal power flow (CSCOPF) problems that include conflicting contingencies. The rescheduling index (the minimum of the maximal controllable rescheduling value in the post-contingency state) becomes the filtering index in a modified CSCOPF (MCSCOPF) model designed to deal with conflicting contingencies. Moreover, a decomposed parallel interior point method (DPIPM) is developed to factorize the primal-dual system into blocks according to contingency scenarios and compute these blocks with a coarse-grained parallelism. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by solving for conflicting contingencies in a standard testing system and a real-world system.

Abstract: This paper presents a set of linear control designs for shaping the inter-area oscillation spectrum of a large radial power system through coordinated control of a wind farm and a battery energy system (BES). We consider a continuum representation of the power system with the wind and battery power modeled as point-source forcings. A spectral analysis of the system demonstrates that its oscillation spectrum strongly depends on the locations of these power injections, implying that there are siting locations that produce more favorable spectral responses. However, the ability to site a wind farm or BES at a specific location may be limited by geographic, environmental, economic or other considerations. Our work provides a means to circumvent this problem by designing co-ordinated controllers for the power outputs of the wind farm and the BES by which one can shape the spectral response of the system to a desired response. The design is posed as a parametric optimization problem that minimizes the error between the two spectral responses over a finite range of frequencies. The approach is independent of the locations of the wind farm and the BES, and can be implemented in a decentralized fashion.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that further integration of wind and solar resources into the power grid will increase the demand for regulation and load following. The purpose of this letter is to investigate an important aspect of using energy storages for providing regulation: The short-term energy restoration of such limited energy resources (LERs) coincides with load following operations and could therefore lead to higher load following requirements. We therefore analyze the impact of corresponding scheduling approaches on load following energy and capacity using stochastic simulations. In particular, we compare the load following impact of a basic control strategy proposed by the stakeholders of the Independent System Operator in California (CAISO) to a strategy that attempts to manage the energy level of LERs such that their impact on load following requirements is optimal. Our results show that such smart state of charge management could even reduce the demand for load following while satisfying the full regulation demand in the CAISO control region.

Abstract: Existing mode meter algorithms were derived with the assumption that load variations are accurately represented by white noise or an integral of white noise, which may not be satisfied in actual power systems. This paper proposes a mode meter algorithm which relaxes this assumption by explicitly taking into account spectral load characteristics. These characteristics can be either measured or estimated using the inverse of the existing power system model. The method is developed assuming an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model of the system and incorporating estimated correlations between loads as inputs and synchrophasor measurements as outputs. Performances of the proposed method are compared with the Yule-Walker and N4SID methods using simulated synchrophasor data obtained from the KTH Nordic 32 test system. Finally, the effects of measurement noise on the proposed method are analyzed, as well as the effects of model uncertainty when the power system model is used to determine spectral load characteristics. It is shown that the proposed algorithm increases accuracy in mode estimates when the loads are described with nonwhite noise.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new adaptive control strategy for a wind energy conversion system based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator and a pulse-width modulated current source converter. Most of the studies on wind farms are based on double fed induction technology. Nevertheless, the proposed conversion system is a good alternative due to its high efficiency and reliability. Electrolytic capacitors are not required in this type of converter and the voltage in the DC-link as well as the generated reactive power can be dynamically modified according to the wind velocity, being even negative if required. However, it is challenging from the control and stability standpoint. Capacitive filters placed on the AC side, which are required for safe commutation, can create resonances with the power grid. Reactive power is generated according to the capacity of the converter, the wind velocity and the load profile. The adaptive control strategy uses an adaptive PI which is self-tuned based on a linear approximation of the power system calculated at each sample time. A model reference is also proposed in order to reduce the post-fault voltages. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new computational intelligence-based control strategy, to enhance the low voltage ride-through capability of grid-connected wind turbines (WTs) with doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs). Grid codes world-wide require that WTs should supply reactive power to the grid during and after the fault, in order to support the grid voltage. The conventional crowbar-based systems that were initially applied in order to protect the rotor-side converter at the occurrence of grid faults, do not fulfill this requirement, as during the connection of the crowbar, the DFIG behaves as a squirrel cage machine, absorbing reactive power from the grid. This drawback led to the design of control systems that eliminate or even avoid the use of the crowbar. In order to conform to the above-mentioned requirement, this paper proposes a coordinated control strategy of the DFIG converters during a grid fault, managing to ride-through the fault without the use of any auxiliary hardware. The coordination of the two controllers is achieved via a fuzzy controller which is properly tuned using genetic algorithms. To validate the proposed control strategy, a case study of a 1.5-MW DFIG supplying a relatively weak electrical system is carried out by simulation.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable forecast of wind power is essential to power system operation and control. However, due to the nonstationarity of wind power series, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, leading to increased uncertainties and risks for system operation. This paper proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation. To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identified with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation with a high potential for practical applications in power systems.

Abstract: A newly proposed oscillation energy analysis method for power system low frequency oscillation is further developed. The oscillation energy flow in a generator and the energy dissipations of the field winding and the damper winding are studied. The oscillation energy flows into the field winding and the damper winding actually correspond to the electric energy transferred to the windings. The average powers of energy dissipation for oscillation modes with different frequencies are decoupled. For an individual mode, the energy dissipation of generator is computed using eigenvector and energy dissipation coefficient is obtained. The real-part of eigenvalue is negatively proportional to the sum of energy dissipation coefficients of all generators. It means the composite damping of the system comes from the energy dissipations of all generators. Especially in the single-machine system, the energy dissipation coefficient is equal to the damping torque coefficient. The consistency of oscillation energy analysis with damping torque analysis and modal analysis is verified. The energy dissipation leads to a new understanding of damping in power system and can be used for quantitative evaluation of generator damping in both offline and online applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a chronological probability model of photovoltaic (PV) generation on the basis of conditional probability and nonparametric kernel density estimation. In addition to randomness of PV power, the correlation of PV powers between adjacent time points and the uncertainty of start and end moments of PV output can be represented. The proposed model can be employed to produce random PV power time series curve using a stochastic sampling method. The power data of three PV generators in different regions with distinct weather conditions and 34-node distribution network are used to demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness, and adaptability of the presented model.

Abstract: The integration of wind power requires additional operating reserves to cope with the uncertainty in power system operation. Previous research shows that the uncertainty of the wind power forecast varies with the level of its output. Therefore, allocating reserves dynamically according to the specific distribution of the wind power forecast would benefit system scheduling. This paper presents a statistical model to formulate the conditional distribution of forecast error for multiple wind farms using copula theory. The proposed model is tested using a set of synchronous data of wind power and its day-ahead forecast. It is then utilized in a stochastic unit commitment model to simulate the day-ahead and real-time scheduling of the modified IEEE RTS-79 system integrating wind power. The results show that scheduling reserves dynamically according to the modeled conditional forecast error reduces the probability of reserve deficiency while maintaining the same level of operating costs.

Abstract: The application of energy storage (ES) in power system is limited due to the high cost of the ES device, which exponentially increases with its capacity. This paper is to improve the saturation-dependent stability of the power system equipped with the energy storage based damping controller (ESDC), and hence, reduce the required size of the ES. The phenomenon that the capacity of ES is smaller than the required value produced by the ESDC, is modeled as actuator saturation using the saturation function. The proposed method is to design an anti-windup compensator (AWC), which in the event of saturation, produces a signal based on the output difference between the ESDC and saturated ES and then augment the signal to the ESDC to alleviate the adverse effect of saturation. The AWC is designed with the reduced-order model of power system and linear matrix inequality. Detailed design procedure is introduced. Case studies based on a modified 4-machine 2-area power system and 10-machine New England power system are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AWC design method.

Abstract: Integration of renewable energy sources and demand response poses new challenges to system operators as they increase the uncertainty of the power supply and demand. Recently, robust optimization techniques are applied to the unit commitment problem with uncertainty as an alternative to the stochastic programming approaches. However, it remains challenging to solve the robust unit commitment model with full transmission line constraints. In this paper, we propose novel acceleration techniques for solving two-stage robust unit commitment problem with consideration of full transmission line constraints. We use 1) the cutting-plane algorithm for the master problem, which dynamically includes critical transmission line constraints, and 2) column-generation methods, including the branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm and heuristic approaches, for the subproblems, which add only necessary transmission line dual variables on the fly. Computational results for the modified IEEE 118-bus system show that the combination of the cutting-plane algorithm and the heuristic column-generation approach greatly reduces the total solution time of the two-stage robust unit commitment problem.

Abstract: This paper examines the feasibility of coordinating variable-speed wind farms with other power system devices, such as flexible ac transmission systems and synchronous generators, to damp low-frequency oscillations. For this purpose, an observer-based state-feedback approach is used to build a power oscillation damping (POD) controller, implemented through coordinated actions of multiple control devices, and able to manage several measurement channels. The wide-area POD controller also presents a time-delay compensation stage to mitigate adverse effects of latency involved in wide-area communication systems. Several practical issues are discussed and analyzed, such as measurement and control selection, model-order reduction, transmission time-delay compensation, impact of the POD control on wind farms, and robustness aspects. The control performance is evaluated and compared with other control schemes using eigenvalue analyses and nonlinear time-domain simulations over a wide range of operating conditions, for example, severe system faults, N - 1 outage contingencies, load/generation shedding, and line tripping.

Abstract: With the growing trend of extreme weather events in the Northeast U.S., a region of dense vegetation, evaluating hazard effects of wind storms on power distribution systems becomes increasingly important for disaster preparedness and fast responses in utilities. In this paper, probabilistic wind storm models for the study region have been built by mining 160-year storm events recorded in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic basin hurricane database (HURDAT). Further, wind storms are classified into six categories according to NOAA criteria and IEEE standard to facilitate the evaluation of distribution system responses under different levels of hazards. The impacts of wind storms in all categories are accurately evaluated through a Sequential Monte Carlo method enhanced by a temporal wind storm sampling strategy. Extensive studies for the selected typical distribution system indicate that our models and methods effectively reveal the hazardous effects of wind storms in the study region, leading to useful insights towards building better system hardening schemes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology for evaluation of risk of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) in meshed compensated AC networks. The developed methodology takes into account the severity of SSR problem in different network configurations caused by fixed series compensation and probabilistic behavior of the power systems due to random outages of the lines. SSR risk evaluation considers severity of SSR problem, probabilities of different network configurations for different contingencies and different operating conditions of turbine generator. Probability of each contingency is determined through line outage model while the probabilities of different operating conditions are calculated from multilevel load duration curve. Using developed risk matrix, it is demonstrated that the degree of risk of SSR that the generators in the network are exposed to can be evaluated for different network configurations, different contingencies and different line compensation levels.

Abstract: This paper applies recently developed mixed-integer programming (MIP) tools to the problem of optimal siting and sizing of distributed generators in a distribution network. We investigate the merits of three MIP approaches for finding good installation plans: a full AC power flow approach, a linear DC power flow approximation, and a nonlinear DC power flow approximation with quadratic loss terms, each augmented with integer generator placement variables. A genetic algorithm-based approach serves as a baseline for the comparison. A simple knapsack problem method involving generator selection is presented for determining lower bounds on the optimal design objective. Solution methods are outlined, and computational results show that the MIP methods, while lacking the speed of the genetic algorithm, can find improved solutions within conservative time requirements and provide useful information on optimality.

Abstract: Reducing the fossil fuel consumption of aluminum smelting production, which consumes around 8% of electricity annually, is of great significance for China's energy sector. One possible solution is to integrate wind power as supply for aluminum smelter loads. Based on this background, this paper studies an actual industrial case-an isolated power system for aluminum production with integrated wind penetration levels as high as 30%. However, due to the integration of wind power, frequency stability issues become critical in such a system. Therefore, a demand-side frequency control scheme responding to frequency deviations of the system is proposed in this paper to control the load power of aluminum smelters. The scheme is designed based on the relationship between the DC voltage supply for aluminum smelting loads and the commutation voltage drop which can be adjusted by changing the inductance value of the saturable reactors. Finally, simulations under both N-1 and N-2 contingency scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme considering various wind power outputs.

Abstract: Since wind at the earth's surface has an intrinsically complex and stochastic nature, accurate wind power forecasts are necessary for the safe and economic use of wind energy. In this paper, we investigated a combination of numeric and probabilistic models: a Gaussian process (GP) combined with a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was applied to wind-power forecasting up to one day ahead. First, the wind-speed data from NWP was corrected by a GP, then, as there is always a defined limit on power generated in a wind turbine due to the turbine controlling strategy, wind power forecasts were realized by modeling the relationship between the corrected wind speed and power output using a censored GP. To validate the proposed approach, three real-world datasets were used for model training and testing. The empirical results were compared with several classical wind forecast models, and based on the mean absolute error (MAE), the proposed model provides around 9% to 14% improvement in forecasting accuracy compared to an artificial neural network (ANN) model, and nearly 17% improvement on a third dataset which is from a newly-built wind farm for which there is a limited amount of training data.

Abstract: Power losses estimation under time-varying distributed generation (DG) conditions usually demands several power flow simulations, which is a time-consuming task. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a method that uses the information of only one (base case) power flow to estimate the total power losses of distribution networks for any new DG condition. The method is based on the second-order power flow sensitivities, which are suitable to model the nonlinear nature of power losses. As a result, the method has the potential to speed up the solution of power losses reduction optimization problems, such as DG allocation problems, in which several DG configurations need to be considered. Moreover, a practical index is proposed to quantify the responsibility of each DG for the total power losses in a multi-DG scenario. The test results verified the validity of the proposed concept and method.

Abstract: In a new environment of energy deregulation, the locational marginal price (LMP) basis is overwhelming congestion management issues. But it still requires proper ancillary services to serve the system. Load frequency control (LFC) is needed to maintain the system frequency in the dynamic environment. In this letter, an efficient LFC approach with the critical load level (CLL)-based adaptive participation factor is proposed for an LMP-based market. The CLL is considered when the load varies from the generation set point. The proposed approach could enhance the LFC performance in securely following up the aggressive change of energy demand. The PJM 5-bus system is used to illustrate the proposed LFC.

Abstract: The loss of stability-an instability-can become a critical cause of emergent cascading outages leading to wide-spread blackouts. Penetration of renewable energy sources makes the problem of instability more urgent because of the highly fluctuating nature of such sources. Here we show a data-based approach to stability assessment of power systems without models. This approach is enabled by Koopman mode analysis for nonlinear dynamical systems, which detects an instability based on the properties of the point spectrum of the Koopman operator. We apply the technique to data on physical power flows sampled from the two major accidents, the 2011 Arizona-Southern California grid outage and the 2006 system disturbance of the European interconnected grid, and successfully detect unstable power flow patterns that govern the complex dynamics occurring during the accidents.

Abstract: Transient stability simulation studies of large-scale power systems often generate large amounts of data. This can make it difficult for power system planners to understand the overall system response or to identify portions of the system with unusual signals. In this paper we present a novel approach that utilizes clustering to extract common features in the voltage magnitude and frequency response signals, and to identify outliers. The geographic visualization of the results is also discussed. Results are demonstrated using the IEEE 118-bus system and a 16 000-bus real-world system model.

Abstract: Telecontrol of distribution switching devices is recognized as a major means for reducing interruption duration after a fault occurrence in modern distribution systems, since it allows one to isolate the faulted sections and to restore the healthy ones as quickly as possible. In order to reduce interruption frequency as well, it is necessary to increase the number of series automatic circuit breakers. Further benefits in terms of service continuity improvement can be obtained by allowing islanded operation of relatively small portions of distribution network (microgrids) in the presence of distributed energy resources in order to supply the local load autonomously during upstream faults. This paper aims to describe an innovative systematic method and its related analytical formulation to evaluate distribution system reliability indices accounting for advanced operation practices such as those based on telecontrol and islanding.

Abstract: This paper presents a new uncertainty handling framework for optimal generation expansion planning (GEP) amalgamating the notions of single-stage and two-stage robust optimization (RO). The proposed multiyear robust GEP methodology, as a tractable mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, copes with the inherent planning uncertainties associated with forecasted electricity load demand, as well as estimated investment and operation costs through distribution-free bounded intervals producing polyhedral uncertainty sets. The optimal generation expansion plan obtained from the proposed RO approach is immunized against worst-case planning uncertainties considering the adopted degree of conservatism for each uncertainty set. Therefore, the proposed methodology is capable of controlling the robustness of the optimal investment schedule regarding the enforced planning uncertainties. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed RO framework throughout GEP studies.

Abstract: A multi-objective (MO) optimization approach is proposed in this letter to develop optimal transmission switching strategies with minimal generating cost and maximal probabilistic reliability. The problem is solved via an evolutionary algorithm together with Monte Carlo simulation to capture the probabilistic nature of system component failures. The numerical results show that the identified quasi Pareto-optimal solutions can provide insights into the trade-off between generating cost and system reliability considering transmission switching.

Abstract: In order to implement distributed control of an electric power distribution system, typically a feeder is first partitioned into control areas. In this work, an analytical partitioning method based on capacitor reactive power domains is presented. Once partitioned, a distributed control algorithm is employed to support distribution operation applications with a focus on voltage spread reduction. The partitioning method is also applied to the commonly studied capacitor control objective of loss minimization. Simulation results applying the method to a real-world distribution feeder are presented and compared with an alternate geographically-based partitioning method. Results show the analytical partitioning and distributed control methodology is capable of producing high quality solutions to the capacitor control problem.

Abstract: The ability of load to respond to short-term variations in electricity prices plays an increasingly important role in balancing short-term supply and demand, especially during peak periods and in dealing with fluctuations in renewable energy supplies. However, price responsive load has not been included in standard models for defining the optimal scheduling of generation units in short-term. Here, elasticities are included to adjust the demand profile in response to price changes, including cross-price elasticities that account for load shifts among hours. The resulting peak reductions and valley fill alter the optimal unit commitment. Enhancing demand response also increases the amount of wind power that can be economically injected. Further, wind power uncertainty can be managed at a lower cost by adjusting electricity consumption in case of wind forecast errors, which is another way in which demand response facilitates the integration of intermittent renewables.

Abstract: This paper presents a new control topology to enable effective integration of voltage source converters (VSCs) in weak grids. The controller has two main parts. The first part is a linear power-damping and synchronizing controller which automatically synchronizes a VSC to a grid by providing damping and synchronizing power components, and enables effective full power injection even under very weak grid conditions. The controller adopts cascaded angle, frequency and power loops for frequency and angle regulation. The controller emulates the dynamic performance of synchronous machines, which eases grid integration and provides a virtual inertia control framework for VSCs to damp power and frequency oscillations. Although the linear controller offers stable and smooth operation in many cases, it cannot ensure system stability in weak grids, where sudden large disturbances rapidly drift system dynamics to the nonlinear region. To overcome this difficulty, a supplementary nonlinear controller is developed to assist the linear controller and enhance system performance under large-signal nonlinear disturbances, such as self-synchronization, disturbances in grid frequency and angle, high power injection in very weak grids and fault-ride-through conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach for hybrid power system static state estimation (SE) in the presence of phasor measurement units (PMUs) is presented. The proposed PMU-based SE takes into account existing time correlation in the PMU measurements. The PMU time series of measurements are modeled by short memory autoregressive (AR) models over short time periods. The correlation existing between PMU measurements at different buses is included using vector or multichannel AR models. The effectiveness and improved performance of the proposed PMU-based SE is demonstrated through a comparison analysis with practical hybrid SE methods. A theoretical analysis highlights the improvement over long execution periods of SE and high PMU sampling rates. Finally, a practical comparison is carried out on results from simulated Monte Carlo runs on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus test beds.

Abstract: Recent applications of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem offers a polynomial time method to compute a global optimum for a large subclass of OPF problems. In contrast, prior OPF solution methods in the literature guarantee only local optimality for the solution produced. However, solvers employing SDP relaxation remain significantly slower than mature OPF solution codes. This letter seeks to combine the advantages of the two methods. In particular, we develop an SDP-inspired sufficient condition test for global optimality of a candidate OPF solution. This test may then be easily applied to a candidate solution generated by a traditional, only-guaranteed-locally-optimal OPF solver.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new separable model for the unit commitment (UC) problem and three deterministic global optimization methods for it ensuring convergence to the global optimum within a desired tolerance. By decomposing a multivariate function into several univariate functions, a tighter outer approximation methodology that can be used to improve the outer approximations of several classical convex programming techniques is presented. Based on the idea of the outer approximation (OA) method and the proposed separable model, an outer-inner approximation (OIA) approach is also presented to solve this new formulation of UC problem. In this OIA approach, the UC problem is decomposed into a tighter outer approximation subproblem and an inner approximation subproblem, where the former leads to a better lower bound than the OA method, and the later provides a better upper bound. The simulation results for systems of up to 100 units with 24 h are compared with those of previously published methods, which show that the OIA approach is very promising due to the excellent performance. The proposed approaches are also applied to the large-scale systems of up to 1000 units with 24 h, and systems of up to 100 units with 96 h and 168 h.

Abstract: When a short-circuit fault occurs in a distribution network, speed and reactive power consumption of an induction generator (IG) increase dramatically, which may cause system transient stability problems. This paper proposes an improved steady-state equivalent circuit method to determine transient stability of a distribution system or a micro-grid with multiple IGs. Interaction between IGs and distribution network during a fault is investigated. The relationship between network parameters and speeds of IGs is derived using the steady-state equivalent circuits of IGs. The critical speed and critical fault clearing time (CCT) for maintaining system stability are determined using the proposed technique. The factors, which affect transient stability of a multi-IG distribution system, are investigated. The correctness of the proposed method is verified using dynamic simulation.

Abstract: Due to the variety of distribution generation (DG) sizes and technologies connecting to distribution networks, and the concerns associated with out-of phase reclosing, anti-islanding continues to be an issue where no clear solution exists. This paper presents an autoground approach that was proposed in the context of an IEEE working group on best practices for DG protection. A prototype system was constructed using standard distribution apparatus and a recloser controller, and it was tested on the utility's distribution test line. Results show that the anti-islanding detection time is approximately a cycle longer than the delay associated with application of the autoground. Once the autoground was applied, the DG was disconnected within 1 cycle on overcurrent protection. The solution is inherently scalable, applicable to all DG types, is configurable to various reclosing practices and does not require additional equipment or settings changes at the producer's site.

Abstract: This paper introduces load shed recovery actions for transmission networks by presenting the dc optimal load shed recovery with transmission switching model (DCOLSR-TS). The model seeks to reduce the amount of load shed, which may result due to transmission line and/or generator contingencies, by modifying the bulk power system topology. Since solving DCOLSR-TS is computationally difficult, the current work also develops a heuristic (MIP-H), which improves the system topology while specifying the required sequence of switching operations. Experimental results on a list of N-1 and N-2 critical contingencies of the IEEE 118-bus test case demonstrate the advantages of utilizing MIP-H for both online load shed recovery and recurring contingency- response analysis. This is reinforced by the introduction of a parallelized version of the heuristic (Par-MIP-H), which solves the list of critical contingencies close to 5x faster than MIP-H with 8 cores and up to 14x faster with increased computational resources. The current work also tests MIP-H on a real-life, large-scale network in order to measure the computational performance of this tool on a real-world implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a profit-maximizing offering strategy for a price taker power producer participating in the day-ahead spot market as organized under the Power Exchange model. The offering strategy maximizes profit by mitigating profit risk due to price forecast uncertainty leading to an imbalance arising from being accepted by the market operator (MO) to produce an infeasible dispatch schedule. The strategy makes use of a price forecast confidence interval to build hourly offer curves. The offering strategy is applied to realistic price scenarios as obtained from the Iberian MO. The performance is compared to alternative offering strategies using the agent-based OPTIMATE simulator. Results indicate that the offering strategy increases profit, reduces profit risk and reduces balancing costs arising from differences between the accepted and actual dispatch schedule. Consequently, the presented strategy outperforms the literature benchmark strategy in 83% of the cases.

Abstract: In this paper a new nonlinear excitation controller design to enhance transient stability of multimachine power systems is presented. Partial feedback linearization is first used to transform the nonlinear power system model into a partially linear systemcomprising a reduced-order linear part and a nonlinear dynamic autonomous part. Then a linear state feedback stabilizing controller is designed for the reduced-order linear part using optimal control theory to enhance the stability of the whole system. In this way, the performance of the stabilizing controller would be independent of the operating points of the power system and therefore is superior to those designed for completely linearized systems. It is shown that the controller design method ensures the stability of the nonlinear dynamic autonomous part. The design method is applicable to multimachine power systems but tested on a 3-machine 11-bus two-area test system. The performance of the proposed control scheme to large disturbances is evaluated, through computer simulation, and compared with a conventional power system stabilizer and an exact feedback linearizing controller.

Abstract: Planning distribution systems without considering the operation status of multiple distributed generation (DG) units could result in constraining the network, lowering the utilization of its assets and minimizing the total DG capacity that can be accommodated. In this paper, the impact of multiple DG configurations on the potential of active network management (ANM) schemes is firstly investigated. Secondly, the paper proposes a multi-configuration multi-period optimal power flow (OPF)-based technique (MMOPF) for assessing the maximum DG capacity under ANM schemes considering 1) variability of demand and generation profiles (multi-period scenarios), and 2) different operational status of DG units (multi-configurations). The results show that the availability of DGs at certain locations could critically impact the amount of DG capacity at other locations. If DGs are properly allocated and sized at certain locations up to the optimal limits, even with a "fit-and-forget" approach, the total connected DG capacity can be maximized, with minimum utilization of ANM schemes. However, exceeding these optimal limits may lead to minimizing the total DG penetration in the long term, impacting the system reliability due to the operational status of multiple DG units, and consequently, imposing more investments on ANM schemes to increase the amount of connected DG capacity.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement model considering power system controlled islanding so that the power network remains observable under controlled islanding condition as well as normal operation condition. The optimization objectives of proposed model are to minimize the number of installed PMUs and to maximize the measurement redundancy. These two objectives are combined together with a weighting variable so that the optimal solution with minimum PMU number and maximum measurement redundancy would be obtained from the model. To reduce the number of required PMUs, the effect of zero-injection bus is considered and incorporated into the model. Furthermore, additional constraints for maintaining observability following single PMU failure or line loss are also derived. At last, several IEEE standard systems and the Polish 2383-bus system are employed to test the presented model. Results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper deals with the management of voltage constraints in active distribution systems that host a significant amount of distributed generation (DG) units. To this end we propose a centralized optimization approach which aims at minimizing the amount of MW curtailment of non-firm DG to remove voltage constraints. The salient feature of this approach is that it comprehensively and properly models the full variety of possible control means (i.e., DG active/reactive power including DG shut-down, on load tap changing transformer ratio, shunt capacitor, and remotely controlled switches or breakers), most of which having a discrete behavior. We develop and compare the performances of two optimization models on a snapshot basis for various distribution systems up to 1089 buses. In particular we show that the use of remotely controlled switches so as to transfer DG between feeders in case of voltage constraints may lead to significant reduction of the DG curtailment.

Ramp-rate limits, prohibited operation zones (POZs) constraints, along with transmission losses are considered in the studied DED model. In order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is implemented on a 54-unit test system. The obtained results verify applicability of the proposed method for solving the DED problem in real-time environment.

Abstract: In recent development of ubiquitous computing on home energy management systems, additional IP-based data collection points are utilized to acquire electricity usage directly from consumers. As cybertampering can disrupt the accuracy of billing information, a well-structured cyberdefense mechanism is required to validate the availability and integrity of metering data for a customer billing center. This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time. The proposed framework is demonstrated to detect tampering activities using a realistic 12.47-kV distribution network. Results show that the data validation framework can accurately identify subsystems with tampered meters. This framework allows the system operator to restrict the search area to a manageable number of meters in a subsystem.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the accurate frequency estimation of power signals corrupted by a stationary white noise. The noneven item interpolation FFT based on the triangular self-convolution window is described. A simple analytical expression for the variance of noise contribution on the frequency estimation is derived, which shows the variances of frequency estimation are proportional to the energy of the adopted window. Based on the proposed method, the noise level of the measurement channel can be estimated, and optimal parameters (e. g., sampling frequency and window length) of the interpolation FFT algorithm that minimize the variances of frequency estimation can thus be determined. The application in a power quality analyzer verified the usefulness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents a new control strategy for voltage-source converters (VSCs) in the frequency-angle domain which enables dc-link voltage regulation via frequency and load angle adjustment. A major advantage of the proposed controller is emulating the behavior of synchronous machines (SMs) with proper regulation of dc-link voltage which eases integration of VSCs interfacing distributed and renewable generation units into ac systems in the presence of conventional SMs. A cascaded frequency, angle and virtual torque control topology is developed to emulate the mechanical behavior of an SM which offers synchronization power to eliminate the need for a phase-locked-loop after initial converter synchronization, and damping power dynamics to damp power oscillations; and presents frequency dynamics similar to SMs, thus it introduces some inertia to the grid. The controller presents high stability margin and fast dc-link voltage regulation, whereas it can provide frequency support in the ac-side during contingencies. Frequency and voltage amplitude are adjusted by two separate loops. Two different variants are proposed for dc-link voltage control; namely direct dc-link voltage control and indirect dc-link voltage control via a dc-link voltage controller. Small-signal dynamics, analysis, and design process are presented. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the controller effectiveness.

Abstract: Wide-area implementations of synchrophasors enable real-time monitoring of power system dynamic responses during disturbances. These disturbances generally excite oscillatory modes of the system which can become problematic if the modes are either poorly damped or negatively damped. This paper describes a Fourier based automatic ringdown analysis algorithm proposed for extracting dominant oscillatory modal content of power system responses from multiple synchrophasor measurements. This approach is well suited for detecting electromechanical oscillatory modes in real-time. The proposed method is shown to be robust under noisy conditions by testing with simulation data as well as real system data, and is able to extract multiple problematic oscillatory modes computationally fast.

Abstract: Validation and data quality improvement of phasor data through state estimation is the first step in ensuring that the synchrophasor data is useful for applications in monitoring, visualization, and control. This paper presents a phasor-measurement- based state estimator (PSE) for improving data consistency by identifying angle biases and current scaling errors in the phasor data using the augmented state vector approach. These errors can arise from issues with the Global Positioning Signal (GPS), timing circuits, instrument channels, and/or data channel scaling. The PSE is demonstrated using several sets of disturbance data from the Central New York Power System. The PSE can also provide estimates of line parameters and transformer tap ratios with sufficient measurement redundancy. Finally, the PSE allows the computation of interface power flows for disturbance and stability monitoring.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach implemented in MISO day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary service market clearing processes to address the reserve deliverability issue. In this approach, MISO enhanced the co-optimization process to incorporate post zonal reserve deployment transmission constraints. Reserves are procured within the co-optimization to meet both market-wide reserve requirements and ensure their deliverability on a zonal basis. As a result, zonal market clearing prices (MCPs) for reserves can properly reflect the effects of zonal reserve deployment on transmission constraints under consideration.

Abstract: This letter proposes a new merit order for the dispatch of stochastic production in forward markets (e.g., day-ahead markets). The proposed merit order considers not only the marginal cost of the stochastic generating unit, which is often very low or zero, but also the projected cost of balancing its energy deviations during the real-time operation of the power system. We show, through an illustrative example, that the proposed merit order leads to increased market efficiency as the penetration of stochastic generation in the electricity market grows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decision tree (DT)-based systematic approach for cooperative online power system dynamic security assessment (DSA) and preventive control. This approach adopts a new methodology that trains two contingency-oriented DTs on a daily basis by the databases generated from power system simulations. Fed with real-time wide-area measurements, one DT of measurable variables is employed for online DSA to identify potential security issues, and the other DT of controllable variables provides online decision support on preventive control strategies against those issues. A cost-effective algorithm is adopted in this proposed approach to optimize the trajectory of preventive control. The paper also proposes an importance sampling algorithm on database preparation for efficient DT training for power systems with high penetration of wind power and distributed generation. The performance of the approach is demonstrated on a 400-bus, 200-line operational model of western Danish power system.

Abstract: The security-constrained optimal power flow problem considers both the normal state and contingency constraints, and it is formulated as a large-scale nonconvex optimization problem. We propose a global optimization algorithm based on Lagrangian duality to solve the nonconvex problem to optimality. As usual, the global approach is often time-consuming, thus, for practical uses when dealing with a large number of contingencies, we investigate two decomposition algorithms based on Benders cut and the alternating direction method of multipliers. These decomposition schemes often generate solutions with a smaller objective function values than those generated by the conventional approach and very close to the globally optimal points.

Abstract: Power fluctuations generated by most oscillating wave energy converters may have a negative impact on the power quality of the local grid to which the wave farms will be connected. Hence, assessing their impact is an important step in the selection process of a suitable deployment location. However, site-specific grid impact assessment studies are relatively time-consuming and require a high level of detail on the local network. Both of these constraints mean that grid impact studies are usually not performed in the preliminary stages of the site selection process, despite the extremely negative consequences resulting from poor power quality. This paper details a comprehensive study based on a relatively typical wave farm design connected to networks of different strength levels. The study was performed using experimental electrical power time series of an oscillating water column (OWC) device generated under the framework of the European FP7 project "CORES". Simulations were performed using DIgSILENT power system simulator "PowerFactory".

Abstract: Microgrid is an aggregation of distributed generators (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESS) through corresponding power interface, such as synchronous generators, asynchronous generators and power electronic devices. Without the support from the public grid, the control and management of an autonomous microgrid is more complex due to its poor equivalent system inertia. To investigate microgrid dynamic stability, a small-signal model of a typical microgrid containing asynchronous generator based wind turbine, synchronous diesel generator, power electronic based energy storage and power network is proposed in this paper. The small-signal model of each of the subsystem is established respectively and then the global model is set up in a global reference axil frame. Eigenvalues distributions of the microgrid system under certain steady operating status are identified to indicate the damping of the oscillatory terms and its effect on system stability margin. Eigenvalues loci analysis is also presented which helps identifying the relationship among the dynamic stability, system configuration and operation status, such as the variation of intermittent generations and ESS with different control strategies. The results obtained from the model and eigenvalues analysis are verified through simulations and experiments on a study microgrid system.

Abstract: We investigate the geometry of injection regions and its relationship to optimization of power flows in tree networks. The injection region is the set of all vectors of bus power injections that satisfy the network and operation constraints. The geometrical object of interest is the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region. If the voltage magnitudes are fixed, the injection region of a tree network can be written as a linear transformation of the product of two-bus injection regions, one for each line in the network. Using this decomposition, we show that under the practical condition that the angle difference across each line is not too large, the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region remains unchanged by taking the convex hull. Moreover, the resulting convexified optimal power flow problem can be efficiently solved via semi-definite programming or second-order cone relaxations. These results improve upon earlier works by removing the assumptions on active power lower bounds. It is also shown that our practical angle assumption guarantees two other properties: 1) the uniqueness of the solution of the power flow problem and 2) the non-negativity of the locational marginal prices. Partial results are presented for the case when the voltage magnitudes are not fixed but can lie within certain bounds.

Abstract: The coupled single-port model has been proposed recently for wide-area measurement-based voltage stability assessment. This concept relies in decoupling a mesh power grid into the local single-port circuit coupled with an extra impedance. However, underestimations in this approach have been observed in simulation studies. In this paper, a modified coupled single-port model is proposed. Based on real-time PMU measurements of individual load bus, the reactive power response used in the extended Ward-type equivalent will be explored to compensate the reactive power mismatch in the existing model. In addition, a mitigation factor is introduced to modify the Thevenin equivalent parameter of the existing model. Due to the simplicity of the proposed model, several voltage stability indicators can be applied with slight modifications. Simulations on various IEEE test systems are presented to validate the accuracy of the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the placement of phasor measurement units (PMU) for enhancing hybrid state estimation via the traditional Gauss-Newton method, which uses measurements from both PMU devices and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. To compare the impact of PMU placements, we introduce a useful metric which accounts for three important requirements in power system state estimation: convergence, observability and performance (COP). Our COP metric can be used to evaluate the estimation performance and numerical stability of the state estimator, which is later used to optimize the PMU locations. In particular, we cast the optimal placement problem in a unified formulation as a semi-definite program (SDP) with integer variables and constraints that guarantee observability in case of measurements loss. Last but not least, we propose a relaxation scheme of the original integer-constrained SDP with randomization techniques, which closely approximates the optimum deployment. Simulations of the IEEE-30 and 118 systems corroborate our analysis, showing that the proposed scheme improves the convergence of the state estimator, while maintaining optimal asymptotic performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized algorithm for real-time estimation of the dynamic states of a power system. The scheme employs phasor measurement units (PMUs) for the measurement of local signals at each generation unit, and subsequent state estimation using unscented Kalman filtering (UKF). The novelty of the scheme is that the state estimation at one generation unit is independent from the estimation at other units, and therefore the transmission of remote signals to a central estimator is not required. This in turn reduces the complexity of each distributed estimator, and makes the estimation process highly efficient, accurate and easily implementable. The applicability of the proposed algorithm has been thoroughly demonstrated on a representative model.

Abstract: In steady-state voltage stability analysis, it is well-known that as the load is increased toward the maximum loading condition, the conventional Newton-Raphson power flow Jacobian matrix becomes increasingly ill-conditioned. As a result, the power flow fails to converge before reaching the maximum loading condition. To circumvent this singularity problem, continuation power flow methods have been developed. In these methods, the size of the Jacobian matrix is increased by one, and the Jacobian matrix becomes non-singular with a suitable choice of the continuation parameter. In this paper, we propose a new method to directly eliminate the singularity by reformulating the power flow problem. The central idea is to introduce an AQ bus in which the bus angle and the reactive power consumption of a load bus are specified. For steady-state voltage stability analysis, the voltage angle at the load bus can be varied to control power transfer to the load, rather than specifying the load power itself. For an AQ bus, the power flow formulation consists of only the reactive power equation, thus reducing the size of the Jacobian matrix by one. This reduced Jacobian matrix is nonsingular at the critical voltage point. We illustrate the method and its application to steady-state voltage stability using two example systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for analyzing the impacts of large-scale wind power integration on electricity market equilibria. A pool-based oligopolistic electricity market is considered including a day-ahead market and a number of real-time markets. Wind power is considered within the generation portfolio of the strategic producers, and the uncertainty of wind power production is modeled through a set of plausible scenarios. The strategic behavior of each producer is modeled through a stochastic bilevel model. The resulting nonlinear equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) is linearized and then solved. Numerical results for a test case with increasing levels of the wind power penetration is provided.

Abstract: This letter proposes an absolute value based method to solve the interval linear optimization problem with application to security constrained economic dispatch (SCED). To avoid expensive computation associated with solving combinatorial linear programming (LP) problems for interval upper bound, firstly a bilinear programming model is formulated using duality theory. The equality constraints are then converted to absolute value constraints. Lastly, the absolute value operator is eliminated through introducing two nonnegative slack variables and complementary slackness condition. The resulting new bilinear programming model can be effectively solved by the branch and bound method with linear relaxation technique to obtain the global optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving solution and computation time.

Abstract: This paper presents the optimal power flow (OPF) formulation of a recent power flow STATCOM model [1]. The new model puts forward an alternative, insightful interpretation of the fundamental frequency operation of the PWM-controlled voltage source converter (VSC), in an optimal fashion. The new model makes provisions for the explicit representation of the converter's internal ohmic and switching losses which in the context of an OPF formulation, yields an optimum operating point at which these power losses are at a minimum. The STATCOM model possesses unparalleled control capabilities in the operational parameters of both the AC and DC sides of the converter. Such control modeling flexibility is at its best when expressed in the context of an OPF solution using Newton's method. The STATCOM equations are incorporated into the OPF formulation using Lagrangian functions in quite a natural manner for efficient optimal solutions using a single frame-of-reference. The inequality constraint set of variables is handled equally well using the multipliers method. The prowess of the new model is demonstrated using two sample systems.

Abstract: This paper considers optimal transmission switching (OTS) to reduce generation cost by removing lines from service. A mixed integer program (MIP) has been proposed to solve the OTS problem, based on the linear direct current optimal power flow (DCOPF) model. Because of excessive computation times for large, real systems, the MIP model has been followed by some heuristics, also based on the DCOPF, to obtain near-optimal solutions quickly. However, the approximations in the DCOPF model may lead to poor choices of lines to remove from service. We assess the quality of line removal recommendations that rely on a previously published, DCOPF-based heuristic, by estimating actual cost reduction with the exact ACOPF model, using the IEEE 118-bus and 300-bus test systems with several demand levels. We also extend this heuristic to be based on the ACOPF and compare the quality of its recommendations to those of the DCOPF-based heuristic. The DCOPF-based heuristic performs very poorly in several cases, even leading to cost increases sometimes. There is a need for approximations to the ACOPF which are accurate enough to produce reliably good results for OTS heuristics, but fast enough for practical use.

By adding artificial 0-1 binary variables for each prohibited operating zone of generators and employing a binary coding scheme, disjoint feasible regions are represented by complementary linear constraints. Compared to existing MIQP method, the proposed method can achieve global optimal solution with much reduced problem complexity.

Abstract: We consider a cluster of interconnected price-responsive demands (e. g., an industrial compound or a university campus) that can be supplied through the main grid and a stochastic distributed energy resource (DER), e. g., a wind plant. Additionally, the cluster of demands owns an energy storage facility. An energy management system (EMS) coordinates the price-responsive demands within the cluster and provides the interface for energy trading between the demands and the suppliers, main grid and DER. The DER and the cluster of demands have a contractual agreement based on a take-or-pay contract. Within this context, we propose an energy management algorithm that allows the cluster of demands to buy, store, and sell energy at suitable times. This algorithm results in maximum utility for the demands. The uncertainty related to both the production level of the DER and the price of the energy obtained from/sold to the main grid is modeled using robust optimization (RO) techniques. Smart grid (SG) technology is used to realize 2-way communication between the EMS and the main grid, and between the EMS and the DER. Communication takes place on an hourly basis. A realistic case study is used to demonstrate the advantages of both the coordination provided by the EMS through the proposed algorithm and the use of SG technology.

Abstract: This paper presents an alternative day-ahead auction based on consumer payment minimization for pool-based electricity markets. This auction is an instance of price-based market clearing wherein market-clearing prices are explicitly modeled as decision variables of the optimization. The auction design includes network constraints, inter-temporal constraints associated with generation scheduling, and marginal pricing. Hence, consumer payment is expressed in terms of locational marginal prices. The proposed solution approach is based on bilevel programming. In the upper-level optimization, generation is scheduled with the goal of minimizing the total consumer payment while taking into account that locational marginal prices are determined by a multiperiod optimal power flow in the lower level. In this bilevel programming setting, locational marginal prices are the Lagrange multipliers or dual variables associated with the nodal power balance equations of the lower-level problem. The resulting mixed-integer linear bilevel program is transformed into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear program suitable for efficient off-the-shelf software. This transformation relies on the application of results from duality theory of linear programming and integer algebra. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to several test systems including the IEEE 118-bus system. Numerical results have been compared with those obtained from declared social welfare maximization.

Abstract: The problem of characterizing impacts of data quality on real-time locational marginal price (LMP) is considered. Because the real-time LMP is computed from the estimated network topology and system state, bad data that cause errors in topology processing and state estimation affect real-time LMP. It is shown that the power system state space is partitioned into price regions of convex polytopes. Under different bad data models, the worst case impacts of bad data on real-time LMP are analyzed. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate worst case performance for IEEE-14 and IEEE-118 networks.

Abstract: Large-scale offshore wind farms can be integrated with onshore ac grids by the voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) technology. The resulting impact on the security of ac grids can be significant. Therefore, it is important to develop an HVDC model for online stability monitoring of the integrated ac/dc systems. This paper proposes a new HVDC model based on a circuit-theoretic foundation. With the available phasor measurement units (PMUs) at VSC stations, the parameters of the HVDC equivalent model can be identified in real-time by synchronized voltage and current phasor measurements at VSC ac terminals. The proposed HVDC model is applied to online voltage instability detection for integrated ac/dc systems by the Thevenin impedance matching. The HVDC equivalent circuit enables the Thevenin equivalent impedance of the HVDC-connected offshore wind farm to be determined directly from the PMU measurements. Numerical simulations are performed on the IEEE 39-bus system with an HVDC-connected offshore wind farm to validate the effectiveness of the proposed HVDC model.

Abstract: Presence of energy hubs in the future vision of energy networks creates a great opportunity for system planners and operators to move towards more efficient systems. The role of energy hubs as the intermediate in multi-carrier energy (MCE) systems calls for a generic framework to study the new upcoming technical as well as economical effects on the system performance. In response, this paper attempts to develop a general optimization and modeling framework for coupled power flow studies on different energy infrastructures. This, as a large-scale nonlinear problem, is approached through a robust optimization technique, i.e., multi-agent genetic algorithm (MAGA). The proposed procedure decomposes the multi-carrier optimal power flow (MCOPF) problem into its traditional separate OPF problem in such a way that the major advantages of simultaneous analysis of MCE systems would not be sacrificed. The presented scheme is then applied to an 11-hubs test system and introduces its expected applicability and robustness in the MCE systems analysis.

Abstract: The issue of power flow divergence when dispersed generations are modeled as P-V nodes needs to be addressed. To address this issue, this paper presents a homotopy-enhanced numerical power flow method. Several numerical aspects of the implementation were discussed. To evaluate its reliability and effectiveness, the proposed method is applied to several standard test systems, a practical 1101-node distribution network and the IEEE 8500-node test system. The evaluation results were very promising. In addition, one distinguished feature of the homotopy-enhanced numerical power flow method is that it is applicable to several existing power flow methods.

Abstract: The ubiquity of synchronous generation should not be assumed in highly renewable power systems. Various problems may consequently arise, not least of which are the difficulties entailed in maintaining regional reactive power balance. Offering a potential solution to such problems, modern renewable generator technologies offer controllable reactive power resources. As many of these generators will be embedded in distribution networks, their incorporation into transmission system operational and planning activities appears challenging. An extension of the capability chart concept offers insight here: for a given active power exchange between the transmission system and a distribution network section, the range of controllable reactive power typically available is of interest. This aggregate capability depends on the innate machine capabilities of the distributed generators and on the prevailing conditions within the distribution network. Novel optimisation techniques are useful in addressing the latter point, offering a means to identify the combination of power flow profiles within the distribution system most restrictive to reactive power provision. The capability chart thus derived gives the dependable range of reactive power available, under the assumption that each generator is operated to locally maximize its own reactive power contribution. Such a description can be applied in transmission system planning or to quantify the effects of modifications to the distribution system.

Abstract: Active Network Management is a philosophy for the operation of distribution networks with high penetrations of renewable distributed generation. Technologies such as energy storage and flexible demand are now beginning to be included in Active Network Management (ANM) schemes. Optimizing the operation of these schemes requires consideration of intertemporal linkages as well as network power flow effects. Network effects are included in optimal power flow (OPF) solutions but this only optimizes for a single point in time. Dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) is an extension of OPF to cover multiple time periods. This paper reviews the generic formulation of DOPF before developing a framework for modeling energy technologies with intertemporal characteristics in an ANM context. The framework includes the optimization of nonfirm connected generation, principles of access for nonfirm generators, energy storage, and flexible demand. Two objectives based on maximizing export and revenue are developed and a case study is used to illustrate the technique. Results show that DOPF is able to successfully schedule these energy technologies. DOPF schedules energy storage and flexible demand to reduce generator curtailment significantly in the case study. Finally, the role of DOPF in analyzing ANM schemes is discussed with reference to extending the optimization framework to include other technologies and objectives.

Abstract: This paper discusses the extension of electromechanical stability models of voltage source converter high voltage direct current (VSC HVDC) to multi-terminal (MTDC) systems. The paper introduces a control model with a cascaded DC voltage control at every converter that allows a two-terminal VSC HVDC system to cope with converter outages. When extended to an MTDC system, the model naturally evolves into a master-slave set-up with converters taking over the DC voltage control in case the DC voltage controlling converter fails. It is shown that the model can be used to include a voltage droop control to share the power imbalance after a contingency in the DC system amongst the converters in the system. Finally, the paper discusses two possible model reductions, in line with the assumptions made in transient stability modeling. The control algorithms and VSC HVDC systems have been implemented using both MatDyn, an open source MATLAB transient stability program, as well as the commercial power system simulation package EUROSTAG.

Abstract: We present a stochastic unit commitment model for assessing the impacts of the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources and deferrable demand in power systems in terms of reserve requirements. We analyze three demand response paradigms for assessing the benefits of demand flexibility: the centralized co-optimization of generation and demand by the system operator, demand bids and the coupling of renewable resources with deferrable loads. We motivate coupling as an alternative for overcoming the drawbacks of the two alternative demand response options and we present a dynamic programming algorithm for coordinating deferrable demand with renewable supply. We present simulation results for a model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.

Abstract: We develop a tri-level model of transmission and generation expansion planning in a deregulated power market environment. Due to long planning/construction lead times and concerns for network reliability, transmission expansion is considered in the top level as a centralized decision. In the second level, multiple decentralized GENCOs make their own capacity expansion decisions while anticipating a wholesale electricity market equilibrium in the third level. The collection of bi-level games in the lower two levels forms an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) that can be approached by either the diagonalization method (DM) or a complementarity problem (CP) reformulation. We propose a hybrid iterative solution algorithm that combines a CP reformulation of the tri-level problem and DM solutions of the EPEC sub-problem.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) power plants into distribution networks (DNs) causes various issues concerning, e.g., stability, protection equipment, and voltage regulation. Thus, the necessity to develop proper control techniques to allow power delivery to customers in compliance with power quality and reliability standards (PQR) has become a relevant issue in recent years. This paper proposes an optimized distributed control approach based on DN sensitivity analysis and on decentralized reactive/active power regulation capable of maintaining voltage levels within regulatory limits and to offer ancillary services to the DN, such as voltage regulation. At the same time, it tries to minimize DN active power losses and the reactive power exchanged with the DN by the DG units. The validation of the proposed control technique has been conducted through a several number of simulations on a real MV Italian distribution system.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to determine an optimal plan for expanding the capacity of a power grid in order to minimize the likelihood of a large cascading blackout. Capacity-expansion decisions considered in this paper include the addition of new transmission lines and the addition of capacity to existing lines. We embody these interacting considerations in a simulation optimization model, where the objective is to minimize the probability of a large blackout subject to a budget constraint. The probability of a large-scale blackout is estimated via Monte Carlo simulation of a probabilistic cascading blackout model. Because the events of interest are rare, standard simulation is often intractable from a computational perspective. We apply a variance-reduction technique within the simulation to provide results in a reasonable time frame. Numerical results are given for some small test networks including an IEEE 14-bus test network. A key conclusion is that the different expansion strategies lead to different shapes of the tails of the blackout distributions. In other words, there is a tradeoff between reducing the frequency of small-scale blackouts versus reducing the frequency of large-scale blackouts.

Abstract: The first part of this two-paper series discusses the motivation of implementing a primary frequency response (PFR) market in restructured pool-based power markets, as well as the market design that would create the right incentives to provide the response reliably. PFR is the immediate, autonomous response of generation and demand to system frequency deviations. It is the critical response required to avoid triggering under-and over-frequency relays or instability that could lead to machine damage, load-shedding, and in the extreme case, blackouts. Currently, in many restructured power systems throughout the world, ancillary services markets have been developed to incent technologies to provide the services to support power system reliability. However, few ancillary services markets include a market explicitly incentivizing the provision of PFR. Historically, PFR was an inherent feature available in conventional generating technologies, and in most systems, more was available than needed. Yet, recent trends in declining frequency response, the introduction of emerging technologies, and market behavior may soon require innovative market designs to incent resources to provide this valuable service.

Abstract: An algorithm facilitating automated purchase of energy on real-time balancing market is proposed in this paper. The main inputs of the algorithm are a prediction of the area control error, its uncertainty in the form of a standard deviation and a set of previously procured ancillary services (contracted power reserves) available for power balance control. The algorithm evaluates all possible power balance scenarios for the closest hour in a probabilistic manner and gives a cost-optimal recommendation for the real-time balancing market demand. A case study on realistic data for the Czech Republic control area was performed by simulation of the power balance control with a Monte Carlo simulator of the Czech transmission system. The results showed potential for savings on the regulation energy costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to obtain flexible future capacity expansion plans under diverse types and sources of uncertainty classified as global and local. Planning flexibility is defined as the capability of a long-term planning solution to adapt cost-effectively to any of the conditions of characterizing the identified scenarios. Global (or high-impact) uncertainties allow us to create scenarios that guide the flexibility-based planning model; whereas local uncertainties allow us to create uncertainty sets that model the imperfect knowledge of each global uncertainty (GU). Our methodology, rather than choosing the most flexible plan among a set of candidate solutions, designs a flexible system that is less sensitive to the choice of scenarios. In addition to minimizing the investment and operational cost, the model minimizes its future adaptation cost to the conditions of other identified scenarios via adjustable robust optimization. Results obtained with our methodology in a 5-region US system under a 40-year planning horizon show how a flexible system adapts to future high-impact uncertainties at reasonably low costs with a low number of adaptation actions. A folding horizon process where GUs are guided by Markov chains was performed to assess the degree of flexibility of the system and its cost under multiple operation conditions.

Abstract: The emergence of high penetration of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of power systems has substantially increased the need for faster-ramping resources participating in the frequency regulation service procured via market mechanisms by the system operators. However, current market mechanisms do not properly align the incentives for participation since resources are not compensated for the actual frequency regulation they provide nor for the accuracy with which they follow the automatic generation control (AGC) dispatch signal. In this paper, we evaluate the current mechanisms for procuring, dispatching and compensating resources for the frequency regulation service. We also propose a comprehensive approach for calculating the performance payment that includes the actual service they provide and the accuracy with which they follow the AGC signal. Finally, we perform a study by deploying actual operational AGC data for analyzing the proposed methodology.

Abstract: We present a method to estimate the capacity value of storage. Our method uses a dynamic program to model the effect of power system outages on the operation and state of charge of storage in subsequent periods. We combine the optimized dispatch from the dynamic program with estimated system loss of load probabilities to compute a probability distribution for the state of charge of storage in each period. This probability distribution can be used as a forced outage rate for storage in standard reliability-based capacity value estimation methods. Our proposed method has the advantage over existing approximations that it explicitly captures the effect of system shortage events on the state of charge of storage in subsequent periods. We also use a numerical case study, based on five utility systems in the U. S., to demonstrate our technique and compare it to existing approximation methods.

Abstract: The usage of remote signals obtained from a wide-area measurement system (WAMS) introduces time delays to a wide-area damping controller (WADC), which would degrade system damping and even cause system instability. The time-delay margin is defined as the maximum time delay under which a closed-loop system can remain stable. In this paper, the delay margin is introduced as an additional performance index for the synthesis of classical WADCs for flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices to damp inter-area oscillations. The proposed approach includes three parts: a geometric measure approach for selecting feedback remote signals, a residue method for designing phase-compensation parameters, and a Lyapunov stability criterion and linear matrix inequalities (LMI) for calculating the delay margin and determining the gain of the WADC based on a tradeoff between damping performance and delay margin. Three case studies are undertaken based on a four-machine two-area power system for demonstrating the design principle of the proposed approach, a New England ten-machine 39-bus power system and a 16-machine 68-bus power system for verifying the feasibility on larger and more complex power systems. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on providing a balance between the delay margin and the damping performance.

Abstract: This paper studies the techniques for modeling modular multilevel converter (MMC) based multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) systems in the electromechanical transient mode. Firstly, the mathematical model of the MMC and its corresponding equivalent circuit are established, which are similar to those of the two level converters. Then, a power flow calculation method for AC/ DC systems containing MMC-MTDC systems is developed. Two dynamic models for MMC-MTDC systems are developed in the paper. One is the detailed model, taking into account of the AC side circuit, the inner controllers, the modulation strategies, the outer controllers and the MTDC circuit. The other is the simplified model, which only reserves the outer controllers and partial dynamics of the MTDC circuit based on a quantitative analysis of the detailed model's dynamic processes, and it can be used in electromechanical transient simulation with a larger step size. Both the detailed and the simplified models are implemented on PSS/E and compared with the accurate electromagnetic transient models on PSCAD in a four terminal MMC-MTDC system; the result proves the validity of the developed models. Lastly, a stability study of a modified New England 39-bus system is executed, and the result shows that the AC fault can be isolated well in an MMC-MTDC asynchronously connected AC grid.

Abstract: In this paper, the wavelet phase difference (WPD) approach is applied for the identification of power system areas with coherent generator groups. This approach allows observation, at different frequency bands, of movement of low frequency electromechanical oscillations (LFEO), identified at different parts of the power system and the identification of the inter-area components that move or do not move together. An illustration of the applied approach was performed on the New England (NE) 39-bus test system. The interesting results of WPD application are also presented in a real wide-area measurement data from European interconnected power system. By using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), the validation of results from WPD approach is also given.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for energy and reserve scheduling in electricity markets subject to transmission flow limits. Security is imposed by guaranteeing power balance under each contingency state including both generation and transmission assets. The model is general enough to embody a joint generation and transmission security criterion and its variants. An adjustable robust optimization approach is presented to circumvent the tractability issues associated with conventional contingency-constrained methods relying on explicitly modeling the whole contingency set. The adjustable robust model is formulated as a trilevel programming problem. The upper-level problem aims at minimizing total costs of energy and reserves while ensuring that the system is able to withstand each contingency. The middle-level problem identifies, for a given pre-contingency schedule, the contingency state leading to maximum power imbalance if any. Finally, the lower-level problem models the operator's best reaction for a given contingency by minimizing the system power imbalance. The proposed trilevel problem is solved by a Benders decomposition approach. For computation purposes, a tighter formulation for the master problem is presented. Our approach is finitely convergent to the optimal solution and provides a measure of the distance to the optimum. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed methodology over conventional contingency-constrained models.

Abstract: The paper presents a generic probabilistic framework for assessing the accuracy of online prediction of power system transient stability based on phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements and data mining techniques. It allows fair comparison of different data mining models in terms of the accuracy of the prediction. To illustrate the concept, a decision tree (DT) method is used as an example of a data mining technique. It is implemented in a 16-machine, 68-bus test power system. Generator rotor angles and speeds provided by PMUs during post-fault condition are chosen as predictors. The performance of the DT based prediction method is tested using a wide variety of disturbances with probabilistically modeled locations, durations, types of fault and the system loading levels. The accuracy of prediction is approximately 98.5% immediately following the fault clearance and can increase to almost 100% if the prediction is made 2.5 s after the fault clearance.

Abstract: Environmental factors, such as weather, trees, and animals, are major causes of power outages in electric utility distribution systems. Of these factors, wind and lightning have the most significant impacts. The objective of this paper is to investigate models to estimate wind and lighting related outages. Such estimation models hold the potential for lowering operational costs and reducing customer downtime. This paper proposes an ensemble learning approach based on a boosting algorithm, ADABOOST(+), for estimation of weather-caused power outages. Effectiveness of the model is evaluated using actual data, which comprised of weather data and recorded outages for four cities of different sizes in Kansas. The proposed ensemble model is compared with previously presented regression, neural network, and mixture of experts models. The results clearly show that ADABOOST(+) estimates outages with greater accuracy than the other models for all four data sets.

Abstract: First-swing stability constrained emergency control (FSCEC) enhances power system transient stability during large disturbances, but is difficult to solve for larger systems because of its computational complexity. The method proposed in this work guarantees first swing transient stability by using a parallel reduced-space interior point method (IPM) with orthogonal collocation to solve FSCEC problems. This novel algorithm discretizes differential-algebraic equations using orthogonal collocation, which leads to a relatively low problem dimension, and accelerates the optimization process through a reduced-space technique by utilizing the property of small degrees of freedom after numerical discretization. Furthermore, a two-level parallelism is explored in reduced-space IPM (RIPM) algorithm and implemented with state-of-the-art parallelization techniques. The proposed approach was benchmarked on a Beowulf cluster with 64 CPU cores to show its excellent computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper develops a generalized admittance matrix approach in Fortescue coordinate system to solve unbalanced/unsymmetrical distribution networks including different number of phases. This generalized Fortescue equivalent is defined in this paper for solving the heterogeneous phase, and thus Fortescue, network model. The performance of the approach is demonstrated in different model networks with number of nodes ranging between 168 and 14200. It is found that the current iteration method exploiting the decoupling in admittance matrix in Fortescue coordinate is substantially faster than the typical unbalanced three-phase solution in phase domain. The method has a significant potential for application in real time active power network management.

Numerical testing of a large-scale two-area system demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP) method designed to alleviate congestion induced by electric vehicle (EV) loads in future power systems. In the proposed approach, the distribution system operator (DSO) determines distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs) by solving the social welfare optimization of the electric distribution system which considers EV aggregators as price takers in the local DSO market and demand price elasticity. Nonlinear optimization has been used to solve the social welfare optimization problem in order to obtain the DLMPs. The efficacy of the proposed approach was demonstrated by using the bus 4 distribution system of the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) and Danish driving data. The case study results show that the integrated DLMP methodology can successfully alleviate the congestion caused by EV loads. It is also shown that the socially optimal charging schedule can be implemented through a decentralized mechanism where loads respond autonomously to the posted DLMPs by maximizing their individual net surplus.

Abstract: The day-ahead unit-commitment (UC)-based market-clearing (MC) is widely acknowledged to be the most economically efficient mechanism for scheduling resources in power systems. In conventional UC problems, power schedules are used to represent the staircase energy schedule. However, the realizability of this schedule cannot be guaranteed due to the violation of ramping limits, and hence conventional UC formulations do not manage the flexibility of generating units efficiently. This paper provides a UC-based MC formulation, drawing a clear distinction between power and energy. Demand and generation are modeled as hourly piecewise-linear functions representing their instantaneous power trajectories. The schedule of generating unit output is no longer a staircase function, but a smoother function that respects all ramp constraints. The formulation represents in detail the operating reserves (online and offline), their time deployment limits (e.g., 15 min), their potential substitution, and their limits according to the actual ramp schedule. Startup and shutdown power trajectories are also modeled, and thus a more efficient energy and reserves schedule is obtained. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, and was tested with a 10-unit and 100-unit system in which its computational performance was compared with a traditional UC formulation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a mathematical model for transmission planning in an environment where there is imperfect competition in electricity supply industry. The model is developed based on the concept of the leader-followers game in applied mathematics. The leader of the game is the transmission planner and the followers are the strategic electricity producing firms. The reaction of the strategic electricity producing firms to the transmission planning decision is modeled using the introduced concept of the worst-Cournot-Nash equilibrium. The worst-Cournot-Nash equilibrium can handle the multiple Nash equilibria problem. The whole mathematical formulation is a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem. This formulation is achieved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and a binary mapping approach. The application of the proposed approach to the three-node example system and the modified six-node Garver's example system are studied. The transmission planning with perfect competition is formulated and used as the benchmark. The numerical results show that the proposed approach in this paper can efficiently allocate the additional transmission capacity to the transmission grid such that it reduces the market power cost in the electricity supply industry. However, further studies should be carried out to scale up the proposed approach to the larger case studies.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) poses potential issues for low voltage (LV) distribution networks, such as excessive voltage deviations and overloading of equipment. Controlled EV charging is seen as one possibility for reducing, or even eliminating, these issues. The implementation of controlled charging schemes, in particular centralized schemes, can require forecasts of a number of variables, e. g., household loads, EV availability, and battery requirements. The unpredictability of individual customer behavior may, however, lead to large variations between forecast and realized behavior. This work presents a multi-period, unbalanced load flow and rolling optimization method, which focuses on controlling the rate and times at which EVs charge over a 24-h time horizon, with a minimum cost objective, subject to certain constraints. Inputs are updated and a new optimization is performed at each time step so that deviations from the initial forecast can be readily accounted for.

Abstract: This paper presents the solution algorithm and test results of the market-splitting approach, proposed in the first part of this two-paper series, for the clearing of the forthcoming Internal Electricity Market. The market-splitting approach is implemented in a Europe-wide level, indicatively defining three power pools and 22 power exchanges, comprising 42 bidding areas in total, with each local/national market respecting the standard market regulatory framework of power pools and power exchanges (PXs). The performance and computational requirements of this implementation is presented; the model is tested in terms of problem solvability to its limits, considering a day-ahead market clearing time threshold equal to one hour. The results demonstrate that a viable solution to the clearing of the Internal Electricity Market can be attained with the current state-of-the-art of computers' processing power. Further discussion is made concerning the viability of the proposed approach and other harmonization issues that should be considered for successful market integration.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-year multi-objective planning algorithm for enabling distribution networks to accommodate high penetrations of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in conjunction with renewable distributed generation (DG). The proposed algorithm includes consideration of uncertainties and will help local distribution companies (LDC) better assess the expected impacts of PEVs on their networks and on proposed renewable DG connections. The goal of the proposed algorithm is to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and system costs during the planning horizon. An approach based on a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NDSGA) is utilized to solve the planning problem of determining the optimal level of PEV penetration as well as the location, size, and year of installation of renewable DG units. The planning problem is defined in terms of multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming. The outcomes of the planning problem represent the Pareto frontier, which describes the optimal system solutions, from which the LDC can choose the system operating point, based on its preferences.

Abstract: An economic evaluation of a network of distributed energy resources (DERs) forming an autonomous power delivery system in an Indian scenario has been made. The mathematical analysis is based on the application of a real valued cultural algorithm (RVCA). The RVCA-evaluated total annual costs for the autonomous microgrid system utilizing both solar module and fuel cells asDERs and solar module and bio-mass gassifier unit as DERs have been compared. Different types of consumers together form a microgrid with the optimal supply of power from DERs. The optimal power generation conditions have been obtained pertaining to minimum cost of microgrid system. The results for different loading scenarios, using hybrid solar-biomass gassifier unit are found to be more cost competitive. A reduction of 8.1% in the annual cost is obtained using solar module-biomass gassifier unit to that using solar module-fuel cell for the same load demand in microgrid operation.

Abstract: For a microgrid with high renewable energy penetration to work autonomously, it must maintain its own supply-demand balance of active power. Maximum peak power tracking algorithms, which emphasize high renewable energy utilization, may cause a supply-demand imbalance when the available renewable generation is more than demanded, especially for autonomous microgrids. Currently, droop control is one of the most popular decentralized methods for sharing active and reactive loads among the distributed generators. However, conventional droop control methods suffer from slow and oscillating dynamic response and steady state deviations. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a distributed subgradient-based solution to coordinate the operations of different types of distributed renewable generators in a microgrid. By controlling the utilization levels of renewable generators, the supply-demand balance can be well maintained and the system dynamic performance can be significantly improved. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control solution.

Abstract: The second part of this two-paper series analyzes the primary frequency response (PFR) market design developed in its companion paper with several case studies. The simulations will show how the scheduling and pricing change depending on whether requirements for PFR are included as well as how the requirements are defined. We first perform simulations on the base case IEEE RTS and show differences in production costs, prices, and amount of PFR when incorporating the PFR constraints. We show how new market designs can affect other linked markets when performing co-optimization. We then test a system with a significant amount of wind power, which does not provide PFR or synchronous inertia, to see how the incorporation of PFR constraints may become more critical on future systems. We then show how pricing can reduce make-whole payments and ensure resources needed for reliability reasons are incentivized. Lastly, we show how resources that improve their capabilities can earn additional profit if the improvement is needed ensuring the incentives can work for innovation in PFR capabilities.

Abstract: Measurement-based load modeling is a promising approach to reliably represent load behavior in dynamic simulations of large power systems. This paper presents a methodology that starts with the acquisition of voltages and currents from power quality monitoring systems and highlights the issues associated with selecting, processing and resampling the data to estimate the relationship between the power deviations as a function of the voltage deviations. The load model mathematical structure chosen is a second-order transfer function, whose parameters are estimated using a genetic algorithm (GA) as the optimization technique that minimizes the error between the real data that are measured and the data that are simulated with the proposed models. Some insights were achieved regarding the appropriate search space choice.

Abstract: This paper aims at establishing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the output variable of the probabilistic optimal power flow. In the context of the probability weighted moment (PWM), the uncertainties in the power system are modelled by a ninth-order polynomial normal transformation (NPNT) technique, whereby the dependencies among the inputs are conveniently handled. The quasi-Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is employed to get the statistical information of the outputs. Based on the PWMs of the output variable, the CDF is reconstructed by NPNT technique. Testing on a modified 118-bus system, results from the proposed method are compared against those from MCS. The proposed method demonstrates a high level of accuracy for the mean, standard deviation and CDF, while significantly reducing the computational burden.

Abstract: We propose a stochastic programming-based tool to support adaptive transmission planning under market and regulatory uncertainties. We model investments in two stages, differentiating between commitments that must be made now and corrective actions that can be undertaken as new information becomes available. The objective is to minimize expected transmission and generation costs over the time horizon. Nonlinear constraints resulting from Kirchhoff's voltage law are included. We apply the tool to a 240-bus representation of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and model uncertainty using three scenarios with distinct renewable electricity mandates, emissions policies, and fossil fuel prices. We conclude that the cost of ignoring uncertainty (the cost of using naive deterministic planning methods relative to explicitly modeling uncertainty) is of the same order of magnitude as the cost of first-stage transmission investments. Furthermore, we conclude that heuristic rules for constructing transmission plans based on scenario planning can be as suboptimal as deterministic plans.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective optimization scheme for the measurement-based load modeling based on the sensitivity analysis of composite load model parameters. Each parameter of load model has different effects on its dynamic response. Moreover, some parameters are insensitive to the change of others. To estimate the dynamic interactions between parameters, their sensitivity is analyzed by using the eigenvalues of Hessian matrix used in the optimization algorithm. Also, the linear dependence between two load model parameters is then identified by examining the condition number of Jacobian matrix. With this parameter analysis, the performance of optimization process for measurement-based composite load modeling is improved by reducing the number of necessary parameters to consider. The performance of proposed method is verified with the practical data measured at a feeder in a real substation.

Abstract: The extensive electrification of ship power systems has become a very appealing option for the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly ships. Optimal power management and energy storage systems will have a key role in such systems as they can lead to fuel consumption reduction and increase overall ship efficiency. However, technical difficulties arising from the inherent complexity of such systems should be overcome. In this paper, the optimal operation of a ship electric power system comprising full electric propulsion and energy storage system is analyzed. An optimal power management method is proposed so that the operation cost is minimized, greenhouse gas emissions are limited and, at the same time, the associated technical and operational constraints are not violated.

Abstract: We study a tri-level integrated transmission and generation expansion planning problem in a deregulated power market environment. The collection of bi-level sub-problems in the lower two levels is an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) that can be approached by either the diagonalization method (DM) or a complementarity problem (CP) reformulation. This paper is a continuation of its Part I, in which a hybrid iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the tri-level problem by iteratively applying the CP reformulation of the tri-level problem to propose solutions and evaluating them in the EPEC sub-problem by DM. It focuses on the numerical results obtained by the hybrid algorithm for a 6-bus system, a modified IEEE 30-bus system, and an IEEE 118-bus system. In the numerical instances, the (approximate) Nash equilibrium point for the sub-problem can be verified by examining local concavity.

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic methodology to estimate a demand curve for operating reserves, where the curve represents the amount that a system operator is willing to pay for these services. The demand curve is quantified by the cost of unserved energy and the expected loss of load, accounting for uncertainty from generator contingencies, load forecasting errors, and wind power forecasting errors. The methodology addresses two key challenges in electricity market design: integrating wind power more efficiently and improving scarcity pricing. In a case study, we apply the proposed operating reserve strategies in a two-settlement electricity market with centralized unit commitment and economic dispatch and co-optimization of energy and reserves. We compare the proposed probabilistic approach to traditional operating reserve rules. We use the Illinois power system to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed reserve market modeling approach when it is combined with probabilistic wind power forecasting.

Abstract: Performance-based regulations accompanied by quality regulations are gaining ground in the electricity distribution business. Several European countries apply quality regulations with reward and penalty schemes (RPSs), where the distribution system operator (DSO) is rewarded (or penalized) when fulfilling (or not fulfilling) an adequate level of reliability to its customers. This paper develops a method that the regulator can use before enforcing a regulation to get an understanding of the impact different RPS design solutions have on the DSO's financial risk and incentives to invest in reliability. The proposed method also includes a sensitivity analysis to identify which are the most important parameters in an RPS. The new method is applied to three regulatory challenges to evaluate their RPS design solutions. Results show that the choice of scheme design and cost model used to decide the incentive rate have a large impact on the DSO's financial risk and incentive to invest.

Abstract: Although the installed wind generation capacity has grown remarkably over the past decades, percentage of wind energy in electricity supply portfolio is still relatively low. Due to the technical limitations of power system operations, considerable wind generation cannot integrate into the grid but gets curtailed. Among various factors, transmission congestion accounts for a significant portion of wind curtailment. Derived from DC power network, an analytical approach is proposed to efficiently assess the congestion induced wind curtailment sensitivity without iterative simulation. Compared to empirical simulation-based wind curtailment studies, the proposed approach offers the following advantages: 1) computational efficiency, 2) low input information requirement, and 3) robustness against uncertainties. This approach could benefit system operators, wind farm owners as well as wind power investors to better understand the interactions between wind curtailment and power system operations and can further help for curtailment alleviation. Numerical experiments of a modified IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System (RTS) as well as a practical 5889-bus system are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-stage approach for solving the optimal voltage regulation problem in unbalanced radial distribution system in the presence of photovoltaic (PV) generation. The on-load tap changer (OLTC) and static VAr compensator (SVC) have been considered as the voltage control devices in this work. The formulated voltage control problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem which remains unsolved even after 8 h due to its computational burden. However, the proposed two-stage approach can solve this problem in less than 10 min. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on a modified IEEE 123-bus radial distribution system.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) is a promising technology for reducing environmental impacts of road transport. In this paper, a framework for optimal design of battery charging/swap stations in distribution systems based on life cycle cost (LCC) is presented. The battery charging/swap station models are developed to compare the impacts of rapid-charging stations and battery swap stations. Meanwhile, in order to meet the requirements of increased power provided during the charging period, the distribution network should be reinforced. In order to control this reinforcement cost, stations should be placed at appropriate places and be scaled correctly. For optimal cost-benefit analysis and safety operation, the LCC criterion is used to assess the project and a modified differential evolution algorithm is adopted to solve the problem. The proposed method has been verified on the modified IEEE 15-bus and 43-bus radial distribution systems. The results show that battery swap station is more suitable for public transportation in distribution systems.

Abstract: Measurement based algorithms for estimating low-frequency electromechanical modes serve as useful practical methods to monitor the modal properties of power system oscillations in real-time. This paper proposes a recursive adaptive stochastic subspace identification (RASSI) algorithm for online monitoring of power system modes using wide-area synchrophasor data. The proposed method gives an online estimation of mode frequency and damping ratio as well as mode shapes using multi-channel measurement data. It exploits both the accuracy of subspace identification and fast computational capability of recursive methods. An adaptive method is proposed to enable fast tracking of modal evolution under poorly damped conditions together with low estimation variance under quasi-steady-state conditions. The algorithms are tested using simulated data from Kundur two-area test power system as well as measured data from real systems.

Abstract: In view of the increasing role of environmental considerations in power generation, there is an evolving body of reliability methods that are cognizant of these emerging factors. This paper presents a method for analyzing the reliability of composite power systems under the constraints of, and emissions. It also utilizes the concept of the shadow price to perform sensitivity analysis with respect to these constraints. The method presented here uses a linearized power flow representation in the form of a linear programming (LP) model similar to those frequently used in power system reliability studies. In addition to power balance and flow constraints normally used, this work introduces a suitably formulated set of emission constraints. The dual solution of the LP provides the shadow prices that are used for determining the sensitivities. This paper also develops relationships for the sensitivities of several reliability indices with respect to the emission allowances. The method is demonstrated on the IEEE-RTS and the results are presented.

Abstract: The integration of the day-ahead electricity markets in Europe shall lead to one multi-area market that will substitute the local/national ones. In view of the "target model" that will be enforced in all European markets in conjunction with their forthcoming coupling/integration, a centralized market splitting algorithm is implemented in this paper, respecting the standard market regulatory framework of power exchanges (PXs) and power pools, including 1) block offers/bids, linked block offers/bids, flexible hourly offers/bids and convertible block offers in power exchanges and 2) unit technical/commitment constraints and system operating constraints in power pools. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can be solved using commercial MILP solvers. The performance and computational requirements of an implementation in pan-European level is presented in the companion paper; the model is tested in terms of problem solvability to its limits, considering a day-ahead market clearing time threshold equal to one hour.

Abstract: The uptake of variable megawatts from photovoltaics (PV) challenges distribution system operation. The primary problem is significant voltage rise in the feeder that forces existing voltage control devices such as on-load tap-changers and line voltage regulators to operate continuously. The consequence is the deterioration of the operating life of the voltage control mechanism. Also, conventional non-coordinated reactive power control can result in the operation of the line regulator at its control limit ( runaway condition). This paper proposes an optimal reactive power coordination strategy based on the load and irradiance forecast. The objective is tominimize the number of tap operations so as not to reduce the operating life of the tap control mechanism and avoid runaway. The proposed objective is achieved by coordinating various reactive power control options in the distribution network while satisfying constraints such as maximum power point tracking of PV and voltage limits of the feeder. The option of voltage support from PV plant is also considered. The problem is formulated as constrained optimization and solved through the interior point technique. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in a realistic distribution network model.

Abstract: This paper introduces the idea of unified unit commitment and economic dispatch modeling within a unique tool that performs economic dispatch with up to 24-hour look-ahead capability. The tool provides financially binding dispatch and ex-ante locational marginal prices (LMPs) for the next 5-min interval and advisory commitment, dispatch schedule and prices for the remaining scheduling horizon. Variable time resolution and variable modeling complexity are used in order to reduce computational requirements. A finer time resolution and detailed modeling are used during the first hours of the scheduling horizon while coarser time resolution and simplified modeling during the last ones. The viability of the method for medium-sized systems is demonstrated through its application to the Greek power system.

Abstract: Along with the increasing penetration of renewable energy, distribution system power flow may be significantly altered in terms of direction and magnitude. This will make delivering reliable power, on demand, a major challenge. In this paper, a novel battery energy storage system (BESS) based energy acquisition model is proposed for the operation of distribution companies (DISCOs) in regulating price or locational marginal price (LMP) mechanisms, while considering energy provision options within DISCO controlled areas. Based on this new model, a new battery operation strategy is proposed for better utilization of energy storage system (ESS) and mitigation operational risk from price volatility. Meanwhile, optimal sizing and siting decisions for BESS is obtained through a cost-benefit analysis method, which aims at maximizing the DISCO's profit from energy transactions, system planning and operation cost savings. The proposed energy acquisition model and ESS control strategy are verified on a modified IEEE 15-bus distribution network, and risk mitigation is also quantified in two different markets. The promising results show that the capacity requirement for ESS can be reduced and the operational risk can also be mitigated.

Abstract: The security-constrained unit commitment problem schedules power generators to minimize cost subject to operating constraints. Reserve requirements ensure that reserve is available to re-balance the system following a contingency but do not guarantee reliability in congested systems where reserve activation is limited by transmission constraints. Operators improve reserve deliverability by limiting power flows and controlling the location of reserves. Zones are used to address inter-zonal congestion but operators lack efficient ways to handle intra-zonal congestion. We propose dynamically relating minimum reserve levels to transmission stress in a computationally efficient approach that complements existing reserve models from the literature. Analysis on the IEEE RTS 96 test case demonstrates the approach can mitigate intra-zonal congestion more economically than traditional reserve policies.
