Abstract: Short-term load modeling and forecasting are essential for operating power utilities profitably and securely. Modern machine learning approaches, such as neural networks, have been used for this purpose. This paper proposes using the alternative technique of abductive networks, which offers the advantages of simplified and more automated model synthesis and analytical input-output models that automatically select influential inputs, provide better insight and explanations, and allow comparison with statistical and empirical models. Using hourly temperature and load data for five years, 24 dedicated models for forecasting next-day hourly loads have been developed. Evaluated on data for the sixth year, the models give an overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.67%. Next-hour models utilizing available load data up to the forecasting hour give a MAPE of 1.14%, outperforming neural network models for the same utility data. Two methods of accounting for the load growth trend achieve comparable performance. Effects of varying model complexity are investigated and proposals made for further improving forecasting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach based on the harmony search algorithm to optimally determine suitable wavelet functions and wavelet decomposition levels for accurate fault classification in transmission lines, unlike previous works in which only one arbitrary wavelet function is used. Discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the features in the voltage and/or current signals using the identified wavelet functions. Machine learning classifiers are then used to build a proper classification model to automate the fault classification process. The results of applying the proposed approach are presented and discussed, and conclusions are drawn.

Abstract: A Fuzzy Basis Function Network (FBFN) based Power System Stabilizer (PSS) is presented in this paper to improve power system dynamic stability. The proposed FBFN based PSS provides a natural framework for combining numerical and linguistic information in a uniform fashion. The proposed FBFN is trained over a wide range of operating conditions in order to re-tune the PSS parameters in real-time based on machine loading conditions. The orthogonal least squares (OLS) learning algorithm is developed for designing an adequate and parsimonious FBFN model. Time domain simulations of a single machine infinite bus system and a multimachine power system subject to major disturbances are investigated. The performance of the proposed FBFN PSS is compared with that of conventional (CPSS). The results show the capability of the proposed FBFN PSS to enhance the system damping of local modes of oscillations over a wide range of operating conditions. The decentralized nature of the proposed FBEN PSS makes it easy to install and tune.

Abstract: A hybrid Genetic Rule-Based Power System Stabilizer (GRBPSS) is presented in this paper. The proposed approach uses genetic algorithms (GA) to search for optimal settings of rule-based power system stabilizer (RBPSS) parameters. Incorporation of GA in RBPSSs design will add an intelligent dimension to these stabilizers and significantly reduce the time consumed in the design process. It is shown in this paper that the performance of RBPSS can be improved significantly by incorporating a genetic-based learning mechanism. The performance of the proposed GRBPSS under different disturbances and loading conditions is investigated for a single machine infinite bus system and two multimachine power systems. The results show the superiority of the proposed GRBPSS as compared to both conventional lead-lag PSS (CPSS) and classical RBPSS. The capability of the proposed GRBPSS to damp out the local as well as the interarea modes of oscillations is also demonstrated.

Abstract: This paper proposes a predictive segmentation technique for identifying sub-groups in a large population that are both homogeneous with respect to certain patterns in customer attributes, and predictive with respect to a desired outcome. Our motivation is creating a highly-interpretable and intuitive segmentation and targeting process for customers of energy utility companies that is also optimal in some sense. In this setting, the energy utility wants to design a small number of message types to be sent to appropriately-chosen customers who are most likely to respond to different types of communications. The proposed method uses consumption, demographics, and program enrollment data to extract basic predictive patterns using standard machine learning techniques. We next define a feasible potential assignment of patterns to a small number of segments described by expert guidelines and hypotheses about consumer characteristics, which are available from prior behavioral research. The algorithm then identifies an optimal allocation of patterns to segments that is feasible and maximizes predictive power. This is formulated as maximizing the minimum enrollment rate from across the segments, which is then expressed as solving a mixed-integer linear-fractional program. We propose a bisection-based method to quickly solve this program by means of identifying feasible sets. We exemplify the methodology on a large-scale dataset from a leading U.S. energy utility, and obtain segments of customers whose likelihood of enrollment is more than twice larger than that of the average population, and that are described by a small number of simple, intuitive rules. The segments designed this way achieve a 2-3 x improvement in the probability of enrollment over the overall population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Due to the high-measuring cost, the monitoring of power quality (PQ) is nontrivial. This paper is aimed at reducing the cost of PQ monitoring in power network. Using a real-world PQ dataset, this paper adopts a learn-from-data approach to obtain a device latent feature model, which captures the device behavior as a PQ transition function. With the latent feature model, the power network could be modeled, in analogy, as a data-driven network, which presents the opportunity to use the well-investigated network monitoring and data estimation algorithms to solve the network quality monitoring problem in power grid. Based on this network model, algorithms are proposed to intelligently place measurement devices on suitable power links to reduce the uncertainty of PQ estimation on unmonitored power links. The meter placement algorithms use entropy-based measurements and Bayesian network models to identify the most suitable power links for PQ meter placement. Evaluation results on various simulated networks including IEEE distribution test feeder system show that the meter placement solution is efficient, and has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty of PQ values on unmonitored power links.

Abstract: Real-time energy management systems that are designed to support consumer supply and demand spectrums of electrical energy continue to face challenges with respect to designing accurate and reliable real-time forecasts due to the stochasticity of model construction data and the model's inability to disseminate both the short- and the long-term electrical energy demand (G) predictions. Using real G data from Queensland, Australia's second largest state, and employing the support vector regression (SVR) model integrated with an improved version of empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) tool, this study aims to propose a novel hybrid model: ICEEM-DAN-PSO-SVR. Optimization of the model's weights and biases was performed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. ICEEMDAN was applied to improve the hybrid model's forecasting accuracy, addressing non-linear and non-stationary issues in time series inputs by decomposing statistically significant historical G data into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and a residual component. The ICEEMDAN-PSO-SVR model was then individually constructed to forecast IMIs and the residual datasets and the final G forecasts were obtained by aggregating the IMF and residual forecasted series. The performance of the ICEEMDAN-PSO-SVR technique was compared with alternative approaches: ICEEMDAN-multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and ICEEM-DAN-M5 model tree, as well as traditional modelling approaches: PSO-SVR, MARS and M5 model tree algorithms. To develop the models, data were partitioned into different subsets: training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%), and the tuned forecasting models with near global optimum solutions were applied and evaluated at multiple horizons: short-term (i.e., weekends, working days, whole weeks, and public holidays), and long-term (monthly). Statistical metrics including the root-mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and their relative to observed means (RRMSE and MAPE), Willmott's Index (WI), the Legates and McCabe Index (E-LM) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (E-NS), were used to assess model accuracy in the independent (testing) period. Empirical results showed that the ICEEMDAN-PSO-SVR model performed well for all forecasting horizons, outperforming the alternative comparison approaches: ICEEMDAN-MARS and ICEEMDAN-M5 model tree and the PSO-SVR, PSO-MARS and PSO-M5 model tree algorithm. Due to its high predictive utility, the two-phase ICEEMDAN-PSO-SVR hybrid model was particularly appropriate for whole week forecasts (E-NS = 0.95, MAPE = 0.89%, RRMSE = 1.22%, and E-LM = 0.79), and monthly forecasts (E-NS = 0.70, MAPE = 2.18%, RRMSE = 3.18%, and E-LM = 0.56). The excellent performance of the ICEEMDAN-PSO-SVR hybrid model indicates that the two-phase hybrid model should be explored for potential applications in real-time energy management systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a decision tree based method for out-of-step prediction of synchronous generators. For distinguishing between stable and out-of-step conditions, a series of measurements are taken under various fault scenarios including operational and topological disturbances. The data of input features and output target classes are used as the input-output pairs for decision tree induction and deduction. The merit of decision tree based detection of transient instability lies in robust classification of new unseen samples. The performance of the proposed method is verified on two test cases including a 9-bus dynamic network and the practical 1696-bus Iran national grid. The simulation results are presented for various input features and learning parameters.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) panels are a very promising technology that answers part of the increasing need for global renewable energy production, particularly in urban areas. We present a novel methodology combining Geographic Information Systems (GIS), solar models and a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, Random Forests, to estimate the potential for rooftop PV solar energy at the scale of a country. We use a hierarchical approach which divides the computation of the final potential into several steps. Each step is reached by estimating multiple variables of interest using widely available data, and combining these variables into potential values. The method for estimating each variable of interest is as follows: (1) collect all the data related to the variable, (2) train a Random Forest model based on the collected data and (3) use the model to predict the variables in unknown locations. The variables of interest include available area for PV installation on rooftops, shape, slope and direction of rooftops, global solar horizontal and tilted radiations, as well as shading factors over rooftops. The study focuses on Switzerland and provides the rooftop PV technical potential for each (200 x 200) [m(2)] pixel of a grid covering the entire country. The methodology, however, is generalizable to any region for which similar data is available and could therefore be useful for researchers, energy service companies, stockholders and municipalities to assess the rooftop PV capacity of the region. Prediction Intervals are also provided for the different estimated variables, in order to measure the uncertainty of the estimations. The results show that Switzerland has a large potential for rooftop PV installations. More specifically, for roofs orientated at +/- 90 degrees from due south, the total estimated potential PV electricity production is about 16.29 TWh/year, which corresponds to 25.3% of the total electricity demand in 2017.

Abstract: Demand management in residential buildings is a key component toward sustainability and efficiency in urban environments. The recent advancements in sensor based technologies hold the promise of novel energy consumption models that can better characterize the underlying patterns.
In this paper, we propose a probabilistic data-driven predictive model for consumption forecasting in residential buildings. The model is based on Bayesian network (BN) framework which is able to discover dependency relations between contributing variables. Thus, we can relax the assumptions that are often made in traditional forecasting models. Moreover, we are able to efficiently capture the uncertainties in input variables and quantify their effect on the system output. We test our proposed approach to the data provided by Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) which has been collected through a pilot Smart Grid project.
We examine the performance of our model in a multiscale setting by considering various temporal (i.e., 15 min, hourly intervals) and spatial (i.e., all households in a region, each household) resolutions for analyzing data. Demand forecasting at the individual households' levels is a first step toward designing personalized and targeted policies for each customer. While this is a widely studied topic in digital marketing, few researches have been done in the energy sector. The results indicate that Bayesian networks can be efficiently used for probabilistic energy modeling in residential buildings by discovering the dependencies between variables.

Abstract: The importance of wind power as a renewable and cost-efficient power generation technology is growing globally. The impact of wind power on the existing power system, land use, and others over time has been widely studied. Such wind integration studies, especially when they are designed as retrospective bottom-up studies, rely on detailed wind turbine data, including the geographic locations, hub height, and dates of commission. Given the frequency of gaps present in these data sets, basic concepts have been developed to cope with missing data points. In this paper, multiple advanced algorithms were compared with respect to their ability to complete such data sets. One focus was on the selection of predictor variables to analyze the impact of different completion techniques depending on the specific gaps in the data set. A sample application using a German data set indicated that random forests are particularly well suited to the problem at hand.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) is becoming increasingly important as the volatility on the grid continues to increase. Current DR approaches are predominantly completely manual and rule-based or involve deriving first principles based models which are extremely cost and time prohibitive to build. We consider the problem of data-driven end-user DR for large buildings which involves predicting the demand response baseline, evaluating fixed rule based DR strategies and synthesizing DR control actions. The challenge is in evaluating and taking control decisions at fast time scales in order to curtail the power consumption of the building, in return for a financial reward. We provide a model based control with regression trees algorithm (mbCRT), which allows us to perform closed-loop control for DR strategy synthesis for large commercial buildings. Our data-driven control synthesis algorithm outperforms rule-based DR by 17% for a large DoE commercial reference building and leads to a curtailment of up to 380 kW and over $45,000 in savings. Our methods have been integrated into an open source tool called DR-Advisor, which acts as a recommender system for the building's facilities manager and provides suitable control actions to meet the desired load curtailment while maintaining operations and maximizing the economic reward. DR-Advisor achieves 92.8-98.9% prediction accuracy for 8 buildings on Penn's campus. We compare DR-Advisor with other data driven methods and rank 2nd on ASHRAE's benchmarking data-set for energy prediction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy consumption control in energy intensive companies is always more considered as a critical activity to continuously improve energy performance. It undoubtedly requires a huge effort in data gathering and analysis, and the amount of these data together with the scarceness of human resources devoted to Energy Management activities who could maintain and update the analyses' output are often the main barriers to its diffusion in companies. Advanced tools such as software based on machine learning techniques are therefore the key to overcome these barriers and allow an easy but accurate control. This type of systems is able to solve complex problems obtaining reliable results over time, but not to understand when the reliability of the results is declining (a common situation considering energy using systems, often undergoing structural changes) and to automatically adapt itself using a limited amount of training data, so that a completely automatic application is not yet available and the automatic energy consumption control using intelligent systems is still a challenge.
This paper presents a whole new approach to energy consumption control, proposing a methodology based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and aimed at creating an automatic energy consumption control system.
First of all, three different structures of neural networks are proposed and trained using a huge amount of data. Three different performance indicators are then used to identify the most suitable structure, which is implemented to create an energy consumption control tool. In addition, considering that huge amount of data are not always available in practice, a method to identify the minimum period of data collection to obtain reliable results and the maximum period of usability is described. The general purpose of the work is to allow the automatic utilization of this kind of tools, so a method to identify a lack of accuracy in the model and two different retraining methods are proposed and compared (Mobile Training and Growing Training).
The whole approach is eventually applied to the case study of a tertiary building in Rome (Italy). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy meters need to be calibrated for use in Measurement and Verification (M&V) projects. However, calibration can be prohibitively expensive and affect project feasibility negatively. This study presents a novel low-cost in-situ meter data calibration technique using a relatively low accuracy commercial energy meter as a calibrator. Calibration is achieved by combining two machine learning tools: the SIMulation EXtrapolation (SIMEX) Measurement Error Model and Bayesian regression. The model is trained or calibrated on half-hourly building energy data for 24 h. Measurements are then compared to the true values over the following months to verify the method. Results show that the hybrid method significantly improves parameter estimates and goodness of fit when compared to Ordinary Least Squares regression or standard SIMEX. This study also addresses the effect of mismeasurement in energy monitoring, and implements a powerful technique for mitigating the bias that arises because of it. Meters calibrated by the technique presented have adequate accuracy for most M&V applications, at a significantly lower cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks can be used as intelligent controllers to control nonlinear, dynamic systems through learning, which can easily accommodate the nonlinearities and time dependencies. Taking advantage of the characteristics of a generalized neuron (GN), that requires much smaller training data and shorter training time, a GN-based adaptive power system stabilizer (GNAPSS) is proposed. It consists of a GN as an identifier, which predicts the plant dynamics one step ahead, and a GN as a controller to damp low frequency oscillations. Results of studies with a GN-based PSS on a five-machine power system show that it can provide good damping of both local and inter-area modes of oscillations over a wide operating range and significantly improve the dynamic performance of the system.

Abstract: Kernel-based methods, such as support vector regression (SVR), have demonstrated satisfactory performance in short-term load forecasting (STLF) application. However, the good performance of kernel-based method depends on the selection of an appropriate kernel function that fits the learning target, unsuitable kernel function or hyper-parameters setting may lead to significantly poor performance. To get the optimal kernel function of STLF problem, this paper proposes a kernel-based SVR combination model by using a novel individual model selection algorithm. Moreover, the proposed combination model provides a new way to kernel function selection of SVR model. The performance and electric load forecast accuracy of the proposed model are assessed by means of real data from the Australia and California Power Grid, respectively. The simulation results from numerical tables and figures show that the proposed combination model increases electric load forecasting accuracy compared to the best individual kernel-based SVR model.

Abstract: Load forecasting is usually made by constructing models on relative information, such as climate and previous load demand data. In 2001, EUNITE network organized a competition aiming at mid-term load forecasting (predicting daily maximum load of the next 31 days). During the competition we proposed a support vector machine (SVM) model, which was the winning entry, to solve the problem. In this paper, we discuss in detail how SVM, a new learning technique, is successfully applied to load forecasting. In addition, motivated by the competition results and the approaches by other participants, more experiments and deeper analyses are conducted and presented here. Some important conclusions from the results are that temperature (or other types of climate information) might not be useful in such a mid-term load forecasting problem and that the introduction of time-series concept may improve the forecasting.

Abstract: Monitoring is a crucial aspect of geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration risk management. Effective monitoring is critical to ensure CO2 is safely and permanently stored throughout the life-cycle of a geologic CO2 sequestration project. Effective monitoring involves deciding: (i) where is the optimal location to place the monitoring well(s), and (ii) what type of data (pressure, temperature, CO2 saturation, etc.) should be measured taking into consideration the uncertainties at geologic sequestration sites. We have developed a filtering-based data assimilation procedure to design effective monitoring approaches. To reduce the computational cost of the filtering-based data assimilation process, a machine-learning algorithm: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines is used to derive computationally efficient reduced order models from results of full-physics numerical simulations of CO2 injection in saline aquifer and subsequent multi-phase fluid flow. We use example scenarios of CO2 leakage through legacy wellbore and demonstrate a monitoring strategy can be selected with the aim of reducing uncertainty in metrics related to CO2 leakage. We demonstrate the proposed framework with two synthetic examples: a simple validation case and a more complicated case including multiple monitoring wells. The examples demonstrate that the proposed approach can be effective in developing monitoring approaches that take into consideration uncertainties.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel method for fault detection and classification in power transmission lines based on convolutional sparse autoencoder. Contrary to conventional methods, the proposed method automatically learns features from a dataset of voltage and current signals, on the basis of which a framework for fault detection and classification is created. Convolutional feature mapping and mean pooling are implemented in order to generate feature vectors with local translation-invariance for half-cycle multi-channel signal segments. Fault detection and classification are achieved by a softmax classifier using the feature vectors. Further, the proposed method is tested under different sampling frequencies and signal types. The generalizability of the proposed method is also verified by adding noise and measurement errors to the data. Results show that the proposed method is fast and accurate in detecting and classifying faults, and is practical for online transmission line protection for its high robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely applied in electricity price forecasts due to their nonlinear modeling capabilities. However, it is well known that in general, traditional training methods for ANNs such as back-propagation (BP) approach are normally slow and it could be trapped into local optima. In this paper, a fast electricity market price forecast method is proposed based on a recently emerged learning method for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, the extreme learning machine (ELM), to overcome these drawbacks. The new approach also has improved price intervals forecast accuracy by incorporating bootstrapping method for uncertainty estimations. Case studies based on chaos time series and Australian National Electricity Market price series show that the proposed method can effectively capture the nonlinearity from the highly volatile price data series with much less computation time compared with other methods. The results show the great potential of this proposed approach for online accurate price forecasting for the spot market prices analysis.

Abstract: This article proposes a two-stage design optimization approach which is applied to a prototype passively designed high-rise residential building under different ventilation modes and thermal load requirements. Machine learning methods are employed to develop surrogate models for improving the computation efficiency of the multi-objective optimization process. The surrogate model is trained by modeling experiments with EnergyPlus and R, which can provide reliable energy performance indicators of generic building models featuring passive design parameters including the building layout, envelope thermophysics, building geometry and infiltration & air-tightness. The lighting, cooling and heating demands of the generic building model are determined by the hybrid ventilation and light diming control strategies in compliance with local green building assessment criteria in Hong Kong. The multiple linear regression (MLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and support vector machines (SVM) are examined by the statistical modelling. SVM is capable of fitting a surrogate model with the best prediction performance based on the coefficient of determination and root mean square error. In addition, both single-sided ventilation and cross-ventilation models under varied thermal load requirements are investigated to compare the preferable design solutions for each scenario. The multi-stage optimization approach is also applied to a Mediterranean climate to explore optimal design solutions in more diverse external environmental conditions. This research can provide a highly efficient design optimization tool to appropriately deploy passive architectural strategies in a green building project.

Abstract: Reliable and highly-generalized prediction models of short-term electric demand are urgently needed for the building sector, as the crucial basis of sophisticated building energy management. Advances in metering technologies and machine learning methods provide both opportunities and challenges for modified approaches. With multi-resolution wavelet decomposition (MWD) as a preprocessing from the point of view of signal analysis, the hybrid support vector regression (SVR) model was applied in two case study buildings to predict the hourly electric demand intensity. Taking ten-dimensional parameters of 29 workdays as the training sample, this model was carried out in a mall and a hotel, the consumed electric demand sequences of which represented the stationary and non-stationary series respectively. By comparisons between the hybrid SVR and the pure SVR, results indicated that the introduction of MWD can always improve the predicting accuracy for the hotel, while it is not necessary for the mall. Specifically, the similar steady level around 0.65 W/m(2) of absolute error was obtained for the mall and the hotel buildings, when a was lower than 0.1. At the same time, the steady quantitative values of relative errors tended to be around 4% and 6% respectively for the hotel and the mall. Based on the limited historical readings, this paper offers an on-line prediction method of short-term electric demand, which is applicable for the further smart energy management.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of photovoltaic (PV) arrays is important for improving the reliability, efficiency and safety of PV power stations, because the PV arrays usually operate in harsh outdoor environment and tend to suffer various faults. Due to the nonlinear output characteristics and varying operating environment of PV arrays, many machine learning based fault diagnosis methods have been proposed. However, there still exist some issues: fault diagnosis performance is still limited due to insufficient monitored information; fault diagnosis models are not efficient to be trained and updated; labeled fault data samples are hard to obtain by field experiments. To address these issues, this paper makes contribution in the following three aspects: (1) based on the key points and model parameters extracted from monitored I-V characteristic curves and environment condition, an effective and efficient feature vector of seven dimensions is proposed as the input of the fault diagnosis model; (2) the emerging kernel based extreme learning machine (KELM), which features extremely fast learning speed and good generalization performance, is utilized to automatically establish the fault diagnosis model. Moreover, the Nelder-Mead Simplex (NMS) optimization method is employed to optimize the KELM parameters which affect the classification performance; (3) an improved accurate Simulink based PV modeling approach is proposed for a laboratory PV array to facilitate the fault simulation and data sample acquisition. Intensive fault experiments are carried out on the both laboratory PV array and the PV model to acquire abundant simulated and experimental fault data samples. The optimized KELM is then applied to train the fault diagnosis model using the data samples. Both the simulation and experimental results show that the optimized KELM based fault diagnosis model can achieve high accuracy, reliability, and good generalization performance.

Abstract: Smart grids are a promising solution to the rapidly growing power demand because they can considerably increase building energy efficiency. This study developed a novel time-series sliding window metaheuristic optimization-based machine learning system for predicting real-time building energy consumption data collected by a smart grid. The proposed system integrates a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and metaheuristic firefly algorithm-based least squares support vector regression (MetaFA-LSSVR) model. Specifically, the proposed system fits the SARIMA model to linear data components in the first stage, and the MetaFA-LSSVR model captures nonlinear data components in the second stage. Real-time data retrieved from an experimental smart grid installed in a building were used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed system. A kappa-week sliding window approach is proposed for employing historical data as input for the novel time-series forecasting system. The prediction system yielded high and reliable accuracy rates in 1-day-ahead predictions of building energy consumption, with a total error rate of 1.181% and mean absolute error of 0.026 kW h. Notably, the system demonstrates an improved accuracy rate in the range of 36.8-113.2% relative to those of the linear forecasting model (i.e., SARIMA) and nonlinear forecasting models (i.e., LSSVR and MetaFA-LSSVR). Therefore, end users can further apply the forecasted information to enhance efficiency of energy usage in their buildings, especially during peak times. In particular, the system can potentially be scaled up for using big data framework to predict building energy consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High-fidelity and computationally efficient energy forecasting models for building systems are needed to ensure optimal automatic operation, reduce energy consumption, and improve the building's resilience capability to power disturbances. Various models have been developed to forecast building energy consumption. However, given buildings have different characteristics and operating conditions, model performance varies. Existing research has mainly taken a trial-and-error approach by developing multiple models and identifying the best performer for a specific building, or presumed one universal model form which is applied on different building cases. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a generalized system framework which can recommend appropriate models to forecast the building energy profiles based on building characteristics. To bridge this research gap, we propose a meta-learning based framework, termed Building Energy Model Recommendation System (BEMR). Based on the building's physical features as well as statistical and time series meta-features extracted from the operational data and energy consumption data, BEMR is able to identify the most appropriate load forecasting model for each unique building. Three sets of experiments on 48 test buildings and one real building were conducted. The first experiment was to test the accuracy of BEMR when the training data and testing data cover the same condition. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 90% of the buildings. The second experiment was to test the robustness of the BEMR when the testing data is only partially covered by the training data. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 83% of the buildings. The third experiment uses a real building case to validate the proposed framework and the result shows promising applicability and extensibility. The experimental results show that BEMR is capable of adapting to a wide variety of building types ranging from a restaurant to a large office, and gives excellent performance in terms of both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: A novel approach for the automatic reconfiguration of shipboard power systems (SPS) based on Q-learning has been investigated. Using this approach it is possible to obtain an optimal set of switches to open/close, in order to restore power to the loads, such that the weighted sum of the power delivered to the loads is maximized. This approach differs significantly from other methods previously studied for reconfiguration as it is a dynamic technique that produces not only the final reconfiguration, but also the correct order in which the switches are to be changed. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

Abstract: A solar radiation forecasting model can be utilized is a scientific contrivance for investigating future viability of solar energy potentials. In this paper, a wavelet-coupled support vector machine (W-SVM) model was adopted to forecast global incident solar radiation based on the sunshine hours (S-t), minimum temperature (T-max), maximum temperature (T-max), windspeed (U), evaporation (E) and precipitation (P) as the predictor variables. To ascertain conclusive results, the merit of the W-SVM was benchmarked with the classical SVM model. For daily forecasting, sixteen months of data (01-March-2014 to 30-June-2015) partitioned into the train (65%) and test (35%) set for the three metropolitan stations (Brisbane City, Cairns Aero and Townsville Aero) were utilized. Data were decomposed into their wavelet sub-series by discrete wavelet transformation algorithm and summed up to create new series with one approximation and four levels of detail using Daubechies-2 mother wavelet. For daily forecasting, six model scenarios were formulated where the number of input was increased and the forecast was assessed by statistical metrics (correlation coefficient r; Willmott's index d; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient E-Ns; peak deviation P-dv), distribution statistics and prediction errors (mean absolute error MAE; root mean square error RMSE; mean absolute percentage error MAPE; relative root mean square error RMSE). Results for daily forecasts showed that the W-SVM model outperformed the classical SVM model for optimum input combinations. A sensitivity analysis with single predictor variables yielded the best performance with S-t as an input, confirming that the largest contributions for forecasting solar energy is derived from the sunshine hours per day compared to the other prescribed inputs. All six inputs were required in the optimum W-SVM for Brisbane and Cairns stations to yield r = 0.928, d = 0.927, E-Ns = 0.858, P-dv = 1.757%, MAE = 1.819 MJ m(-2) and r = 0.881, d = 0.870, E-Ns = 0.762, P-dv = 9.633%, MAE = 2.086 MJ m(-2), respectively. However, for Townsville, the time-series of S-t, T-min, and T-max and E were required in the optimum model to yield r = 0.858, d = 0.886, E-Ns = 0.722, P-dv = 10.282% and MAE = 2.167 MJ m(-2). In terms of the relative model errors over daily forecast horizon, W-SVM model was the most accurate precise for Townsville (RRMSE = 12.568%; MAPE = 12.666%) followed by Brisbane (13.313%; 13.872%) and Cairns (14.467%; 15.675%) weather stations. A set of alternative models developed over the monthly, seasonal and annual forecast horizons verified the long-term forecasting skill, where lagged inputs of T-max, T-min, E, P and VP for Roma Post Office and Toowoomba Regional stations were employed. The wavelet-coupled model performed well, with r = 0.965, d = 0.964, P-dv = 2.249%, RRMSE = 5.942% and MAPE = 4.696% (Roma) and r = 0.958, d = 0.943, P-dv = 0.979%, RRMSE = 7.66% and MAPE = 6.20% (Toowoomba). Accordingly, the results conclusively ascertained the importance of wavelet-coupled SVM predictive model as a qualified stratagem for short and long-term forecasting of solar energy for assessment of solar energy prospectivity in this study region.

Abstract: Various models based on measure-correlate-predict (MCP) methods have been used to estimate the long-term wind turbine power output (WTPO) at target sites for which only short-term meteorological data are available. The MCP models used to date share the postulate that the influence of air density variation is of little importance, assume the standard value of 1.225 kg m(-3) and only consider wind turbines (WTs) with blade pitch control.
A performance assessment is undertaken in this paper of the models used to date and of newly proposed models. Our models incorporate air density in the MCP model as an additional covariable in long-term WTPO estimation and consider both WTs with blade pitch control and stall-regulated WTs. The advantages of including this covariable are assessed using different functional forms and different machine learning algorithms for their implementation (Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine for regression and Random Forest).
The models and the regression techniques used in them were applied to the mean hourly wind speeds and directions and air densities recorded in 2014 at ten weather stations in the Canary Archipelago (Spain). Several conclusions were drawn from the results, including most notably: (a) to clearly show the notable effect of air density variability when estimating WTPOs, it is important to consider the functional ways in which the features air density and wind speed and direction intervene, (b) of the five MCP models under comparison, the one that separately estimates wind speeds and air densities to later predict the WTPOs always provided the best mean absolute error, mean absolute relative error and coefficient of determination metrics, independently of the target station and type of WT under consideration, (c) the models which used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for regression or random forests (RFs) always provided better metrics than those that used artificial neural networks, with the differences being statistically significant (5% significance) for most of the cases assessed, (d) no statistically significant differences were found between the SVM- and RF-based models.

Abstract: Accurate forecasts of electrical substations are mandatory for the efficiency of the Advanced Distribution Automation functions in distribution systems. The paper describes the design of a class of machine-learning models, namely neural networks, for the load forecasts of medium-voltage/low-voltage substations. We focus on the methodology of neural network model design in order to obtain a model that has the best achievable predictive ability given the available data. Variable selection and model selection are applied to electrical load forecasts to ensure an optimal generalization capacity of the neural network model. Real measurements collected in French distribution systems are used to validate our study. The results show that the neural network-based models outperform the time series models and that the design methodology guarantees the best generalization ability of the neural network model for the load forecasting purpose based on the same data.

Abstract: In an electricity market, the main goal of a generation company (GenCo) is to maximize its profit, while encountering the uncertainty of the electricity price forecast. Different risk measures have been proposed to cope with this source of uncertainty. However, those are usually before-the-fact performance indices and cannot give a measure for the financial loss/gain (FLG) of a GenCo considering the electricity prices actually realized in the market. This paper focuses on this matter. The time series of FLG is first constructed given the real conditions of the electricity market. Then, the FLG time series is quantized using Silhouette criterion and k-means clustering approach. Subsequently, based on the historical values of the quantized FLG time series and relevant exogenous variables, its day-ahead values are predicted. The method proposed for day-ahead FLG prediction consist of conditional mutual information and sequential forward search as the feature selection technique and extreme learning machine as the forecasting engine. The effectiveness of the whole proposed approach, including the FLG time series construction, quantization approach, and the prediction method, is shown for a typicalGenCo using the real data of the PJM and Ontario electricity markets.

Abstract: Many studies have proven that the building sector can significantly benefit from replacing the current practice rule-based controllers (RBC) by more advanced control strategies like model predictive control (MPC). However, the optimization-based control algorithms, like MPC, impose increasing hardware and software requirements, together with more complicated error handling capabilities required from the commissioning staff. In recent years, several studies introduced promising remedy for these problems by using machine learning algorithms. The idea is based on devising simplified control laws learned from MPC. The main advantage of the proposed methods stems from their easy implementation even on low-level hardware. However, most of the reported studies were dealing only with problems with a limited complexity of the parametric space, and devising laws only for a single control variable, which inevitably limits their applicability to more complex building control problems. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework for synthesis of simple, yet well-performing control strategies that mimic the behavior of optimization-based controllers, also for large scale multiple-input-multiple output (MIMO) control problems which are common in the building sector. The approach employs multivariate regression and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Particularly, deep time delay neural networks (TDNN) and regression trees (RT) are used to derive the dependency of multiple real-valued control inputs on parameters. The complexity of the problem, as well as implementation cost, are further reduced by selecting the most significant features from the set of parameters. This reduction is based on straightforward manual selection, principal component analysis (PCA) and dynamic analysis of the building model. The approach is demonstrated on a case study employing temperature control in a six-zone building, described by a linear model with 286 states and 42 disturbances, resulting in an MPC problem with more than thousand of parameters. The results show that simplified control laws retain most of the performance of the complex MPC, while significantly decreasing the complexity and implementation cost.

Abstract: EnergyPlus is the U.S. Department of Energy's flagship whole-building energy simulation engine and provides extensive simulation capabilities. However, the computational cost of these capabilities has resulted in annual building simulations that typically requires 2-3 min of wall-clock time to complete. While EnergyPlus's overall speed is improving (EnergyPlus 7.0 is 25-40% faster than EnergyPlus 6.0), the overall computational burden still remains and is the top user complaint. In other engineering domains, researchers substitute surrogate or approximate models for the computationally expensive simulations to improve simulation and reduce calibration time. Previous work has successfully demonstrated small-scale EnergyPlus surrogate models that use 10-16 input variables to estimate a single output variable. This work leverages feed forward neural networks and Lasso regression to construct robust large-scale EnergyPlus surrogate models based on 3 benchmark datasets that have 7-156 inputs. These models were able to predict 15-min values for most of the 80-90 simulation outputs deemed most important by domain experts within 5% (whole building energy within 0.07%) and calculate those results within 3 s, greatly reducing the required simulation runtime for relatively close results. The techniques shown here allow any software to be approximated by machine learning in a way that allows one to quantify the trade-off of accuracy for execution time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how a computational approach to learning from interactions, called reinforcement learning (RL), can be applied to control power systems. We describe some challenges in power system control and discuss how some of those challenges could be met by using these RL methods. The difficulties associated with their application to control power systems are described and discussed as well as strategies that can be adopted to overcome them. Two reinforcement learning modes are considered: the online mode in which the interaction occurs with the real power system and the offline mode in which the interaction occurs with a simulation model of the real power system. We present two case studies made on a four-machine power system model. The first one concerns the design by means of RL algorithms used in offline mode of a dynamic brake controller. The second concerns RL methods used in online mode when applied to control a thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) aimed to damp power system oscillations.

Abstract: A machine learning based prediction method is proposed in this paper to determine the potential outage of power grid components in response to an imminent hurricane. The decision boundary, which partitions the components' states into two sets of damaged and operational, is obtained via logistic regression by using a second-order function and proper parameter fitting. Two metrics are examined to validate the performance of the obtained decision boundary in efficiently predicting component outages.

Abstract: Short-term building cooling load prediction is the essential foundation for many building energy management tasks, such as fault detection and diagnosis, demand-side management and control optimization. Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way.
This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a device that transforms chemical energy in wastewater into electricity, and its performance is influenced by multi-variables. Mathematic modeling approach could be a useful alternative to design and optimize such a complex system for power generation and wastewater treatment. Here we develop a novel integrated modeling approach with uniform design (UD), a machine learning approach of relevance vector machine (RVM) and a global searching algorithm of accelerating genetic algorithm (AGA) to optimize the operation of multi-variable MFCs after they are constructed. With the integrated UD-RVM-AGA approach, a maximum Coulombic efficiency of 73.0% and power density of 1097 mW/m(3) of MFC are estimated under the optimal conditions of ionic concentration of 102 mM, initial pH of 7.75, medium nitrogen concentration of 48.4 mg/L, and temperature of 30.6 degrees C. The Coulombic efficiency and power density in the verification experiments, 70.9% and 1156 mW/m(3), are close to those calculated by the modeling approach. The results demonstrate that the integrated UD-RVM-AGA approach is effective and reliable to optimize the complex MFC and improve its performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated controller to regulate the terminal voltage of generators as well as to mitigate power system oscillations, instead of employing the combination of the conventional power system stabilizer and automatic voltage regulator. This intelligent controller is an online trained self-recurrent wavelet neural network controller (OTSRWNNC). To achieve the aforementioned objectives, two control errors are simultaneously minimized by updating the parameters of OTSRWNNC. In addition, the adaptive learning rates derived by the discrete Lyapunov theory are used to enhance the convergence speed of proposed controller. The proposed controller does not require any identifier to approximate the dynamic of controlled power system, because of its high learning ability. The performance of proposed controller is evaluated on a single-machine infinite-bus power system and two large power systems. Simulation results and comparative studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed controller in stabilizing power systems in a wide range of loading conditions and different disturbances.

Abstract: With the growing wind penetration into the power system worldwide, improving wind power forecasting accuracy is becoming increasingly important to ensure continued economic and reliable power system operations. In this paper, a data-driven multi-model wind forecasting methodology is developed with a two-layer ensemble machine learning technique. The first layer is composed of multiple machine learning models that generate individual forecasts. A deep feature selection framework is developed to determine the most suitable inputs to the first layer machine learning models. Then, a blending algorithm is applied in the second layer to create an ensemble of the forecasts produced by first layer models and generate both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. This two-layer model seeks to utilize the statistically different characteristics of each machine learning algorithm. A number of machine learning algorithms are selected and compared in both layers. This developed multi-model wind forecasting methodology is compared to several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated to provide 1-hour-ahead Wind speed forecasting at seven locations of the Surface Radiation network. Numerical results show that comparing to the single-algorithm models, the developed multi-model framework with deep feature selection procedure has improved the forecasting accuracy by up to 30%.

Abstract: Actual technology improvements are contributing to DC and AC micro grid diffusion characterized by renewables photovoltaic and storage systems. Photovoltaic technologies have the advantage of a capillary distribution, but they are characterized by an intrinsic variable behavior due to continuously changing weather conditions. This drawback can be overcome by an appropriate temporal and energetic match among photovoltaic generation and storage capacity, so increasing micro grids reliability and efficiency levels. An accurate forecast of photovoltaic production can contribute to smooth photovoltaic systems intermittency problems so supporting generation and storage balance.
Many different forecasting algorithms have been proposed in literature to provide long, medium and short-term predictions of photovoltaic production. A criterion for selection among them is not a priori and it is not uniquely identifiable. In this paper, the attention is focused on eleven data-driven models to obtain 12 h ahead forecast, also including some models not usually used in solar field but successfully employed in other expertise fields. This study addresses simple linear models, as Multiple Linear Regression, nonlinear models, such as Classification And Regression Tree, Model Tree M5, Extreme Learning Machines, weighted k-Nearest Neighbors, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks and ensemble methods, as Random Forests, Cubist and Extreme Gradient Boosting. The goal is to compare methods characterized by different complexity levels to understand if a higher complexity model can provide better performances. Furthermore, the considered forecasting methodologies are compared applying two different training methodologies (online and offline) to identify the most performing training mode. The application of optimization algorithms permits to identify optima parameters and the optimum training dataset length for each model. After the optimization step, a statistical analysis is carried out to compare methods forecasting performances for the production of a 1 kW(p) photovoltaic plant installed at the ENEA Research Center of Portici. The case study results demonstrate promising forecasting performances applying the online training mode. Among all studied methods, Support Vector Machines, M5 and the Cubist can assure minima prediction errors and satisfying accuracy with optima dataset lengths. Cubist and M5 represent the best performing models since they are able to minimize prediction errors both in case of optima and minima training datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enable frequent computational cycles in online dynamic security assessment by using the terms of the transient energy function (TEF) as input features to a machine learning algorithm. The aim is to train a single classifier that is capable of classifying stable and unstable operating points independent of the contingency. The network is trained based on the current system topology and the loading conditions. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the New England 39-bus test power system model using the support vector machine as the machine learning technique. It is shown that the classifier can be trained using a small set of data when the terms of the TEF are used as input features. The prediction accuracy of the proposed scheme was tested under the balanced and unbalanced faults with the presence of voltage sensitive and dynamic loads for different operating points.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental coupling between loads and locational marginal prices (LMPs) in security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED). Theoretical analysis based on multi-parametric programming theory points out the unique one-to-one mapping between load and LMP vectors. Such one-to-one mapping is depicted by the concept of system pattern region (SPR) and identifying SPRs is the key to understanding the LMP-load coupling. Built upon the characteristics of SPRs, the SPR identification problem is modeled as a classification problem from a market participant's viewpoint, and a Support Vector Machine based data-driven approach is proposed. It is shown that even without the knowledge of system topology and parameters, the SPRs can be estimated by learning from historical load and price data. Visualization and illustration of the proposed data-driven approach are performed on a 3-bus system as well as the IEEE 118-bus system.

Abstract: Smart grid is a platform that enables the participants of electricity market to adjust their bidding strategies based on Demand-Side Management (DSM) models. Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand. Moreover, the interactive effects of demand-side management programs on load factor (load curve) and price signal are investigated by numerical indices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a new concept based on wavelet design and machine learning applied to nonintrusive load monitoring. The wavelet coefficients of length-6 filter are determined using procrustes analysis and are used to construct new wavelets to match the load signals to be detected, unlike previous work which used previously designed wavelet functions that are special cases of Daubechies filters to suit other nonpower system applications such as communications and image processing. The results of applying the new concept to a test system consisting of four loads have shown that the newly designed wavelet can improve the prediction accuracy compared with that obtained using Daubechies filter of order three while keeping the prominent features of the pattern in the detail levels.

Abstract: Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in renewable energy forecasting, uncertainty quantification is a key input to maintain acceptable levels of reliability and profitability in power system operation. A proposal is formulated and evaluated here for the case of solar power generation, when only power and meteorological measurements are available, without sky-imaging and information about cloud passages. Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution of forecast errors do not follow any of the common parametric densities. This therefore motivates the proposal of a nonparametric approach to generate very short-term predictive densities, i.e., for lead times between a few minutes to one hour ahead, with fast frequency updates. We rely on an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a fast regression model, trained in varied ways to obtain both point and quantile forecasts of solar power generation. Four probabilistic methods are implemented as benchmarks. Rival approaches are evaluated based on a number of test cases for two solar power generation sites in different climatic regions, allowing us to show that our approach results in generation of skilful and reliable probabilistic forecasts in a computationally efficient manner.

Abstract: Due to the imbalanced and uncompleted characteristics of complex petrochemical small datasets, it is a challenge to build an accurate prediction and optimization model of energy consumption of petrochemical systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel virtual sample generation (VSG) approach based on the Monte Carlo (MC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to improve the accuracy of the energy efficiency analysis on small data set problems. The proposed approach utilizes the MC and PSO algorithms to generate appropriate virtual samples based on the underlying information extracted from the small datasets. An accurate prediction model is presented using the extreme machine learning (ELM) in view of the synthetic data. The performance of the proposed model is validated via an application using a purified Terephthalic acid (PTA) solvent system and an ethylene production system. The experiment results demonstrate that the accuracy of the prediction model can be improved, and guidance for the production department to improve the energy efficiency, energy savings and emission reduction is provided under the small data circumstance.

Abstract: By using smart meters, more data about how businesses use energy is becoming available to energy retailers (providers). This is enabling innovation in the structure and type of tariffs on offer in the energy market. We have applied Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayesian Classifiers to a data set of the electrical power use by 12,000 businesses (in 44 sectors) to investigate predicting which businesses will gain or lose by switching between tariffs (a two-classes problem). We have used only three features of each company: their business sector, load profile category, and mean power use. We are particularly interested in the switch between a static tariff (fixed price or time-of-use) and a dynamic tariff (half-hourly pricing). We have extended the two-classes problem to include a price elasticity factor (a three-classes problem). We show how the classification error for the two- and three-classes problems varies with the amount of available data. Furthermore, we used Ordinary Least Squares and Support Vector Regression models to compute the exact values of the amount gained or lost by a business if it switched tariff types. Our analysis suggests that the machine learning classifiers required less data to reach useful performance levels than the regression models. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: There is growing interest in discerning behaviors of electricity users in both the residential and commercial sectors. With the advent of high-resolution time-series power demand data through advanced metering, mining this data could be costly from the computational viewpoint. One of the popular techniques is clustering, but depending on the algorithm the resolution of the data can have an important influence on the resulting clusters. This paper shows how temporal resolution of power demand profiles affects the quality of the clustering process, the consistency of cluster membership (profiles exhibiting similar behavior), and the efficiency of the clustering process. This work uses both raw data from household consumption data and synthetic profiles. The motivation for this work is to improve the clustering of electricity load profiles to help distinguish user types for tariff design and switching, fault and fraud detection, demand-side management, and energy efficiency measures. The key criterion for mining very large data sets is how little information needs to be used to get a reliable result, while maintaining privacy and security.

Abstract: The fault diagnosis of air-conditioning systems is of great significance to the energy saving of buildings. This study proposes a novel fault diagnosis approach for building energy saving based on the deep learning method which is deep belief network, and its application potential in the air conditioning fault diagnosis field is in vestigated. Then, a parameter optimization selection strategy is developed for model optimization. Four kinds of faults of the variable flow refrigerant system under heating mode are used to evaluate the performance of the models. The fault diagnosis results show that the deep belief network model with initial parameters can be used to diagnose the faults of the variable flow refrigerant system. Through the parameter optimization selection strategy, the fault diagnosis correct rate of the optimized model is 97.7%, which is improved by 5.05% compared with the model with initial parameters. The number of hidden layers of the deep belief network model is selected to be 2 layers. This result indicates that the fault diagnosis for variable flow refrigerant systems may not require a very deep model. Additionally, the performance of the optimized deep belief network model is compared with that of the traditional back propagation neural network, and the former is better. This finding also shows that the unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine layer for data feature reconstruction can improve the fault diagnosis performance.

Abstract: Energy demand prediction of building heating is conducive to optimal control, fault detection and diagnosis and building intelligentization. In this study, energy demand prediction models are developed through machine learning methods, including extreme learning machine, multiple linear regression, support vector regression and backpropagation neural network. Seven different meteorological parameters, operating parameters, time and indoor temperature parameters are used as feature variables of the model. Correlation analysis method is utilized to optimize the feature sets. Moreover, this paper proposes a strategy for obtaining the thermal response time of building, which is used as the time ahead of prediction models. The prediction performances of extreme learning machine models with various hidden layer nodes are analyzed and contrasted. Actual data of building heating using a ground source heat pump system are collected and used to test the performances of the models. Results show that the thermal response time of the building is approximately 40 min. Four feature sets are obtained, and the performances of the models with feature set 4 are better. For different machine learning methods, the performances of extreme learning machine models are better than others. In addition, the optimal number of hidden layer nodes is 11 for the extreme learning machine model with feature set 4.

Abstract: Solar energy plays a vital role in the field of sustainable energy by providing clean, efficient and reliable alternative source of energy. Where, the output of solar energy systems is highly dependent on the solar radiation. Thus, accurate prediction of solar radiation is considered as a very important factor for such applications. In this paper, standalone adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and hybrid models have been developed to predict monthly global solar radiation from different meteorological parameters such as sunshine duration S (h), and air temperature. The proposed hybrid models include particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm and differential evolution. To evaluate the capability and efficiency of the proposed models, several statistical indicators such as; root mean square error, co-efficient of determination and mean absolute bias error are used. All prediction models' results showed good agreements with measured datasets. The performance evaluation over different statistical indicators showed high correlation for all developed modules. Whereas, hybrid particle swarm optimization has achieved the best statistical indicators over all models in training and testing models. A detailed comparison with other studies is carried out to validate the prediction accuracy and suitability of the proposed models. The results showed that the developed hybrid models have the most reliable and accurate estimation capability and deemed to be the efficient methods for predicting global solar radiation for various applications.

Abstract: This article provides the first comprehensive study to explore the potential of tree-based ensemble methods in modeling solar radiation. Gradient boosting, bagging and random forest (RF) models have been developed for estimating global, diffuse and normal radiation components in daily and hourly time-scales. The developed ensemble models have been compared to their corresponding multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector regression (SVR) and decision tree (DT) models. The results show that the suggested techniques are very reliable and accurate, despite being relatively simple. The average validation coefficients of determination (R-2) for boosting, bagging and RF algorithms are (0.957, 0,971, 0.967) for the global irradiation model, (0.768, 0.786, 0.791) for the diffuse irradiation model, (0.769, 0.785, 0.792) for the normal irradiation model, (0.852, 0.890, 0.883) for the hourly global irradiance model, (0.778, 0.869, 0.853) for the diffuse irradiance model, and (0.797, 0.897, 0.880) for the normal irradiance model. In general, the bagging and RF algorithms showed better estimates than gradient boosting. However, the gradient boosting algorithm was the most stable with maximum increase of 10.32% in the test root mean square error, compared to 41.3% for the MLP algorithm. The SVR algorithm offers the best combination of stability and prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, its computational costs are up to 39 times the computational costs of ensemble methods. The new ensemble methods have been recommended for generating synthetic radiation data to be used for simulating and evaluating the performance of different solar energy systems.

Abstract: Choice of load signature or feature space is one of the most fundamental design choices for non-intrusive load monitoring or energy disaggregation problem. Electrical power quantities, harmonic load characteristics, canonical transient and steady-state waveforms are some of the typical choices of load signature or load signature basis for current research addressing appliance classification and prediction. This paper expands and evaluates appliance load signatures based on V-I trajectory-the mutual locus of instantaneous voltage and current waveforms-for precision and robustness of prediction in classification algorithms used to disaggregate residential overall energy use and predict constituent appliance profiles. We also demonstrate the use of variants of differential evolution as a novel strategy for selection of optimal load models in context of energy disaggregation. A publicly available benchmark dataset REDD is employed for evaluation purposes. Our experimental evaluations indicate that these load signatures, in conjunction with a number of popular classification algorithms, offer better or generally comparable overall precision of prediction, robustness and reliability against dynamic, noisy and highly similar load signatures with reference to electrical power quantities and harmonic content. Herein, wave-shape features are found to be an effective new basis of classification and prediction for semi-automated energy disaggregation and monitoring.

Abstract: A multilayer neural network with an adaptive learning algorithm is designed for short term load forecasting.  Extensive studies have been performed on the effect of various factors such as learning rate, momentum, the number of presentations in an iteration, etc. on the efficiency and accuracy of the backpropagation-momentum learning method which is employed in the training of artificial neural networks.  To speed up the training process, a new learning algorithm for the adaptive training of neural networks is presented.  The effectiveness of the neural network with the proposed adaptive learning algorithm is demonstrated by short term load forecasting of Taiwan power system.  It is found that, once trained by the proposed learning algorithm, the neural network can yield the desired hourly load forecast very efficiently and accurately.  Moreover, the proposed adaptive learning algorithm converges much faster than the conventional backpropagation-momentum learning method.

Abstract: The smart grid initiative and electricity market operation drive the development known as demand-side management or controllable load. Home energy management has received increasing interest due to the significant amount of loads in the residential sector. This paper presents a hardware design of smart home energy management system (SHEMS) with the applications of communication, sensing technology, and machine learning algorithm. With the proposed design, consumers can easily achieve a real-time, price-responsive control strategy for residential home loads such as electrical water heater (EWH), heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), electrical vehicle (EV), dishwasher, washing machine, and dryer. Also, consumers may interact with suppliers or load serving entities (LSEs) to facilitate the load management at the supplier side. Further, SHEMS isdesignedwith sensors to detect human activities and then a machine learning algorithm is applied to intelligently help consumers reduce total payment on electricity without or with little consumer involvement. Finally, simulation and experiment results are presented based on an actual SHEMS prototype to verify the hardware system.

Abstract: Buildings are the dominant source of energy consumption and environmental emissions in urban areas. Therefore, the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop ''sensor based'' approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly, 10 min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit) granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model. Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In addition to implications for the development of residential energy forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices. Ultimately, accurate and cost effective wide-scale energy prediction is a vital step towards next-generation energy efficiency initiatives, which will require not only consideration of the methods, but the scales for which data can be distilled into meaningful information.

Abstract: A fault detection, identification, and location approach is proposed and studied in this paper. This approach is based on matching pursuit decomposition (MPD) using Gaussian atom dictionary, hidden Markov model (HMM) of real-time frequency and voltage variation features, and fault contour maps generated by machine learning algorithms in smart grid (SG) systems. Specifically, the time-frequency features are extracted by MPD from the frequency and voltage signals, which are sampled by the frequency disturbance recorders in SG. A hybrid clustering algorithm is then developed and used to cluster the frequency and voltage signal features into various symbols. Using the symbols, two detection HMMs are trained for fault detection to distinguish between normal and abnormal SG operation conditions. Also, several identification HMMs are trained under different system fault scenarios, and if a fault occurs, the trained identification HMMs are used to identify different fault types. In the meantime, if the fault is detected by the detection HMMs, a fault contour map will be generated using the feature extracted by the MPD from the voltage signals and topology information of SG. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed approach for the diagnosis of various types of faults with different measurement signal-to-noise ratios in SG systems.

Abstract: This paper presents foresee'', a user-centric home energy management system that can help optimize how a home operates to concurrently meet users' needs, achieve energy efficiency and commensurate utility cost savings, and reliably deliver grid services based on utility signals. Foresee is built on a multiobjective model predictive control framework, wherein the objectives consist of energy cost, thermal comfort, user convenience, and carbon emission. Foresee learns user preferences on different objectives and acts on their behalf to operate building equipment, such as home appliances, photovoltaic systems, and battery storage. In this work, machine learning algorithms were used to derive data-driven appliance models and usage patterns to predict the home's future energy consumption. This approach enables highly accurate predictions of comfort needs, energy costs, environmental impacts, and grid service availability. Simulation studies were performed on field data from a residential building stock data set collected in the Pacific Northwest. Results indicated that foresee generated up to 7.6% whole-home energy savings without requiring substantial behavioral changes. When responding to demand response events, foresee was able to provide load forecasts upon receipt of event notifications and delivered the committed demand response services with 10% or fewer errors. Foresee fully utilized the potential of the battery storage and controllable building loads and delivered up to 7.0-kW load reduction and 13.5-kW load increase. These benefits are provided while maintaining the occupants' thermal comfort or convenience in using their appliances.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel intrusion detection and prevention system for ZigBee-based home area networks in smart grids, HANIDPS. HANIDPS employs a model-based intrusion detection mechanism as well as a machine learning-based intrusion prevention system to protect the network against a wide range of attack types. The detection module extracts network features and analyzes them to decide whether the network is in a normal state. We use smart energy profile 2.0 specification as well as IEEE 802.15.4 standard to precisely characterize the expected normal behavior. A set of defensive actions are defined for the prevention system which are effective in stopping various attack types. HANIDPS uses Q-learning and through interactions with environment learns the best strategy against an attack. Use of model-based approach for intrusion detection and dynamic learning for intrusion prevention, as well as employment of effective mechanisms to stop the attacks, provide a high performance for HANIDPS without the need for prior knowledge of the attacks. Soundness of the proposed method is evaluated through extensive analysis and experiments.

Abstract: The paper describes the use of general-purpose mathematical software "GPMS" as a major advancement in simplifying simulation procedures for junior level engineering studies. GPMS handles general and specific mathematical formulas and is packed with a vast array of codes to perform many scientific and engineering functions in an interactive mode. In order for the student to interact positively, the numerical examples in the textbook must be converted into an interactive media to support the theory and provide a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena. By this method, the students enhance their problem-solving abilities with minimal programming skills. By using examples, the paper presents an approach to computer-aided problem solving methods for junior level courses. The methods described in the paper have proven to be of value to students studying electric machines and power engineering at Arizona State University.

Abstract: The ability to non-intrusively identify people will enable smart buildings to customize the environment to meet occupants' comfort level while saving energy. Occupant identification can help in energy savings effort in a building because we can retrieve each occupant's temperature preference profile and choose the temperature that minimizes the total discomfort of a group in the building. To enable occupant identification in buildings, many methods used can be intrusive, such as using cameras or requiring the users to carry mobile gadgets or a smart phone. Non-intrusive techniques are gaining interest in smart building applications. In this paper, we present a non-intrusive ultrasonic based sensing technique to identify people by sensing their body shape and movement. The ultrasonic sensors are placed on the top and sides of doors to measure the height and width as the occupant walks through the instrumented doorway. Height and width and their related features can give a unique signature to occupants to identify them. In this study, the proposed system senses a stream of height and width data, recognizes the walking event when a person walks through the door, and extracts features that capture a person's movement as well as physical shape. These features are fed to a clustering algorithm that associates each occupant with a distinct cluster. The system was deployed for a total of three months. The results show that the proposed approach achieves 95% accuracy with 20 occupants suggesting the suitability of our approach in commercial building settings. In addition, the results show that using girth to distinguish between occupants is more successful than using height. We show that this system generalizes beyond our datasets and works for different populations of different physical distributions.

Abstract: A novel scheme for fast detection of islanding events in a microgrid is proposed in this paper. The scheme consists of a passive islanding detection process using an adaptive ensemble classifier and measurements of three-phase voltage at the distributed generation (DG) terminals. Initial features inputs to the classifier are obtained using the phase-space method. They are then used to train an ensemble classifier which comprises a set of randomized neural networks called extreme learning machine (ELM). The optimal parameter settings for each ELM are identified through evolutionary computation. An adaptive decision mechanism is designed to progressively adjust the decision time of the events classification, where its decision speed can be significantly improved over existing methods. Extensive tests are conducted on a radial distribution system with two identical DG units and the IEEE 33-bus with four DG units, considering various scenarios of islanding and non-islanding conditions, as well as the different types of DG. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can make accurate decisions at appropriately earlier times, which achieves a good balance between efficiency and accuracy in detecting the islanding events.

Abstract: This paper presents features and applications of an interactive graphical PC (DOS based) software package for the comprehension of transient stability using the equal area criterion method. The software is specifically useful for senior level undergraduate and first year graduate students in power system analysis courses. Utility engineers working with large-scale power systems can learn some basic concepts of transient stability by simulating the single machine infinite bus power system. A distinctive feature of this package is the user-friendly method for problem definition. Problems are defined by selecting options from menus without typical editor-like entry approach,used in other mathematical software, which normally have their own strict syntax.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are applied to predict wind speed data for Osorio wind farm that is located in the south of Brazil, near the Osorio city. Forecasting wind speed in wind farm regions is valuable in order to obtain an intelligent management of the generated power and to promote the utilization of wind energy in grid connected and isolated power systems. In this study, multilayer feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN), support vector regression (SVR), fuzzy inference system (FIS), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), group method of data handling (GMDH) type neural network, ANFIS optimized with particle swarm optimization algorithm (ANFIS-PSO) and ANFIS optimized with genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA) are developed to predict the time-series wind speed data. The Time-series prediction describes a model that predicts the future values of the system only using the past values. Past data is entered as input and future data to be used for represents MLA output. The developed models are examined on 5-min, 10-min, 15-min and 30-min intervals of wind speed data. The results demonstrated that the GMDH model for all time intervals can successfully predict the time-series wind speed data with a high accuracy. Also, the combination of ANFIS models with PSO and GA algorithms can increase the prediction accuracy of the ANFIS model for all time intervals.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that machine learning can be used to create effective algorithm selectors that select between power system control algorithms depending on the state of a network, achieving better performance than always using the same algorithm for every state. Also presented is a novel method for creating algorithm selectors that consider two objectives. The method is used to develop algorithm selectors for power flow management algorithms on versions of the IEEE 14- and 57-bus networks, and a network derived from a real distribution network. The selectors choose from within a diverse set of power flow management algorithms, including those based on constraint satisfaction, optimal power flow, power flow sensitivity factors, and linear programming. The network state-based algorithm selectors offer performance benefits over always using the same power flow management algorithm for every state, in terms of minimizing the number of overloads while also minimizing the curtailment applied to generators.

Abstract: Many cities across the United States have turned to building energy disclosure (or benchmarldng) laws to encourage transparency in energy efficiency markets and to support sustainability and carbon reduction plans. In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1 million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2 kbtuisf and for residential buildings is 31.2 kbtu/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings- those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall- are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability.

Abstract: Recent technological advancements have facilitated the evolution of traditional distribution grids to smart grids. In a smart grid scenario, flexible devices are expected to aid the system in balancing the electric power in a technically and economically efficient way. To achieve this, the flexible devices' consumption data are theoretically recorded, elaborated, and their upcoming flexibility is bid to flexibility markets. However, there are many cases where explicit flexible device consumption data are absent. This paper presents a way to circumvent this problem and extract the potentially flexible load of a flexible device, namely a heat pump (HP), out of the aggregated energy consumption of a house. The main idea for accomplishing this is a comparison of the flexible consumer with electrically similar nonflexible consumers. The methodology is based on machine-learning techniques, probability theory, and statistics. After presenting this methodology, the general trend of the HP consumption is estimated and an hour-ahead forecast is conducted by employing seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average modeling. In this manner, the flexible consumption is predicted, establishing the basis for bidding flexibility in intraday markets, even in the absence of explicit device measurements.

Abstract: Decision tree based machine learning methods find a great deal of application in power system reliability assessment studies, wherein essential knowledge in the form of operating rules or guidelines are produced that help operators maneuver the system away from insecurity. Independent test sets are generally used to validate these rules, with the motivation of estimating their classification accuracy and error rates, apart from checking their performance against some interesting situations. This paper proposes an importance sampling based method to generate intelligent test set for validating operating rules. The method is applied for testing decision tree rules derived against voltage collapse problems in western regions of the French power system, and is seen to produce test sets at lesser computation that estimates the rule's classification errors with good accuracy. For a given computation, it also provides richer information on critical operating conditions for which the rule is vulnerable, which helps in further improving the rules.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel modeling framework for forecasting electricity prices is proposed. While many predictive models have been already proposed to perform this task, the area of deep learning algorithms remains yet unexplored. To fill this scientific gap, we propose four different deep learning models for predicting electricity prices and we show how they lead to improvements in predictive accuracy. In addition, we also consider that, despite the large number of proposed methods for predicting electricity prices, an extensive benchmark is still missing. To tackle that, we compare and analyze the accuracy of 27 common approaches for electricity price forecasting. Based on the benchmark results, we show how the proposed deep learning models outperform the state-of-the-art methods and obtain results that are statistically significant. Finally, using the same results, we also show that: (i) machine learning methods yield, in general, a better accuracy than statistical models; (ii) moving average terms do not improve the predictive accuracy; (iii) hybrid models do not outperform their simpler counterparts.

Abstract: As the number of renewable energy generation units and, consequently, solid-state based converters increases in the power grid, many power electronics concepts should be integrated into power system analysis and design. Thus, a power laboratory course with emphasis on the nexus between power electronics and power system is desired. However, the flexibility of instructors in designing a wide range of educational experiments is limited by the use of specialized educational setups. This problem can be resolved by allowing students to assemble their setups using laboratory scaled-down devices; however, implementation times can limit students to focus on the main concepts of the experiments. In particular, lacking experience with hardware description languages to develop switching patterns and control schemes for solid-state based converters further increases the implementation times. In this paper, a technique for rapidly implementing switching patterns and control schemes for power converters is proposed. This technique provides an easy-to-use laboratory allowing students to focus on reinforcing the theory learned in energy conversion, motor-drive, power electronics, and power system classes while still providing instructors with the flexibility to design a wide range of educational experiments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a potential learning scheme that can dynamically predict the stability of the reconnection of subnetworks to a main grid. As the future electrical power systems tend toward smarter and greener technology, the deployment of self sufficient networks, or microgrids, becomes more likely. Microgrids may operate on their own or synchronized with the main grid, thus controlmethods need to take into account islanding and reconnecting of said networks. The ability to optimally and safely reconnect a portion of the grid is not well understood and, as of now, limited to raw synchronization between interconnection points. A support vector machine (SVM) leveraging real-time data from phasor measurement units is proposed to predict in real time whether the reconnection of a subnetwork to the main grid would lead to stability or instability. A dynamics simulator fed with preacquired system parameters is used to create training data for the SVM in various operating states. The classifier was tested on a variety of cases and operating points to ensure diversity. Accuracies of approximately 85% were observed throughout most conditions when making dynamic predictions of a given network.

Abstract: The contribution of this paper is that we present experiences from dealing with practical issues related to synchronous machine stability events. We describe and analyze the scenarios of generator loss-of-field occurring two times at a cogeneration thermal power plant in Taiwan in the years 2003 and 2005. Since the total production loss from both events was quite large, some improvements have been implemented to prevent the recurrence of similar events in the future. They consist of installing the sequence of events recorder at the generator output terminal, regulating the generator lagging power factor operation from 0.95-0.99 to 0.91, adjusting the tap position to decrease the secondary voltage of the 161 kV/161 kV interconnecting transformer, operating the phase-leading capacitors attached with a multi-stage chain cut-off control unit, and running two or three generators in automatic voltage regulation mode instead of automatic power factor regulation mode. Although similar events occurred twice at the same power plant in 2006, the generating units were capable of continuous stable operation which had effectively verified the improvements of operational changes. In conclusion, we suggest that the operating modes of generators in a cogeneration plant should re-examine constantly as well as monitor power quality of different end-user sectors continuously in order to ensure the security of power-system operation.

Abstract: Wind speed forecasting plays an important role in estimating the power produced from wind farms. However, because of the non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of the wind speed time series, it is difficult to model and predict such series precisely by traditional wind speed forecasting models. In this paper, a novel hybrid modelling method is proposed, in which time series decomposition, feature selection, and basic forecasting model are combined in a synchronous optimisation framework. In this method, the above-mentioned modelling factors, which affect model performance, could make a concerted effort to improve the model. Specifically, variational mode decomposition, the Gram-Schmidt orthogonal, and extreme learning machine, are optimized synchronously by gravitational search algorithm in the proposed hybrid short-term wind speed forecasting model. First, variational mode decomposition is employed to decompose the original wind speed time series into a set of modes and into one bias series. Subsequently, the Gram-Schmidt orthogonal is used to select the important features. Next, the set of modes are forecasted using the ELM. Finally, the key parameters of the models in three stages are optimized synchronously by gravitational search algorithm. Seven data sets from the Sotavento Galicia wind farm and two wind farms in China have been adopted to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the traditional signal forecasting models both on one-step and multi-step wind speed forecasting with at least 40% average performance promotion over all the seven competitors.

Abstract: While there are growing interests in using pumped hydro storage to facilitate the integration of renewable resources, the flexibility of storage is not being fully utilized by existing energy and market management systems. Today, one common approach to operate pumped hydro storage is to determine schedules for a future time horizon based on a look-ahead operational planning stage, with limited adjustment in real-time. However, as renewable penetration levels increase, such approaches do not fully utilize the flexibility of pumped hydro storage. In this paper, a policy function approach is proposed to enhance the utilization of pumped hydro storage in real-time operations. The performance of the approach is evaluated and compared with other benchmark approaches using the IEEE RTS 24-bus system. The result shows that the policy function approach is effective in utilizing the flexibility of pumped hydro storage and has minimal added computational complexity to the existing dispatch process.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel ensemble method for short-term load forecasting based on wavelet transform, extreme learning machine (ELM) and partial least squares regression. In order to improve forecasting performance, a wavelet-based ensemble strategy is introduced into the forecasting model. The individual forecasters are derived from different combinations of mother wavelet and number of decomposition levels. For each sub-component from the wavelet decomposition, a parallel model consisting of 24 ELMs is invoked to predict the hourly load of the next day. The individual forecasts are then combined to form the ensemble forecast using the partial least squares regression method. Numerical results show that the proposed method can significantly improve forecasting performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a new ensemble forecasting model for short-term load forecasting (STLF) is proposed based on extreme learning machine (ELM). Four important improvements are used to support the ELM for increased forecasting performance. First, a novel wavelet-based ensemble scheme is carried out to generate the individual ELM-based forecasters. Second, a hybrid learning algorithm blending ELM and the Levenberg-Marquardt method is proposed to improve the learning accuracy of neural networks. Third, a feature selection method based on the conditional mutual information is developed to select a compact set of input variables for the forecasting model. Fourth, to realize an accurate ensemble forecast, partial least squares regression is utilized as a combining approach to aggregate the individual forecasts. Numerical testing shows that proposed method can obtain better forecasting results in comparison with other standard and state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: An online voltage stability margin (VSM) monitoring approach based on local regression and adaptive database is proposed. Considering the increasing variability and uncertainty of power system operation, this approach utilizes the locality of underlying pattern between VSM and reactive power reserve (RPR), and can adapt to the changing condition of system. LASSO is tailored to solve the local regression problem so as to mitigate the curse of dimensionality for large scale system. Along with the VSM prediction, its confidence interval is also estimated simultaneously in a simple but effective way, and utilized as an evidence to trigger the database updating. IEEE 30-bus system and a 60,000-bus large system are used to test and demonstrate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can be successfully employed in online voltage stability monitoring for real size systems, and the adaptivity of model and data endows the proposed approach with the advantage in the circumstances where large and unforeseen changes of system condition are inevitable.

Abstract: The causes of uncertainty in wind farm power generation are not yet fully understood. A method for the scale division of wind power based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and Hurst analysis is proposed in this paper, which allows the various multi-scale chaotic characteristics of wind power to be investigated to reveal further information about the dynamic behavior of wind power. First, the time-frequency characteristics of wind power are analyzed using the HHT, and then Hurst analysis is applied to analyze the stochastic/persistent characteristics of the different time-frequency components. Second, based on their fractal structures, the components are superposed and reconstructed into three series, which are defined as the Micro-, Meso- and Macro-scale subsequences. Finally, indices related to the statistical and behavioral characteristics of the subsequences are calculated and used to analyze their nonlinear dynamic behavior. The data collected from a wind farm of Hebei Province, China, are selected for case studies. The simulation results reveal that (1) although the time-frequency components can be decomposed, the different fractal structures of the signal are also derived from the original series; (2) the three scale subsequences all present chaotic characteristics and each of them exhibits its own unique properties. The Micro-scale subsequence shows strong randomness and contributes the least to the overall fluctuations; the Macro-scale subsequence is the steadiest and exhibits the most significant tendency; the Meso-scale subsequence which possesses the greatest variance contribution rate and the maximum largest Lyapunov exponent, is the dominant factor driving the fluctuation and dynamic behavior of wind power; (3) the short-term predictions of these three subsequences based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) models have validated the above analysis results, which show that the number of steps of look-ahead predictability have pursued an ordinal trend in term of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the prediction error contribution rate of the Meso-scale subsequence is the maximum. Furthermore, the short-term wind power forecasting of 6-step-ahead based on the multi-scale analysis is performed by EMD-LSSVM + ELM and the normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) and normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) have been decreased by 49.45% and 44.30% compared with those of LSSVM, and 37.96% and 27.12% compared with those of EMD-LSSVM, respectively.

Abstract: Short-term load forecasting is an important part in the energy management of micro-grid. The forecasting errors directly affect the economic efficiency of operation. Compared to larger-scale power grid, micro-grid is more difficult to realize the short-term load forecasting for its smaller capacity and higher randomness. A hybrid load forecasting model with parameter optimization is proposed for short-term load forecasting of micro-grids, being composed of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Extreme Learning Machine with Kernel (KELM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Firstly, the time-series load data are decomposed into a number of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components through EMD. Two typical different forecasting algorithms (EKF and KELM) are adopted to predict different kinds of IMF components. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the parameters in the model. Considering the limited computation resources, an implementation mode based on off-line parameter optimization, period parameters updating and on-line load forecasting is proposed. Finally, four typical micro-grids with different users and capacities are used to test the accuracy and efficiency of the forecasting model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Future grid scenario analysis requires a major departure from conventional power system planning, where only a handful of most critical conditions is typically analyzed. To capture the interseasonal and temporal variations in the renewable generation of a future grid scenario necessitates the use of computationally intensive time-series analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework for fast stability scanning of future grid scenarios using an improved feature selection and self-adaptive PSO-k-means clustering algorithm. To achieve the computational speedup, the stability analysis is performed only on small number of representative cluster centroids instead of on the full set of operating conditions. As a case study, we perform small-signal stability and steady-state voltage stability scanning of a simplified model of the Australian national electricity market with significant penetration of renewable generation. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to an exhaustive time series scanning, the proposed framework reduced the computational burden up to ten times, with an acceptable level of accuracy.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a combination method for the classification of power quality complex disturbances based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and multilabel learning. EEMD is adopted to extract the features of complex disturbances, which is more suitable to the nonstationary signal processing. Rank wavelet support vector machine (rank-WSVM) is proposed to apply in the classification of complex disturbances. First, the characteristic quantities of complex disturbances are obtained with EEMD through defining standard energy differences of each intrinsic mode function. Second, after the optimization of rank-SVM, based on wavelet kernel function, the ranking function, and multilabel function are, respectively, constructed. Lastly, rank-WSVM is applied to classify the complex disturbances. Simulation results and real-time digital simulator tests show that for different signal to noise ratio, the rank-WSVM classification performance of complex disturbances including hamming loss, ranking loss, one-error, coverage, and average precision, is generally better than the other three methods, namely rank-SVM, multilabel naive Bayes, and multilabel learning with backpropagation.

Abstract: This paper presents a single-ended traveling wave-based fault location method for a hybrid transmission line: an overhead line combined with an underground cable. Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is used to extract transient information from the measured voltages. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are utilized to identify the faulty-section and faulty-half. Bewley diagrams are observed for the traveling wave patterns and the wavelet coefficients of the aerial mode voltage are used to locate the fault. The transient simulation for different fault types and locations are obtained by ATP using frequency-dependent line and cable models. MATLAB is used to process the simulated transients and apply the proposed method. The performance of the method is tested for different fault inception angles (FIA), different fault resistances, non-linear high impedance faults (NLHIF), and non-ideal faults with satisfactory results. The impact of cable aging on the proposed method accuracy is also investigated.

Abstract: The paper studies the horizontal global, direct-beam and sky-diffuse solar irradiance data measured in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2013. A machine learning algorithm was employed to predict the horizontal sky-diffuse irradiance and conduct sensitivity analysis for the meteorological variables. Apart from the clearness index (horizontal global/extra atmospheric solar irradiance), we found that predictors including solar altitude, air temperature, cloud cover and visibility are also important in predicting the diffuse component. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the logistic regression using the aforementioned predictors was less than 21.5 W/m(2) and 30 W/m(2) for Hong Kong and Denver, USA, respectively. With the systematic recording of the five variables for more than 35 years, the proposed model would be appropriate to estimate of long-term diffuse solar radiation, study climate change and develope typical meteorological year in Hong Kong and places with similar climates.

Abstract: Ice-based thermal energy storage (TES) systems can shift peak cooling demand and reduce operational energy costs (with time-of-use rates) in commercial buildings. The accurate prediction of the cooling load, and the optimal control strategy for managing the charging and discharging of a TES system, are two critical elements to improving system performance and achieving energy cost savings. This study utilizes data-driven analytics and modeling to holistically understand the operation of an ice-based TES system in a shopping mall, calculating the system's performance using actual measured data from installed meters and sensors. Results show that there is significant savings potential when the current operating strategy is improved by appropriately scheduling the operation of each piece of equipment of the TES system, as well as by determining the amount of charging and discharging for each day. A novel optimal control strategy, determined by an optimization algorithm of Sequential Quadratic Programming, was developed to minimize the TES system's operating costs. Three heuristic strategies were also investigated for comparison with our proposed strategy, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the heuristic strategies in terms of total energy cost savings. Specifically, the optimal strategy yields energy costs of up to 11.3% per day and 9.3% per month compared with current operational strategies. A one-day-ahead hourly load prediction was also developed using machine learning algorithms, which facilitates the adoption of the developed data analytics and optimization of the control strategy in a real TES system operation.

Abstract: This paper applies modern statistical nonparametric methodology to the problem of prediction of the transient stability boundary of large-scale power engineering systems. The stability issue is characterized by the critical clearing time (CCT) that is employed to determine whether a precontingency steady-state condition is stable for a given fault in the power system. The multidimensional mapping between the precontingency steady-state conditions and the corresponding CCT is modeled as an additive structure of one-dimensional functions. Nonparametric kernel estimation methods are applied to the assumed additive model yielding the boundary prediction algorithm that is easily interpretable and avoids the curse of dimensionality. The precision of our additive nonlinear modeling is demonstrated in the context of fault prediction of the 470-bus power network. For the specified fault type, we demonstrate a stronger prediction accuracy compared to other large-scale machine learning methods that have been used for the transient stability boundary problem so far.

Abstract: This paper presents a principal component (PC) analysis based method for online characterization of outliers in synchrophasor measurements. To that end, a linearized framework is established to analyze dynamical response from a system under nominal and off-nominal (e.g., faulted) conditions, which are contained in the same window of synchrophasor data. Inspired by the singular value perturbation theory, a bound on the change in the norm of the PC scores as a function of system state matrices is presented. It is shown that in the presence of bad data outliers these bounds for higher dimensional PC scores will be significantly larger compared to lower dimensions. The effect of the number of samples in the data window on the results of the analysis is established. Case studies on a simulated test system and on field data collected from a US utility are presented to support the analytical results. Finally, an online classifier for the characterization of outliers is developed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for machine learning based methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for single and simultaneous fault location in distribution networks by means of a sparse representation (SR) vector, Fuzzy-clustering, and machine-learning. The method requires few smart meters along the primary feeders to measure the pre- and during-fault voltages. The voltage sag values for the measured buses produce a vector whose dimension is less than the number of buses in the system. By concatenating the corresponding rows of the bus impedance matrix, an underdetermined set of equation is formed and is used to recover the fault current vector. Since the current vector ideally contains few nonzero values corresponding to fault currents at the faulted points, it is a sparse vector which can be determined by l(1)-norm minimization. Because the number of nonzero values in the estimated current vector often exceeds the number of fault points, we analyze the nonzero values by Fuzzy-c mean to estimate four possible faults. Furthermore, the nonzero values are processed by a new machine learning method based on the k-nearest neighborhood technique to estimate a single fault location. The performance of our algorithms is validated by their implementation on a real distribution network with noisy and noise-free measurement.

Abstract: An active machine learning technique for monitoring the voltage stability in transmission systems is presented. It has been shown that machine learning algorithms may be used to supplement the traditional simulation approach, but they suffer from the difficulties of online machine learning model update and offline training data preparation. We propose an active learning solution to enhance existing machine learning applications by actively interacting with the online prediction and offline training process. The technique identifies operating points where machine learning predictions based on power system measurements contradict with actual system conditions. By creating the training set around the identified operating points, it is possible to improve the capability of machine learning tools to predict future power system states. The technique also accelerates the offline training process by reducing the amount of simulations on a detailed power system model around operating points where correct predictions are made. Experiments show a significant advantage in relation to the training time, prediction time, and number of measurements that need to be queried to achieve high prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The estimation of a wind farm's power curve, which links the wind speed to the power that is produced by the whole wind farm, is a challenging task because this relationship is nonlinear and bounded, in addition to being non-stationary due for example to changes in the site environment and seasonality. Even for a single wind turbine the measured power at different wind speeds is generally different than the rated power, since the operating conditions on site are generally different than the conditions under which the turbine was calibrated (the wind speed on site is not uniform horizontally across the face of the turbine; the vertical wind profile and the air density are different than during the calibration; the wind data available on site are not always measured at the height of the turbine's hub).
The paper presents a data-driven approach for building an equivalent steady state model of a wind farm under normal operating conditions and shows its utilization for the creation of quality control charts at the aim of detecting anomalous functioning conditions of the wind farm. We use and compare three different machine learning models - viz. a self-supervised neural network called GMR (Generalized Mapping Regressor), a feed-forward Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) - to estimate the relationship between the wind speed and the generated power in a wind farm. GMR is a novel incremental self-supervised neural network which can approximate every multidimensional function or relation presenting any kind of discontinuity; MLPs are the most widely used state-of-the-art neural network models and GRNNs belong to the family of kernel neural networks.
The methodology allows the creation of a non-parametric model of the power curve that can be used as a reference profile for on-line monitoring of the power generation process, as well as for power forecasts. The results obtained show that the non-parametric approach provides fair performances, provided that a suitable pre-processing of the input data is accomplished. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper, a new islanding detection method for single phase inverter-based distributed generation is presented. In the first stage of the proposed method, a parametric technique called autoregressive signal modeling is utilized to extract signal features from voltage and current signals at the point of common coupling with the grid. In the second stage, advanced machine learning technique based on support vector machine, which takes calculated features as inputs is utilized to predict islanding state. The extensive study is performed on the IEEE 13 bus system and feature vectors corresponding to various islanding and nonislanding conditions are used for support vector machine classifier training and testing. Simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately detect system islanding operation mode 50 ms after the event starts. Further, the robustness of the proposed method is analyzed by examining its performances in the systems with multiple distributed generations, and when system loading condition, grid disturbance types, and characteristics are altered.

Abstract: This paper illustrates the development of an intelligent local area signals based controller for damping low-frequency oscillations in power systems. The controller is trained offline to perform well under a wide variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural network based system identification eliminates the need to develop accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement units at generating stations within an area of the system. These representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the system "seen" by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with simulations of the system. Results obtained on the 68-bus New England/New York benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations without additional control effort.

Abstract: The pattern recognition approach to transient stability analysis (TSA) has been presented as a promising tool for online application. This paper applies a recently introduced learning-based nonlinear classifier, the support vector machine (SVM), showing its suitability for TSA. It, can be seen as a different approach to cope with the problem of high dimensionality. The high dimensionality of power systems has led to the development and implementation of feature selection techniques to make the application feasible in practice. SVMs' theoretical motivation is conceptually explained and they are tested with a 2684-bus Brazilian systems Aspects of model adequacy, training time, classification accuracy, and dimensionality reduction are discussed and compared to stability classifications provided by multilayer perceptrons.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel authentication scheme for advanced metering infrastructure of smart grid using ring oscillator physically unclonable functions (ROPUFs). The scope of the design covers the communication between the utility company and the smart meter network. The scheme is based on hardware-oriented security and can be implemented on existing smart meters. Authentication keys of 64 bits are used for security level 1 communication. The size of keys can increase up to 1024 bits for security level 5. The cryptographic keys used in this scheme are extremely difficult to model by adversaries as each key is used only once. These authentication keys are generated from ROPUF response bits using the Hamming code. The design of the scheme ensures fault tolerance as ring oscillator comparison pairs with high frequency differences are selected to prevent bit flips and only 10% discrepancy is tolerated in parity bits. The proposed scheme is highly secure and efficient in terms of latency and data storage. As a proof of concept, two different machine learning algorithms, support vector machine and multigene genetic programming, are used to show that the scheme cannot be modeled by adversaries.

Abstract: An air handling unit's energy usage can vary from the original design as components fail or fault - dampers leak or fail to open/close, valves get stuck, and so on. Such problems do not necessarily result in occupant complaints and, consequently, are not even recognized to have occurred. In spite of recent progress in the research and development of diagnostic solutions for air handling units, there is still a lack of reliable, scalable, and affordable diagnostic solutions for such systems. Modeling limitations, measurement constraints, and the complexity of concurrent faults are the main challenges in air handling unit diagnostics. The focus of this paper is on developing diagnostic algorithms for air handling units that can address such constraints more effectively by systematically employing machine-learning techniques. The proposed algorithms are based on analyzing the observed behavior of the system and comparing it with a set of behavioral patterns generated based on various faulty conditions. We show how such a pattern-matching problem can be formulated as an estimation of the posterior distribution of a Bayesian probabilistic model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by detecting faults in commercial building air handling units. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to nontechnical loss (NTL) analysis for utilities using the modern computational technique extreme learning machine (ELM). Nontechnical losses represent a significant proportion of electricity losses in both developing and developed countries. The ELM-based approach presented here uses customer load-profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. This approach provides a method of data mining for this purpose, and it involves extracting patterns of customer behavior from historical kWh consumption data. The results yield classification classes that are used to reveal whether any significant behavior that emerges is due to irregularities in consumption. In this paper, ELM and online sequential-ELM (OS-ELM) algorithms are both used to achieve an improved classification performance and to increase accuracy of results. A comparison of this approach with other classification techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, is also undertaken and the ELM performance and accuracy in NTL analysis is shown to be superior.

Abstract: The world is rapidly urbanizing, and the energy intensive built environment is becoming increasingly responsible for the world's energy consumption and associated environmental emissions. As a result, significant efforts have been put forth to develop methods that can accurately model and characterize building energy consumption in cities. These models aim to utilize physics-based building energy simulations, reduced-order calculations and statistical learning methods to assess the energy performance of buildings within a dense urban area. However, current urban building energy models are limited in their ability to account for the inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors that can have a substantial impact on building energy use. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S) framework that integrates a network-based machine learning algorithm (ResNet) with engineering simulation to better understand how buildings consume energy on multiple temporal (hourly, daily, monthly) and spatial scales in a city (single building, block, urban). We validate the proposed DUE-S framework on a proof of concept case study of 22 densely located university buildings in California, USA. Our results indicate that the DUE-S framework is able to accurately predict urban scale energy consumption at hourly, daily and monthly intervals. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the integration of data-driven and engineering simulation approaches can partially capture the inter-building energy dynamics and impacts of the urban context and merits future work to explore how they can be improved to predict sub-urban scale energy predictions (single building, block). In the end, successfully predicting and modeling the energy performance of urban buildings has the potential to inform the decision-making of a wide variety of urban sustainability stakeholders including architects, engineers and policymakers.

Abstract: It is highly desirable that we be able to assess the security and stability of electric power systems after exposure to large disturbances. In this connection, the critical clearing time(CCT) is an attribute which provides significant information about the quality of the post-fault system behavior. It may be regarded to be a complex mapping of the prefault, fault-on, and post-fault system conditions into the time domain. In previous work, we have shown that a feedforward neural-network can be used to learn this mapping and successfully perform under variable system operating conditions and topologies. In that work we described the system in terms of some conventionally used parameters.
In contrast to using those pragmatic features selected on the basis of the engineering understanding of the problem, we consider in this paper the possibility of using unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms to discover what combination of "raw" measurements are significant in determining CCT. Correlation analysis and Euclidian metric are used to specify inter-feature dependencies. An example of 4-machine power system is used to illustrate the suggested approach.

Abstract: In recent years, many cities have adopted energy disclosure policies to better understand how energy is consumed in the urban built environment and how energy use and carbon emissions can be reduced. The diffusion of such policies has generated large-scale streams of building energy data, creating new opportunities to develop the fundamental science of urban energy dynamics. Nevertheless, there is limited research that rigorously analyzes building energy performance patterns over time. This paper provides a comprehensive framework to analyze building energy time series data and identify buildings with similar temporal energy performance patterns. We use data from approximately 15,000 properties in New York City, covering a six-year reporting period from 2011 to 2016. After pre-processing and merging the data for each constituent year, we use an unsupervised learning algorithm to optimally cluster the energy time series and statistical tests and supervised learning methods to infer how building characteristics vary between clusters. Our results show that energy reductions in New York City are mainly driven by its commercial building stock, with larger, newer, and higher value buildings demonstrating the largest improvements in energy intensity over the study period. Moreover, voluntary energy conservation schemes are found to be more effective in boosting energy performance of commercial properties, compared to residential buildings. Our results suggest two distinct temporal patterns of energy performance for commercial and residential buildings, characterized by energy use reductions and increases. This finding highlights the differential response to energy reporting and disclosure, and presents a more complex picture of energy use dynamics over time when compared to previous studies. In order to realize significant energy use improvements over time and reach energy and carbon reduction goals, cities need to design and implement comprehensive energy policy frameworks, bringing together information transparency and reporting with targeted mandates and incentives.

Abstract: Real-time prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is an essential feature of a robust battery management system (BMS). In this work, a novel method for real-time RUL estimation of Li ion batteries is proposed that integrates classification and regression attributes of Support Vector (SV) based machine learning technique. Cycling data of Li-ion batteries under different operating conditions are analyzed, and the critical features are extracted from the voltage and temperature profiles. The classification and regression models for RUL are built based on the critical features using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification model provides a gross estimation, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used to predict the accurate RUL if the battery is close to the end of life (EOL). By the critical feature extraction and the multi-stage approach, accurate RUL prediction of multiple batteries is accomplished simultaneously, making the proposed method generic in nature. In addition to accuracy, the multistage approach results in faster computations, and hence a trained model can potentially be used for real-time onboard RUL estimation for electric vehicle battery packs.

Abstract: Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) are among the major energy demand in the buildings sector globally. Improving the energy efficiency of such systems is a critical objective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning towards renewable sources of energy supply. The interest of this paper is to explore means to increase the efficiency of HVAC systems in accommodating occupants' behavior in real time. For instance, rooms in office buildings are not always occupied by occupants during scheduled HVAC service periods. This offers an opportunity to reduce unnecessary energy demands of HVAC systems associated with occupants' behavior. An in-depth analysis of occupants' stochastic behavior within an office building is conducted in this paper. A demand-driven control strategy is proposed that automatically responds to occupants' energy related behavior for reducing energy consumption and maintains room temperature for occupants with similar performances as a static cooling. In this control strategy, two types of machine learning methods unsupervised and supervised learning are applied to learn occupants' behavior in two learning processes. The occupancy related information learned by the algorithms is used by a set of specified rules to infer real-time room setpoints for controlling the office's space cooling system. This learning-based approach intends to reduce the need for human intervention in the cooling system's control. The proposed strategy was applied to control the cooling system of the office building under real-world conditions. Eleven case study office spaces were selected, representing three typical office uses: single person offices, multi-person offices, and meeting rooms. The experimental results report between 7% and 52% energy savings as compared to the conventionally-scheduled cooling systems.

Abstract: This work develops guidance and tools to understand the performance, improve the design, and simplify the evaluation of naturally ventilated low-rise commercial buildings in warm and hot climates. We conducted 50,000 detailed energy and airflow simulations in 427 locations across Brazil, varying 55 parameters representing building morphology, fenestration, construction properties, internal gains, operating times, wind modifiers, flowpaths, window control, and soil traits. Comfort performance was quantified by the average annual fraction of occupied hours that exceeded the upper limit of an adaptive comfort zone, and investigated with sensitivity analysis and machine learning methods. Results indicated that, after climate, building size (both footprint area and number of stories) and internal gains were most influential and were positively associated with discomfort. Adding air movement with ceiling fans and providing for night ventilation both proved highly effective comfort interventions. Except for roof solar absorptance, opaque envelope changes, including increasing insulation or thermal mass, had only marginal impacts. A support vector regression metamodel, requiring 29 easily obtainable inputs plus a weather file, was fit to the simulation results and successfully validated (R-2 = 0.97). The metamodel was developed as a simplified compliance path for naturally ventilated buildings to enhance Brazil's commercial building performance labeling program, which, because it currently provides such a path only for air conditioned buildings, may discouraging decision-makers from considering even more efficient passive solutions. We use a case study to show how the metamodel, which we will distribute publicly, can also serve as a design tool, and demonstrate that modifying a small set of parameters can drastically improve thermal performance and achieve sustainable comfort in hot and warm climates.

Abstract: This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of >= 1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to longterm prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building's schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building's load profiles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi layered perceptron model.

Abstract: Building energy consumption makes up 40% of the total energy consumption in the United States. Given that energy consumption in buildings is influenced by aspects of urban form such as density and floor-area-ratios (FAR), understanding the distribution of energy intensities is critical for city planners. This paper presents a novel technique for estimating commercial building energy consumption from a small number of building features by training machine learning models on national data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). Our results show that gradient boosting regression models perform the best at predicting commercial building energy consumption, and can make predictions that are on average within a factor of 2 from the true energy consumption values (with an r(2) score of 0.82). We validate our models using the New York City Local Law 84 energy consumption dataset, then apply them to the city of Atlanta to create aggregate energy consumption estimates. In general, the models developed only depend on five commonly accessible building and climate features, and can therefore be applied to diverse metropolitan areas in the United States and to other countries through replication of our methodology.

Abstract: Units within a control area, participating in the secondary frequency control, are usually spinning generating units already connected to the network and operating outside their range of optimal performance. This paper deals with an alternative method of providing secondary frequency control called rapid-start (RS). It consists in assigning a regulation band to several offline units (RS units) which are capable of being started and connected rapidly, therefore allowing the online units to function more closely to their nominal power. RS units have commonly been used for peaking generation and for tertiary control reserve, and have been rarely used for secondary control reserve. As RS operation may have economic benefits, since it allows for better dispatch of the other units in the control area, an appropriate algorithm to start up an RS unit needs to be developed. This paper proposes a machine learning based system (MLBS) to be employed in the decision to start up an RS unit while being used to provide secondary frequency control. The decision-making procedure is carried out by a decision tree. The building and implementation of the RS machine learning based system is illustrated for a secondary frequency control zone within the Spanish power system.

Abstract: This research paper aims to develop a hybrid neuro-evolutionary wrapper-based model for daily global solar radiation estimation in the solar-rich Sunshine State of Queensland, Australia. To design a robust hybrid modelling mechanism, the Interim-ERA European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data are employed to train and cross-validate the estimation model that is formulated by an evolutionary -type algorithm: the Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) integrated with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. The hybrid CRO-(ELM) algorithm is applied in two stages: first for the feature selection process guided by an ELM algorithm (a class of fast training neural network tool) as the model's fitness function to screen an optimal set of predictor variables and second, for the estimation of the solar radiation using the optimally screened variables by the final hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system. To benchmark the performance of the hybrid CRO-ELM algorithm for this estimation problem we apply an alternative, yet a similar feature screening approach: the Grouping Genetic Algorithm encoded into the ELM-based model (GGA-(ELM) used as the predictor mechanism). After the feature selection process is performed by the CRO algorithm that extracts the data patterns for accurate estimation the alternative objective algorithm is applied (in this case the ELM again) to formulate the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM modelling system. To provide a rigorous evaluation of the CRO-(ELM)ELM hybrid system, alternative estimation approaches are considered: the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). The hybrid CRO(ELM)-ELM system is tested in a real problem where the results are evaluated by means of several statistical score metrics and diagnostic plots of the observed and the estimated daily global solar radiation in the testing phase. We show that the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM model is able to yield promising results; thus improving those attained by the 7 alternative models (i.e., hybrid CRO-(ELM)-MARS, CRO-(ELM)-MLR and CRO-(ELM)-SVR and the GGA equivalent models). The study ascertains that the CRO-based hybrid system where a large pool of predictor data are carefully screened through a wrapper-based modelling system and the ELM model is applied as a objective estimation tool can be adopted as a qualified stratagem in solar radiation estimation problems. The proposed hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system exhibits clear advantages over the alternative machine learning approaches tested and also over the other machine learning algorithms used without the feature selection tool; thus advocating its scientific utility in renewable energy applications.

Abstract: Technical advances and decreasing costs of photovoltaic (PV) and battery (B) systems are key drivers for the consumer-prosumer transition in many countries. However, the installation of a photovoltaic-battery (PVB) system is not equally profitable for all consumers. This study systematically assesses how heterogeneity in real-world electricity load profiles affects the optimal system configuration and profitability of PVB systems. To that end, we develop a techno-economic simulation model that optimizes the PVB configuration for given electricity load profiles. The analysis uses real-world energy consumption data from 4190 households and is conducted for current electricity rates and weather conditions in Zurich, Switzerland. To account for future price reductions of PV and PVB systems, we conduct a sensitivity analysis that assesses how different cost scenarios influence optimal system configuration and profitability. Finally, we develop and validate a machine learning algorithm that can predict system profitability based only on a limited set of features and on shorter measurement timeframes of smart-meter data. We find that under the current cost scenario (PV: 2000 (sic)/kWp, B: 1000 (sic)/kWh) and without subsidies, about 40% of the analyzed households reach a positive net present value (NPV) for a PV-system, but only for 0.1% of households is the integration of a battery profitable. Under the most optimistic cost scenario for both technologies (PV: 1000 (sic)/kWp, B: 250 (sic)/kWh), 99.9% of the households benefit from the integration of battery storage into their optimal system configuration, with a mean installed PV power of 4.4 kWp and a mean battery size of 9.6 kWh, In all cost scenarios, system profitability varies considerably between households, even for households with comparable total annual demand, primarily due to the heterogeneity in the load profiles. Thus, being able to identify households for whom the installation is profitable is important. The proposed machine learning algorithm predicts optimal configuration, profitability, self-sufficiency, and self-sufficiency ratios with good accuracy, even when only relatively short timeframes of smart-meter data are available. The results of this study are relevant for households making individual investment decisions as well as for utility companies to more effectively identify and approach relevant customers for the installation of PVB systems. Furthermore, the findings enable policymakers to determine the critical levers for increasing private investments into PVB systems in their region and to predict how future developments like component costs will affect the future diffusion of these systems.

Abstract: Controlled islanding refers to the controlled separation of an interconnected power system into electrically isolated regions. The objective of this paper is to develop adaptive controlled islanding as a component of an emergency power system control strategy. There are two primary aspects of controlled islanding: 1) where to island and 2) when to island? Assisted by a decision tree (DT) approach, this paper seeks to address the "when to island" aspect. A decision tree based tool is proposed to recognize conditions existing in the system that warrant controlled islanding. A 29-generator, 179-bus system is employed to demonstrate the tool. Simulation data are used to train DTs, and the online performance of DTs is then evaluated as part of a controlled islanding strategy.

Abstract: Time-of-use electricity pricing is touted as one of the solutions toward optimal load distribution in the future of smart grid. However, the benefits of such an approach are limited as human electricity usage can often be described as inelastic in nature, or not sensitive to pricing in economic theory. Water heating constitutes one of the largest components of such usage. This paper proposes technology to enable residential water heating to be converted from an inelastic to an elastic demand, which would respond to pricing incentives. This is accomplished by utilizing consumer hot water use patterns combined with thermal storage to calculate a user-specific temperature profile. Results demonstrated that such an approach could not only reduce electrical water heating costs significantly and allow for realization of large-scale grid benefits, but also improve customer experience as thermal storage capability would enable more hot water to be delivered at times of peak consumption.

Abstract: Interarea oscillation is one of the main challenges for the secure and stable operation of a large-scale interconnected power system. To address this problem, this paper presents an adaptive supplementary damping controller (SDC) for voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) by using the goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP). Compared with conventional heuristic dynamic programming (HDP), GrHDP adds a new goal representation network to generate an adaptive reward signal to achieve better mapping relationship between the system states and the control action. To compensate phase shift between the output and input signals of a large-scale interconnected AC/DC power system, this paper proposes a parallel phase shift channel for the GrHDP. Moreover, the proposed GrHDP-SDC is a model-free control scheme, which does not need the mathematic model of the power system and has quick online learning ability to adapt to the variation of system operating conditions. Case studies are carried out on the 10-machine 39bus system and 16-machine 68-bus system, respectively. Compared with the conventional lead-lag SDC (LL-SDC) andHDP-SDC, simulation results show that the proposed GrHDP-SDC can always provide satisfactory damping performance over a wide range of system operating conditions and disturbances.

Abstract: This paper compares the vapour ejector and electric vacuum pump power consumptions with machine learning algorithms by using real process data and presents some novelty guideline for the selection of an appropriate condenser vacuum pump system of a steam turbine power plant. The machine learning algorithms are made by using the supervised machine learning methods such as artificial neural network model and local linear neuro-fuzzy models. The proposed non-linear models are designed by using a wide range of real process operation data sets from the CHP system in the thermal power plant. The novelty guideline for the selection of an appropriate condenser vacuum pumps system is expressed in the comparative analysis of the energy consumption and use of specific energy capable of work. Furthermore, the novelty is expressed in the economic efficiency analysis of the investment taking into consideration the operating costs of the vacuum pump systems and may serve as basic guidelines for the selection of an appropriate condenser vacuum pump system of a steam turbine.

Abstract: The U.S. wholesale power market comprises a large commodity market. The growth in power trading is due to the ongoing deregulation policy of the electric power industry. Most deregulation scenarios indicate a further separation of power production from transmission and retailing. The power production is opened to more competition. Unfortunately, the power trading mechanism is not clearly investigated in the level that we can predict a price change in the U.S. wholesale power market. Such a price change in the U.S. wholesale power market is explored from a simulation system with learning capabilities. Using the new intelligence system, we investigate the bidding strategies of traders in the wholesale power market and examine how the price change occurs under different economic and engineering environments.

Abstract: This study documents the practicality of an agent-based approach by examining how two groups of agents handle business complexity related to power trading. Three important findings are identified in this research. First, the proposed approach can estimate fluctuations of electricity prices as well as other well-known methods such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. Second, multiple learning capabilities incorporated in adaptive agents do not have an advantage over limited learning capabilities in predicting the market price of electricity. Finally, a theoretical extension of multiple learning capabilities may have potential for developing the agent-based approach for power trading.

Abstract: Demand-side management technology is a key element of the proposed smart grid, which will help utilities make more efficient use of their generation assets by reducing consumers' energy demand during peak load periods. However, although some modern appliances can respond to price signals from the utility companies, there is a vast stock of older appliances that cannot. For such appliances, utilities must infer what appliances are operating in a home, given only the power signals on the main feeder to the home (i.e., the home's power consumption must be disaggregated into individual appliances). We report on an in-depth investigation of multi-label classification algorithms for disaggregating appliances in a power signal. A systematic review of this research topic shows that this class of algorithms has received little attention in the literature, even though it is arguably a more natural fit to the disaggregation problem than the traditional single-label classifiers used to date. We examine a multi-label meta-classification framework (RAkEL), and a bespoke multi-label classification algorithm (MLkNN), employing both time-domain and wavelet-domain feature sets. We test these classifiers on two real houses from the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset. We found that the multilabel algorithms are effective and competitive with published results on the datasets.

Abstract: Difficulties in expanding the generation and transmission system force modern power systems to operate often close to their stability limits, in order to meet the continuously growing demand. An effective way to face power system contingencies that can lead to instability is load shedding. This paper proposes a machine learning framework for the evaluation of load shedding for corrective dynamic security of the system. The proposed method employs a self-organized map with decision trees nested in some of its nodes in order to classify the load profiles of a power system. The method is applied on a realistic model of the Hellenic Power System and its added value is shown by comparing results with the ones obtained from the application of simple self-organized maps and simple decision trees.

Abstract: This paper proposes an automatic learning framework for the dynamic security control of a power system. The proposed method employs a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), which serves to assess the dynamic security status of the power system and to estimate the effect of a corrective control action applied in the event of a disturbance. Particle swarm optimization is applied to find the optimal control action, where the objective function to be optimized is provided by the RBFNN. The method is applied on a realistic model of the Hellenic Power System and on the IEEE 50-generator test system, and its added value is shown by comparing results with the ones obtained from the application of other machine learning methods.

Abstract: A novel efficient probabilistic forecasting approach is proposed to accurately quantify the variability and uncertainty of the power production from photovoltaic (PV) systems. Distinguished from most existing models, a linear programming-based prediction interval construction model for PV power generation is established based on an extreme learning machine and quantile regression, featuring high reliability and computational efficiency. The proposed approach is validated through the numerical studies on PV data from Denmark.

Abstract: The fluctuation and uncertainty of wind power generation bring severe challenges to secure and economic operation of power systems. Because wind power forecasting error is unavoidable, probabilistic forecasting becomes critical to accurately quantifying the uncertainty involved in traditional point forecasts of wind power and to providing meaningful information to conduct risk management in power system operation. This paper proposes a novel direct quantile regression approach to efficiently generate nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation combining extreme learning machine and quantile regression. Quantiles with different proportions can be directly produced via an innovatively formulated linear programming optimization model, without dependency on point forecasts. Multistep probabilistic forecasting of 10-minwind power is newly carried out based on real wind farm data from Bornholm Island in Denmark. The superiority of the proposed approach is verified through comparisons with other well-established benchmarks. The proposed approach forms a new artificial neural network-based nonparametric forecasting framework for wind power with high efficiency, reliability, and flexibility, which can be beneficial to various decision-making activities in power systems.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable forecast of wind power is essential to power system operation and control. However, due to the nonstationarity of wind power series, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, leading to increased uncertainties and risks for system operation. This paper proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation. To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identified with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation with a high potential for practical applications in power systems.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is essential to power system operation. Given significant uncertainties involved in wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting provides a unique solution to estimate and quantify the potential impacts and risks facing system operation with wind penetration beforehand. This paper proposes a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm approach to directly formulate optimal prediction intervals of wind power generation based on extreme learning machine and particle swarm optimization. Prediction intervals with associated confidence levels are generated through direct optimization of both the coverage probability and sharpness to ensure the quality. The proposed method does not involve the statistical inference or distribution assumption of forecasting errors needed in most existing methods. Case studies using real wind farm data from Australia have been conducted. Comparing with benchmarks applied, experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency and reliability of the developed approach. It is therefore convinced that the proposed method provides a new generalized framework for probabilistic wind power forecasting with high reliability and flexibility and has a high potential of practical applications in power systems.

Abstract: The electricity market plays a key role in realizing the economic prophecy of smart grids. Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to construct prediction intervals of MCPs with a two-stage formulation. In the first stage, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to estimate point forecasts of MCPs and model uncertainties involved. In the second stage, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the noise variance. A generalized and comprehensive evaluation framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method has been validated through comprehensive tests using real price data from Australian electricity market.

Abstract: In order to achieve more efficient voltage regulation in a power system, coordinated secondary voltage control has been proposed, bringing in the extra benefit of enhancement of power system voltage stability margin. This paper investigates a new potential application of coordinated''secondary voltage control by multiple FACTS voltage controllers in eliminating voltage violations in power system contingencies. The study is presented by the example New England ten-machine power system with two SVCs and two STATCOMs installed. The coordinated secondary voltage control is assigned to the SVCs and STATCOMs in order to eliminate voltage violations in system contingencies. In the paper, it is proposed that the secondary voltage control is implemented by a learning fuzzy logic controller. A key parameter of the controller is trained by P-type learning algorithm via offline simulation with the assistance of injection of artificial loads in controller's adjacent locations. A multiagent collaboration protocol, which is graphically represented as a finite-state machine, is proposed in the paper for the coordination among multiple SVCs and STATCOMs. As an agent, each SVC or STATCOM can provide multilocation coverage to eliminate voltage violations at its adjacent nodes in the power system. Agents can provide collaborative support to each other which is coordinated according to the proposed collaboration protocol.

Abstract: Due to the economic and environmental benefits, wind power is becoming one of the more promising supplements for electric power generation. However, the uncertainty exhibited in wind power data is generally unacceptably large. Thus, the data should be accurately evaluated by operators to effectively mitigate the risks of Wind power on power system operations. Recognizing this challenge, a novel deep learning based ensemble approach is proposed for probabilistic wind power forecasting. In this approach, an advanced point forecasting method is originally proposed based on wavelet transform and convolutional neural network. Wavelet transform is used to decompose the raw wind power data into different frequencies. The nonlinear features in each frequency that are used to improve the forecast accuracy are later effectively learned by the convolutional neural network. The uncertainties in wind power data, i.e., the model misspecification and data noise, are separately identified thereafter. Consequently, the probabilistic distribution of wind power data can be statistically formulated. The proposed ensemble approach has been extensively assessed using real wind farm data from China, and the results demonstrate that the uncertainties in wind power data can be better learned using the proposed approach and that a competitive performance is obtained.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wind power penetration into modern power grids, wind speed forecasting (WSF) plays an increasingly significant role in the planning and operation of electric power and energy systems. However, the wind speed time series always exhibits nonlinear and non-stationary features, making it very difficult to be predicted accurately. Recognizing this challenge, a novel deep learning based approach is proposed for deterministic and probabilistic WSF. The approach is a hybrid of wavelet transform (WT), deep belief network (DBN) and spine quantile regression (QR). WT is employed to decompose raw wind speed data into different frequency series with better behaviors. The nonlinear features and invariant structures of each frequency are completely extracted by layer-wise pre-training based DBN. Then, the uncertainties in wind speed are statistically synthesized via the QR method. Case studies using real wind farm data from China and Australia have been presented. The comparative results demonstrate that the high-level nonlinear and non-stationary feature in the wind speed series can be learned better, and competitive performance can thus be obtained. It is therefore convinced that the proposed method has a high potential for practical applications in electric power and energy systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Given the current increasingly serious energy crisis, the development and utilization of new energy resources are attracting increasing attention, and wind power is widely used among these renewable energy resources. However, the randomness of wind power can cause a series of problems in the power system. Furthermore, the integration of large-scale wind farms into the whole power grid can place a great burden on stability and security. Accurate wind speed forecasting would reduce the randomness of wind power, which could effectively alleviate the adverse effects on the power system. In this paper, a hybrid wind speed forecasting model is proposed with the hope of achieving better forecasting performance. Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) was employed to decompose the wind speed series into several series with different frequencies. A Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), the parameters of which were tuned by a particle swarm optimization based on simulated annealing (PSOSA), was built to model those series. The optimal input form of the model was determined by Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the daily average wind speed series from four wind farms in Gansu Province, Northwest China, were used as a case study. The results of the simulation and Grey Relational Analysis indicate that the proposed model outperforms the comparison models, and the null hypothesis of the predicted series having the same mean of the real series was accepted.

Abstract: Smart meters play vital roles in the aspects of the management and operation of smart grids such as demand response, energy efficiency improvement, and electricity pricing. Massive amounts of data are being collected owing to the popularity of smart meters. Two main issues should be addressed in this context. One is the communication and storage of big data from smart meters at reduced cost. The other is the effective extraction of useful information from this massive dataset. In this paper, the K-SVD sparse representation technique, which includes two phases (dictionary learning and sparse coding), is used to decompose load profiles into linear combinations of several partial usage patterns (PUPs), which allows the smart meter data to be compressed and hidden electricity consumption patterns to be extracted. Then, a linear support vector machine (SVM) based method is used to classify the load profiles into two groups, residential customers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), based on the extracted patterns. Comprehensive comparisons with the results of k-means clustering, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), principal component analysis (PCA), and piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) are conducted on real datasets in Ireland. The results show that our proposed technique outperforms these methods in both compression ratio and classification accuracy.

Abstract: A closed-loop robust distribution state estimator was investigated. An approach that is suitable for medium voltage distribution networks which are either under-determined with limited real-time measurements or over-determined but with delayed information from smart meters was developed. The state estimator was designed to be robust against the effect of measurement errors, the type, location and accuracy of measurements, as well as temporary failure of the smart metering communication system. A machine learning function provides reliable input information to a robust state estimation algorithm. The output of the state estimator is then fed back to the machine learning function creating a closed-loop information flow which improves the performance of the state estimator. Test results and analysis on a 33-node system are provided.

Abstract: A new intelligent system (IS) is developed for real-time dynamic security assessment (DSA) of power systems. Taking an ensemble learning scheme, the IS structures a series of extreme learning machines (ELMs) and generalizes the randomness of single ELMs during the training. Benefiting from the unique properties of ELM and the strategically designed decision-making rules, the IS learns and works very fast and can estimate the credibility of its DSA results, allowing an accurate and reliable pre-fault DSA mechanism: credible results can be directly adopted while incredible results are decided by alternative tools such as time-domain simulation. This makes the IS promising for practical application since the potential unreliable results can be eliminated for use. Case studies considering classification and prediction are, respectively, conducted on an IEEE 50-machine system and a dynamic equivalent system of a real-world large power grid. The efficiency, robustness, accuracy, and reliability of the IS are demonstrated. In particular, it is observed that the IS could provide 100% classification accuracy and very low prediction error on its decided instances.

Abstract: A machine learning method called the ID3 (Interative Dichotomizer 3) approach is presented for the estimation of line flows and bus voltages following an outage event.  A decision tree which is capable of generating the desired line flows and bus voltages are created using the training patterns which are compiled from the historical operating records of Taiwan power system.  The established decision tree contains the knowledge which are essential for line flow and bus voltage prediction.  Thus, it can be applied to estimate line flows and bus voltages of a system in an efficient manner.  The effectiveness of the proposed ID3 approach is demonstrated by security assessment of Taiwan power system which contains 170 buses and 207 lines.

Abstract: Electricity prices have rather complex features such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity, mean reversion and non-stationarity that make forecasting very difficult. However, accurate electricity price forecasting is essential to market traders, retailers, and generation companies. To improve prediction accuracy using each model's unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach thdt combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the ARMA model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using electricity price data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), Australian and Spanish markets. The experimental results show that the developed method has more accurate prediction, better generality and practicability than individual methods and other hybrid methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyals (PCBs) is hazardous to human health. The United Nations Environment Programme has decreed that nations, including Canada and USA, must eliminate PCB contaminated equipment such as transformers by 2025. To determine the PCB status of a transformer with absolute certainty, the oil mixture of the transformer must be sampled because transformers labeled as non-PCB could be cross-contaminated. Since sealed oil mixture sampling is costly, for the first time, we apply an iterative machine learning technique called active learning to classify PCB contaminated transformers while minimizing a cost metric that integrates the classification error cost and the sampling cost. We propose a dynamic sampling method to address two key issues in active learning: the sampling size per iteration and the stopping criterion of the sampling process. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the real-world datasets from BC Hydro in Canada.

Abstract: Conventional wide-area control strategies that are deployed to damp inter-area oscillations use fixed a priori schemes based on modal analysis of the power system. As these controllers cannot be tuned online, such schemes fail to perform well during severe dynamic system changes. In this paper, a wide-area control architecture designed based on reinforcement learning and optimal adaptive critic network is proposed, that learns and optimizes the system closed-loop performance. Also, a value priority scheme is designed using a derived Lyapunov energy function for prioritization of local and the proposed wide-area global controller which ensures coherent damping of local and inter-area oscillations. The method increases the reliability and allows for automatic tuning of stabilizing controllers especially in the presence of wide-area monitoring constraints. Simulation results on 8-bus 5-machine and 68-bus 16-machine IEEE test systems highlight the efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources calls for new planning and operational tools. However, such tools depend on system topology and line parameters, which may be missing or inaccurate in distribution grids. With abundant data, one idea is to use linear regression to find line parameters, based on which topology can be identified. Unfortunately, the linear regression method is accurate only if there is no noise in both the input measurements (e.g., voltage magnitude and phase angle) and output measurements (e.g., active and reactive power). For topology estimation, even with a small error in measurements, the regression-based method is incapable of finding the topology using nonzero line parameters with a proper metric. To model input and output measurement errors simultaneously, we propose the error-in-variables model in a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for joint line parameter and topology estimation. While directly solving the problem is NP-hard, we successfully adapt the problem into a generalized low-rank approximation problem via variable transformation and noise decorrelation. For accurate topology estimation, we let it interact with parameter estimation in a fashion that is similar to expectation-maximization algorithm in machine learning. The proposed PaToPa approach does not require a radial network setting and works for mesh networks. We demonstrate the superior performance in accuracy for our method on IEEE test cases with actual feeder data from Southern California Edison.

Abstract: Online identification of postcontingency transient stability is essential in power system control, as it facilitates the grid operator to decide and coordinate system failure correction control actions. Utilizing machine learning methods with synchrophasor measurements for transient stability assessment has received much attention recently with the gradual deployment of wide-area protection and control systems. In this paper, we develop a transient stability assessment system based on the long short-term memory network. By proposing a temporal self-adaptive scheme, our proposed system aims to balance the trade-off between assessment accuracy and response time, both of which may be crucial in real-world scenarios. Compared with previous work, the most significant enhancement is that our system learns from the temporal data dependencies of the input data, which contributes to better assessment accuracy. In addition, the model structure of our system is relatively less complex, speeding up the model training process. Case studies on three power systems demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed transient stability as sessment system.

Abstract: This paper focuses on developing an interdisciplinary mechanism that combines machine learning, optimization, and data structure design to build a demand response and home energy management system that can meet the needs of real-life conditions. The loads of major home appliances are divided into three categories: 1) containing fixed loads; 2) regulate-able loads; and 3) deferrable loads, based on which a decoupled demand response mechanism is proposed for optimal energy management of the three categories of loads. A learning-based demand response strategy is developed for regulateable loads with a special focus on home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVACs). This paper presents how a learning system should be designed to learn the energy consumption model of HVACs, how to integrate the learning mechanism with optimization techniques to generate optimal demand response policies, and how a data structure should be designed to store and capture current home appliance behaviors properly. This paper investigates how the integrative and learning-based home energy management system behaves in a demand response framework. Case studies are conducted through an integrative simulation approach that combines a home energy simulator and MATLAB together for demand response evaluation.

Abstract: High-quality wind power prediction intervals (PIs) are of utmost importance for system planning and operation. To improve the reliability and sharpness of PIs, this paper proposes a new approach in which the original wind power series is first decomposed and grouped into components of reduced order of complexity using ensemble empirical mode decomposition and sample entropy techniques. The methods for the prediction of these components with extreme learning machine technique and the formation of the overall optimal PIs are then described. The effectiveness of proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to real wind farms from Australia and National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Compared to the existing methods without wind power series decomposition, the proposed approach is found to be more effective for wind power interval forecasts with higher reliability and sharpness.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel equilibrium-inspired multiagent optimizer (EMO) with extreme transfer learning for decentralized optimal carbon-energy combined-flow (OCECF) of large-scale power systems. The original large-scale power system is firstly divided into several small-scale subsystems, in which each subsystem is regarded as an agent, such that a decentralized OCECF can be achieved via a Nash game among all the agents. Then, a knowledge matrix associated with a state-action chain is presented for knowledge storing of the previous optimization tasks, which can be updated by a continuous interaction with the external environment. Furthermore, an extreme learning machine is adopted for an efficient transfer learning, such that the convergence rate of a new task can be dramatically accelerated by properly exploiting the prior knowledge of the source tasks. EMO has been thoroughly evaluated for the decentralized OCECF on IEEE 57-bus system, IEEE 300-bus system, and a practical Shenzhen power grid of southern China. Case studies and engineering application verify that EMO can effectively handle the decentralized OCECF of large-scale power systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fault diagnosis method for battery systems in electric vehicles based on big data statistical methods. According to machine learning algorithm and 3 sigma multi-level screening strategy (36-MSS), the abnormal changes of cell terminal voltages in a battery pack can be detected and calculated in the form of probability. Applying the neural network algorithm, this paper combines fault and defect diagnosis results with big data statistical regulation to construct a more complete battery system fault diagnosis model. Through analyzing the abnormalities hidden beneath the surface, researchers can see the design flaws in battery systems and provide feedback on the upstream of designing. Furthermore, the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm and clustering outlier diagnosis algorithm are applied to verifying the calculation results. To further validate the effectiveness of the diagnosis method, a corresponding analysis between statistical diagnosis results and actual vehicle is given. To test the big data diagnosis model, the diagnosis results based on the actual vehicle operating data for the whole year is shown. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A novel bidirectional mechanism and a backward forecasting model based on extreme learning machine (ELM) are proposed to address the issue of ultra-short term wind power time series forecasting. The backward forecasting model consists of a backward ELM network and an optimization algorithm. The reverse time series is generated to train backward ELM, assuming that the value to be forecasted is already known whereas one of the previous measurements is treated as unknown. In the framework of bidirectional mechanism, the forward forecast of a standard ELM network is incorporated as the initial value of optimization algorithm, by which error between the backward ELM output and the previous measurement is minimized for backward forecasting. Then the difference between forward and backward forecasting results is used as a criterion to develop the methods to correct forward forecast. If the difference exceeds a predefined threshold, the final forecast equals to the average of forward forecast and latest measurement. Otherwise the forward forecast keeps as the final forecast. The proposed models are applied to forecast wind farm production in six time horizons: 1-6 h. A comprehensive error analysis is carried out to compare the performance with other approaches. Results show that forecast improvement is observed based on the proposed bidirectional model. Some further considerations on improving wind power short term forecasting accuracy by use of bidirectional mechanistn are discussed as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a robust extreme learning machine is proposed. In comparison with the original extreme learning machine and the regularized extreme learning machine, this robust algorithm minimizes both the mean and variance of modeling errors in the objective function to overcome the bias-variance dilemma. As a result, its generalization performance and robustness are enhanced, and these merits are further proved theoretically. In addition, this proposed algorithm can keep the same computational efficiency as the original extreme learning machine and the regularized extreme learning machine. Then, several benchmark data sets are used to test the effectiveness and soundness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, it is employed to model a real small-scale turbojet engine. This engine is fit well. Especially, on the idle phase, where the signal-to-noise ratio is low and it is very hard to model, the proposed algorithm performs well and its robustness is sufficiently showcased. All in all, the proposed algorithm provides a candidate technique for modeling real systems.

Abstract: Conventional methods are less robust in terms of accurately forecasting non-stationary and nonlineary carbon prices. In this study, we propose an empirical mode decomposition-based evolutionary least squares support vector regression multiscale ensemble forecasting model for carbon price forecasting. Firstly, each carbon price is disassembled into several simple modes with high stability and high regularity via empirical mode decomposition. Secondly, particle swarm optimization-based evolutionary least squares support vector regression is used to forecast each mode. Thirdly, the forecasted values of all the modes are composed into the ones of the original carbon price. Finally, using four different matured carbon futures prices under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme as samples, the empirical results show that the proposed model is more robust than the other popular forecasting methods in terms of statistical measures and trading performances.

Abstract: Comprehensive energy modeling and saving potential analysis play a key role in sustainable development of complex petrochemical industry. However, it is difficult to make effective energy modeling and saving potential analysis due to the characteristics of uncertainty, high nonlinearity, and with noise of the data collected from the practical production. To deal with this problem, an energy modeling and saving potential analysis method using a novel extreme learning fuzzy logic network is proposed. In the proposed method, Mamdani type fuzzy inference system and multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network are integrated. First, the original ethylene production data is fused into a comprehensive energy consumption index. Then the index is fuzzified as outputs instead of precise values. Finally, an extreme learning algorithm based on Moore-Penrose Inverse is utilized to train the network efficiently. Three levels of energy efficiency of "low efficiency, median efficiency and high efficiency" can be effectively classified using the proposed method. For "low efficiency", valid slack variables are predicted for finding the direction of improving energy efficiency and then analyzing the energy saving potential. The performance and the practicality of the proposed method are confirmed through an application of China ethylene industry. Simulation results show that low-efficiency samples can be effectively improved to be high-efficiency samples and the energy saving potential in terms of the crude oil reduction amount is indicted as 8.82%.
