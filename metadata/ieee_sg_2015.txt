Abstract: A method for the coordination of multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is proposed for voltage control in low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs). The main objective of this method is to solve over-voltage problems with multiple suitably sized energy storage systems. The performance of coordinated control is compared with noncoordinated control using both a real-time digital simulator and a MATLAB model of a real U.K. LVDN with a high installed capacity of solar photovoltaics. This is used to show that coordinated control is robust and effective at preventing voltage rise problems in LVDNs. The proposed coordinated control scheme is able to use the BESSs more evenly, and therefore reduces the costs of battery replacement to the storage operator in terms of both number of batteries and maintenance visits.

Abstract: With introducing demand response provider (DRP) in smart grid paradigm, small consumers can actively participate in various demand response programs, especially price-based programs. This newly important matter can significantly affect the power system problems, such as expansion planning. Accordingly, consideration of small consumers via DRP in long-term market equilibrium can be notably useful. This paper proposes a bi-level game framework with iterating between master and slave level to find the long-term market equilibrium in the pool-based market, including opponent generation companies (GenCos), DRP, and independent system operator (ISO). In the master level, a set of investment decisions are generated. Then, the system information is updated and the market is cleared in the slave level. After evaluating all decision-making options, the ISO selects the best option based on a tradeoff analysis. The proposed method is examined on a system with one DRP and two GenCos under ISOs supervision.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method, called wavelet scale decomposition, for modal analysis of ambient synchrophasor data using orthogonal wavelet bases. Wavelet formulation of the problem enables reliable estimation results even with short data analysis windows that are a few minutes long. Also, in addition to finding the mode frequency and damping ratio of oscillatory modes, the proposed method is able to estimate their mode shapes as well. The method is tested on some archived real phasor measurement unit data sets and on simulations from Kundur two area system. The results show that the proposed method is able to track damping ratio variations in power systems effectively with short analysis windows.

Abstract: A new numerical algorithm for the analysis of single line to ground faults on short overhead transmission lines is presented in this paper. It is based upon synchronized sampling at two line ports, and an accurate fault model including the arcing phenomena and tower footing resistance at the fault point. The core of the algorithm is an efficient nonrecursive parameter estimation method. A dynamic arc model is included in the fault model to represent the arc's interaction with the external power network. The algorithm accurately estimates the arc voltage amplitude, tower footing resistance, and the fault location, simultaneously. The algorithm is derived in the time domain, and is based on the synchronized acquisition of currents and voltages at both line terminals. Case studies based on simulated data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. In particular, the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to synchronization errors, harmonics, line capacitance, and fault resistance were explored with lumped, distributed, transposed, and untransposed line models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a distributed economic dispatch strategy for microgrids with multiple energy storage systems. This strategy overcomes the challenges of dynamic couplings among all decision variables and stochastic variables in a centralized dispatching formulation. The proposed strategy can be implemented in the microgrid central controller as multiple problems with simplified and decomposed formulations. It can also be implemented in the local controllers and managed by the central controller. Numerical studies and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed dispatching systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of various technologies and applications in smart grid implementation, demand response has attracted growing research interests because of its potentials in enhancing power grid reliability with reduced system operation costs. This paper presents a new demand response model with elastic economic dispatch in a locational marginal pricing market. It models system economic dispatch as a feedback control process, and introduces a flexible and adjustable load cost as a controlled signal to adjust demand response. Compared with the conventional "one time use" static load dispatch model, this dynamic feedback demand response model may adjust the load to a desired level in a finite number of time steps and a proof of convergence is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation and boundary calculation using interval mathematics are applied for describing uncertainty of end-user's response to an independent system operator's expected dispatch. A numerical analysis based on the modified Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland power pool five-bus system is introduced for simulation and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. System operators may use the proposed model to obtain insights in demand response processes for their decision-making regarding system load levels and operation conditions.

Abstract: The traditional neutral voltage problem in low-voltage (LV) four-wire multigrounded distribution networks can be aggravated due to an unbalanced allocation of one-phase photovoltaic (PV) units. Inherent limitations restrict the performance of the traditional strategies to mitigate the combined effect of load and PV unbalance. To overcome the shortcoming of traditional approaches, a new dynamic mitigation approach using community energy storage (CES) is proposed in this paper. A power balancing algorithm is developed to perform the balancing operation while minimizing power drawn from the CES. A charge/discharge control strategy is developed that will continuously balance and dynamically adjust the power exchange with the grid in a real time, and mitigate the neutral current and neutral voltage rise. To investigate the applicability of the proposed approach under physical time delays associated with battery and PV systems, a suitable dynamic model is developed. An Australian LV distribution system is used to verify the proposed approach under daylong variations of load and PV, and also during short-term variations of PV output caused by cloud passing.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study the effectiveness of customer engagement plans that clearly specify the amount of intervention in customer's load settings by the grid operator for peak load reduction. We suggest two different types of plans, including constant deviation plans (CDPs) and proportional deviation plans (PDPs). We define an adjustable reference temperature for both CDPs and PDPs to limit the output temperature of each thermostat load and to control the number of devices eligible to participate in demand response program. We model thermostat loads as power throttling devices and design algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan parameters on peak load reduction. Based on the simulation results, we recommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable thermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with similar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple power throttling states, customer engagement plans with less temperature deviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical ON/OFF control, higher temperature deviations are required to achieve similar amount of peak load reduction. Several other interesting tradeoffs and useful guidelines for designing mutually beneficial incentives for both the grid operator and customers can also be identified.

Abstract: This paper addresses the transparent and realistic optimum day-ahead (DA) scheduling for a hybrid power system by explicitly considering the uncertainties. The basic components of the hybrid power system include conventional thermal generators, wind farm, and solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. A set of batteries is available for energy storage and/or discharge. The most critical problem in operating a wind farm or solar PV module is that these renewable energy resources cannot be dispatched in the same manner as conventional plants, because they involve climatic factors such as wind velocity and solar irradiation. This paper proposes the optimal scheduling strategy taking into account the impact of uncertainties in wind, solar PV, and load forecasts, and provides the best-fit DA schedule by minimizing both DA and real-time adjustment costs including the revenue from renewable energy certificates. This strategy consists of a genetic algorithm (GA)-based scheduling and a two-point estimate-based probabilistic real-time optimal power flow. The simulation for the IEEE 30-bus system with the GA and two-point estimate method, and the GA and Monte Carlo simulation have been obtained to test the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategy.

Abstract: Demand response is an essential issue in smart grid. The central problem is balancing the user cost and the social utility. We focus on the multi-objective energy consumption scheduling problem based on the third-party management. The aim is to provide diverse, uniformly-distributed, and accurate solutions to the third-party decision-maker. The novel contribution of this paper is that it provides an exact choice in energy consumption scheduling. First, we investigate the mathematical model, which dispatches the power consumption for different users in different time slots considering the users' preferences. Then, we propose a matrix-encoding scheme. The energy matrix and the demand matrix are the key factors. The constraints are handled based on the dot product of the two matrixes. In addition, we adopt a scheduling algorithm based on Tchebycheff decomposition. We define several metrics to evaluate the quality of the solutions for the decision-maker. The neighbor generation distance is proposed to reflect the convergence. The metric S and the metric C are used to represent the diversity and coverage, respectively. The metric HV is used to give a comprehensive evaluation. The simulation illustrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II in convergence, diversity, and coverage. It obtains a wider search region at a faster search speed than the NSGA-II algorithm.

Abstract: The design of communication infrastructure in cyber physical system (CPS) is of vital importance for proper operations of physical dynamics. In this paper, the scheduling of packet transmission over wireless communication networks in CPS is studied for the purpose of system state stabilization. To measure the effective information amount of different packets, the concept of virtual queue (VQ) is defined based on the delay-tolerant Kalman filtering. VQ-based back pressure algorithm is proposed for the distributed data traffic scheduling. The impact of transmission delays on VQ lengths is also studied for the formulation of distributed scheduling strategy. The scheduling method is then applied in the context of voltage control in microgrid and is demonstrated to achieve better performance than general scheduling algorithm without the awareness of dynamics state. Further numerical simulations of data traffic scheduling considering transmission delay are carried out to demonstrate the validity of the scheduling algorithm, which is established according to VQ lengths affected by transmission time delays.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized multiagent system (MAS) approach for service restoration using controlled distributed generator (DG) islanding. Furthermore, it investigates the impacts of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) facility of the electric vehicles (EVs) for service restoration. Service restoration is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem considering maximization of priority load restored and minimization of switching operations as the multiple objectives and solved using the proposed decentralized MAS approach. Extensive case studies are conducted on 38, 69, and 119 bus distribution systems, and the following advantages of the proposed MAS approach are observed: 1) flexibility-to perform under different DG and EV penetration levels; 2) scalability-to restore service for different size test systems, small as well as large; and 3) robustness-ability to perform efficiently for both single as well as multiple-fault situations. The simulation results also highlight the benefits of V2G feature of EVs for service restoration.

Abstract: Droop control by means of virtual resistance (VR) control loops can be applied to paralleled dc-dc converters for achieving autonomous equal power sharing. However, equal power sharing does not guarantee an efficient operation of the whole system. In order to achieve higher efficiency and lower energy losses, this paper proposes a tertiary control level including an optimization method for achieving efficient operation. As the efficiency of each converter changes with the output power, VR values are set as decision variables for modifying the power sharing ratio among converters. A genetic algorithm is used in searching for a global efficiency optimum. In addition, a secondary control level is added to regulate the output voltage drooped by the VRs. However, system dynamics is affected when shifting up/down the VR references. Therefore, a secondary control for system damping is proposed and applied for maintaining system stability. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method. The results show that the system efficiency is improved by using tertiary optimization control and the desired transient response is ensured with system damping secondary control.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy has become a critical issue in recent years. The future power system is foreseen to depend on distributed energy resource (DER) excessively for continuous load support. Yet, DER providers are also facing limited choices in their produced renewable energy. Massive information and complicated cooperation emerging from involvers intensify issues in terms of efficiency, reliability, and scalability. In this paper, a cloud-based framework is proposed to provide a customer-oriented energy management as a service (EMaaS) for green communities, which are formed as virtual retail electricity providers (REPs) by involved DERs providers. It can be adopted by existing REPs or utilities. For each green community, the multiperiod global cost is minimized to promote renewable energy, and renewable energy consumption is stabilized to enhance integration. A solvable linear programming model is formulated for EMaaS. The case studies results reveal the proposed EMaaS retains satisfactory performances.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a centralized electric vehicles (EVs) recharge scheduling system for parking lots using a realistic vehicular mobility/parking pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We consider two different types of EV based on their mobility/parking patterns: 1) regular EVs; and 2) irregular EVs. An extensive trace-based vehicular mobility model collected from the Canton of Zurich is used for the regular EVs, and a probabilistic pattern built on top of this trace is used for modeling the behavior of irregular EVs. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first EV charging scheduling study in the literature that takes into account a realistic vehicular mobility pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We compare the performance of our proposed system with two well-known basic scheduling mechanisms, first come first serve and earliest deadline first, with regard to two objective functions: 1) maximizing the total parking lot revenue; and 2) maximizing the total number of EVs fulfilling their requirements. Comparison results show that our proposed system outperforms well-known basic scheduling mechanisms with regards to both objectives. Parking lots managing the recharging of a high number of EVs will greatly benefit from using such recharge scheduling systems in the context of smart cities.

Abstract: Microgrids are an effective way to increase the penetration of distributed generation into the grid. They are capable of operating either in grid-connected or in islanded mode, thereby increasing the supply reliability for the end user. This paper focuses on achieving seamless transitions from islanded to grid-connected and vice versa for a single phase microgrid made up from voltage controlled voltage source inverters (VC-VSIs) and current controlled voltage source inverters (CC-VSIs) working together in both modes of operation. The primary control structures for the VC-VSIs and CC-VSIs is considered together with the secondary control loops that are used to synchronize the microgrid as a single unit to the grid. Simulation results are given that show the seamless transitions between the two modes without any disconnection times for the CC-VSIs and VC-VSIs connected to the microgrid.

Abstract: We consider the sequential (i.e., online) detection of false data injection attacks in smart grid, which aims to manipulate the state estimation procedure by injecting malicious data to the monitoring meters. The unknown parameters in the system, namely the state vector, injected malicious data and the set of attacked meters pose a significant challenge for designing a robust, computationally efficient, and high-performance detector. We propose a sequential detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio to address this challenge. Specifically, the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a variety of attacking strategies, and load situations in the power system, and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection delay and robustness to various attacking strategies. For wide-area monitoring in smart grid, we further develop a distributed sequential detector using an adaptive sampling technique called level-triggered sampling. The resulting distributed detector features single bit per sample in terms of the communication overhead, while preserving the high performance of the proposed centralized detector.

Abstract: High levels of penetration of distributed generation and aggressive reactive power compensation may result in the reversal of power flows in future distribution grids. The voltage stability of these operating conditions may be very different from the more traditional power consumption regime. This paper focuses on the demonstration of multistability phenomenon in radial distribution systems with reversed power flow where multiple stable equilibria coexist for the given set of parameters. The system may experience transitions between different equilibria after being subjected to disturbances such as short-term losses of distributed generation or transient faults. Convergence to an undesirable equilibrium places the system in an emergency or in extremis state. Traditional emergency control schemes are not capable of restoring the system if it gets entrapped in one of the low voltage equilibria. Moreover, undervoltage load shedding may have a reverse action on the system and can induce voltage collapse. We propose a novel pulse emergency control strategy that restores the system to the normal state without any interruption of power delivery. The results are validated with dynamic simulations of IEEE 13-bus feeder performed with SystemModeler software. The dynamic models can also be used for characterization of the solution branches via a novel approach, so-called the admittance homotopy power flow method.

Abstract: Micro-grids require active control to maintain quality of service and to interface with the power grid in a bi-directional manner. Further, micro-grids must be justified by environmental, governmental, and economic viability. We present a programmable architecture for active, optimal distributed control of elements of the grid to achieve desired behavior. A unique aspect of this architecture is to include a distributed inductive engine for learning the local dynamics of generators and loads in the micro-grid. It generates feedback laws that are adapted to the current status of the micro-grid, and responds to anomalous events in a resilient manner. An important novelty is that control laws are extracted online for bidirectional discontinuous nonlinear loads by mean field methods from physics outside the standard design methodologies for piecewise linear quadratic controls.

Abstract: Distribution systems are undergoing many enhancements and developments to enable the future smart grid, and distribution system state estimation (DSSE) provides the control centers with the information necessary for several of its applications and operational functions. However, the quality of DSSE typically suffers from a lack of adequate/accurate measurements. Recently, many electric utilities have started to install fairly accurate smart meters throughout their distribution networks, which create an opportunity to achieve higher quality DSSE. However, the signals provided by smart meters are generally not synchronized and the difference between the measurement times of smart meters can be significant. Therefore, a complete snapshot of the entire distribution system may not be available. This paper proposes a method to deal with the issue of nonsynchronized measurements coming from smart meters based on the credibility of each available measurement and appropriately adjusting the variance of the measurement devices. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two IEEE benchmark systems are used. The results show that the proposed method is robust and improves the accuracy of DSSE compared with the traditional DSSE approach.

Abstract: Smart grid, as the next generation of power grid characterized by "two-way" communications, has been paid great attention to realizing green, reliable, and efficient electricity delivery for our future lives. In order to support the two-way communications in smart grid, a large number of smart meters (SMs) should be deployed to customers to report their near real-time data to control center for monitoring purpose. However, this kind of real-time report could disclose users' privacy, bringing down the users' willingness to participate in smart grid. In order to address the challenge, in this paper, by considering the lifetime of SMs as exponential distribution, we propose a diverse grouping-based aggregation protocol with error detection (DG-APED), which employs differential privacy technique into grouping-based private stream aggregation for secure smart grid communications. DG-APED can not only achieve privacy-preserving aggregation, but also perform error detection efficiently when some SMs are malfunctioning. Detailed security analysis shows that DG-APED can guarantee the security and privacy requirements of smart grid communications. In addition, extensive performance evaluation also verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DG-APED.

Abstract: Recent investigations have revealed the susceptibility of phasor measurement units (PMUs) to the time synchronization attack by spoofing its global positioning system (GPS). This paper proposes a cross-layer detection mechanism to fight against simultaneous attacks toward multiple PMUs. In the physical layer, we propose a GPS carrier-to-noise ratio (C/No) based spoofing detection technique. We apply the patch-monopole hybrid antenna to two GPS receivers and compute the difference between the standard deviation of each receiver's C/No. The priori probability of spoofing is calculated from the distributions of the difference. A counter is embedded in the physical layer to identify the most suspicious PMU. In the upper layer, the spoofing attack is considered similarly to the bad data injection toward the power system. A trustworthiness evaluation, which is based on both the physical layer information and power grid measurements, is applied to identify the PMU being attacked. An experiment has been carried to validate the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, a community microgrid with multiple ac and dc microgrids is introduced and analyzed. Individual microgrids with different frequency and voltage requirements would operate as self-controlled entities, which could also cooperate with neighboring microgrids for providing backup operations in the community microgrid. A hierarchical coordination strategy with primary, secondary, and tertiary coordination is proposed for the economic operation of an islanded community microgrid. The hierarchical strategy is also applied to a grid-connected community microgrid and the results are discussed. The simulation results verify that the proposed hierarchical coordination strategy is an effective and efficient way for coordinating microgrid flows in an islanded community microgrid, while maintaining the rated frequency and voltage with each microgrid. The simulation results also demonstrate the economic operation of a grid-connected community microgrid in which individual microgrids operate as autonomous agents, while satisfying the community objectives.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) algorithms manipulate the energy consumption schedules of controllable loads so as to satisfy grid objectives. Implementation of DR algorithms using a centralized agent can be problematic for scalability reasons, and there are issues related to the privacy of data and robustness to communication failures. Thus, it is desirable to use a scalable decentralized algorithm for the implementation of DR. In this paper, a hierarchical DR scheme is proposed for peak minimization based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD). In addition, a time weighted maximization option is included in the cost function, which improves the quality of service for devices seeking to receive their desired energy sooner rather than later. This paper also demonstrates how the DWD algorithm can be implemented more efficiently through the calculation of the upper and lower cost bounds after each DWD iteration.

Abstract: A low-voltage islanded dc microgrid contains a number of renewable energy sources, local loads, and energy storage systems (ESS). To avoid the over-charging and over-discharging situations of ESS, a coordinated control strategy should be used in islanded dc microgrids. In this paper, a novel bus-signaling method (BSM) is proposed to achieve autonomous coordinated performance of system according to different state of charge conditions. Additionally, a secondary coordinated control is introduced to restore the voltage deviation produced by primary control level without decaying coordinated performance. The proposed control algorithm and controller implementation based on BSM are also presented. Finally, real-time simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach by presenting the operation of an islanded dc microgrid in different testing scenarios.

Abstract: To reduce their operational costs, datacenter (DC) operators can schedule large jobs at DCs in different geographical locations with time- and location-varying electricity and bandwidth prices. We introduce a framework and algorithms to do so that minimize electricity and bandwidth cost subject to job indivisibility, deadlines, priorities, and DC resource constraints. In doing so, we provide a way for DC operators to predict their operational costs for different DC placements and capacities, and thus make informed decisions about how to expand their DC network. Our distributed algorithm uses estimated job arrivals and day-ahead electricity prices to optimize over sliding time windows. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a Google DC trace and investigate the effects of different cost and performance criteria. The algorithm leverages heterogeneous job resource requirements and routing and scheduling flexibility: even deadline and indivisibility constraints yield little cost increase, though they significantly improve job completion times and localization at only one DC, respectively. We show that our algorithm reduces the cost much more than optimizing only electricity, only bandwidth, or a combination of resource costs and job completion times.

Abstract: In this paper, a converter-based dc microgrid is studied. By considering the impact of each component in dc microgrids on system stability, a multistage configuration is employed, which includes the source stage, interface converter stage between buses, and common load stage. In order to study the overall stability of the above dc microgrid with constant power loads (CPLs), a comprehensive small-signal model is derived by analyzing the interface converters in each stage. The instability issue induced by the CPLs is revealed by using the criteria of impedance matching. Meanwhile, virtual-impedance-based stabilizers are proposed in order to enhance the damping of dc microgrids with CPLs and guarantee the stable operation. Since droop control is commonly used to reach proper load power sharing in dc microgrids, its impact is taken into account when testing the proposed stabilizers. By using the proposed stabilizers, virtual impedances are employed in the output filters of the interface converters in the second stage of the multistage configuration. In particular, one of the virtual impedances is connected in series with the filter capacitor, and the other one is connected at the output path of the converter. It can be seen that by using the proposed stabilizers, the unstable poles induced by the CPLs are forced to move into the stable region. The proposed method is verified by the MATLAB/Simulink model of multistage dc microgrids with three distributed power generation units.

Abstract: Microgrids can operate in both grid-connected and islanded modes. In order to seamlessly transfer from islanded to grid-connected modes, it is necessary to synchronize microgrid voltage and frequency, and phase to the main grid. However, since the microgrid is often based on power electronic converters, the synchronization process is quite different compared with the quasi-synchronism control in conventional power systems. First, in order to address this concern, the microgrid synchronization criteria are derived. Based on these criteria, a novel distributed active synchronization strategy is proposed, which takes into account not only the fundamental component, but also positive and negative sequences of the harmonic components. This way, a seamless reconnection to the main grid can be performed. The proposed method is implemented in the secondary control level of a hierarchical control structure. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop results show the feasibility of the proposed technique.

Abstract: Proliferation of private distributed energy resources (DERs) necessitates devising effective energy management frameworks. This paper aims at establishing a decentralized model for the optimal dispatch of DERs in smart grids. The objective function is to minimize expected procurement cost of demand while profit of private DER owners is not sacrificed. Unit management modules (UMMs) embedded in private DERs and a central agent are autonomous agents of the model. The approach is iterative. In each iteration, the central agent announces to UMMs its procurement strategy, which contains purchased powers and their prices. Then, UMMs optimize and send back their output power and selling price proposals in the hope of achieving higher profits. The energy service provider (ESP) gathers the bids and modifies the procurement strategy whenever bids are in line with the cost minimization objective. The service provider releases the last procurement strategy in response to which UMMs synchronously update and send back their bids. The mutual interaction between UMMs and ESP is continued to the point in which no further modification in ESP's procurement strategy is experienced. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by its implementation in a system with a few DERs from different types.

Abstract: This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to design a distributed real-time electricity pricing mechanism. Our approach is novel in that it guarantees individual rationality, meaning that it provides suppliers and consumers with a guaranteed incentive to participate in the real-time pricing market. Such an incentive is devised by offering a time-varying, situation-dependent subsidy that guarantees that a supplier/consumer profits by switching from a fixed-price contract to the real-time pricing contract. Although we assume that suppliers and consumers decide supply and demand quantities in a fully distributed manner to maximize their own profit, the proposed mechanism guarantees under moderate conditions that the market converges through an iterative process to a Nash equilibrium that maximizes social welfare. Furthermore, in order to guarantee safe operation of an electrical grid, our pricing mechanism increases stability of load frequency control, and at the same time, achieves supply-demand equilibrium by explicitly taking into account an equality constraint through dual decomposition method. We empirically demonstrate by simulations the individual rationality of the proposed mechanism as well as the convergence to supply-demand equilibrium.

Abstract: It is known that the choice of gain (K) in the Sandia frequency shift (SFS) scheme has direct impacts on the stability of a system with grid-connected distributed generations (DGs). In this paper, a scheduled perturbation technique is proposed to reduce the stability impact of K. In the proposed technique, chopping fraction (cf) is used to compensate for reduction in the value of K, where higher cf values are used to achieve zero nondetection zone (NDZ) under low gain SFS. It is shown by analysis that theoretical reduction of NDZ can be always achieved for a nonzero value of cf. Simulations for single-and multi-DGs systems are performed to verify the analytical analysis. It is shown that an appropriate design of scheduled signal duty cycle (d) is of critical importance to realize the proposed reduction in NDZ. While close synchronization of perturbation signals for multi-DG system is required, a delay of 0.33 s is shown to be tolerated for a two-DG system. Synchronization can be achieved either through locally synchronized timers or by limited communication among DGs. The proposed technique provides an attractive option for systems with high DG penetration by reducing the negative impact of K on stability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of control bandwidth on the stability of loads, which are interfaced through power electronic converters and are fed from a dc power source. When tightly regulated, these loads exhibit a constant power load (CPL) behavior. It is shown here that the ideal CPL assumption, prevalent in literature, may not represent the worst case in real-life applications. If the control bandwidth of the load is sufficiently high, the load behaves like a CPL, and the system stability margin decreases with the increase in output power. However, in a practical range, with a lower control bandwidth, the system stability margin is influenced critically by the converter's characteristic impedance, as well as its output power. Under these conditions, the minimum stability margin may occur at a low-power range.

Abstract: With the bidirectional power flow provided by the Energy Internet, various methods are promoted to improve and increase the energy utilization between Energy Internet and main grid (MG). This paper proposes a novel distributed coordinated controller combined with a multiagent-based consensus algorithm, which is applied to distributed generators in the Energy Internet. Then, the decomposed tasks, models, and information flow of the proposed method are analyzed. The proposed coordinated controller installed between the Energy Internet and MG keeps voltage angles and amplitudes consensus, while providing accurate power-sharing and minimizing circulating currents. Finally, the Energy Internet can be integrated into the MG seamlessly if necessary. Hence, the Energy Internet can be operated as a spinning reserve system. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in an Energy Internet.

Abstract: In this paper, simultaneous control of active power and volt/var is explored with photovoltaic (PV) generators in distribution systems. The PV active power output can be controlled in the load-following mode when sufficient solar power is available to supply a local load, or the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode when a local load is large or injection to the system is allowed. Two selected control approaches, P-Q control in the load-following mode and P-V control in the MPPT mode, are investigated in this paper. The P-Q control is implemented with a relatively simple approach, while the P-V control demands an extra MPPT logic, which is solved based on a power balance between the dc and ac sides in a two-stage PV configuration. The control algorithms are tested with the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder with various system conditions like the presence of multiple PV generators, imbalance, harmonics, and faults. The MATLAB and SimPowerSystems simulation results clearly demonstrate the capability of the proposed control in maintaining the P/V bus as either a P-Q or P-V bus depending on different applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer second-order cone programing (MISOCP) model to solve the optimal operation problem of radial distribution networks (DNs) with energy storage. The control variables are the active and reactive generated power of dispatchable distributed generators (DGs), the number of switchable capacitor bank units in operation, the tap position of the voltage regulators and on-load tap-changers, and the operation state of the energy storage devices. The objective is to minimize the total cost of energy purchased from the distribution substation and the dispatchable DGs. The steady-state operation of the DN is modeled using linear and second-order cone programing. The use of an MISOCP model guarantees convergence to optimality using existing optimization software. A mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) formulation for the original model is also presented in order to show the accuracy of the proposed MISOCP model. An 11-node test system and a 42-node real system were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MISOCP and MILP models.

Abstract: This paper presents the mathematical formulation and control architecture of a stochastic-predictive energy management system for isolated microgrids. The proposed strategy addresses uncertainty using a two-stage decision process combined with a receding horizon approach. The first stage decision variables (unit commitment) are determined using a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming formulation, whereas the second stage variables (optimal power flow) are refined using a nonlinear programming formulation. This novel approach was tested on a modified CIGRE test system under different configurations comparing the results with respect to a deterministic approach. The results show the appropriateness of the method to account for uncertainty in the power forecast.

Abstract: Consumer demand profiles and fluctuating renewable power generation are two main sources of uncertainty in matching demand and supply. This paper proposes a model of the electricity market that captures the uncertainties on both the operator and user sides. The system operator (SO) implements a temporal linear pricing strategy that depends on real-time demand and renewable generation in the considered period combining real-time pricing with time-of-use pricing. The announced pricing strategy sets up a noncooperative game of incomplete information among the users with heterogeneous, but correlated consumption preferences. An explicit characterization of the optimal user behavior using the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution concept is derived. This explicit characterization allows the SO to derive pricing policies that influence demand to serve practical objectives, such as minimizing peak-to-average ratio or attaining a desired rate of return. Numerical experiments show that the pricing policies yield close to optimal welfare values while improving these practical objectives.

Abstract: We illustrate the potential of applying population games in two key related problems in microgrids management: 1) economic dispatch of active and reactive power; and 2) demand response. For the dynamic economic dispatch problem, we present a hierarchical microgrid energy management algorithm able to dispatch active and reactive power dynamically. In the second case, we use an opinion dynamics model, including the market in which the network agents interact. Opinion dynamics considers individuals who shape their beliefs based on information they receive from a subset of the society and offers tools to analyze the outcome of collective decision processes, which apparently can be considered arbitrary. We propose an opinion dynamics model including some desired characteristics, such as prominent agents and environmental incentives.

Abstract: Price-directed demand in smart grids operating within deregulated electricity markets calls for real-time forecasting of the price of electricity for the purpose of scheduling demand at the nodal level (e.g., appliances, machines, and devices) in a way that minimizes energy cost to the consumer. In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naive forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid methodology over the other tested methods with regard to mean absolute error for electricity signal pricing forecasting.

Abstract: Grid integration of wind generation is challenging in view of wind uncertainties and possible transmission congestions. Without considering transmission, a stochastic unit commitment problem was solved in our previous work by modeling aggregated wind as a Markov chain instead of scenarios for reduced complexity. With congestion, wind generation at different locations cannot be aggregated and is modeled as a Markov chain per wind node, and the resulting global states are a large number of combinations of nodal states. To avoid explicitly considering all such global states, interval optimization is synergistically integrated with the Markovian approach in this paper. The key is to divide the generation level of a conventional unit into a Markovian component that depends on the local state, and an interval component that manages extreme nonlocal states. With appropriate transformations, the problem is converted to a linear form and is solved by using branch-and-cut. Numerical results demonstrate that the over conservativeness of pure interval optimization is much alleviated, and the new approach is effective in terms of computational efficiency, simulation cost, and solution feasibility. In addition, solar generation shares a similar uncertain nature as wind generation, and can thus be modeled and solved similarly.

Abstract: As we transition toward a power grid that is increasingly based on renewable resources like solar and wind, the intelligent control of distributed energy resources (DERs) including photovoltaic (PV) arrays, controllable loads, energy storage, and plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) will be critical to realizing a power grid that can handle both the variability and unpredictability of renewable energy sources as well as increasing system complexity. Realizing such a decentralized and dynamic infrastructure will require the ability to solve large scale problems in real-time with hundreds of thousands of DERs simultaneously online. Because of the scale of the optimization problem, we use an iterative distributed algorithm previously developed in our group to operate each DER independently and autonomously within this environment. The algorithm is deployed within a framework that allows the microgrid to dynamically adapt to changes in the operating environment. Specifically, we consider a commercial site equipped with on-site PV generation, partially curtailable load, EV charge stations and a battery electric storage unit. The site operates as a small microgrid that can participate in the wholesale market on the power grid. We report results for simulations using real-data that demonstrate the ability of the optimization framework to respond dynamically in real-time to external conditions while maintaining the functional requirements of all DERs.

Abstract: Active networks require modifications of control logic and fast load/generator shedding actions to preserve system stability in case of the creation of islands. Today, industrial networks are designed to run both in parallel with the grid (if is present) and in islanded mode. The transmission system operator in public networks, on the other hand, does not allow islands. This will change as the detection of separated areas with generation capacity and loads will become crucial for the activation of the required control actions in public networks. Here, we describe an algorithm that automatically selects the events that may cause the system islanding, recognizes the island configuration, and calculates the amount of power to shed (when required). This algorithm is the very core of a power management system both for industrial applications today and for future public networks. It can be used to start all the required reactions to islanding, e.g., frequency control and load-shedding. The algorithm is for general-purpose and it does not require any customization for a specific network. The algorithm is based only on the network topology and it does not require data on the network parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, a strategy that employs an adaptive voltage droop control to achieve accurate reactive power sharing is investigated. Instead of controlling the output voltage of the inverter directly, the voltage droop slope is tuned to compensate for the mismatch in the voltage drops across feeders by using communication links. If the communication channel is disrupted, the controller will operate with the last tuned droop coefficient, which is shown to still outperform the controller with the initial fixed droop coefficient. Also, the net control action of the adaptive droop terms is demonstrated to have a negligible effect on the microgrid bus voltage. Since communication is not used within the tuning control loop, the strategy is inherently immune to delays in communication links. A small-signal model of the proposed controller is presented, and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on a 1.2 kVA prototype microgrid.

Abstract: Designing fair compensation mechanisms for demand response (DR) is challenging. This paper models the problem in a game theoretic setting and designs a payment distribution mechanism based on the Shapley value (SV). As exact computation of the SV is in general intractable, we propose estimating it using a reinforcement learning algorithm that approximates optimal stratified sampling. We apply this algorithm to a DR program that utilizes the SV for payments and quantify the accuracy of the resulting estimates.

Abstract: Of the numerous types of distributed generators (DGs), synchronous DGs represent the most substantial contribution to fault currents and, consequently, have the greatest effect on the operation of the protection system. On the other hand, many types of DGs require power electronic (PE) interfaces at the points where they connect to the grid, which are normally left idle during fault conditions. This paper presents a novel idea for employing the PE interfaces of inverter-based DGs (IBDGs) as a means of managing the fault current contribution of synchronous DGs through the modification of the IBDG current phase angle during fault conditions. This operation enables synchronous DGs and IBDGs to be kept connected to the system during fault conditions but with their contribution to the current having no effect on the magnitude of the fault current. Constraints related to DG locations and capacities are thus relieved. More interestingly, it is demonstrated that larger-capacity IBDGs are more effective for managing the fault current contribution of synchronous DGs, which means that for systems that include synchronous DGs, the availability of more numerous IBDGs would be beneficial.

Abstract: Synchrophasor systems provide an immense volume of data for wide area monitoring and control of power systems to meet the increasing demand of reliable energy. The construction of traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that use manually created rules based upon expert knowledge is knowledge-intensive and is not suitable in the context of this big data problem. This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs. As a proof of concept, an IDS prototype was implemented and validated. The IDS prototype accurately classifies disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks for the distance protection scheme for a two-line three-bus power transmission system.

Abstract: Power-line communication (PLC) has been the main enabler for modernizing the aging electrical power grid. As such, PLC systems have been the subject of intensive research in the community. One of the major aspects of PLC is the link interface, for which orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely adopted. In this paper, we propose the application of orthogonal poly-phase-based multicarrier code division multiple access (OPP-MC-CDMA) due to its inherent better flexibility and signal-envelope properties which can be utilized to further enhance the reliability of PLC signals. The proposed OPP-MC-CDMA system is implemented with a minimum mean square error equalizer and nonlinear preprocessing to overcome the effects of bursty noise and multipath frequency-selective fading commonly experienced in PLC channels. We study the performance of this system in terms of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate with various constellation sizes of OPP codes under different noise scenarios and nonlinear processor's thresholds. For comparison-sake, the performance of the OFDM scheme is included. The results reveal that the proposed approach always provides superior performance over the OFDM one with a maximum output SNR gain of up to 5.25 dB. It is also shown that the performance of the OPP-MC-CDMA technique improves when increasing the constellation size of the OPP codes, which consequently enhances the reliability of PLC.

Abstract: This paper proposes a three-layer optimization and an intelligent control algorithm for a microgrid with multiple renewable resources. A dual heuristic dynamic programming-based system control layer is used to ensure the dynamic performance and voltage dynamics of the microgrid as the system operation conditions change. A local layer maximizes the capability of the photovoltaic (PV) wind power generators and battery systems, and a model predictive control-based device layer increases the tracking accuracy of the converter control. The proposed control scheme, system wide adaptive predictive supervisory control (SWAPSC) smooths the output of PV and wind generators under intermittencies, maintains bus voltage by providing dynamic reactive power support to the grid, and reduces the total system losses while minimizing degradation of battery life span. Performance comparisons are made with and without SWAPSC for an IEEE 13 node test system with a PV farm, a wind farm, and two battery-based energy storage systems.

Abstract: In this paper, an integrated maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller system using a ZigBee wireless communication module is proposed for multimodal power converters as a concept of an intelligent photovoltaic (PV) module of PV power conditioning systems. The proposed scheme can integrate all information under a single host controller to realize low-cost manufacturing. It can also simplify the monitoring and supervision processes through machine-to-machine communications for the smart-grid. The voltage and current information for each module are periodically sampled and transferred to the central inverter (or another host server) through the ZigBee module. After the transmission process, the MPPT control algorithm derives each of the PV voltage reference parameters to return to each PV module accordingly. The technical benefits of the proposed approach is the configuration of a PV-controller system composed of a single digital-signal processor (DSP), low-cost analog controllers, and some mandatory communication peripherals used to monitor the distributed multimodules. Also, the method is quite desirable for supervision and monitoring of the overall system due to its centralized control structure. For the experimental validation of the proposed MPPT control, multiple ZigBee (XBee-PRO series) modules, as well as a DSP, dualmodule solar simulators, and a couple of 50 W dc-dc power conversion hardware prototypes were utilized.

Abstract: This paper presents exact solution methods for analyzing vulnerability of electric power networks to a certain kind of undetectable attacks known as false data injection attacks. We show that the problems of finding the minimum number of measurement points to be attacked undetectably reduce to minimum cut problems on hypergraphs, which admit efficient combinatorial algorithms. Experimental results indicate that our exact solution methods run as fast as the previous methods, most of which provide only approximate solutions. We also present an algorithm for enumerating all small cuts in a hypergraph, which can be used for finding vulnerable sets of measurement points.

Abstract: Utilities are rapidly deploying smart meters that measure electricity usage in real-time. Unfortunately, smart meters indirectly leak sensitive information about a home's occupancy, which is easy to detect because it highly correlates with simple statistical metrics, such as power's mean, variance, and range. To prevent occupancy detection, we propose using the thermal energy storage of electric water heaters already present in many homes. In essence, our approach, which we call combined heat and privacy (CHPr), modulates a water heater's power usage to make it look like someone is always home. We design a CHPr-enabled water heater that regulates its energy usage to thwart a variety of occupancy detection attacks without violating its objective-to provide hot water on demand-and evaluate it in simulation using real data. Our results show that a standard 50-gal CHPr-enabled water heater prevents a wide range of state-of-the-art occupancy detection attacks.

Abstract: Frequency-dependent loads inherently contribute to primary frequency response. This paper describes additional contribution to primary frequency control based on voltage-dependent noncritical (NC) loads that can tolerate a wide variation of supply voltage. By using a series of reactive compensators to decouple the NC load from the mains to form a smart load (SL), the voltage, and hence the active power of the NC load, can be controlled to regulate the mains frequency. The scope of this paper focuses primarily on reactive compensators for which only the magnitude of the injected voltage could be controlled while maintaining the quadrature relationship between the current and voltage. New control guidelines are suggested. The effectiveness of the SLs in improving mains frequency regulation without considering frequency-dependent loads and with little relaxation in mains voltage tolerance is demonstrated in a case study on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution network. Sensitivity analysis is included to show the effectiveness and limitations of SLs for varying load power factors, proportion of SLs, and system strengths.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) not only in high-voltage transmission, but in lower-voltage distribution systems. For a distributed generation (DG) grid, this would require deployment of PMUs at critical locations, which implies accurate phase measurement with the support of a low delay, highly reliable network infrastructure. In the absence of such a network, the most cost-effective solution would be to consider a wireless network to support centralized control for situational awareness in the transmission, as well as the DG grid environment. Therefore, the main objective in this paper is to design and implement a scalable synchrophasor network using wireless LAN technology to assess network performance and requirements under real-world conditions. To achieve this, we have designed an emulation platform that can support physical and medium access control layers. The data communication at the application is based on the IEEE C37.118-2011-2 Standard. By considering a hierarchical network architecture for our testbed implementation, we propose an efficient method to reduce bandwidth, as well as provide capabilities for control and management at each hierarchical level. In addition, an efficient tree-based multihop routing protocol has been designed to match a specific distribution feeder structure. The testbed is then used to access different network configurations under various test conditions.

Abstract: In the smart grid, a neighborhood area network (NAN) is a part of the cyber-physical system that achieves two-way communications between smart meters and meter data management system (MDMS). In this paper, we study the energy efficiency issue for uplink transmissions from NAN gateways to the concentrator connecting the MDMS. Classical power control schemes targeting pure bits/joule energy efficiency for multiaccess wireless networks do not fit in well due to the stringent data rate reliability requirement caused by the massive amount of smart meter data. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical uplink transmission power control scheme for a NAN using a two-level Stackelberg game approach. Focusing on linear receivers, the Stackelberg equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves both data rate reliability and energy efficiency.

Abstract: A wireless data communication system for future microgrids (MGs) is presented in this paper. It is assumed that each MG has a central controller and each distributed generation unit in the MG has a local controller. The communication system is responsible for transmitting and receiving data amongst these controllers. This communication system is based on ZigBee technology, which is a low cost and low power consumption device. However, its main limitation is the low data transfer rate. To reduce the number of data transactions, a data management scheme is presented in this paper. The required data to be transferred are defined and a suitable coding is proposed. Finally, the number of transmitted symbols and the processing time of the proposed data management scheme are numerically analyzed. In addition, the dynamic operation of an MG is evaluated considering the delays that are imposed by this communication system.

Abstract: With the proposition to install a large number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the future power grid, it is essential to provide robust communications infrastructure for phasor data across the network. We make progress in this direction by devising a simple time division multiplexing scheme for transmitting phasor data from the PMUs to a central server. Time is divided into frames and the PMUs take turns to transmit to the control center within the time frame. The main contribution of this paper is a scheduling policy based on which PMU transmissions are ordered during a time frame. The scheduling scheme is independent of the approach taken to solve the PMU placement problem, and unlike strategies devised for conventional communications, it is intended for the power network since it is fully governed by the measure of electrical connectedness between buses in the grid. To quantify the performance of the scheduling scheme, we couple it with a fault detection algorithm used to detect changes in the susceptance parameters in the grid. Results demonstrate that scheduling the PMU transmissions leads to an improved performance of the fault detection scheme compared to PMUs transmitting at random.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming model for provision of flexible demand response (DR) based on thermal energy storage in the form of hot water storage and/or storage in building material. Aggregated residential electro-thermal technologies (ETTs), such as electric heat pumps and (micro-) combined heat and power, are modeled in a unified nontechnology specific way. Day-ahead optimization is carried out considering uncertainty in outdoor temperature, electricity and hot water consumption, dwelling occupancy, and imbalance prices. Building flexibility is exploited through specification of a deadband around the set temperature or a price of thermal discomfort applied to deviations from the set temperature. A new expected thermal discomfort (ETD) metric is defined to quantify user discomfort. The efficacy of exploiting the flexibility of various residential ETT following the two approaches is analyzed. The utilization of the ETD metric to facilitate quantification of the expected total (energy and thermal discomfort) cost is also demonstrated. Such quantification may be useful in the determination of DR contracts set up by energy service companies. Case studies for a U.K. residential users' aggregation exemplify the model proposed and quantify possible cost reductions that are achievable under different flexibility scenarios.

Abstract: Estimating power system states accurately is crucial to the reliable operation of power grids. Traditional weighted least square (WLS) state estimation methods face the rising threat of cyber-attacks, such as false data injection attacks, which can pass the bad data detection process in WLS state estimation. In this paper, we propose a new detection method to detect false data injection attacks by tracking the dynamics of measurement variations. The Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) is used to calculate the distance between two probability distributions derived from measurement variations. When false data are injected into the power systems, the probability distributions of the measurement variations will deviate from the historical data, thus leading to a larger KLD. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 14 bus system using load data from the New York independent system operator with different attack scenarios. We have also tested our method on false data injection attacks that replace current measurement data with historical measurement data. Test results show that the proposed approach can accurately detect most of the attacks.

Abstract: This paper studies iterative distributed algorithms for real-time available transfer capability (ATC) assessment in energy management systems of multiarea power systems. Since ATC calculations can be modeled as a special nonlinear optimal power-flow problem, iterative decomposition-coordination approaches based on constrained augmented Lagrangian methods can be applied. One special distributed scheme, called the auxiliary problem principle method, will be studied for distributed ATC assessment in this paper. A computation framework of this distributed algorithm is investigated. System partition with nonoverlapping and boundary sub-systems will also be studied. Simulations of several IEEE test systems will be conducted to validate the feasibility and the correctness of this distributed ATC. In addition, the real-time monitoring and reaction mechanism of this distributed algorithm will also be demonstrated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the electric vehicle charging coordination (EVCC) problem in unbalanced electrical distribution systems (EDSs). Linearization techniques are applied over a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to obtain the proposed MILP formulation based on current injections. The expressions used to represent the steady-state operation of the EDS take into account a three-phase representation of the circuits, as well as the imbalance of the loads, leading to a more realistic model. Additionally, the proposed formulation considers the presence of distributed generators and operational constraints such as voltage and current magnitude limits. The optimal solution for the mathematical model was found using commercial MILP solvers. The proposed formulation was tested in a distribution system used in the specialized literature. The results show the efficiency and the robustness of the methodology, and also demonstrate that the model can be used in the solution of the EVCC problem in EDSs.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) for residential and small commercial buildings is estimated to account for as much as 65% of the total energy savings potential of DR, and previous work shows that a fully automated energy management system (EMS) is a necessary prerequisite to DR in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel EMS formulation for DR problems in these sectors. Specifically, we formulate a fully automated EMS's rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and argue that this RL problem can be approximately solved by decomposing it over device clusters. Compared with existing formulations, our new formulation does not require explicitly modeling the user's dissatisfaction on job rescheduling, enables the EMS to self-initiate jobs, allows the user to initiate more flexible requests, and has a computational complexity linear in the number of device clusters. We also demonstrate the simulation results of applying Q-learning, one of the most popular and classical RL algorithms, to a representative example.

Abstract: Smart grid users and standardization committees require that utilities and third parties collecting metering data employ techniques for limiting the level of precision of the gathered household measurements to a granularity no finer than what is required for providing the expected service. Data aggregation and data perturbation are two such techniques. This paper provides quantitative means to identify a tradeoff between the aggregation set size, the precision on the aggregated measurements, and the privacy level. This is achieved by formally defining an attack to the privacy of an individual user and calculating how much its success probability is reduced by applying data perturbation. Under the assumption of time-correlation of the measurements, colored noise can be used to even further reduce the success probability. The tightness of the analytical results is evaluated by comparing them to experimental data.

Abstract: Because of the rapid growth of small-scale solar electricity generation over the past few years, forecasting solar power output is becoming more important. However, changes in weather conditions cause solar power generation to be highly volatile. This paper analyses the challenges of solar power forecasting and then presents a similar day-based forecasting tool to do 24-h-ahead forecasting for small-scale solar power output forecasting.

Abstract: Aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have been shown to hold promise as demand response resources. However, the evaluation of these promises has relied on simulations of individual TCLs that make important assumptions about the thermal dynamics and properties of the loads, the end-user's interactions with individual TCLs and the disturbances to their operation. In this paper, we first propose a data-driven modeling strategy to simulate individual TCLs-specifically, household refrigeration units (HRUs)-that allows us to relax some of these assumptions and evaluate the validity of the approaches proposed to date. Specifically, we fit probability distributions to a year-long dataset of power measurements for HRUs and use these models to create more realistic simulations. We then derive the aggregate system equations using a bottomup approach that results in a more flexible [linear time invariant (LTI)] system. Finally, we quantify the plant-model mismatch and evaluate the proposed strategy with the more realistic simulation. Our results show that the effects of invalid assumptions about the disturbances and time-invariant properties of individual HRUs may be mitigated by a faster sampling of the state variables and that, when this is not possible, the proposed LTI system reduces the plant-model mismatch.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power systems into smart grid infrastructures constitutes secure data acquisition to prevent widely explored false data injection attacks. In this paper, we design, implement, and deploy a trusted sensing base (TSB) that enhances the security capabilities of traditional commodity power system sensors via enabling them to encrypt analog ac signals at data acquisition points. Nowadays, data encryption occurs at phasor measurement units (PMUs) after the measurements are sampled and digitalized at the analog-to-digital devices. Through pushing the encryption to within the sensors, TSB reduces the size of trusted computing base for the whole smart grid infrastructure and hence increases its trustworthiness. We have developed a hardware working prototype of TSB in a real-world power system test-bed, including PMUs and energy management systems. Results are very promising for practical real-world deployments. TSB encrypts analog signals on the sensor side and retrieves a very accurate estimate of them on the global positioning system-synchronized control center side with minimal latency.

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to design a market operator (MO) and a distribution network operator (DNO) for a network of microgrids in consideration of multiple objectives. This is a high-level design and only those microgrids with nondispatchable renewable energy sources are considered. For a power grid in the network, the net value derived from providing power to the network must be maximized. For a microgrid, it is desirable to maximize the net gain derived from consuming the received power. Finally, for an independent system operator, stored energy levels at microgrids must be maintained as close as possible to storage capacity to secure network emergency operation. To achieve these objectives, a multiobjective approach is proposed. The price signal generated by the MO and power distributed by the DNO are assigned based on a Pareto optimal solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. By using the proposed approach, a fair scheme that does not advantage one particular objective can be attained. Simulations are provided to validate the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Online closed-loop hierarchical control systems (HCSs) are widely used in power-system operation. Like typical cyber-physical systems, the contingencies on the cyber side of an HCS may lead to inappropriate control commands, which will influence the physical power system. To evaluate the degree to which these inappropriate control commands influence the power system, we propose a cyber-physical equivalent model for HCSs. In this model, the HCS cyber network is abstracted to a directed graph consisting of data nodes and directed branches, and connectivity is described by using a node-branch incidence matrix. Using this strategy, we can describe the general information flow in an HCS using mathematical equations on the basis of which quantitative evaluation can be carried out. Furthermore, by using existing operation records, several kinds of typical cyber-contingencies are also modeled on the basis of which cyber-contingency assessment (cyber-CA) can be implemented by using a model-based approach. Considering the computational efficiency, such an approach keeps only key characteristics of the information flow rather than all features of the cyber network. In the case study, a coordinated secondary-voltage control system is studied as an example. The physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies on different data transmission and processing modules are compared. The results show that the model-based method provides improved efficiency compared with conventional simulation-based methods while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) in power systems poses many research challenges. Research shows that the RES output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Consequently, the direction of the power flow on distribution lines can be reversed during some periods. As the voltage regulator is normally designed for unidirectional power flow, this may cause voltage violations on the distribution feeder. Therefore, most utilities try to set a penetration level (PL) limit for safe operation. On the other hand, time varying and unbalanced loading are the main characteristics of distribution systems. Moreover installation of intermittent and nondispatchable photovoltaic (PV) devices increases the control problems of distribution system. This paper presents an impedance-based monitoring method for detection of distribution system current behavior. It will be shown that by utilizing this monitoring technique, not only the small variation of PV PL can be easily detected, but also some fast transients such as the effect of cloud movement on PV system can be monitored. This monitoring technique employs only local measurements of bus voltages and line current to measure the apparent impedance seen at the installation point. The practical application of measured impedance as a monitoring technique shows its effectiveness for distribution system monitoring in presence of various PV PL.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the effect of integrating battery-based energy storage transportation (BEST) by railway transportation network on power grid operation and control. A time-space network model is adopted to represent transportation constraints. The proposed model integrates the hourly security-constrained unit commitment with vehicle routing problem. The BEST solution provides the locational and hourly charging/discharging schedule of the battery storage system. The mobility of BEST will be of particular interest for enhancing the power system resilience in disaster areas where the transmission grid is congested or on outrage. Two cases are used to simulate the BEST including a six-bus power system linking with a three-station railway system, as well as the IEEE 118-bus systems linking with an eight-station railway system. The results show that under certain conditions, the mobility of battery storage system can economically relieve the transmission congestion and lower the operation costs.

Abstract: Distributed generators (DGs) are being widely deployed in today's power grid. These energy sources are highly variable posing practical challenges for deployment and grid management. In this paper, a novel scalable distributed power dispatch strategy is proposed to effectively manage DGs at the distribution substation level, capitalizing on the recent push to cyber-enable power grid operations. We demonstrate how the inherent separability of the power dispatch problem allows the use of dual decomposition that enables every participating DG to locally compute its dispatch strategy based on simple broadcast data by the utility. Results and comparisons indicate that the DGs are able to rapidly converge to an optimal economical dispatch vector with significantly less concentrated computational effort and communication overhead, promoting security and privacy.

Abstract: Communications network plays a key role in the next-generation microgrid protection schemes, as the protective relays need to communicate with each other to dynamically track their tripping currents due to the time-varying nature of the loads and the distributed generation (DG) outputs. Hence, communications cost and reliability are some of the key factors that need to be considered before deploying a microgrid protection scheme. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a hybrid microgrid protection system, which implements traditional differential protection scheme along with an adaptive microgrid protection scheme. While the differential scheme is more sensitive, yet relies on extensive communications, the adaptive scheme is less sensitive but has low communications load. The joint deployment of these two schemes has the potential to increase the accuracy and precision of the whole protection scheme, while reducing the overall communications cost. Moreover, we propose a preemptive switching algorithm for the microgrid relays, which ensures a seamless transition from differential protection to adaptive protection based on the bit error rate of the communications links. Some illustrative results are provided based on an IEEE 802.16/WiMAX network to justify the proposed hybrid protection scheme.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a set of distributed algorithms for estimating the electro-mechanical oscillation modes of large power system networks using synchrophasors. With the number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the North American grid scaling up to the thousands, system operators are gradually inclining toward distributed cyber-physical architectures for executing wide-area monitoring and control operations. Traditional centralized approaches, in fact, are anticipated to become untenable soon due to various factors such as data volume, security, communication overhead, and failure to adhere to real-time deadlines. To address this challenge, we propose three different communication and computational architectures by which estimators located at the control centers of various utility companies can run local optimization algorithms using local PMU data, and thereafter communicate with other estimators to reach a global solution. Both synchronous and asynchronous communications are considered. Each architecture integrates a centralized Prony-based algorithm with several variants of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We discuss the relative advantages and bottlenecks of each architecture using simulations of IEEE 68-bus and IEEE 145-bus power system, as well as an Exo-GENI-based software defined network.

Abstract: As the current power grid system is upgrading to the smart grid, it becomes more vulnerable to security attacks on its communication subsystem such as the denial-of-service attack. Jamming, as a kind of denial-of service attack, can be applied to interfere the real-time communication in smart grid. In this paper, we analyze the scenario in which the attacker can jam a reduced number of signal channels carrying measurement information in order to manipulate the locational marginal price and create the opportunity for gaining profit, and the defender is able to guarantee a limited number of channels in information delivery. Based on the electricity marketing model, we propose a multiact dynamic game between the attacker and defender, in which the optimal strategies are taken by the two sides to maximize their own profits. We study the gaming process and discuss the prosperities of the outcome. Simulation results present the affect of jamming attack on the electricity prices and the gained profits of the two sides. Moreover, they confirm the optimality of the proposed scheme in pursuing profit.

Abstract: Clarification of the responsibility for carbon emission is fundamental in a carbon-constrained world. Existing statistical methods for carbon emission estimation usually attribute the emission responsibility to the generation side. However, a growing number of analysis across different sectors has pointed out that "consumers" rather than "producers" should be responsible for the CO2 emitted during the production. In power system, it is consumers that create the need for the combustion of fossil fuels and cause substantial carbon emission. In order to account carbon emission from the consumption-based perspective, carbon emission generated by various generators can be seen as a virtual attachment to the power flow and accumulated at the consumer's side. A novel analytical model for carbon emission flow (CEF) is proposed in this paper to quantify the carbon emission accompanying the power delivery process. The newly developed model of CEF can take into account the operational characteristics and the network features of power system, and elaborately characterize the relationship between power delivery and CEF. Some basic concepts of CEF in power networks are defined, and the fundamental characteristics and distribution principles of CEF are analyzed. Furthermore, a novel calculation model for CEF in power networks is proposed. A case study is conducted based on the IEEE 118 bus system to illustrate the calculation process and result of CEF in power system.

Abstract: Critical systems require zero recovery time when a failure occurs in a communications network. The soon to be implemented standard IEC 62439-3 defines the only two protocols, parallel redundancy protocol and high-availability seamless redundancy, which fulfill this requirement and ensure no frame loss in the presence of an error. These protocols also provide a hot-plugging capability, which allows elements to be added to or removed from the network without interrupting communications and the operation of the plant. The electricity sector has adopted these for power utility automation in the recently published IEC 61850-90-4. The challenge is to obtain an efficient approach for use in electronic devices, capable of managing the characteristic duplicates, and circulating frames of these protocols, coupled with agile architectures capable of dealing with real-time processing requirements, fast switching times, high throughput, and deterministic behavior. The main contribution of this paper is the in-depth analysis it makes of network parameters imposed by the application of the protocols to power utility automation, and the proposition of a frame management system based on a segmented memory system that improves frame detecting time and uses the smallest memory required in order to resolve all the issues dealt with.

Abstract: This paper proposed a methodology to identify the vulnerable components, and ensure the resilient operation of coordinated electricity and natural gas infrastructures considering multiple disruptions within the microgrid. The microgrid demands, which consist of electricity and heat demands, are served by the interdependent electricity and natural gas supplies. The proposed approach addressed the vulnerability of multiple energy carrier microgrids against various interdictions, which is used to apply preventive reinforcements to increase the resilience of energy supply and decrease the operation cost. The proposed methodology is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem to address the optimal and secure operation of multiple energy carrier microgrids. The interdependence between natural gas and electricity infrastructures is addressed to show the effectiveness of the presented methodology in improving the resilience of generation and demand scheduling against deliberate actions causing disruptions in the interdependent energy infrastructures in multiple energy carrier microgrids.

Abstract: With ongoing smart grid activities, advancements in information and communication technology coupled with development of sensors are utilized for better situational awareness, decision support, and control of the power grid. However, it is critical to understand the complex interdependencies between cyber and power domains, and also the potential impacts of cyber events on the power grid. In this paper, the impact of three different possible cyber events on physical power grid have been analyzed using an integrated cyber-power modeling and simulation testbed. Real-time modeling of end-to-end cyber-power systems have been developed with hardware-in-the-loop capabilities. Real-time digital simulator, synchrophasor devices, DeterLab, and network simulator-3 are utilized in this developed testbed with a wide-area control algorithm and associated closed-loop control. DeterLab can be used to model real-life cyber events in the developed cyber-physical testbed. Man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service attacks have been modeled as specific cases for the IEEE standard test cases. Additionally, communication failure impact on the power grid has been analyzed using the testbed.

Abstract: In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) for the optimal power exchanges in a smart network of power microgrids (MGs) is presented. The main purpose is to present an innovative control strategy for a cluster of interconnected MGs to maximize the global benefits. A MPC-based algorithm is used to determine the scheduling of power exchanges among MGs, and the charge/discharge of each local storage system. The MPC algorithm requires information on power prices, power generation, and load forecasts. The MPC algorithm is tested through case studies with and without prediction errors on loads and renewable power production. The operation of single MGs is simulated to show the advantage of the proposed cooperative framework relative to the control of a single MG. The results demonstrate that the cooperation among MGs has significant advantages and benefits with respect to each single MG operation.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal expansion planning model for an energy hub with multiple energy systems. Energy hub represents a coupling among various energy infrastructures for supplying electricity, natural gas, and heating loads. Combined heat and power (CHP) and natural gas furnaces are considered within the energy hub to convert energy into other forms. The multiple energy system planning problem would optimally determine appropriate investment candidates for generating units, transmission lines, natural gas furnaces, and CHPs that satisfy electricity and heating load forecasts and hub system constraints. The system performances associated with reliability, energy efficiency, and emission matrices is evaluated for the identified planning schedules. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiple energy system expansion planning approach based on energy hub.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of rooftop solar power generation is transforming traditionally passive power distribution systems into active ones. High penetration of such devices creates new dynamics for which the current power distribution systems are inadequate. The changing paradigm of power distribution system requires it to be operated as cyber-physical system. A goal-based holonic multiagent system (HMAS) is presented in this paper to achieve this objective. This paper provides details on design of the HMAS for operation of power distribution systems. Various operating modes and associated goals are discussed. Finally, the role of HMAS is demonstrated for two applications in distribution systems. The first one is associated with control of reactive power at solar photovoltaic installations at individual homes for optimal operation of the system. The second deals with the state estimation of the system leveraging different measurements available from smart meters at homes.

Abstract: We develop a graph-theoretic algorithm for localizing the physical manifestation of attacks or disturbances in large power system networks using real-time synchrophasor measurements. We assume the attack enters through the electromechanical swing dynamics of the synchronous generators in the grid as an unknown additive disturbance. Considering the grid to be divided into coherent areas, we pose the problem as to localize which area the attack may have entered using relevant information extracted from the phasor measurement data. Our approach to solve this problem consists of three main steps. We first run a phasor-based model reduction algorithm by which a dynamic equivalent of the clustered network can be identified in real-time. Second, in parallel, we run a system identification in each area to identify a transfer matrix model for the full-order power system. Thereafter, we exploit the underlying graph-theoretic properties of the identified reduced-order topology, create a set of localization keys, and compare these keys with a selected set of transfer function residues. We validate our results using a detailed case study of the two-area Kundur model and the IEEE 39-bus power system.

Abstract: Smart meters are inherent components in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the smart power grid. They are serving as the crucial interfaces through which the cyber, physical, and social domains of the smart grid can interact with each other. Due to the complicated interactions, smart meters may face a large variety of threats. In this paper, we exploit the colored Petri net to describe the information flows among units in a smart meter. Then, we propose a threat model for smart meters. Considering the constrained computation and storage resources of a smart meter, we present a collaborative intrusion detection mechanism against false data injection attack. The proposed scheme can work regardless of changes in a smart meter's software. Numerical results demonstrate the low cost and effectiveness of our proposed intrusion detection mechanism.

Abstract: The integration of cyber communications and control systems into the power grid infrastructure is widespread and has a profound impact on the operation, reliability, and efficiency of the grid. Cyber technologies allow for efficient management of the power system, but they may contain vulnerabilities that need to be managed. One important possible consequence is the introduction of cyber-induced or cyber-enabled disruptions of physical components. In this paper, we propose an online framework for assessing the operational reliability impacts due to threats to the cyber infrastructure. This framework is an important step toward addressing the critical challenge of understanding and analyzing complex cyber-physical systems at scale.

Abstract: Microgrids are a key component in the evolution of the power grid. Microgrids are required to operate in both grid connected and standalone island mode using local sources of power. A major challenge in implementing microgrids is the communications and control to support transition from grid connected mode and operation in island mode. Here, we propose a secure communication architecture to support microgrid operation and control. A security model, including network, data, and attack models, is defined and a security protocol to address the real-time communication needs of microgrids is proposed. The implementation of the proposed security scheme is discussed and its performance evaluated using theoretical and co-simulation analysis, which shows it to be superior to existing protocols.

Abstract: Public-key cryptography (PKC) is widely used in smart grid (SG) communications to reduce the overhead of key management. However, PKC comes with its own problems in terms of certificate management. Specifically, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) need to be maintained and distributed to the smart meters (SMs) in order to ensure security of the communications. The size of CRLs may grow over time and eventually may introduce additional delay, bandwidth, and storage overhead when various applications are run on SG. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for creating customized CRLs with reduced size for IEEE 802.11s-based advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Rather than maintaining a huge-size single CRL that introduces unnecessary search time and storage, the idea is to cluster/group SMs within the AMI network and create CRLs based on these groups. The grouping is mainly done in such a way that they bring together the SMs that will be very likely to communicate so that the CRLs will be kept local to that group. To this end, we propose two novel grouping algorithms. The first algorithm is a bottom-up approach, which is based on the existing routes from the SMs to the gateway. Since the SMs will be sending their data to the gateway through the nodes on the route, this forms a natural grouping. The second approach is a top-down recursive approach, which considers the minimum spanning tree of the network and then divides it into smaller subtrees. Via grouping, the length of the CRL for each SM and the corresponding distribution overhead can be reduced significantly. Simulation results have shown that our approach can maintain a balance between the size of the CRL and the number of signatures generated by CAs while guaranteeing security of the communications.

Abstract: The number of inverter-based distributed power generators connected to the power network has rapidly grown in recent years. The consequence of this phenomenon is an increasingly complex distribution grid requiring advanced and intelligent monitoring and observation tools in order to guarantee satisfactory power quality and reliability. This paper describes a novel power line impedance estimation method implementing an innovative technique based on modifications of the pulse width modulator's pulse pattern on the inverters in order to generate pseudo-random binary sequence-based pilot signals. The stimuli are generated at different locations in the distribution grid and detected at the transformer sub-station, through cross correlation between the received distorted signal and the sequence, the parameters of the propagation channel can be estimated. Simulations in typical grid situations verify that the proposed algorithm is robust to a realistic environment, and would represent a promising grid monitoring and diagnostic tool.

Abstract: Demand response systems in the electricity grid, which rely on two way communication between the consumers and utility, require the transmission of instantaneous energy consumption to utilities. Perfect knowledge of a user's power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. It has been shown that an in-home energy storage system (such as a battery/inverter) that provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without inconvenience can also be used to hide a user's power usage pattern. A fundamental tradeoff exists between the costs saved and the degree of privacy achievable, and in this paper, the tradeoff achievable by a finite capacity battery assuming a zero tolerance for activity delay is studied using a Markov process model for user's demands and instantaneous electricity prices. Due to high computational complexity (continuous state-action space) of the stochastic control model, inner and upper bounds are presented on the optimal tradeoff. In particular, a class of battery charging policies based on minimizing revealing states is proposed to derive achievable privacy-cost savings tradeoff. The performance of this algorithm is compared with lower bounds derived using a greedy heuristic and upper bounds derived using an information theoretic rate distortion approach. The framework proposed is shown to be applicable even when users only desire partial information protection, such as presence/absence of activity or specific appliances they wish to hide. Numerical results based on real electricity and pricing data show that the proposed algorithm performs close to the upper bound demonstrating its efficacy.

Abstract: Large penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) can have a negative impact on the power grid, e.g., increased peak load and losses, that can be largely mitigated using coordinated charging strategies. In addition to shifting the charging process to the night valley when the electricity price is lower, this paper explicitly considers the EV owner convenience that can be mainly characterized by a desired state of charge at the departure time. To this end, the EV charging procedure is defined as an uninterruptible process that happens at a given discrete charging rate and the coordinated charging is formulated as a scheduling problem. The scalable real-time greedy (S-RTG) algorithm is proposed to schedule a large population of EVs in a decentralized fashion, explicitly considering the EV owner criteria. Unlike the majority of existing approaches, the S-RTG algorithm does not rely on iterative procedures and does not require heavy computations, broadcast messages, or extensive bi-directional communications. Instead, the proposed algorithm schedules one EV at a time with simple computations, only once (i.e., at the time the EV connects to the grid), and only requires low-speed communication capability making it suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations with significant EVs penetration and comparative analysis with scheduling policies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Deregulation of the electric power industry has created both wholesale markets and retail markets. Most load forecasting studies in the literature are on the wholesale side. Minimal research efforts have been devoted to tackling the challenges on the retail side, such as limited data history and high customer attrition rate. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to long-term retail energy forecasting in order to feed the forecasts to a conservative trading strategy. We dissect the problem into two sub-problems: 1) load per customer forecasting; and 2) tenured customer forecasting. Regression analysis and survival analysis are applied to each sub-problem respectively. The proposed methodology has been implemented at a fast growing retailer in the U.S., showing superior performance in terms of mean absolute percentage error of hourly demand and daily and monthly energy over a common industry practice that assumes constant customer attrition rate.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive and general optimization-based home energy management controller, incorporating several classes of domestic appliances including deferrable, curtailable, thermal, and critical ones. The operations of the appliances are controlled in response to dynamic price signals to reduce the consumer's electricity bill whilst minimizing the daily volume of curtailed energy, and therefore considering the user's comfort level. To avoid shifting a large portion of consumer demand toward the least price intervals, which could create network issues due to loss of diversity, higher prices are applied when the consumer's demand goes beyond a prescribed power threshold. The arising mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem is solved in an iterative manner rolling throughout the day to follow the changes in the anticipated price signals and the variations in the controller inputs while information is updated. The results from different realistic case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in minimizing the household's daily electricity bill while preserving comfort level, as well as preventing creation of new least-price peaks.

Abstract: Many utilities have the data quality problem with the geographical information system (GIS) records at distribution level. This affects many business functions of a utility, including asset management, outage response, and workforce safety. For correcting connectivity errors in the GIS representation of the distribution network topology, BC Hydro has developed an in-house algorithm. The algorithm leverages smart meter interval measurements and identifies the neighboring meters by voltage profile correlation analysis. It also predicts customers' upstream and downstream location relationship by voltage magnitude comparisons. The output of the algorithm is then compared with the existing GIS records to correct any errors in it. This paper presents in detail the algorithm and the promising testing results within the practical BC Hydro system. Challenges for underground services are demonstrated. The algorithm's potential use for phase detection by collectively leveraging smart meter and feeder meter data is explored. It shows encouraging results when applied in a downstream section of a large feeder.

Abstract: A new open source mapping of IEC 61850-7-2 to web services has been defined and implemented. This letter describes work which is useful for rapidly implementing user interfaces-particularly web-based interfaces-for monitoring and controlling intelligent electronic devices from multiple vendors. The web service mapping has been implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, with a message format in JavaScript Object Notation. This approach requires a simple and ubiquitous software stack for its implementation, which is a significant advantage over existing client-server communications mappings. The use of an open source paradigm allows for the rapid iteration and refinement of the design, implementation, and testing of the internal details of the proposed protocol stack in a collaborative manner. These developments are of immediate interest to users of IEC 61850, and are particularly relevant to the IEC 61850 standardization process.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for planning and investment studies pertaining to the implementation of system-wide conservation voltage reduction (CVR). In the CVR paradigm, optimal voltage profiles at the load buses are determined so as to yield load reductions and hence energy conservation. The system modifications required to operate at such voltages is known to be capital intensive, which is not desirable by investors. Hence, the proposed model determines the system savings and the appropriate price incentives to offer industries such that a minimum acceptable rate of return is accrued. In this model, the industrial facilities are represented by a combination of constant impedance, constant current, and constant power loads. A detailed case study for Ontario, Canada, is carried out considering that industrial loads are investing in voltage optimization to reduce their energy costs. The optimal incentives that need to be offered by the system planner, over a long-term horizon, and across various zones of Ontario, are determined using the presented mathematical model. Furthermore, a comprehensive risk analysis comprising sensitivity studies and Monte Carlo simulations is carried out considering the variations in the most uncertain model parameters.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present methods on real-time event detection and data archival reduction based on synchrophasor data produced by phasor measurement unit (PMU). Event detection is performed with principal component analysis and a second order difference method with a hierarchical framework for the event notification strategy on a small-scale microgrid. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method is more practical and efficient in the combined use of event detection and data archival reduction. The proposed method on data reduction, which is an "event oriented auto-adjustable sliding window method,"implements a curve fitting algorithm with a weighted exponential function-based variable sliding window accommodating different event types. It works efficiently with minimal loss in data information especially around detected events. The performance of the proposed method is shown on actual PMU data from the Illinois Institute of Technology campus microgrid, thus successfully improving the situational awareness of the campus power system network.

Abstract: The many new distributed energy resources being installed at the distribution system level require increased visibility into system operations that will be enabled by distribution system state estimation (DSSE) and situational awareness applications. Reliable and accurate DSSE requires both robust methods for managing the big data provided by smart meters and quality distribution system models. This paper presents intelligent methods for detecting and dealing with missing or inaccurate smart meter data, as well as the ways to process the data for different applications. It also presents an efficient and flexible parameter estimation method based on the voltage drop equation and regression analysis to enhance distribution system model accuracy. Finally, it presents a 3-D graphical user interface for advanced visualization of the system state and events. We demonstrate this paper for a university distribution network with the state-of-the-art real-time and historical smart meter data infrastructure.

Abstract: As the penetration of renewable energy sources is increasing, the long-term voltage stability (LTVS) of fixed-speed induction generators (FSIGs) has raised a major concern for distribution power networks since they will always consume reactive power. When either the voltage profile of the FSIG severely declines due to the load consumption increasing in the nearby area, or the mechanical power of the wind turbine increases owing to the wind speed increasing, the loss of the stable equilibrium point will result in this class of long-term voltage instability problems. Although this problem is a local phenomenon, it may spread to the rest of the system and cause the cascaded blackout. Meanwhile, with massive deployment of synchrophasor technology, it is possible to improve system awareness and enable early warning to detect this class of LTVS problems in real-time. In this paper, a measurement-based algorithm for synchrophasor long-term voltage stability indicator (SLVSI) will be proposed. First, qualitative analysis of this class of LTVS problems is conducted by corresponding bifurcation diagrams and hysteretic curves. Secondly, a measurement- based FSIG equivalent model is proposed by utilizing real-time phasor measurements from synchrophasors. The above concept can be extended to distribution power networks with multiple FSIGs. The entire distribution power grid will be considered as a modified coupled single-port network. By exploring the concept of reactive power response factor, the corresponding Thevenin equivalent parameter of each individual FSIG branch is adjusted based on real-time phasor measurements. Thus, a SLVSI for each individual FSIG can be defined by modifying the conventional L-index. Simulation experiments on two IEEE test systems are performed to validate the accuracy of the proposed SLVSI.

Abstract: The presence of distributed generation (DG) in distribution networks may seriously affect accuracy of the voltage sag based fault location method. An approach toward quantifying the adverse effect of DG on the fault location calculation is described. A series of realistic scenarios is used to illustrate how DG impacts synchrophasor measurements during disturbances. Alternative Transients Program-Electromagnetic Transients Program models are used to obtain steady-state solutions in the time domain, while Sobol's approach to sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the effect of DG and imperfections of measuring instruments on fault location. Various test cases reveal that DG may adversely affect the voltage characteristic and therefore the accuracy of voltage sag based fault location.

Abstract: Modern power grids are becoming more prone to cyberattacks. Even worse, an attacker without the full topology and parameter information of a power grid can still execute a false data injection attack without being detected by the state estimator. This paper proposes an efficient strategy for determining the optimal attacking region that requires reduced network information. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through extensive simulations. This paper introduces a new front in the study of smart grid cyber security: determination of a feasible attacking region by obtaining less network information. This paper is also essential and significant for finding effective protection strategies against false data injection attacks based on the deep understanding of the mechanisms and strategies of the attacks.

Abstract: In order to foster electric vehicle (EV) adoption, there is a strong need for designing and developing charging stations that can accommodate different customer classes distinguished by their charging preferences, needs, and technologies. By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes more congested and, therefore, controlling charging requests should be carefully aligned with the available resources. This paper focuses on an EV charging network equipped with different charging technologies and proposes two frameworks. In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV population is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty fleets. This necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to prevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This framework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer request rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality of service (QoS). The second framework, on the other hand, is more appropriate for smaller networks, in which the objective is to compute the minimum amount of resources required to provide certain levels of QoS to each class. The results show that the proposed frameworks ensure grid reliability and lead to significant savings in capacity planning.

Abstract: The development of distributed generation system and electric vehicles is bound to strain the distribution network. A typical radial distribution feeder suffers from voltage fluctuation and feeder overload in the presence of a large amount of variable renewable generation. This paper presents a concept of enhancing the power handling capacity of distribution networks using dc grid interconnections. Control of both the active and reactive power exchange between the ac feeder and the interconnecting power converter has been proposed for the voltage regulation at the ac feeder terminal. Besides, the dc grid interconnection also allows the introduction of a common storage system that can be shared by the connected ac feeders and the dc grid connection to other renewable energy resources. The increased power handling capacity and improved voltage profile of the ac distribution feeder using the proposed system is shown through time domain simulations on a test system.

Abstract: Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) method requires only one set of voltage and current sensors to be installed at the electrical service entry for load disaggregation and has attracted considerable research interests. NIALM's identity accuracy is closely related to power signatures (PSs) of loads. The current waveform (CW) is a PS which is frequently used. In order to improve CW's discrimination, this letter uses power theory to decompose CW to active and nonactive current. The experimental results indicate that the similarity between different appliances of the proposed PS is lower, compared with the CW and other PSs, leading to better load disaggregation.

Abstract: We utilize a for-profit aggregator-based residential demand response (DR) approach to the smart grid resource allocation problem. The aggregator entity, using a given set of schedulable residential customer assets (e.g., smart appliances), must set a schedule to optimize for a given objective. Here, we consider optimizing for the profit of the aggregator. To encourage customer participation in the residential DR program, a new pricing structure named customer incentive pricing (CIP) is proposed. The aggregator profit is optimized using a proposed heuristic framework, implemented in the form of a genetic algorithm, that must determine a schedule of customer assets and the CIP. To validate our heuristic framework, we simulate the optimization of a large-scale system consisting of 5555 residential customer households and 56 642 schedulable assets using real-pricing data over a period of 24-h. We show that by optimizing purely for economic reasons, the aggregator can enact a beneficial change on the load profile of the overall power system.

Abstract: The evolution toward emerging active distribution networks (ADNs) can be realized via a real-time state estimation (RTSE) application facilitated by the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs). A critical challenge in deploying PMU-based RTSE applications at large scale is the lack of a scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely (i.e., sub-second) delivery of the high volume of synchronized and continuous synchrophasor measurements. We address this challenge by introducing a communication platform called C-DAX based on the information-centric networking (ICN) concept. With a topic-based publish-subscribe engine that decouples data producers and consumers in time and space, C-DAX enables efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery, as well as flexible and scalable (re) configuration of PMU data communication for seamless full observability of power conditions in complex and dynamic scenarios. Based on the derived set of requirements for supporting PMU-based RTSE in ADNs, we design the ICN-based C-DAX communication platform, together with a joint optimized physical network resource provisioning strategy, in order to enable the agile PMU data communications in near real-time. In this paper, C-DAX is validated via a field trial implementation deployed over a sample feeder in a real-distribution network; it is also evaluated through simulation-based experiments using a large set of real medium voltage grid topologies currently operating live in The Netherlands. This is the first work that applies emerging communication paradigms, such as ICN, to smart grids while maintaining the required hard real-time data delivery as demonstrated through field trials at national scale. As such, it aims to become a blueprint for the application of ICN-based general purpose communication platforms to ADNs.

Abstract: Robust control and management of the grid relies on accurate data. Both phasor measurement units and remote terminal units are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is crucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of tampered data-both for preventing attacks that may lead to blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control of current and future grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme based on the Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the conditional covariance test CMIT to learn the structure of the grid. Using the dc power flow model, we show that, under normal circumstances, the Markov graph of the voltage angles is consistent with the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between the calculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Our method can detect the most recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge of the bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state estimator; hence damaging power network control, monitoring, demand response, and pricing scheme. Specifically, under the stealthy deception attack, the Markov graph of phase angles changes. In addition to detecting a state of attack, our method can detect the set of attacked nodes. To the best of our knowledge, our remedy is the first to comprehensively detect this sophisticated attack and it does not need additional hardware. Moreover, it is successful no matter the size of the attacked subset. Simulation of various power networks confirms our claims.

Abstract: The circulating current among the paralleled solid state transformers (SSTs) originated by the line parameter and mismatched output impedance comes into appearance in the islanded operation of the novel microgrid, the future renewable electric energy delivery and management system. In this regard, the aggregated control strategy of both virtual inductance and external inductance is proposed in this paper to suppress circulating current. The "matching concept" regarding the parameter selection of virtual and external inductance is proposed to ensure the reliable operation of the system through constructing the complete small-signal model of SST. On the basis of aggregated control strategy and small-signal model, the adaptive virtual impedance control strategy is finally proposed by introducing the feedback of circulating current into the conventional virtual impedance control. The virtual impedance is adjusted adaptively according to the judgment algorithm to regulate the equivalent output impedance of SST. With this modification, the adjustment ability of virtual impedance control against sudden disturbance is improved and the circulating current is further reduced. The simulation results with nonlinear loading are presented to prove that the proposed control strategy, and the parameters determined by the matching concept substantially reduce the circulating current among SSTs and improve the accuracy of load sharing among SSTs.

Abstract: The active nature of next generation distribution systems requires a highly accurate real-time monitoring for state estimation and situational awareness. This paper considers the problem of robust placement of a limited number of voltage magnitude meters and phasor measurement units for state estimation in an active distribution system comprising topological reconfigurations. The trace of the inverse of the Fisher information matrix is chosen as criterion for the estimation accuracy. For meter placement in a single configuration distribution system, the greedy approach provides a near-optimal solution as well as a theoretical approximation guarantee. However, for meter placement in an active distribution system, a robust approach is required to optimize the worst case estimation accuracy among all possible configurations of the system. In this paper, a simple robust algorithm, called submodular saturation algorithm, for meter placement in active distribution systems is proposed. Numerical results on three different active distribution systems show that the submodular saturation algorithm outperforms the greedy algorithm and the genetic algorithm in most cases, and provides competitive results in other cases.

Abstract: Nowadays, it is a common concern for modern electrical networks and energy management systems to derive an optimal operation management considering energy costs, pollutant emissions, and security, of the system in the presence of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). In this paper, a multiobjective optimization problem is solved to schedule power sources in a typical microgrid, while PEVs are viewed as a stochastic factor. PEVs residing in a city are considered as probable loads and/or generations depending on how they interact with the utility grid. A novel stochastic methodology is used to calculate the 24 h expected power demand and generation of vehicles aggregated in municipal parking lots. The objective functions of the problem are voltage security margin to be maximized and the total power losses, the total electrical energy costs, and the total emissions of power sources, which should be minimized. Based on different scenarios, the impact of PEVs penetration on base load, voltage profile, and also the value of objective functions, are assessed. Numerical results show the effect of different fleets of PEVs, as well as on the operation of future microgrids.

Abstract: A microgrid (MG) is a local energy system consisting of a number of energy sources (e.g., wind turbine or solar panels among others), energy storage units, and loads that operate connected to the main electrical grid or autonomously. MGs provide flexibility, reduce the main electricity grid dependence, and contribute to changing large centralized production paradigm to local and distributed generation. However, such energy systems require complex management, advanced control, and optimization. Moreover, the power electronics converters have to be used to correct energy conversion and be interconnected through common control structure is necessary. Classical droop control system is often implemented in MG. It allows correct operation of parallel voltage source converters in grid connection, as well as islanded mode of operation. However, it requires complex power management algorithms, especially in islanded MGs, which balance the system and improves reliability. The novel reactive power sharing algorithm is developed, which takes into account the converters parameters as apparent power limit and maximum active power. The developed solution is verified in simulation and compared with other known reactive power control methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of defining a day-ahead consumption plan for charging a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs), and following this plan during operation. A challenge herein is the beforehand unknown charging flexibility of EVs, which depends on numerous details about each EV (e.g., plug-in times, power limitations, battery size, power curve, etc.). To cope with this challenge, EV charging is controlled during opertion by a heuristic scheme, and the resulting charging behavior of the EV fleet is learned by using batch mode reinforcement learning. Based on this learned behavior, a cost-effective day-ahead consumption plan can be defined. In simulation experiments, our approach is benchmarked against a multistage stochastic programming solution, which uses an exact model of each EVs charging flexibility. Results show that our approach is able to find a day-ahead consumption plan with comparable quality to the benchmark solution, without requiring an exact day-ahead model of each EVs charging flexibility.

Abstract: Traditionally, distribution network monitoring has been focused on primary substations (i.e., high voltage/medium voltage level), whereas low voltage (LV) network has not been monitored at all. With rapid growth and penetration of distributed energy resources in LV grids, there is growing interest in extending the real-time monitoring to LV level. The framework program FP7 European Project INTEGRIS proposes an integrated real-time LV network monitoring solution and implements it in a cost-efficient way. This solution integrates smart metering data with secondary substation measurements to get a more accurate and real-time view about LV grid, uses "decentralized" distribution management architecture to optimize data flow, and uses International Electrotechnical Commission 61850 Standard-based interfaces to improve interoperability. This paper focuses on information and communications technology perspective, explains the implementation details of this monitoring solution, and presents its functionality/performance testing results from two distribution system operator field trials and from real-time digital simulator laboratory.

Abstract: Recent technological advancements have facilitated the evolution of traditional distribution grids to smart grids. In a smart grid scenario, flexible devices are expected to aid the system in balancing the electric power in a technically and economically efficient way. To achieve this, the flexible devices' consumption data are theoretically recorded, elaborated, and their upcoming flexibility is bid to flexibility markets. However, there are many cases where explicit flexible device consumption data are absent. This paper presents a way to circumvent this problem and extract the potentially flexible load of a flexible device, namely a heat pump (HP), out of the aggregated energy consumption of a house. The main idea for accomplishing this is a comparison of the flexible consumer with electrically similar nonflexible consumers. The methodology is based on machine-learning techniques, probability theory, and statistics. After presenting this methodology, the general trend of the HP consumption is estimated and an hour-ahead forecast is conducted by employing seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average modeling. In this manner, the flexible consumption is predicted, establishing the basis for bidding flexibility in intraday markets, even in the absence of explicit device measurements.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources and demand-side management are expected to become more prevalent in the future electric power system. Coordinating the increased number of grid participants in an efficient and reliable way is going to be a major challenge. A potential solution is the employment of a distributed energy management approach, which uses intelligence distributed over the grid to balance supply and demand. In this paper, we specifically consider the situation in which distributed resources and loads form microgrids within the bulk power system in which the load is supplied by local generation. A distributed energy management approach based on the consensus + innovations method is presented and used to coordinate local generation, flexible load, and storage devices within the microgrid. The approach takes advantage of the fact that, at the optimal allocation settings, the marginal costs given as a function of the power output/consumption need to be equal for all nonbinding network resources. Solutions for single time step, as well as multitime step optimization including intertemporal constraints, are presented.

Abstract: With the spotlight on smart grid development around the world, it is critical to recognize the key factors contributing to changing power system characteristics. This is more apparent in distribution systems with the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and microgrid development. Utilities are also focusing on the reliability and resiliency of the grid. These activities require distribution automation (DA) strategies that take advantage of available technologies while promoting newer solutions. It is necessary to create a roadmap for holistic DA strategies in a smarter grid. Sustainable and resilient grid development is a paradigm shift requiring a new line of thinking in the engineering, operation, and maintenance of the power system. International perspectives on DA are also addressed, with the understanding that one solution will not fit all. Integrating technical, business, and policy decisions into the challenges will generate the development of technologies, standards, and implementation of the overall solution. The challenges in the development of industry standards are also discussed. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities in the changing landscape of the distribution systems. Evolution of technologies and the business case for infrastructure investment in distribution systems are covered in another paper by the same authors.

Abstract: For dc fast charging stations (FCS), short charging time duration is its main advantage over other ac charging stations. However, due to the characteristics of internal resistance of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, if charging request of an EV is near the full state of charge (SoC), its charging time increases significantly. In this paper, considering the impact of requested SoC on charging time, we propose an operation analysis of FCS, where operators of FCS can set a limit on the EVs' requested SoC to obtain maximized revenue. We model the FCS operation as an M/G/S/K queue and incorporate the dc fast charging model into the queuing analysis, as well as the revenue model of FCS. Simulation results indicate that limiting the requested SoC in an overloaded condition at FCS can increase total charged energy and revenue of FCS, as well as decrease the probability of blocking arriving EVs.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the response of an individual consumer with a flexible demand for electricity to exogenous and stochastic electricity prices. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we propose a comprehensive model for which the optimal policy can be explicitly computed. The proposed consumer model features a time varying bound on power consumption, the presence of a nondeferrable load profile, the presence of a load profile that can be deferred up to a deadline, and the possibility of curtailment. Second, we describe the algorithm that, via explicit backward iterations of the Bellman equation, returns the optimal response of such consumer in a very general energy market scenario featuring a correlated/nonstationary price process and multiple energy procurement sources.

Abstract: In this paper, future distribution network operation is discussed under assumption of multimicrogrids (MMGs) concept. The economic operation of MMGs is formulated as an optimization problem. A stochastically and probabilistic modeling of both small-scale energy resources (SSERs) and load demand at each microgrids (MGs) is done to determine the optimal economic operation of each MGs with minimum cost based on the power transaction between the MGs and main grids. The balance between the total power generation in each MGs and the load demand is determined regarding the sold or purchase power either by MG or by main grid. Based on the results, the mean, standard deviation, and probability density function of each generated power with SSERs is determined considering optimization constraints. A statistical analysis for generated power and costs is given. The power interchange between MGs is considered. The particle swarm optimization is applied to minimize the cost function as an optimization algorithm. Results show that it is possible to regulate the power demand and power transaction between each MGs and the main grid. Moreover, it is indicated that the power sharing between MGs with main grid can reduce the total operation cost of the future distribution network.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient noniterative method for distribution state estimation using conditional multivariate complex Gaussian distribution (CMCGD). In the proposed method, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the state variables is obtained in one step considering load uncertainties, measurement errors, and load correlations. In this method, first the bus voltages, branch currents, and injection currents are represented by MCGD using direct load flow and a linear transformation. Then, the mean and SD of bus voltages, or other states, are calculated using CMCGD and estimation of variance method. The mean and SD of pseudo measurements, as well as spatial correlations between pseudo measurements, are modeled based on the historical data for different levels of load duration curve. The proposed method can handle load uncertainties without using time-consuming approaches such as Monte Carlo. Simulation results of two case studies, six-bus, and a realistic 747-bus distribution network show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of speed, accuracy, and quality against the conventional approach.

Abstract: The recent rapid uptake of residential solar photovoltaic installations provides many challenges for electricity distribution networks designed for one-way power flow from the generator to residential customers via transmission and distribution networks. For grid-connected installations, large amounts of generation during low load periods or intermittent generation can lead to a difficulty in balancing supply and demand, maintaining voltage and frequency stability, and may even result in outages due to overvoltage conditions tripping protection circuits. In this paper, we present four control methodologies to mitigate these difficulties using small-scale distributed battery storage. These four approaches represent three different control architectures: 1) centralized; 2) decentralized; and 3) distributed control. These approaches are validated and compared using data on load and generation profiles from customers in an Australian electricity distribution network.

Abstract: Arc faults have always been a concern for electrical systems, as they can cause fires, personnel shock hazard, and system failure. Existing commercialized techniques that rely on pattern recognition in the time domain or frequency domain analysis using a Fourier transform do not work well, because the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the arc signal is not periodic. Instead, wavelet transform (WT) provides a time and frequency approach to analyze target signals with multiple resolutions. In this paper, a new approach using WT for arc fault analysis in dc systems is proposed. The process of detecting an arc fault involves signal analysis and then feature identification. The focus of this paper is on the former. Simulation models are synthesized to study the theoretical results of the proposed methodology and traditional fast Fourier transform analysis on arcing faults. Experimental data from the dc system of a photovoltaic array is also shown to validate the approach.

Abstract: Microgrid allows high penetration of renewable energy sources, and provides technical foundation for the grid connection and operation of distributed generations (DGs). The negative impacts caused by DGs should be reduced inside the microgrid. Photovoltaic (PV) generation is one of the major distributed energy sources, and the performance of PV generation systems connected to microgrid directly affects power quality and other technical indexes of the microgrid. Thus, the research of flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation system has both theoretical significance and practical value. This paper makes a concise exposition on the H-infinity control theory and applies this theory to the flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation systems. This paper focuses on the specific situation where the microgrid is grid tied to the main power grid. We establish the mathematical model of PV generation system and adopt the H-infinity control theory to design a voltage tracking controller. Theoretical analysis proved that our control system is internally stable. Simulations under six different conditions are performed using MATLAB/Simulink, and the results demonstrate that the grid-tied PV generation system using H-infinity controller has high control accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a combination method for the classification of power quality complex disturbances based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and multilabel learning. EEMD is adopted to extract the features of complex disturbances, which is more suitable to the nonstationary signal processing. Rank wavelet support vector machine (rank-WSVM) is proposed to apply in the classification of complex disturbances. First, the characteristic quantities of complex disturbances are obtained with EEMD through defining standard energy differences of each intrinsic mode function. Second, after the optimization of rank-SVM, based on wavelet kernel function, the ranking function, and multilabel function are, respectively, constructed. Lastly, rank-WSVM is applied to classify the complex disturbances. Simulation results and real-time digital simulator tests show that for different signal to noise ratio, the rank-WSVM classification performance of complex disturbances including hamming loss, ranking loss, one-error, coverage, and average precision, is generally better than the other three methods, namely rank-SVM, multilabel naive Bayes, and multilabel learning with backpropagation.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an abstract market model for demand response where a supply function bidding is applied to match power supply deficit or surplus. We characterize the resulting equilibria in competitive and oligopolistic markets and propose distributed demand response algorithms to achieve the equilibria. We further show that the equilibrium in competitive market maximizes social welfare, and the equilibrium in oligopolistic market has bounded efficiency loss under certain mild assumptions. We also propose distributed demand response algorithms to achieve the equilibria.

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust optimization (RO) model for bidirectional dispatch coordination of large-scale plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in a power grid in which the PEVs are aggregated to manage. The PEV aggregators are considered as a type of dispatchable demand response and energy storage resource with stochastic behaviors, and can supply load or provide ancillary services such as regulation reserve to the grid. The proposed RO model is then reformulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming model, which can be solved efficiently. Computer simulations are performed for a power grid with ten generators and three PEV aggregators to validate the economic benefit of the RO model for bidirectional dispatch coordination of the PEVs and the robustness of the RO model to the uncertainty of the PEVs' stochastic mobility behaviors.

Abstract: Distribution system states have become more dynamic due to the integration of intermittent distributed generation/load and bi-directional power flows. The availability of close to real-time distribution system models will help the controls and customer participations in the active distribution networks. A framework using on-line and off-line computing power and data in existing distribution management system to work together and build distribution feeder models for operation purposes is proposed. Simulations and evaluation results of the synergy of big heterogeneous topological and measurement data from systems that have different data formats, polling cycles, and accuracy to establish immediate past and future feeder models are presented. Archived customer meter interval and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data with the same time stamp are used to build quasi dynamic models off-line, and to forecast the states and measurements at the feeder buses. The results are then used in the on-line quasi dynamic state estimations (DySEs). The state tracking capability of two DySE techniques in conjunction with a static state estimator under various data accuracy assumptions is evaluated. Numerical results demonstrate the benefit of data synergy in the improvement of system operation models and network efficiency.

Abstract: Robust-index method is proposed to tackle the challenges of uncertainties caused by customer behavior in order to minimize comfort violation in household load scheduling. Robust indexes for different kinds of loads are developed and integrated into the load scheduling optimization problems in the form of additional constraints, and thus the obtained load schedules are able to reach the expected robust level. The robust-index method is simple in modeling, independent of historical data, and with low additional computational burden. Simulation results verified the validity of the proposed method and demonstrated their application in load scheduling.

Abstract: With the spotlight on smart grid development around the world, it is critical to recognize the key factors contributing to changing power-system characteristics. This is more apparent in distribution systems with the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and microgrid development. Source and load control at the distribution level is a key requirement of the evolving system. These activities require distribution automation (DA) strategies that take advantage of available technologies, while promoting newer solutions. It is necessary to create a roadmap for holistic DA strategies in a smarter grid. Sustainable and resilient grid development is a paradigm shift requiring a new line of thinking in the engineering, operation, and maintenance of the power system. Distributed control architectures based on dynamic load and source data should be explored as a possible solution. This paper discusses a novel approach that integrates protection, control, and monitoring using high-performance computing at the primary distribution substation level. The business case for infrastructure investment in the distribution systems is also discussed. This paper concludes with a discussion on emerging and future technologies for DA to improve the resiliency of a sustainable grid.

Abstract: With anticipated proliferation of electric vehicles and distributed generations in near future, dynamic thermal rating (DTR) as a tool for unlocking network capacities, is becoming critical for distribution network operators. DTR is gaining a great and still growing focus of attention in today's power industries. However, potential benefits of DTR, although have been envisioned to be significant, have not yet been studied quantitatively. This paper intends to comprehensively assess the potential impacts of DTR on the performance of a realistic Finnish distribution network. For doing so, first a step-by-step procedure is devised. Then, weather data and loading information of circuits in the network are gathered by advanced metering infrastructure available in the network. Thereafter, the gathered data are fed to mathematical models provided by the IEEE Standard 738-2006 and component dynamic thermal models to give thermal rating of circuits. The ratings are then used in reliability analysis where likely system states are simulated. This paper is performed for several cases and the results are discussed.

Abstract: There has been an ongoing effort to increase the number of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) devices to improve system observability. When deployed across distribution secondary networks, AMI provides building-level load and consumption information, which can be used to improve grid management strategies. A barrier to implementation is the significant upgrade costs associated with retrofitting existing meters with network-capable sensing. One economic way is to use image processing methods to extract usage information from images of the existing meters. This paper presents a solution that uses online data exchange of power consumption information to a cloud server without modifying the existing electromechanical analog meters. In this framework, a systematic approach to extract energy data from images is applied to replace the manual reading process. A case study is presented where the digital imaging approach is compared to the averages determined by visual readings over a one-month period.

Abstract: Wind energy is highly location-dependent. Many desirable wind resources in North America are located in rural areas without direct access to the transmission grid. By connecting megawatt-scale wind turbines to the distribution system, the cost of building transmission facilities can be avoided and wind power supplied to consumers can be greatly increased; however, integrating megawatt-scale wind turbines on distribution feeders will impact the distribution feeder stability, especially voltage stability. Distributed wind turbine generators (WTGs) have the capability to aid in grid stability if equipped with appropriate controllers, but few investigations are focusing on this. This paper investigates the potential of using real-time measurements from distribution phasor measurement units for a new WTG control algorithm to stabilize the voltage deviation of a distribution feeder. This paper proposes a novel auxiliary coordinated-control approach based on a support vector machine (SVM) predictor and a multiple-input and multiple-output model predictive control on linear time-invariant and linear time-variant systems. The voltage condition of the distribution system is predicted by the SVM classifier using synchrophasor measurement data. The controllers equipped on WTGs are triggered by the prediction results. The IEEE 13-bus distribution system with WTGs is used to validate and evaluate the proposed auxiliary control approach.

Abstract: This paper studies a novel transformer-based solid state fault current limiter (TBSSFCL) for radial distribution network applications. The proposed TBSSFCL is capable of controlling the magnitude of fault current. In order to control the fault current, primary winding of an isolating transformer is connected in series with the line and the secondary side is connected to a reactor, paralleled with a bypass switch which is made of anti-parallel insulated gate bipolar transistors. By controlling the magnitude of ac reactor current, the fault current is reduced and voltage of the point of common coupling is kept at an acceptable level. Also, by this TBSSFCL, switching overvoltage is reduced significantly. The proposed TBSSFCL can improve the power quality factors and also, due to its simple structure, the cost is relatively low. Laboratory results are also presented to verify the simulation and theoretical studies. It is shown that this TBSSFCL can limit the fault current with negligible delay, smooth the fault current waveform, and improve the power quality.

Abstract: Distribution utilities are becoming increasingly aware that their networks may struggle to accommodate a large number of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), especially at times of peak loading. In this paper, a centralized scheduling scheme is formulated to coordinate charging of a heterogeneous PEV fleet, which is then divided into load groups, each with a set of local objectives, constraints, and a decentralized control algorithm. Realistic energy tariffs are used to formulate probable "real-world" objectives for each load group, and a distributed dynamic program is used to regulate the net load of each load group. It is shown that charging coordination not only reduces peak network loads, but can also significantly reduce the customer's PEV charging cost. Potential improvements from the perspective of communication and modeling are also highlighted by adopting a systematic approach to divide the PEV fleet into load groups.

Abstract: Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) initiatives are a popular tool to incorporate changes for modernizing the electricity grid, reduce peak loads, and meet energy efficiency targets. There is the looming issue of how to communicate and handle consumer data collected by electric utilities and manage limited communication network resources. Several data relay points are required to collect data distributedly and send them through a communication backhaul. This paper studies the smart meter message concatenation (SMMC) problem of how to efficiently concatenate multiple small smart metering messages arriving at data concentrator units in order to reduce protocol overhead and thus network utilization. This problem needs to deal with the added constraint that each originating message from its source may have its own stated deadline that must be taken into account during the concatenation process. This paper provides hardness results for the SMMC problem, and proposes six heuristics and evaluates them to gain a better understanding of the best data volume reduction policies that can be applied at data concentrators of AMI infrastructures. These results are further tested for feasibility under practical settings based on aspects, such as network and processing delays, tightness of application deadlines, and lossy backhaul links.

Abstract: This paper discusses the design and simulation of an integrated load forecasting and state estimation tool for distribution system operations. A predictive database is created and applied to forecast future network states in order to allow short-term (e.g., hours/days ahead) planning to be carried out. The predictive database is based on adaptive nonlinear auto-regressive exogenous (NARX) load estimation and forecasting models, which are continuously updated using feedback from the state estimator. This creates a closed-loop information flow designed to continuously monitor and improve the system state estimation performance by updating and retraining models where appropriate. The aim of this methodology is to improve situational awareness and help to provide network operators with early warning of potential issues, in medium voltage (MV) networks where the number of on-line measurements is limited, and state estimation relies heavily on estimates of power injections. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated through simulation using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and smart meter measurements recorded from an actual MV distribution network.

Abstract: One of the important aspects of smart grid is to make the best use of existing assets. One way (among others) to achieve this objective is by scheduling effective maintenance routines. Abnormal conditions, including short circuits or overloads, would affect not only the exposed components, but also those farther away from the fault locations. This exposure may cause some of the components fail right away or at a later time. Therefore, the severity, frequency, and timings of system faults are important factors in planning maintenance programs. In this paper, the impact of increased current flows, in the form of short circuits and overloads, on component failure rates are studied and a maintenance scheduling model taking into account such impacts is developed. Using the developed model, the optimum mean time to preventive maintenance is derived and used to maximize the components availability. Results of this paper would help in preventing damage to the equipment by optimally scheduling maintenance programs based on short circuit current levels of the system.

Several load models and their parameter estimation methods are proposed. The online load modeling process is based on an adjustable sliding window applied to two different types of load step changes. The load modeling tests and related analysis of the synchrophasor data from the IIT microgrid are demonstrated.

Abstract: The development of state estimation (SE) tools for distribution networks is receiving increased attention as the traditionally passive distribution systems have become far more active. The high dimensionality of a distribution system model may lead to very high computation times. This paper addresses these issues and proposes an SE algorithm that analyzes a network which has been split into overlapping zones, enabling parallel application of the algorithm. The algorithm is developed to provide compatibility with distribution system requirements. The novelty of the algorithm lies in its capability to generate feasible solutions for the voltage estimation with a much smaller number of real measurements. The proposed algorithm is referred to as an overlapping zone approach, and has been tested on 356 and 711 node networks.

Abstract: We describe the general concept and practical feasibility of a dc-based open energy system (OES) that proposes an alternative way of exchanging intermittent energy between houses in a local community. Each house is equipped with a dc nanogrid, including photovoltaic panels and batteries. We extend these nanogrids with a bidirectional dc-dc converter and a network controller so that power can be exchanged between houses over an external dc power bus. In this way, demand-response fluctuations are absorbed not only by the local battery, but can be spread over all batteries in the system. By using a combination of voltage and current controlled units, we implemented a higher-level control software independent from the physical process. A further software layer for autonomous control handles power exchange based on a distributed multiagent system, using a peer-to-peer like architecture. In parallel to the software, we made a physical model of a four-node OES on which different power exchange strategies can be simulated and compared. First results show an improved solar replacement ratio, and thus a reduction of ac grid consumption thanks to power interchange. The concept's feasibility has been demonstrated on the first three houses of a full-scale OES platform in Okinawa.

Abstract: High penetrations of photovoltaic (PV) systems within load pockets in distribution grids have changed pure consumers to prosumers. This can cause technical challenges in distribution and transmission grids, such as overvoltage and reverse power flow. Embedding voltage support schemes into PVs, such as standard cos phi(P) characteristic proposed by the German grid codes, may cause more changes in the steady-state behavior of distribution grids and, in turn, the transmission side. Accordingly, it is important to properly model active distribution grids to analyze the system impacts of these changes to plan and operate future smart power grids. However, due to the high dimension of distribution grids, considering a detailed distribution grid to study the transmission side or a fraction of the distribution grid is either cumbersome or impractical. Therefore, it is required to develop a reasonable equivalent that can fairly capture the dominant behavior of the distribution grids. The aim of this paper is to use gray-box modeling concepts to develop a static equivalent of distribution grids comprising a large number of PV systems embedded with voltage support schemes. In the proposed model, the PV systems are aggregated as a separate entity, and not as a negative load, which is traditionally done. The results demonstrate the superior quality of the proposed model compared with the model with PV systems as the negative load.

Abstract: In a multienergy system, there are different types of dependencies among the energy carriers. Internal dependencies refer to possible changes in the energy source in the presence of energy converters and storage, and are managed by the system operator through the control strategies applied to the equipment. External dependencies (EDs) are due to the choice of the energy supply according to customer preferences when alternative solutions are available. This paper introduces a new model of EDs within a multigeneration representation based on energy hubs. EDs are addressed through a stochastic model in order to take into account the possible uncertainty in the customers' decisions. This model is then used to introduce carrier-based demand response (DR) in which the user participates in DR programs aimed at promoting the shifting among different energy sources by preserving the service provided to the end users. The results obtained from the new model in deterministic and stochastic cases indicate the appropriateness and usefulness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h. Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation, the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data. We also find that the parameter values chosen by evolution often provide insights into the interplay between the different datasets and forecast models. Software is available online.

Abstract: Weak grids/microgrids are gaining considerable attention due to the installation of renewable power generation resources in areas that are remote from load centers. This paper presents a multivariable-droop synchronous current converter control strategy for current management of weak grid/microgrid applications, and offers a systematic and straightforward design approach using the loop shaping technique. The controller integrates current regulation, management, and limitation that are applicable to weak grids and microgrids (MGs). The multivariable synchronous current converter enables superior decoupling of d- and q-axis currents in weak grids and/or resistive grids where these control variables are highly coupled due to converter operation at large load-angles. Therefore, stable connection of weak (high impedance) resistive MGs to utility grids is feasible. The multivariable droop concept also realizes real power sharing by simultaneous drooping of both frequency and voltage amplitude, which enhances load sharing accuracy in resistive and/or weak grids. Similar to its predecessor, synchronous converters, the controller can eliminate phase-locked loop (PLL) and provides a unified controller, PLL, and load manager in one simple control methodology. This can facilitate grid auto-synchronization, which can improve the stability of voltage source converters in weak grid applications. Also, the controller can participate in the power system frequency, and voltage regulation and control. To evaluate the performance of the controller, several simulations are conducted under various typical scenarios and conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an event-based protection scheme for a multiterminal dc power system, which includes hybrid energy resources and various loading schemes. The proposed protection scheme transfers less data when compared with commonly used data-based protection methods, and does not require high-speed communication and synchronization. Each protection unit is able to autonomously identify the type of event using the current derivative fault identification method, employing an artificial inductive line impedance. In order to accurately set the protection relays, detailed fault current analysis considering low pass resistor capacitor filter effects are presented. The decision for fault isolation is made based on the unit judgment and the data received through high-level data communication from other interconnected units. The performance of the proposed protection scheme was evaluated under different dc feeder and bus faults. The results show that this scheme is able to accurately identify the type of fault, isolate the faulted area, and restore the system quickly while limiting the load voltage drop to its preset limit.

Abstract: Over the past several years, distribution utilities have invested heavily in installations of "smart-meter" advanced metering initiative (AMI) systems. Among the anticipated benefits of these systems, utilities with smart-meter deployments are generally able to quickly assess which portions of their systems are operating normally and which customers are experiencing an outage. Projects at multiple utilities have focused on integrating AMI information, along with traditional supervisory control and data acquisition data sources, into utility distribution management systems to improve situational awareness on distribution feeders. Despite the clear benefits each of these systems offer, their ability to provide utilities with broad awareness of events affecting the health and status of the distribution system is limited, and often reactive in nature. This paper presents never-before-published cases observed in real-world field trials, detailing how integration of waveform analytics into utility operational practice leads to improved situational awareness.

Abstract: Nowadays, electricity energy demands requested from down-stream sectors in a smart grid constantly increase. One way to meet those demands is use of home energy management systems (HEMS). By effectively scheduling major household appliances in response to demand response (DR) schemes, residents can save their electricity bills. In this paper, an advanced HEMS facilitated by a nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique with an automated nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism is proposed. The NILM as an electricity audit is able to nonintrusively estimate power consumed by each of monitored major household appliances at a certain period of time. Data identified by the NILM are very useful for DR implementation. For DR implementation, the NSGA-II-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism autonomously and meta-heuristically schedules monitored and enrolled major household appliances without user intervention. It is based on an analysis of the NILM with historical data with past trends. The experimental results reported in this paper reveal that the proposed advanced HEMS with the NILM assessed in a real-house environment with uncertainties is workable and feasible.

Abstract: The integration of distributed generation (DG) in distribution grids is one of the pillars of smart grid deployment. However, an increasing amount of DG connected to distribution grids is likely to affect the operation of the grids themselves, e.g., changing the magnitude, and in some cases the direction, of power flows. In order to perform the transition to a smart grid, it is therefore essential to have the distribution system operators (DSOs) involved in the process. However, being that the DSOs' business is controlled by regulators, regulation has a fundamental impact on the speed and the actual performance of DSOs' involvement in the transition toward a smart grid. Therefore, a method is needed to assess network regulation impact on DSOs' incentive to integrate DG into their grids. This paper proposes a new method for the calculation of such incentive, and the method has been applied on a case study to the Portuguese, Danish, and Swedish regulations for different scenarios of DG penetration. The focus is on DSOs' operational costs and revenues. The analyses indicate that DG has a different impact on DSOs business, depending on the different regulations, the most relevant aspects being the structure of customer tariffs and the regulatory treatment of network losses.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm for coordinated control of the distributed generators integrated to a dc microgrid (DCMG), in islanded and grid connected modes of operation. The proposed DCMG connects various types of nonconventional energy sources, storage system to the dc, and three-phase, as well as single-phase ac loads. A control strategy for three-phase voltage source inverter to integrate the three-phase load, as well as utility grid into the DCMG, under various operating scenarios, has also been proposed. The proposed control strategy uses a combination of the feed-back and feed-forward control loops. Dual proportional integral controllers for ac voltage regulation and inner current control have been suggested in two rotating direct-and quadrature-axis synchronous reference frames for controlling the respective positive and negative sequence components. Simulations are carried out to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm and control strategy under different operating conditions including fault scenario and its effectiveness in maintaining the dc voltage of the microgrid.

Abstract: Real-time situational awareness tools are of critical importance to power system operators, especially during emergencies. The availability of electric power has become a linchpin of most post-disaster response efforts, because public and private sector services depend upon it. Knowledge of the scope and extent of facilities impacted, as well as the duration of their dependence on backup power, enables emergency response officials to plan for contingencies and provide a better overall response. Based on the measurement data acquired by the frequency disturbance recorders deployed in the North American power grids, an off-grid detection method is proposed and implemented. This method monitors the critical electrical loads and detects the transition of these loads from an on-grid operation to an off-grid operation, during which the loads are fed by an uninterrupted power supply or a backup generation system. The details of the detection algorithm are presented, and some case studies and off-grid detection scenarios are also provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness. This paper also presents the real-time implementation of this method and several effectively detected off-grid situations. Moreover, two visualization tools are developed to display the real-time system operation condition in an intuitive manor.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for estimating synchronized phase and frequency at the distribution level under both steady-state and dynamic conditions. The discrete Fourier transform-based method is widely used for phasor and frequency estimation, thanks to its low computational burden. However, errors arise when the power system is operating at off-nominal frequency, especially under dynamic conditions such as phase modulation. Additionally, the power grid signal at the distribution level contains more noise and harmonics, which cause phase and frequency estimation errors. In this paper, a synchronized phase and frequency estimation algorithm suitable for measurement at the distribution level is proposed and tested under noise and harmonic conditions, as well as various conditions in the phasor measurement unit Standard (C37.118.1-2011 and C37.118.1a-2014), to verify its measurement accuracy at the distribution level.

Abstract: As information and communication networks are highly interconnected with the power grid, cyber security of the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has become a critical issue in the electric power sector. By exploiting the vulnerabilities in cyber components and intruding into the local area networks of the control center, corporation, substations, or by injecting false information into communication links, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data, reconfigure devices, and send trip commands to the intelligent electronic devices that control the system breakers. Reliability of the power system can thus be impacted by various cyber attacks. In this paper, four attack scenarios for cyber components in networks of the SCADA system are considered, which may trip breakers of physical components. Two Bayesian attack graph models are built to illustrate the attack procedures and to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks. A mean time-to-compromise model is modified and adopted considering the known and zero-day vulnerabilities on the cyber components, and the frequencies of intrusions through various paths are estimated. With increased breaker trips resulting from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities in the IEEE reliability test system 79 are estimated. The simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks on the cyber components increases and the skill levels of attackers increase.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from utility-scale customer segmentation research initiatives, a new set of metrics is introduced that serve as quantitative measures of building occupant energy efficiency and energy-use predictability. Building occupant energy-use data is segmented to facilitate the construction of independent energy-use profiles for workdays, nonworkdays, work hours, and nonwork hours, which in turn enable further classification of building occupants according to their energy-use patterns. The three new metrics, building occupant energy-use efficiency, entropy, and intensity enable the design of more targeted energy conservation campaigns. Building occupants with relatively low energy-use efficiency scores can be individually targeted for behavioral interventions aimed at increasing the efficiency of their energy-use. Furthermore, building occupants with relatively low energy-use entropy scores can be sent timely behavior intervention notifications based on predictions of their future energy-use. Finally, building occupants with relatively high energy-use intensity scores can be targeted for equipment upgrades in order to reduce their overall energy consumption. We present the methodology behind the construction of these metrics and demonstrate how they can be applied to classify commercial building occupants based on their energy-use.

Abstract: There is a growing need for accurate and efficient real-time state estimation with increasing complexity, interconnection, and insertion of new devices in power systems. In this paper, a massively parallel dynamic state estimator is developed on a graphic processing unit (GPU), which is especially designed for processing large data sets. Within the massively parallel framework, a lateral two-level dynamic state estimator is proposed based on the extended Kalman filter method, utilizing both supervisory control and data acquisition, and phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. The measurements at the buses without PMU installations are predicted using previous data. The results of the GPU-based dynamic state estimator are compared with a multithread CPU-based code. Moreover, the effects of direct and iterative linear solvers on the state estimation algorithm are investigated. The simulation results show a total speed-up of up to 15 times for a 4992-bus system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel adaptive wide area backup protection scheme for transmission lines. In the proposed scheme, both the faulted line and fault location are determined by a limited number of synchronized phasor measurements. Based on phasor measurement unit placement and network topology, subsets of lines and buses called backup protection zones (BPZs) are formed. After a fault occurs in the transmission network, the sum of zero- and/or positive-sequence currents entering the faulted BPZ highly increases, and hence, the faulted BPZ can be determined. The linear least squares method is then used to determine the faulted line, as well as the fault location by voltage and current phasors of the faulted BPZ. Accordingly, the proposed scheme provides a closed-form and noniterative solution for the faulted line and fault location identification problem. On the other hand, it readily determines the faulted line regardless of the fault type, fault resistance, and measurement errors. To show the effectiveness of the method, it is applied to the WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems. Simulation results verify successful identification of the faulted BPZ as well as the faulted line within the faulted BPZ with limited measurement points.

Abstract: This paper deals with the selection of feedback signal(s) that retain the modal behavior of power system electromechanical dynamics under varying operating circumstances. The approach seeks signals that have relatively large magnitude of residue, less variation of the magnitude and phase angle, sufficient gap between the critical pole-zeros, and least sensitive to other modes. The methodology is tested in a 16-machine interconnected power system model with multiple wind farms.

Abstract: Coordinated operation of microgrids requires that energy management system takes into account both the available power in renewable energy sources (RES) and storage capacity of energy storage systems (ESS). In this paper, a coordinated architecture of islanded ac microgrids with smooth switching droop control (SSDC) is derived. Based on the proposed SSDC approach, flexible power control of each ESS/RES unit can be obtained with seamless modes changes. Furthermore, decentralized power management can be achieved by executing frequency bus-signaling. The power management principle based on different operational modes is explained in detail and small-signal analysis is carried out for SSDC. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop results of an islanded microgrid are provided under several scenarios to validate the proposed coordinated control strategy.

Abstract: Energy management in microgrids is typically formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Solving it in a centralized manner does not only require high computational capabilities at the microgrid central controller (MGCC), but may also infringe customer privacy. Existing distributed approaches, on the other hand, assume that all generations and loads are connected to one bus, and ignore the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flow and system operational constraints. Consequently, the schedules produced by those algorithms may violate those constraints and thus are not feasible in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the design of a distributed energy management strategy (EMS) for the optimal operation of microgrids with consideration of the distribution network and the associated constraints. Specifically, we formulate microgrid energy management as an optimal power flow problem, and propose a distributed EMS where the MGCC and the local controllers jointly compute an optimal schedule. We also provide an implementation of the proposed distributed EMS based on IEC 61850. As one demonstration, we apply the proposed distributed EMS to a real microgrid in Guangdong Province, China, consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, and a battery energy storage system. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and fast convergence of the proposed distributed EMS.

Abstract: With the recent rapid development of smart grid technology, the distribution grids become more active, and the interaction between transmission and distribution grids becomes more significant. However, in traditional power flow calculations, transmission and distribution grids are separated, which is not suitable for such future smart grids. To achieve a global unified power flow solution to support an integrated analysis for both transmission and distribution grids, we propose a global power flow (GPF) method that considers transmission and distribution grids as a whole in this paper. We construct GPF equations, and develop a master-slave-splitting (MSS) iterative method with convergence guarantee to alleviate boundary mismatches between the transmission and distribution grids. In our method, the GPF problem is split into a transmission power flow and a number of distribution power flow sub-problems, which supports on-line geographically distributed computation. Each sub-problem can be solved using a different power flow algorithm to capture the different features of transmission and distribution grids. An equivalent method is proposed to improve the convergence of the MSS-based GPF calculation for distribution grids that include loops. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in particular when the distribution grid has loops or distributed generators.

Abstract: So-called smart technologies are at the forefront of modern energy research. Many existing works focus on the effects of smart technologies, with scales ranging from a single household to an entire city. One area that is less studied is the adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we extend our prior work to develop a more robust framework for exploring the diffusion of basic smart grid technologies using a social-network-based model to study demand response adoption. This network is based around considering an end-user as a node, and any relationship where mutual trust and communication exists as an edge. In addition, we have incorporated mathematical representations of user personality traits in the decision-making progress to better simulate real-world actions. We observe greater usage of demand response when conventional electricity is high, when conscientiousness is high, and when the network is densely connected; all of these are reasonable results given logical behavior of the individual agents. Our model includes many tunable parameters in the update stages, of which the effects of only a few are included in this paper. This quantity of potential parameters, as well as the broad nature of the model and algorithm, makes our model a candidate for future improvement and development based on including different parameters.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage two-level model for the energy pricing and dispatch problem faced by a smart grid retailer who plays the role of an intermediary agent between a wholesale energy market and end consumers. Demand response of consumers with respect to the retail price is characterized by a Stackelberg game in the first stage, thus the first stage has two levels. A risk-aversive energy dispatch accounting for market price uncertainty is modeled by a linear robust optimization with objective uncertainty in the second stage. The proposed model is transformed to a mixed integer linear program (MILP) by jointly using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, the disjunctive constraints, and the duality theory. We propose a heuristic method to select the parameter in disjunctive constraints based on the interpretation of Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, we suggest solving an additional linear program (LP) to acquire a possible enhanced bidding strategy that guarantees a Pareto improvement on the retailer's profit over the entire uncertainty set. Case studies demonstrate the proposed model and method is valid.

Abstract: Demand-side management (DSM) plays a key role in the future of smart grids. Recently, DSM researchers have developed various mathematical models to optimize the demand response. Most of these works ignore the channel impairments' impact on the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a new noncooperative game theoretic model for the management of smart grid's demand considering the packet error rate in our formulation. We set the Nash equilibrium conditions for the proposed model. Under an assumption on the form of the utility functions, we develop a 0-1 mixed linear programming approach to compute nondominated extreme Nash equilibria. Results on a numerical example are provided and some useful insights are presented. Under some assumptions and a fully proven proposition, a feasible nondominated Nash equilibrium solution is found. Finally, we report and comment on computational experiments on randomly generated smart grid DSM game instances with different characteristics.

Abstract: A renewable energy-based dc micro-grid with hybrid energy storage, consisting of battery and ultracapacitor, is investigated. To achieve high penetration depth of renewable sources into the utility grid, a novel system operation strategy and the corresponding energy management method is proposed. In the operation strategy, the ultracapacitor unit works as the sole voltage source of the micro-grid to support the dc link in both connected and islanding mode. The micro-grid is controlled to deliver/absorb predefined amount of power to/from the utility grid during connected mode and zero during islanding mode. This design will certainly simplify the power dispatching algorithm of the power system and increase the possibility of including large quantities of micro-grids into the utility grid. The energy management method is dedicated to conducting the net power of the micro-grid effectively. The net power is separated into high-and low-frequency components. The high-frequency power is suppressed by the ultracapacitor automatically and the low frequency power is shared by the battery and an adjustment unit. A small-scale dc micro-grid structure with a single dc link is considered for investigation. MATLAB/Simulink simulation results are presented to validate the proposed system operation strategy and the energy management method.

Abstract: Recently, microgrids (MGs) have attracted considerable attention as a high-quality and reliable source of electricity. In this paper, energy management in MGs is addressed in the light of economic efficiency, environmental restrictions, and reliability improvement via: 1) optimizing the type and capacity of distributed generation (DG) sources, as well as the capacity of storage devices (SD); and 2) developing an operational strategy (OS) for energy management in MGs. A master-slave objective function based on net present value (as an economic indicator) is proposed. Such objective function is solved using a hybrid optimization method. This method includes two steps. In the first step, 2-D slave object functions (SOFs), operating costs, and consumer outage cost (as a reliability index) are minimized by quadratic programming and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, respectively. Then Pareto curve is drawn for SOF and fuzzy logic is employed to select the best SOF solution, OS, from Pareto curve. In the second step, using the best OS from step one for any iteration, PSO algorithms employed to solve master objective function, and to determine the optimum capacity and type of DGs and SDs. The results show that the proposed framework can be considered as an efficient tool in planning and energy management of MGs.

Abstract: This paper deals with the service restoration problem in renewable-powered microgrids that are driven islanded by an unscheduled breakdown from the main grid. The objective is to determine the maximum of the expected restorative loads by choosing the best arrangement of the power network configurations immediately from the beginning of the breakdown all the way to the end of the island mode. The intermittency nature of the renewable power, as well as the uncertainty of the duration of the breakdown pose new challenges to this classic optimization scheduling task. The proposed two scenario-splitting methods can be solved in a two-step solving procedure, in which a Lagrangian technique and dynamic programming are utilized to provide an analytical sub-optimal yet efficient solution to the original problem. Simulation results demonstrate that both methods can find solutions very close to optima effectively; the scheduling plan should be adjusted when the time evolves, especially when the renewable power generation takes a large portion in the power supply; and the energy storage system plays a significant role to reduce the risk of unreliability in the wind power forecasting, even with a small amount of capacity. Finally, the proposed approach can be applied to radially configured systems with other types of distributed generators.

Abstract: The emergence of microsources holds promise to reduce the carbon emissions and exploit more renewables in order to meet the worldwide growing electrical energy demands. However, there exist several challenges, such as optimizing the tradeoff between the use of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, to leverage affordable electric power while minimizing carbon emissions. Game theoretic approaches have been widely used in various scientific domains and have recently also increasingly been used in smart grids, whereby evolutionary paradigms have been widely deployed as a popular heuristic search method to solve and optimize complex real-life scientific problems. A promising approach is the development of such evolutionary algorithms and game theoretic approaches in the context of open energy markets. In this paper, we develop an analytic model of a multileader and multifollower Stackelberg game approach and propose a bi-level hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to find optimal strategies that maximize the profit of utilities, and minimize carbon emissions in an open energy market among interconnected microsources.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for contactless measurement of instantaneous voltage and waveform reconstruction for use in a medium voltage (MV) indoor substation. Voltage waveforms are reconstructed by artificial neural network (ANN) using the signals originating from electric field sensors located under MV bus. The method is validated by the experiment in a typical indoor MV substation. Depending on the selection of ANN architecture and data used for training the root mean squared error of waveforms, reconstruction as low as 0.3% to 2.1% can be achieved in a steady state. The practical advice on the application of the proposed measurement method in a production environment is also given.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic demand scheduling (D2S) scheme-an effort toward cost-effective energy consumption at customers' end. The theory of optimal portfolio selection is adopted to generate customers' expected day-ahead energy demand graph called the weight graph, based on past days' history-energy demand, profit return, and corresponding risk. In such a scenario, the weight graph of energy ensures that the expected profit return and the corresponding risk to the customers are optimized. Consequently, we evaluate the dynamic scheduling scheme for optimizing the energy cost to the customers using the weight graph. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also assists in relieving the peak-demand on the grid, which, in turn, implies that the grid is capable of providing service to the scheduled appliances. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated with different performance metrics-peak-demand, demand variation, energy-cost, and utility of the customers. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic scheduling scheme, D2S, yields improved performance than that with the existing ones-no scheduling and static scheduling. It also shows that the utility of the customers increases approximately 28.2% over the existing ones.

Abstract: This paper introduced a decentralized voltage control strategy for dc microgrids that is based on the droop method. The proposed distributed secondary voltage control utilizes an average voltage sharing scheme to compensate the voltage deviation caused by the droop control. Through nonexplicit communication, the proposed control strategy can perform precise terminal voltage regulation and enhance the system reliability against system failures. The distributed voltage compensators that resemble a centralized secondary voltage controller are implemented with the bi-proper anti-wind-up design method to solve the integration issues that necessarily lead to the saturation of the controller output efforts. The proposed concept of pilot bus voltage regulation shows the possibility of managing the terminal voltage without centralized structure. Moreover, the network dynamics are illustrated with a focus on cable resonance mode based on the eigenvalue analysis and small-signal modeling; analytical explanations with the development of equivalent circuits give a clear picture regarding how the controller parameters and droop gains affect the system damping performance. The proposed derivative droop control has been demonstrated to damp the oscillation and to improve the system stability during transients. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy are validated by both simulation and experimental evaluation.

Abstract: While electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to provide environmental and economical benefit, judicious coordination of EV charging is necessary to prevent overloading of the distribution grid. Leveraging the smart grid infrastructure, the utility company can adjust the electricity price intelligently for individual customers to elicit desirable load curves. In this context, this paper addresses the problem of predicting the EV charging behavior of the consumers at different prices, which is a prerequisite for optimal price adjustment. The dependencies on price responsiveness among consumers are captured by a conditional random field (CRF) model. To account for temporal dynamics potentially in a strategic setting, the framework of online convex optimization is adopted to develop an efficient online algorithm for tracking the CRF parameters. The proposed model is then used as an input to a stochastic profit maximization module for real-time price setting. Numerical tests using simulated and semi-real data verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The harmonic pollution of electric vehicle chargers is increasing rapidly as the scale of electric vehicle charging stations enlarges to meet the rising demand for electric vehicles. This paper investigates the operating characteristics of a three-phase uncontrolled rectification electric vehicle charger with passive power factor correction. A method for estimating the equivalent circuit parameters of chargers is proposed based on the measured feature data of voltage and current at the ac side and on the circuit constraint during the conduction charging process. A harmonic analytical model of the charging station is then established by dividing the same charger types into groups. The parameter estimation method and the harmonic model of the charging station are verified through simulation, experiment, and field test. The parameter sensitivities of the equivalent circuit to the charging current harmonic are also studied.

Abstract: New voltage control algorithms are necessary to cope with the increasing amount of distributed generation and electric vehicles in distribution networks. Many of the newly proposed voltage control algorithms are based on linearized dependencies between the voltage magnitude, and the active and reactive power consumption. These linearized dependencies are normally obtained by algorithms, which rely on accurate grid topology information. Due to the traditionally passive operation of low voltage (LV) distribution networks, this information is typically missing, incomplete, or inaccurate. Therefore, this paper introduces a method to extract these linear dependencies based on historical smart meter data only. No information about the grid topology is required. The model adapts to the changing load conditions in the network. The algorithm has a low complexity and is applied to an unbalanced LV distribution network. Data of a practical laboratory setup is used to validate the proposed method in real-life conditions. With the obtained voltage sensitivity factors a voltage management strategy was implemented for the laboratory grid.

Abstract: Distributed energy generation and storage are widely investigated demand-side management (DSM) technologies that are scalable and integrable with contemporary smart grid systems. However, prior research has mainly focused on day-ahead optimization for these distributed energy resources while neglecting forecasting errors and their often detrimental consequences. We propose a novel game theoretic model predictive control (MPC) approach for DSM that can adapt to real-time data. The MPC-based algorithm produces subgame perfect equilibrium strategies for distributed generation and storage with perfect forecasting information, and is shown to be more effective than a day-ahead scheme when mean forecasting errors greater than 10% are present. This robust and continuous MPC approach reduces effective forecasting errors, and in doing so, achieves greater electricity cost savings and peak to average demand ratio reduction than the day-ahead optimization scheme.

Abstract: The energy-saving dispatch could significantly enhance the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission reduction, as well as the sustainable development of the socio economy in China. With the rapid growth of smart grid, the use of demand response to dispatch loads with flexible consumption time and/or quantity has been a new trend in power industry. This paper proposes a new energy-saving dispatch problem while considering energy-saving and emission-reduction potentials of generation and demand sides, as well as the interaction between the two. A bi-level optimization model is established to address the interaction between the energy-saving dispatch of thermal units and that of users. The objective function of the upper level considers both the electric power generation cost and the carbon emission cost of thermal units, while the lower level integrates both compensation and incentive costs of electricity consumers into its objective function according to the influences of their regulation-based demand response to the power grid. Moreover, user benefits of reducing downtime and avoiding frequent load restarting are also considered in the lower layer model. An iterative algorithm is proposed and the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) method is used to solve the lower-layer model for seeking the optimal compromise solution on the Pareto frontier, which is derived by maximum deviations and entropy-based multiple attributes decision making method. Comparing with general NSGA-II and multiobjective genetic algorithms, the improved NSGA-II method can improve the spatial distribution of Pareto solution set and reduce the number of iterations, thus having stronger consistency among multiple objective functions and better performance.

Abstract: To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, several incentives are given to use renewable energy sources (RES) and plug-in electrical vehicles (PEVs). By using PEVs for electricity storage and RES as distributed generators, microgrids (MG) become more reliable, stable, and cost-effective. However, the high intermittent nature of energy sources and unpredictable presence of PEV in the MG offers new technological challenges to the smart grid/MG energy management system (EMS). In this paper, we propose a new distributed real-time electricity allocation (DRTA) scheme for the smart grid/MG EMS whose objectives are to reduce the electricity bill of the residential customers, to increase the overall social benefit of smart MG/grid community, and to increase the energy efficiency and reliability of the MG to rely on locally generated electricity. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game using mechanism design and solve it to optimality. The proposed DRTA scheme converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium and produces a near-optimal solution. We compare the proposed scheme with a centralized optimal electricity consumption scheme and to the solution obtained from unregulated (natural) scheduling framework.

Abstract: A new class of microgrids, called provisional microgrids, is introduced in this paper. Provisional microgrids hold similar characteristics as microgrids; however, do not possess the islanding capability and are dependent on one or more electrically connected microgrids for islanding purposes. Removing the islanding requirements and relying on the available unused capacity of existing microgrids characterizes provisional microgrids as enablers of rapidly deploying variable generation renewable energy resources in distribution networks and further preventing underutilization of capital-intensive distributed energy resources in microgrids. Provisional microgrids are defined and an uncertainty-constrained optimal scheduling model is developed, which considers prevailing uncertainties associated with loads, nondispatchable generation, and market price forecasts, as well as islanding incidents and the available unused capacity from coupled microgrids. The optimal scheduling problem is decomposed using Benders decomposition and solved via the robust optimization method. Numerical simulations study a test provisional microgrid for exploring its economic, reliability, and environmental merits.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is of paramount importance to maintain normal operations of smart power grids. However, recent research shows that carefully produced attacks with the knowledge of the grid topology, i.e., Jacobian matrix, can bypass the bad data detection (BDD) system. The BDD is used to ensure the integrity of state estimation to filter faulty measurements introduced by device malfunctions or malicious attacks. However, to construct the false data injection attack vectors, a common assumption in most prior works on false data injection attacks is that the attacker has complete knowledge about the power grid topology and transmission-line admittances. By contrast, this paper studies the general problem of blind false data injection attacks using the principal component analysis approximation method without the knowledge of Jacobian matrix and the assumption regarding the distribution of state variables. The proposed attack is proven to be approximately stealthy.(1) The performance of the proposed attack is analyzed. Simulations confirm the performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for the real-time management of electric vehicles (EVs) charging processes. The proposed method aims to limit the peak load and to increase the number of rechargeable EVs with respect to the scenario in which no coordination action is performed, while achieving given constraints on the power distribution system. The approach is based on a tight interaction between a scheduling algorithm and a power-flow evaluation procedure. The scheduling algorithm finds the best charging periods for each EV. The power flow procedure checks the achievement of electrical constraints and evaluates the operational parameters of the grid. Simulations are carried out on a real electricity distribution system of a medium-sized Italian city. The results show that the proposed approach increases the number of rechargeable EVs up to 33%. At the same time, the peak load is reduced by 25%. The scheduling algorithm requires an average of 50 ms to evaluate each charge request on an ordinary computer, therefore allowing its use in real-time conditions.

Abstract: The evolving wide-area measurement system technology offers new opportunities for backup protection of transmission lines to avert the misoperation of conventional relays against system disturbances and prevent system instability. Since wide-area backup protection (WABP) is to operate at the range of a few hundred milliseconds, the delays associated with data and command communications and algorithm execution can be a troublesome issue in a large-scale power system. This paper briefly reviews a WABP scheme based on positive-sequence voltage phasor direct and indirect measurements. To overcome the problem of WABP delays, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is proposed to divide the power system into several protection regions. This process is accomplished in three stages in which the number and location of measurement devices (MDs), the number and boundary of protection regions, and the location of protection rooms, as well as the total number of communication links between MDs and protection rooms are optimized. The proposed WABP scheme is implemented in each region and individually protects the associated transmission lines. Execution of the proposed ILP model on different test systems reveals that with regionalization of the systems, WABP schemes can reliably be used in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decentralized control scheme for islanded microgrids (ImGs) composed by the interconnection of distributed generation units (DGUs). Local controllers regulate voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling of each DGU, and they are able to guarantee stability of the overall ImG. The control design procedure is decentralized, since, besides two global scalar quantities, the synthesis of a local controller uses only information on the corresponding DGU and lines connected to it. Most important, our design procedure enables plug-and-play operations: when a DGU is plugged in or out, only DGUs physically connected to it have to retune their local controllers. We study the performance of the proposed controllers simulating different scenarios in MATLAB/Simulink and using performance indexes proposed in IEEE standards.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical control architecture designed for an arbitrary high voltage multiterminal dc (MTDC) network. In the proposed architecture, the primary control of the MTDC system is decentralized and implemented using a generalized droop strategy. Design criteria for dimensioning the primary control parameters, including voltage limits, are offered by analyzing the transients appearing in the system. The proposed secondary control is centralized and regulates the operating point (OP) of the network so that optimal power flow (OPF) is achieved. Compared to previous works, this paper further elaborates, both analytically and through simulations, on the coordination between the primary and secondary control layers. This includes how local primary controllers have to be driven by the centralized controller in order to ensure a smooth transition to the optimal OP.

Abstract: This paper studies the electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling problem to match the stochastic wind power. Besides considering the optimality of the expected charging cost, the proposed model innovatively incorporates the matching degree between wind power and EV charging load into the objective function. Fully taking into account the uncertainty and dynamics in wind energy supply and EV charging demand, this stochastic and multistage matching is formulated as a Markov decision process. In order to enhance the computational efficiency, the effort is made in two aspects. Firstly, the problem size is reduced by aggregating EVs according to their remaining parking time. The charging scheduling is carried out on the level of aggregators and the optimality of the original problem is proved to be preserved. Secondly, the simulation-based policy improvement method is developed to obtain an improved charging policy from the base policy. The validation of the proposed model, scalability, and computational efficiency of the proposed methods are systematically investigated via numerical experiments.

Abstract: The operation of the power grid is becoming more stressed, due to the addition of new large loads represented by electric vehicles (EVs) and a more intermittent supply due to the incorporation of renewable sources. As a consequence, the coordination and control of projected EV demand in a network of fast charging stations becomes a critical and challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a game theoretic based decentralized control mechanism to alleviate negative impacts from the EV demand. The proposed mechanism takes into consideration the nonuniform spatial distribution of EVs that induces uneven power demand at each charging facility, and aims to: 1) avoid straining grid resources by offering price incentives, so that customers accept being routed to less busy stations; 2) maximize total revenue by serving more customers with the same amount of grid resources; and 3) provide charging service to customers with a certain level of quality-of-service (QoS), the latter defined as the long term customer blocking probability. We examine three scenarios of increased complexity that gradually approximate real world settings. The obtained results show that the proposed framework leads to substantial performance improvements in terms of the aforementioned goals when compared to current state of affairs.

Abstract: The microgrid has been shown to be profitable, reliable, and efficient for military, commercial, and university-like installations. However, until now, there has been no study to show how and when a residential microgrid may be profitable. Therefore, in this paper, we present a design space exploration methodology of the microgrid by modeling all the energy resources at the residential level and conducting numerous simulations with various parameters. Moreover, a set of rules are defined to make the stakeholders in the microgrid profitable. Also, by analyzing the number of houses in the microgrid, we observe that the number of years it takes to return the capital costs invested in the microgrid may become adequately short for a certain range of the number of houses. For instance, if the aggregator owns the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, it may profit in less than five years when 500 houses participate in the microgrid where each house owns 500 sf solar panels. On the other hand, if the prosumers own the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, the aggregator may profit in about a year. Typically, for an apartment-block type housing area in U. S. there are more than 1000 houses, therefore the aggregator profitability may improve furthermore. pu pa

Abstract: Over a home area network, between smart appliances and the smart meter, and over an 802.15.4g smart utility network, from a smart meter toward the utility center, IEEE 802.15.4 assists with advanced metering infrastructure components in a smart grid. Adopting the synchronous beacon-enabled mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a slotted framework for low-power, real-time collection, and distribution of power information. However, the shared nature of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band introduces the beacon corruption issue, and confronts the 802.15.4-based network with service interruptions and large delays. This paper, experimentally and analytically, studies how interference from collocated networks affects the beaconing functionally and, consequently, network performance. Investigations indicate that beaconing contributes in low-power and low-delay communications over an 802.15.4 network only when its proper operation is guaranteed over a coexistent environment like ISM band; otherwise, the application delay is significantly compromised. In this regard, a standard-conforming enhancement, called the beacon corruption recovery scheme (BCRS), is proposed to mitigate effects of coexistence on beaconing performance by migration of the network to a cleaner channel. Simulation results show that by applying the BCRS, an 802.15.4 network experiences a less fragmented accesses to the medium and better fulfills real-time bidirectional flow of monitoring information.

Abstract: Without demand-side management, an increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) could result in overloads on distribution feeders. Aggregators could optimally manage the charging/discharging of the EVs, to not only maximize the consumers' welfare in response to real-time prices and accommodate their needs for transportation, but also to keep the distribution network within its operating limits. This paper proposes a decentralized framework in which the aggregator seeks to maximize its profits while the consumers minimize their costs in response to time-varying prices, and additional incentives provided to mitigate potential overloads in the distribution system. Test results show that a large penetration of EV penetration can then be managed without violating the capacity of the distribution network.

Abstract: In the risk-based security assessment, probability and severity of events are the two main factors for measuring the security level of power systems. This paper presents a method for assessing line overload risk of wind-integrated power systems with the consideration of wind and load-power generation correlation. The established risk assessment model fully considers the probability and the consequence of wind uncertainties and line flow fluctuations. The point estimate method is employed to deal with the probability of line overload and the severity function is applied to quantify line flow fluctuations. Moreover, with the Cholesky decomposition, the correlation between loads and power generations are simulated by the spatial transformation of probability distributions of random variables. In addition, Nataf transformation is used to address wind resource correlation. Finally, the line overload risk index is obtained, which can be used as an indicator for quantifying power system security. Numerical results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system and the modified IEEE 118-bus system show that the types and the parameters of the wind speed distribution would affect the risk indices of line overload, and the risk indices obtained with the consideration of wind resource correlation and load correlation would reflect the system security more accurately.

Abstract: Reactive power support through shunt capacitors and distributed generation is used in conjunction with step voltage regulators (SVRs) for voltage control of distribution feeders. Distribution management system is responsible for coordination among distributed reactive power sources, such as capacitors, photovoltaic and wind power generators, and SVRs. In this paper, a novel method for calculating voltage sensitivity to active, reactive power injection, and SVR taps in unbalanced distribution feeders is developed. The method is based on ABCD parameters of network components which are used in forward/backward sweep of power-flow solution. The method can deal with network unbalance, network shunt admittances, single-phase sections, and ungrounded sections. The initial sensitivities are calculated in one power-flow forward sweep through a recursive way, and the online updating of sensitivities is very easy and straightforward so the method is suitable for online voltage control. A novel sensitivity-based online optimization method is developed for online coordinated voltage control with no prior information about the load. The same ABCD parameters are used for developing a novel method for calculating short circuit currents in unbalanced distribution feeders. The method can also handle unbalance, shunt elements, and single phase sections, and is applicable to all fault types. The developed method for voltage control and short circuit calculation are tested on the IEEE comprehensive test feeder and the results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Minimizing the peak power consumption of electrical appliances under delay requirements is shown to be NP-hard. To address this, we propose a "family plan" approach that partitions users into groups and schedules users' appliances to minimize the peak power consumption of each group. Our scheme leverages the social network topology and statistical energy usage patterns of users. To partition users into groups with the potential of reducing peak power consumption, our distributed clustering scheme seeks such a partition of users into groups that the total power consumption in each group of users achieves minimum variance. Then, given a set of jobs of users' appliances to be scheduled in the next scheduling period, we use a distributed scheduling algorithm to minimize the peak power consumption of each group of users. Our simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves a significant reduction in user payments, peak power consumption, and fuel cost.

Abstract: In the foreseeable future, power grids will be managed largely with demand-side management (DSM) programs. With the growing population of electric vehicles (EVs) and the emergence of aggregators, DSM will surely introduce more intense competition to the markets. Since EV charging produces a large amount of time-flexible load in power systems, competition of its management could become a major game. This paper first formulates the game of EV charging management to describe this major form of the future DSM competition and then studies three challenges inherent in it: 1) inefficiency of Nash equilibria; 2) the game of chicken; and 3) cheating on private information. It is found that a central regulator is required to prevent these drawbacks. Solutions are proposed and a central governing procedure is also presented. The notion of the game of EV charging management is compatible with DSM programs that are able to schedule load flexibly over multiple time periods.

Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a potential candidate for medium/high-power applications, specifically for high-voltage direct current transmission systems. One of the main challenges in the control of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents while the capacitor voltages are maintained balanced. This paper proposes a control strategy for the MMC using finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). A bilinear mathematical model of the MMC is derived and discretized to predict the states of the MMC one step ahead. Within each switching cycle, the best switching state of the MMC is selected based on evaluation and minimization of a defined cost function. The defined cost function is aimed at the elimination of the MMC circulating currents, regulating the arm voltages, and controlling the ac-side currents. To reduce the calculation burden of the MPC, the submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing controller based on the conventional sorting method is combined with the proposed FCS-MPC strategy. The proposed FCS-MPC strategy determines the number of inserted/bypassed SMs within each arm of the MMC while the sorting algorithm is used to keep the SM capacitor voltages balanced. Using this strategy, only the summation of SM capacitor voltages of each arm is required for control purposes, which simplifies the communication among the SMs and the central controller. This paper also introduces a modified switching strategy, which not only reduces the calculation burden of the FCS-MPC strategy even more, but also simplifies the SM capacitor voltage balancing algorithm. In addition, this strategy reduces the SM switching frequency and power losses by avoiding the unnecessary switching transitions. The performance of the proposed strategies for a 20-level MMC is evaluated based on the time-domain simulation studies.

Abstract: Communication network brings new challenges such as time delay and data loss to wide-area damping control of power systems. The uncertainty caused by stochastic time delay of network communication increases the difficulty of wide-area control performance analysis. This paper proposes a mathematical expectation modeling approach to model and analyze wide-area controlled power systems considering the effect of stochastic time delay. In the proposed method, mathematical expectation of stochastic time delay distribution is derived to accurately model the impact of communication network on wide-area control performance. The theoretical frame of the proposed modeling approach is presented, and the effectiveness of the method is verified through the simulation of a power system with eight generators and 36 nodes.

Abstract: Power management is an essential tool for microgrid (MG) safe and economic operation, particularly in the islanded operation mode. In this paper, a multi-timescale cost-effective power management algorithm (PMA) is proposed for islanded MG operation targeting generation, storage, and demand management. Comprehensive modeling, cost, and emission calculations of the MG components are developed in this paper to facilitate high accuracy management. While the MGs overall power management and operation is carried out every several minutes to hours, depending on the availability of the required data, simulation for highly dynamic devices, such as batteries and electric water heaters (EWHs) used for demand response (DR), are performed every minute. This structure allows accurate, scalable, and practical power management taking into consideration the intrainterval dynamics of battery and EWHs. Two different on/off strategies for EWH control are also proposed for DR application. Then, the PMA is implemented using the two different DR strategies and the results are compared with the no-DR case. Actual solar irradiation, ambient temperature, nonEWH load demand, and hot water consumption data are employed in the simulation studies. The simulation results for the MG studied show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to reduce both MGs cost and emission.

Abstract: As the smart grid solutions enable active consumer participation, demand response (DR) strategies have drawn much interest in the literature recently, especially for residential areas. As a new type of consumer load in the electric power system, electric vehicles (EVs) also provide different opportunities, including the capability of utilizing EVs as a storage unit via vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) options instead of peak power procurement from the grid. In this paper, as the main contribution to the literature, a collaborative evaluation of dynamic-pricing and peak power limiting-based DR strategies with a bi-directional utilization possibility for EV and energy storage system (ESS) is realized. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework-based modeling of a home energy management (HEM) structure is provided for this purpose. A distributed small-scale renewable energy generation system, the V2H and V2G capabilities of an EV together with two-way energy trading of ESS, and different DR strategies are all combined in a single HEM system for the first time in the literature. The impacts of different EV owner consumer preferences together with the availability of ESS and two-way energy trading capabilities on the reduction of total electricity prices are examined with case studies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel optimization based home load control (HLC) to manage the operation periods of responsive electrical appliances, determine several recommended operation periods for nonresponsive appliances, and schedule the charge/discharge cycling of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) considering various customer preferences. The customer preferences are in the format of payment cost, interruption cost, and different operational constraints. The projected algorithm is online, in which household appliances are initially scheduled based on the payment cost, and when the home load is interrupted, the scheduling will be updated to minimize customer interruption cost. Due to vehicle to home capability of PHEV, the home outage can be managed through solving the proposed optimization problem. Several realistic case studies are carried out to examine the performance of the suggested method. In addition, the impacts of common electricity tariffs on the HLC results are investigated. The results reveal that employing the proposed HLC program benefits not only the customers by reducing their payment and interruption costs, but also utility companies by decreasing the peak load of the aggregate load demand.

Abstract: The possibility of leveraging the data provided by smart meters to understand the load characteristics is studied in this paper. The loads are modeled as voltage-dependent elements to increase the accuracy of volt-VAR optimization (VVO) techniques for distribution systems. VVO techniques are part of the distribution management system and may be used for purposes such as loss reduction, voltage profile improvement, and conservation voltage reduction. A deterministic framework is proposed that formulates the VVO problem as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming problem, which is solved efficiently using advanced branch-and-cut techniques. The proposed framework is capable of optimally controlling capacitor banks, voltage regulators, and under-load tap changers (ULTCs) for day-ahead operation planning. The results indicate that loss reductions of up to 40% and a total demand reduction of up to 4.8% are achievable under some loading conditions in a radial test system. The effect of the load voltage dependence is also demonstrated through analytical simulations.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to present a novel agent based distributed power flow solver for general unbalanced radial distribution systems utilizing multiagent system communication. The distributed solver makes use of intelligent agents, which possess three key characteristics, namely autonomy, local view, and decentralization. Comprehensive models of distribution systems will be considered, including lines, switching devices, voltage regulators, transformers, shunt capacitors, distributed energy storage systems, and different load types. The distributed intelligent agents will use the backward/forward sweep technique to iteratively solve the power flow. A distinguishing feature of the new solver is that it deals with the problem from a completely distributed perspective. The proposed solution algorithm is evaluated on three standard IEEE distribution test systems with very promising results.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new coordinated voltage control (CVC) method with reactive power management scheme (RPMS) for a hybrid micro-grid (MG). The CVC scheme, based on synchronizing the response speeds of different voltage regulating devices, is coordinated with novel RPMS. Two cases, with and without proposed CVC, were simulated in the power system computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including dc (EMTDC) environment and compared against each other. The case with proposed CVC shows superior performance, when tested for fault triggered islanding, intentional islanding, and MG internal fault. Further, the proposed CVC with RPMS is compared to a voltage regulation method present in literature. The proposed CVC with RPMS provides better voltage regulation, maximizes the fast dynamic reactive power reserve, and improves the transient response and transient stability margin of the hybrid MG.

Abstract: Minimization of the de-energized consumers load and reduction of the service restoration costs are considered in the proposed heuristic graph-based approach for finding the solution of the service restoration in distributed networks. The approach is based on the logic of the modified Prim's algorithm that finds the minimum spanning trees (i.e., a forest). Operation costs including an actual status ("open" or "close") of the switching equipment in a de-energized area is represented by the switching cost coefficients. The cost coefficients are assigned to all branches in a de-energized area. The switching action is performed by switching equipment with minimal switching costs coefficient in each iteration of the algorithm. The results confirm that the service restoration costs are decreased by the consideration of the actual status of the switching equipment.

Abstract: This paper develops an analytical model for a residential microgrid (RMG) under a collaborative environment. The model assumes that the RMG community is under a social agreement referred to as Collaborative Consumption. The model includes a framework for RMGs using a unique method of demand response based on the particular characteristics of residential loads. Residential loads are categorized into three types based on their necessity and reschedulable ability. Consumers assign priority to their appliances. Then, the microgrid informs consumers about their real-time consumption and economic benefits associated with their participation in collaborative consumption. Accordingly, consumers can evaluate suggested alternatives prior to using appliances and consequentially make better decisions. Finally, the effects of model parameters on profit maximization are studied. The results of this paper estimate the economic benefits within a collaborative environment.

Abstract: This paper presents a topology for dc grids which enables very robust dc fault protection with moderate costs, good operating flexibility, and simple controls. It is postulated that radial dc systems are best suited for limited-size local dc grids. Radial topology enables robust and fast protection selectivity using only local signals and exploiting the advantages of hybrid dc circuit breakers (CBs). To enable flexible expansion options to national/international systems, it is suggested to interconnect star points of radial systems using dc/dc converters. DC/dc converters enable inherent isolation of dc faults and provide firewall between radial dc grids. Each interconnecting cable is protected by a dc/dc at one end and a hybrid CB at the other end. The control options for dc/dc converter and the radial grids are analyzed. A detailed simulation model of six terminal dc grid with two-star points is presented. The power systems computer aided design (PSCAD) simulation results confirm dc fault isolation and good control performance of the proposed topology for a range of dc fault contingencies.

Abstract: Large-scale penetration of photovoltaic (PV) power generators and storage batteries is expected in recently constructed power systems. For the realization of smart energy management, we need to make an appropriate day-ahead schedule of power generation and battery charge cycles based on the prediction of demand and PV power generation, which inevitably involves nontrivial prediction errors. With this background, a novel framework is proposed to maintain the balance among the total amounts of power generation, demand, and battery charging power with explicit consideration of the prediction uncertainty, assuming that consumer storage batteries are not directly controllable by a supplier. The proposed framework consists of the following three steps: 1) the day-ahead scheduling of the total amount of generation power and battery charging power; 2) the day-ahead scheduling of utility energy consumption requests to individual consumers, which aim to regulate battery charging cycles on the consumer side; and 3) the incentive-based management of the entire power system on the day of interest. In this paper, we especially focus on the day-ahead scheduling problems in steps 1) and 2), and show that they can be analyzed in a manner originating from spatiotemporal aggregation. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework through numerical verification of the power system management.

Abstract: In the smart grid environment, reserve services (RS) are also expected from the demand side, taking into account the flexibility and availability of loads connected into the grid. This paper proposes a method to calculate the availability of thermal domestic loads for the provision of upward RS, considering some aspects regarding the constructive characteristics of the appliances, as well as the consumer habits and comfort preferences. A case study comprising 500 consumers with three types of domestic thermal loads (electric water heaters, air-conditioners, and refrigerators) will be used to illustrate the method.

Abstract: An effective power system protection scheme has to be able to detect and locate all occurring faults corresponding to low and high impedance values. The latter category poses the greatest challenge for the protection schemes due to the low values of the related fault current. This paper extends previous work by the authors on the subject, aiming to achieve detection and location of high impedance faults (HIFs) in multiconductor overhead distribution networks utilizing power line communication (PLC) devices. Fault detection is proposed to be performed by a PLC device installed at the starting point of the monitored line and by using differences to the values of metrics related to input impedance at frequencies utilized by narrowband systems. Moreover, fault location can be derived by a response to impulse injection procedure utilized by all installed PLC devices along the line. The method is evaluated and validated in various simulation test cases concerning its ability to effectively detect and locate HIFs.

Abstract: Gearbox has proven to be a major contributor toward downtime in wind turbines. The majority of failures in the gearbox originate from the gearbox bearings. An early indication of possible wear and tear in the gearbox bearings may be used for effective predictive maintenance, thereby reducing the overall cost of maintenance. This paper introduces a self-evolving maintenance scheduler framework for maintenance management of wind turbines. Furthermore, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based condition monitoring approach using data from supervisory control and data acquisition system is proposed. The ANN-based condition monitoring approach is applied to gearbox bearings with real data from onshore wind turbines, rated 2 MW, and located in the south of Sweden. The results demonstrate that the proposed ANN-based condition monitoring approach is capable of indicating severe damage in the components being monitored in advance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present optimal day-ahead scheduling and control models for microgrids under uncertainty. The traditional deterministic mixed integer programming used in wholesale market fails to produce adequate results, especially when variations and risks are high. We develop stochastic programming optimization models with risk neutral and risk-averse options. We also characterize microgrids with their mean design capacity configuration and operational volatility. A dissimilarity measure determines the relative volatility between two microgrids. We demonstrate that risk-based decision-making in microgrids can significantly change the day-ahead scheduling and control outcomes, and capacity configuration and volatility measures are determining factors for microgrid risks and savings.

Abstract: In order to analyze the fault trends more accurately, a failure rate model appropriate for general electric power equipment is established based on a nonparametric regression method, improved from stratified proportional hazards model (PHM), which can make maximum use of equipment lifecycle data as the covariates, including manufacturer, service age, location, maintainer, health index, etc. All of covariates are represented in the hierarchy process of equipment health condition, which is beneficial for processing and classifying the lifecycle data into multitype recurrent events quantitatively. Meanwhile, based on new definitions of single health cycle and time between events, recurrent inspecting events distributed with martingale process can correspond with event-specific failure function during equipment lifecycle. On this occasion, more inspecting events can be utilized in a complete cycle to predict potential risk and assess equipment health condition. Then, stratified nonparametric PHM is employed to build the multitype recurrent events-specific failure model appropriate for competing risk problem toward interval censored. Lastly, the example in terms of transformers demonstrates the modeling procedure. Results show the well asymptotic property and goodness-of-fit tested by both of graphical and analytical methods. Compared with existing failure models, such as age-based or CBF model, this improved nonparametric regression model can mine lifecycle data acquisition from asset management system, depict the failure trend accurately considering both individual and group features, and lay the foundation for health prognosis, maintenance optimization, and asset management in power grid.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a single-phase on-board bidirectional plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charger that can provide reactive power support to the utility grid in addition to charging the vehicle battery. The topology consists of two-stages: 1) a full-bridge ac-dc boost converter; and 2) a half-bridge bidirectional dc-dc converter. The charger operates in two quadrants in the active-reactive power (PQ) power plane with five different operation modes (i.e., charging-only, charging-capacitive, charging-inductive, capacitive-only, and inductive-only). This paper also presents a unified controller to follow utility PQ commands in a smart grid environment. The cascaded two-stage system controller receives active and reactive power commands from the grid, and results in line current and battery charging current references while also providing a stable dynamic response. The vehicle's battery is not affected during reactive power operation in any of the operation modes. Testing the unified system controller with a 1.44 kVA experimental charger design demonstrates the successful implementation of reactive power support functionality of PEVs for future smart grid applications.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage robust optimization model for the distribution network reconfiguration problem with load uncertainty. The first-stage decision is to configure the radial distribution network and the second-stage decision is to find the optimal a/c power flow of the reconfigured network for given demand realization. We solve the two-stage robust model by using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm, where the master problem and subproblem are formulated as mixed-integer second-order cone programs. Computational results for 16, 33, 70, and 94-bus test cases are reported. We find that the configuration from the robust model does not compromise much the power loss under the nominal load scenario compared to the configuration from the deterministic model, yet it provides the reliability of the distribution system for all scenarios in the uncertainty set.

Abstract: An energy management system (EMS) determines the dispatching of generation units based on an optimizer that requires the forecasting of both renewable resources and loads. The forecasting system discussed in this paper includes a representation of the uncertainties associated with renewable resources and loads. The proposed modeling generates fuzzy prediction interval models that incorporate an uncertainty representation of future predictions. The model is demonstrated using solar and wind generation and local load data from a real microgrid in Huatacondo, Chile, for one-day ahead forecasts to obtain the expected values together with fuzzy prediction intervals to represent future measurement bounds with a certain coverage probability. The proposed prediction interval models would help to enable the development of robust microgrid EMS.

Abstract: High penetration levels from renewable energy sources in large-scale power systems demand a high degree of flexibility in the transmission and distribution system. This paper presents a method for utilization of flexible demand in the low-voltage distribution system using the thermal mass of a building to defer power consumption from electric space heating. The power consumption for heating is controlled by an operational virtual power plant, which is sending a set point for requested power consumption to the building management system. An optimization problem is formulated such that the discrete dispatch of power from ten electric space heaters is following the power set point given constraints on the indoor comfort that is defined by the users of the building. The controlling method has been implemented in an intelligent office building and used for demonstration of flexible demand in the low voltage network.

Abstract: This paper describes the development of a multi-function control strategy for the stable operation of distributed generation (DG) units during the integration with the power grid. The proposed control model is based on direct Lyapunov control (DLC) theory and provides a stable region for the proper operation of DG units during the integration with the power grid. The compensation of instantaneous variations in the reference current components in ac-side and dc-voltage variations in the dc-side of the interfacing system are adequately considered in this control plan, which is the main contribution and novelty of this paper in comparison with previous control strategies. Utilization of the DLC technique in DG technology can confirm the continuous injection of maximum active power in fundamental frequency from the DG source to the power grid, compensating all the reactive power and harmonic current components of grid-connected loads through the integration of DG link into the grid. Application of this concept in smart grids system can guarantee to reduce the stress on the utility grid during the peak of energy demand. Simulation and experimental test results are presented to demonstrate the proficiency and performance of the proposed DLC technique in DG technology.

Abstract: Sales of privately-owned plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are projected to increase dramatically in coming years and their charging will impact residential service transformer loads. Transformer life expectancy is strongly related to the cumulative effects of internal winding temperatures, which are a function of loading. Thermal models exist (e.g., IEEE Standard C57.91) for predicting these internal temperatures, the most sophisticated being the Annex G model. While this model has been validated with measurements from large power transformers, small residential service transformers have been given less attention. Given increasing PEV loads, a better understanding of service transformer aging could be useful in replacement planning processes. Empirical data from this paper indicate that the Annex G model over-estimates internal temperatures in small 25 kVA 65 degrees C rise mineral-oil-immersed transformers. This paper presents an alternative model to Annex G by using a genetic program. Empirical results using a thermally-instrumented transformer suggest that this model is both simpler and more accurate at tracking empirical transformer data. We conclude that one can use a simple thermal model in combination with data from advanced metering infrastructure to more accurately estimate service transformer lifetimes, and thus better plan for transformer replacement.

Abstract: This paper presents a new risk assessment method that is applicable to extreme cases in power systems. This paper analyzes the interactions among protection system components and the power grid in extreme events pertaining to simultaneous faults and cascading failures. The hidden failures of protection systems could exacerbate power system conditions if cascading events tend to follow a path to a blackout. The proposed risk assessment considers detailed reliability models of protection system components including circuit breakers (CBs) and protective relays. The failure probability of a CB is formulated considering its component degradation rate and operation times. The failure model of a protective relay is constructed using the dynamic fault tree. The evolution of cascading failures of power systems in extreme conditions, which deteriorates due to protection system malfunctions, is modeled based on the actual physical system behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed risk assessment method is demonstrated using a modified 9-bus system and the IEEE 68-bus system.

Abstract: Condition monitoring and diagnosis have become an essential part of power transformer asset management. A variety of online and offline measurements have been performed in utilities for evaluating different aspects of transformers' conditions. However, properly processing measurement data and explicitly correlating these data to transformer condition is not a trivial task. This paper proposes an intelligent framework for condition monitoring and assessment of power transformer. Within this framework, various signal processing and pattern recognition techniques are applied for automatically denoising sensor acquired signals, extracting representative characteristics from raw data, and identifying types of faults in transformers. This paper provides case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and techniques for power transformer asset management. The hardware and software platform for implementing the proposed intelligent framework will also be presented in this paper.

Abstract: Dynamic asset rating (DAR) is one of the number of techniques that could be used to facilitate low carbon electricity network operation. Previous work has looked at this technique from an asset perspective. This paper focuses, instead, from a network perspective by proposing a dynamic network rating (DNR) approach. The models available for use with DAR are discussed and compared using measured load and weather data from a trial network area within Milton Keynes in the central area of the U.K. This paper then uses the most appropriate model to investigate, through a network case study, the potential gains in dynamic rating compared to static rating for the different network assets-transformers, overhead lines, and cables. This will inform the network operator of the potential DNR gains on an 11-kV network with all assets present and highlight the limiting assets within each season.

Abstract: This paper presents game-theoretic frameworks for demand response at both electricity market and consumer levels. First, the interaction between a demand response aggregator (DRA) and electricity generators is modeled as a Stackelberg game in which the DRA, as the leader of the game, makes demand reduction bids, and generators, as followers, compete for maximizing their profits based on the reduced demand. Next, the interaction between the DRA and consumers is modeled as a mechanism design problem wherein the DRA seeks to minimize the aggregate inconvenience of consumers while achieving the targeted load curtailment. The inconvenience function of each consumer is captured by a type value, which is used by the DRA to solve the load curtailment problem. A Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-based mechanism is proposed, which guarantees that each consumer reveals its true type value to the DRA. A case study of the Stackelberg game shows that, in the South Australian electricity market where there is significant renewable penetration, peak period demand response provides the maximum potential profit, but off-peak demand response even in a concentrated market is not financially attractive.

Abstract: This paper presents a new modeling framework for analysis of impact and scheduling of price-responsive as well as controllable loads in a three-phase unbalanced distribution system. The price-responsive loads are assumed to be linearly or exponentially dependent on price, i.e., demand reduces as price increases and vice versa. The effect of such uncontrolled price-responsive loads on the distribution feeder is studied as customers seek to reduce their energy cost. Secondly, a novel constant energy load model, which is controllable by the local distribution company (LDC), is proposed in this paper. A controllable load is one that can be scheduled by the LDC through remote signals, demand response programs, or customer-end home energy management systems. Minimization of cost of energy drawn by LDC, feeder losses, and customers cost pertaining to the controllable component of the load are considered as objectives from the LDCs and customers' perspective. The effect of a peak demand constraint on the controllability of the load is further examined. The proposed models are tested on two feeders: 1) the IEEE 13-node test feeder; and 2) a practical LDC feeder system. Detailed studies examine the operational aspects of price-responsive and controllable loads on the overall system. It is observed that the LDC controlled load model results in a more uniform system load profile, and that with a reduction in the peak demand cap, the energy drawn decreases, consequently reducing feeder losses and LDC's and customers' costs.

Abstract: Through smart metering in the smart grid end-user domain, load profiles are measured per household. Personal data can be inferred from these load profiles by using nonintrusive appliance load monitoring methods, which has led to privacy concerns. Privacy is expected to increase with longer intervals between measurements of load curves. This paper studies the impact of data granularity on edge detection methods, which are the common first step in nonintrusive load monitoring algorithms. It is shown that when the time interval exceeds half the on-time of an appliance, the appliance use detection rate declines. Through a one-versus-rest classification modeling, the ability to detect an appliance's use is evaluated through F-scores. Representing these F-scores visually through a heatmap yields an easily understandable way of presenting potential privacy implications in smart metering to the end-user or other decision makers.

Abstract: This letter presents a performance enhancement for a previously developed direct load control scheme that controls (toggles on/off) thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) through two-way communication infrastructure for providing load balancing services. In addition to device operating temperature and on/off status (TCA states), two more pieces of information, rates of temperature increase and decrease (RTI/RTD), are calculated at each TCA and communicated to the central controller. By communicating the RTI/RTD to the central controller, the same or even better control performance can be achieved at 2-3 times longer sampling periods, showing significant reduction of the communication needs from each TCA to the central controller.

Abstract: Smart transmission grids are intended to utilize various measurements for enhanced operation. In particular, synchronized phasor measurements have found many applications in this context. This paper presents a linear weighted least-squares (WLS) method for fault location estimation of transmission lines by synchronized voltage measurements. The measurements may be taken from the faulted line terminals or buses far from the faulted line. The circuit equations of the network are used to find the transfer function between the fault location and each voltage measurement. Next, two auxiliary variables are defined to transform the nonlinear fault location estimation problem into a linear WLS problem. A closed-form solution is then obtained for fault location. The use of multiple measurements provides the opportunity of identifying erroneous measurements by a statistical test. The linearity of the problem expedites both estimation and identification procedures. Moreover, the method requires neither to classify the fault type nor to estimate the fault resistance. Furthermore, transmission lines are modeled by distributed parameters so that the method can be applicable to long lines. Electromagnetic transient simulations for 9-bus and 22-bus test systems reveal accurate fault location estimation, regardless of fault type and resistance, as well as successful identification of measurement errors.

Abstract: To protect complex power-grid control networks, power operators need efficient security assessment techniques that take into account both cyber side and the power side of the cyber-physical critical infrastructures. In this paper, we present CPINDEX, a security-oriented stochastic risk management technique that calculates cyber-physical security indices to measure the security level of the underlying cyber-physical setting. CPINDEX installs appropriate cyber-side instrumentation probes on individual host systems to dynamically capture and profile low-level system activities such as interprocess communications among operating system assets. CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state. The results of our experiments with actual attacks against a real-world power control network shows that CPINDEX, within few seconds, can efficiently compute the numerical indices during the attack that indicate the progressing malicious attack correctly.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust control strategy for reducing system frequency deviation, caused by load fluctuation and renewable sources, in a smart microgrid system with attached storage. Frequency deviations are associated with renewable energy sources because of their inherent variability. In this work, we consider a microgrid where fossil fuel generators and renewable energy sources are combined with a reasonably sized, fast acting battery-based storage system. We develop robust control strategies for frequency deviation reduction, despite the presence of significant (model) uncertainties. The advantages of our approach are illustrated by comparing system frequency deviation between the proposed system (designed via mu synthesis) and the reference system which uses governors and conventional PID control to cope with load and renewable energy source transients. All the simulations are conducted in the Matlab (TM) and Simulink (TM) environment.

Abstract: As the penetration of renewable energy resources increases in distribution networks, so does the need to manage these resources in an effective manner. Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical control approach and new mathematical optimization models of greenhouses, which can be readily incorporated into energy hub management systems (EHMSs) in the context of smart grids to optimize the operation of their energy systems. In greenhouses, artificial lighting, CO2 production, and climate control systems consume considerable energy; thus, a mathematical model of greenhouses appropriate for their optimal operation is proposed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing greenhouse control systems. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of greenhouses; in particular, inside temperature and humidity, CO2 concentration, and lighting levels should be kept within acceptable ranges. Therefore, the proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing control systems in greenhouses. Effects of uncertainty in electricity price and weather forecast on optimal operation of the storage facilities are studied through Monte Carlo simulations. The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.

Abstract: Moving toward a carbon free energy system has become an objective for many countries nowadays. Among other changes, the electrification of strategic sectors, such as heating and transportation, is inevitable. As a consequence, the current power system load will substantially increase. In this context, the nature of the expected loads (heat pumps, plug-in electric vehicles, etc.) makes the low voltage (LV) networks specially targeted. A promising solution to overcome the challenges resulting from their grid integration is demand response (DR). This paper introduces a hierarchical structure for controlling the DR of a LV grid. This is designed to maximize the grid utilization, thereby reducing the need for reinforcement; accommodate the maximum number of flexible loads; and satisfy the power and comfort requirements from each of the consumers in the network. The validation of the proposed concept is made using a model of an LV network currently operative in Denmark. The results show that by using the proposed strategy a considerable improvement of the minimum system voltage and a better load distribution is obtained.

Abstract: Managing the widely distributed wood pole assets owned by typical electric power utilities in the USA is challenging in the absence of appropriate analytical tools. The traditional method of inspecting poles by headquarters or strictly age is insufficient for effective management since natural hazards cause the largest instantaneous pole replacements. A probabilistic framework is developed and presented in this paper to address this issue. Fragility assessment is conducted using Latin hypercube sampling to estimate pole failure probabilities conditional on wind speed intensities. Failure probability estimates are obtained using age-dependent fragility functions and appropriate distribution functions for maximum 3 s wind gust speeds. Pole locations from an electric power utility's database management system were imported into ArcMap, a component of Environmental Systems Research Institute geospatial processing program. Age distributions were extracted by county and used to estimate expected pole failures. A sort-algorithm on the failures-the inspection order indices gives the proposed appropriate order of pole locations to be inspected. These calculated values were added as a data layer into ArcMap generating a geospatial visualization of both the orders of pole inspections and probabilistic pole loss estimates for the electric utility by counties. Applying the framework will increase utilities' visibility into the vulnerability of their pole plants. Emergency preparedness will also improve, strengthening customer-perception on utilities' maintenance efforts.

Abstract: Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are expected to become widespread in the near future. However, high penetration of PHEVs can overload the distribution system. In smart grid, the charging of PHEVs can be controlled to reduce the peak load, known as demand-side management (DSM). In this paper, we focus on the DSM for PHEV charging at low-voltage transformers (LVTs). The objective is to flatten the load curve of LVTs, while satisfying each consumer's requirement for their PHEV to be charged to the required level by the specified time. We first formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem and then propose a decentralized water-filling-based algorithm to solve it. A moving horizon approach is utilized to handle the random arrival of PHEVs and the inaccuracy of the forecast nonPHEV load. We focus on decentralized solutions so that computational load can be shared by individual PHEV chargers and the algorithm is scalable. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time implementation of a multiagent-based game theory reverse auction model for microgrid market operations featuring conventional and renewable distributed energy resources (DER). Studies were conducted on a grid connected microgrid consisting of a synchronous generator, two inverter-based generation units, and a combined load. The multiagent-based platform was applied to monitor, control, and perform the reverse auction process of DERs. A competitive game-theory reverse auction model was investigated to schedule the DER unit commitment with an hour-ahead market approach for the 24 h of the day. The proposed methodology was realistically implemented and operated at the Florida International University smart grid test system. The investigation shows that the proposed algorithm and the industrial hardware-based infrastructure can be implemented in the existing electric utility grid as new assets of the system are added.

Abstract: If several feeders are interrupted in a severe accident, distribution networks should be restored by reconfiguring switches automatically with smart grid technologies. Although there have been several restoration algorithms developed to find the new network configuration, they might fail to restore the whole network if the network were critically damaged. The network's design has to guarantee that it is restorable under any possible failure for secure power delivery, but it is a computationally hard task to examine all possible failures in a large-scale network with complex electrical constraints. This paper proposes a novel method to find all the critical (unrestorable) line cuts with great efficiency to verify the network design. The proposed method first runs a fast screening algorithm based on hitting set enumeration; the algorithm selects suspicious cuts without naively examining all possible cuts. Next, unrestorable cuts are identified from the suspicious ones with another algorithm, which strictly tests the restorability of the network under each suspicious cut without redundantly repeating heavy power flow calculations. Thorough experiments on two distribution networks reveal that the proposed method can find thousands of unrestorable cuts from the trillions of possible cuts in a large 432-Bus network with no significant false negatives.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the price competition among electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) with renewable power generators (RPGs). As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, a competition among EVCSs to attract EVs is inevitable. Thereby, each EVCS sets its electricity price to maximize its revenue by taking into account the competition with neighboring EVCSs. We analyze the competitive interactions between EVCSs using game theory, where relevant physical constraints such as the transmission line capacity, the distance between EV and EVCS, and the number of charging outlets at the EVCSs are taken into account. We show that the game played by EVCSs is a supermodular game and there exists a unique pure Nash equilibrium for best response algorithms with arbitrary initial policy. The electricity price and the revenue of EVCSs are evaluated via simulations, which reveal the benefits of having RPGs at the EVCSs.

Abstract: Automated demand response can be a valuable resource for ancillary services in the power grid. This paper illustrates this value with the first experimental demonstration of frequency regulation from commercial building heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The experiments were conducted in Pugh Hall, a 40 000 sq. ft. commercial building located at the University of Florida. Detailed are the steps required to make this possible, including control architecture, system identification, and control design. Experiments demonstrate: that satisfactory frequency regulation service can be provided by the HVAC system without noticeable effect on the indoor climate, and the ancillary service provided by this system passes the qualification criteria for participating in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection's frequency regulation market.

Abstract: To increase the reliability of the power grid and reduce the risk of power supply failure, demand-side management (DSM) is of central importance. In this paper, a nonparametric test is applied to detect if the demand behavior of consumers is consistent with time-of-day electricity tariff initiatives. The test is based on Afriat's theorem in economics and has the unique feature that it provides necessary and sufficient conditions to detect if the price-demand behavior is consistent with utility maximization (i.e., the test detects demand-responsive consumers) without prior knowledge of the consumer's utility function. For consumers that are responsive to time-of-day pricing initiatives, a nonparametric learning algorithm is used to forecast power demands for unobserved electricity tariffs. The nonparametric learning algorithm can be used in anticipatory control structures in a DSM framework to achieve power usage objectives. Real-world data from Ontario's power system and numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of the nonparametric test and nonparametric learning algorithm for forecasting consumer demand.

Abstract: Life cycle management (LCM) combines a set of technical and economic activities with the specific goal of improving the long-term economic value of an asset. An LCM plan helps to make operational decisions for a component over its life cycle. It typically consists of preventive maintenance scheduling, condition monitoring, inspection activities, replacement or refurbishment planning, and spares management. It is developed based on a study of component failure modes, operating history, maintenance practices, aging, spares, and obsolescence. Utility companies have predominantly developed LCM plans based on heuristic approaches. The existing methods do not accurately cover the impact of maintenance on equipment reliability and cost. A state diagram is developed to simulate the aging, inspection, maintenance, repair, failure, and overhaul cycle of a component throughout its lifetime. This diagram can help in deciding the optimal maintenance policy, and also quantify the impact of maintenance on reliability and cost. Probabilistic tools are also developed to help in the evaluation of an LCM plan and for further optimization.

Abstract: With the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), an avalanche of new energy-use information became available. Better understanding of the actual power consumption patterns of customers is critical for improving load forecasting and efficient deployment of smart grid technologies to enhance operation, energy management, and planning of electric power systems. Unlike traditional aggregated system-level load forecasting, the AMI data introduces a fresh perspective to the way load forecasting is performed, ranging from very short-term load forecasting to long-term load forecasting at the system level, regional level, feeder level, or even down to the consumer level. This paper addresses the efforts involved in improving the system level intraday load forecasting by applying clustering to identify groups of customers with similar load consumption patterns from smart meters prior to performing load forecasting.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generic optimal industrial load management (OILM) model, which can be readily incorporated into energy hub management systems (EHMSs) for industrial customers, in interaction with local distribution companies (LDCs), for automated and optimal scheduling of their processes. The mathematical models comprise an objective function to minimize the total energy costs and/or demand charges for industrial customers, and a set of equality and inequality constraints to represent the industrial process, storage units, distribution system components, operator's requirements, and other relevant constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed OILM model is demonstrated in two industrial customers: 1) a flour mill; and 2) a water pumping facility. The results show that the proposed OILM model, in conjunction with communication and control infrastructures at the customer and LDC levels, would allow optimal operation of industrial EHMSs in smart grids.

Abstract: The presence of energy hubs and the advancement in smart grid technologies have motivated system planners to deploy intelligent multicarrier energy systems entitled "smart energy hub" (S.E. Hub). In this paper, we model S.E. Hub, and propose a modern energy management technique in electricity and natural gas networks based on integrated demand side management (IDSM). In conventional studies, energy consumption is optimized from the perspective of each individual user without considering the interactions with each other. Here, the interaction among S.E. Hubs in IDSM program is formulated as a noncooperative game. The existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) is proved. Additionally, the strategies for each S.E. Hub are determined by proposing a distributed algorithm. We also address the IDSM game in a cloud computing (CC) framework to achieve efficient data processing and information management. Simulations are performed on a grid consisting of ten S.E. Hubs. We compare the CC framework with conventional data processing techniques to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach in determining NE. It is also shown that in the NE, the energy cost for each S.E. Hub and the peak-to-average ratio of the electricity demand decrease substantially.

Abstract: A fully distributed control scheme of island ac microgrids that can perform the primary, secondary, and tertiary control locally in distributed generators (DGs) is proposed. In the control scheme, no central controller or external information exchange is needed, while the final frequency can be controlled within the allowable range and the DGs can share loads according to their increment costs. The low-pass filters are designed to decouple the dynamics of the microgrid and to improve the system performance. Simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the control scheme.

Abstract: Rapid development of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) brings new challenges and opportunities to the power industry. A large number of idle PHEVs can potentially be employed to form a distributed energy storage system for supporting renewable generation. To reduce the negative effects of unsteady renewable generation outputs, a stochastic optimization-based dispatch model capable of handling uncertain outputs of PHEVs and renewable generation is formulated in this paper. The mathematical expectations, second-order original moments, and variances of wind and photovoltaic (PV) generation outputs are derived analytically. Incorporated all the derived uncertainties, a novel generation shifting objective is proposed. The cross-entropy (CE) method is employed to solve this optimal dispatch model. Multiple patterns of renewable generation depending on seasons and renewable market shares are investigated. The feasibility and efficiency of the developed optimal dispatch model, as well as the CE method, are demonstrated with a 33-node distribution system.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel finite-state-machine (FSM) representation of long-term load operating waveforms for feature extraction and load identification. An operating waveform is first converted into a quantized sequence of states. Each state is assigned with 2-D numerical values: root mean square (RMS) current values and staying time values. A set of elemental states and events are defined to reduce the number of states and extract numerical features to represent electric loads for classification and identification. Three major categories of repeating patterns in waveforms that correspond to repeating operating actions are summarized and identification methods are proposed for each such category. Test results using a large dataset of real-world waveforms show that the different appliances have distinct ranges of features extracted from the proposed FSM representation, and thus can be identified with high accuracy.

Abstract: Demand-management programs intend to maintain supply-demand balance and reduce the total energy cost. In this paper, we propose a user-aware demand-management approach that manages residential loads while taking into consideration user preferences. Maximizing users' savings and comfort can be two contradicting objectives. We identify a trade-off between these two objectives and propose an energy consumption optimization model, as well as a game theoretic approach to take this trade-off into account. User comfort is modeled in a simple yet effective way that considers waiting time, type of appliance, as well as a weight factor to prioritize comfort over savings. The proposed game is based on a modified regret matching procedure and borrows advantages of both centralized and decentralized schemes. Through simulations, we show that the proposed approach is scalable, converges in acceptable times, introduces a very limited amount of overhead in the system, achieves very high cost savings, and preserves users' preferences. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the optimization model and the proposed approach.

Abstract: Service restoration is important in distribution networks following an outage. During the restoration process, the system operating conditions will fluctuate, including variation of the load demand and the output from distributed generators (DGs). These variations are hard to be predicted and the load demands are roughly estimated because of absence of real-time measurements, which can significantly affect the restoration strategy. In this paper, we report a robust restoration decision-making model based on information gap decision theory, which takes into account the uncertainty in the load and output of the DGs. For a given bounded uncertain set of parameters, the solutions can ensure feasibility and that an objective does not fall below a given threshold. We describe the implementation of a robust optimization algorithm based on a mixed integer quadratic constraint programming restoration model, the objective of which is to restore maximal outage loads. Numerical tests on a modified Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) 69-node distribution network are discussed to demonstrate the performance of the model.

Abstract: Aiming at eliminating the current drawbacks that exists in condition-based maintenance (CBM) decision-making, such defects as single objective model, difficulty in controlling the process, and individual rather than group decision-making, this paper proposed a multiobjective group decision-making CBM model based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory by establishing maintenance decision-making framework, setting index system and quantifying all the indices. The model takes decision-making indices as evidence sources and maintenance schemes as knowledge framework, solving the problem of difficulty in demarcation of objectives and constraints. Maintenance schemes are achieved according to mean residual life prediction based on maintenance guidance and current condition quantified by health index to estimate the most appropriately maintenance interval. After that, standardized values of indices under each scheme are normalized into mass function of D-S evidence theory. Then, considering comprehensive weights of indices decision-makers, multiobjective group decision-making results of maintenance types, and time intervals are obtained. Finally, a numerical case is studied to illustrate the proposed modeling process, and demonstrates that the model can effectively realize multiobjective group decision-making, as well as considering the intentions of decision makers while all indices can reach global optimum.

Abstract: This paper presents a flexible and robust numerical algorithm for fault location on transmission lines. The algorithm does not require line parameters to locate the fault, which is an advance over fault locators that do require such information. Line parameters are only approximately constant; they vary with different loading and weather conditions, which affects the accuracy of existing fault location algorithms. Thus, an approach which does not require line parameters would be more robust, accurate, and flexible. Accurately, locating faults on transmission lines is vital for expediting their repair, so the proposed solution could lead to an improvement in the security and quality of the energy supply. Development of the proposed algorithm was facilitated by new smart grid technologies in the field of wide-area monitoring, protection, and control. The proposed algorithm is based on emerging synchronized measurement technology, using synchronized data sampling at both line terminals; however, the "SynchroCheck" procedure is also proposed as a means of accurately locating faults when data sampling synchronization has been lost. This paper presents the algorithm derivation and the results of thorough testing using alternative transients program-electromagnetic transients program (ATP-EMTP) fault simulations.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal charging strategy for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to be used in electric distribution networks. The optimization algorithm is made up of two phases: 1) an optimal power flow calculation; and 2) a linear optimization. The former, while taking into account the power system technical constraints, sets the upper bounds to the recharge power for each vehicle and the latter defines the recharge profiles of each PEV. In order to test the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm, a case study was set up. The connection of 300 PEVs to the Conseil International des Grands Reseaux lectriques (CIGRE) European low voltage benchmark network has been simulated. The proposed algorithm has been compared with a nonoptimal charging strategy, which assigns a flat charging profile by dividing the energy requested by the desired recharge time. The results show that the optimization algorithm both complies with the energy requests set by the end users and with the technical operation limits of the network. This allows for PEVs to provide a basic-although of paramount importance-service to the grid: the smart charge.

Abstract: When considering the characteristics of electric power systems in the U.S., the local distribution is the most likely part to be adversely affected by the unregulated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging. The increased load that can result from unregulated charging of PEVs could dramatically accelerate the aging of electrical transformers. In this paper, the control strategies that can mitigate or eliminate the accelerated aging that could result from load peaks caused by PEV charging is developed. The aging model makes it possible to develop charging control strategies that protect the transformer system while maximizing overall PEV charging quality. The charging control policy makes use of load prediction algorithms using data-driven models that are based on actual electricity consumption data. The experimental tests are done to calibrate the thermal model of a 25 kVA distribution transformer and validate the effectiveness of the control strategy.

Abstract: Microgrids are perceived to play an important role in the future of smart grids. Cost reduction and frequency regulation are among the major concerns in this context. This paper aims to study the mutual impacts of these issues and to propose an integrated mathematical framework in order to achieve minimum costs while maintaining frequency-regulation requirements. Inspired by the operational practices and requisites of the real-world microgrid applications, different methods of frequency control are reviewed and discussed. This is followed by developing adequate models for the different types of frequency-regulation mechanisms in the framework of the microgrid generation scheduling problem. The application of the proposed methodology to the Bella Coola microgrid in British Columbia, Canada, is explained, and several numerical results are presented and discussed.

Abstract: In a smart micro-grid (MG) each generator or load has to take part in the network management, joining in reactive power supply/voltage control, active power supply/frequency control, fault ride-through capability, and power quality control. This paper includes a new concept for building integration in MGs with zero grid-impact so improving the MG efficiency. These aims are shown to be achievable with an intelligent system, based on a dc/ac converter connected to the building point of coupling with the main grid. This system can provide active and reactive power services also including a dc link where storage, generation, and loads can be installed. The system employed for validation is a prototype available at ENEA Laboratories (Italian National Agency for New Technologies). A complete and versatile model in MATLAB/SIMULINK is also presented. The simulations results and the experimental test validation are included. The trial confirms the model goodness and the system usefulness in MG applications.

Abstract: Electricity cost has become a big concern of commercial cloud service providers with the rapid expansion of network-based cloud computing. Locationally, dispersed large-scale Internet data centers (IDCs) that underpin the cloud have increasing impact on the regional electricity market with their skyrocketing energy consumption. In this paper, the electricity market participation and accordingly the demand response capability of an IDC is defined as its temporally and spatially shiftable electricity demand quantities for processing delay-tolerant central processing unit-intense batch computing jobs. The demand response capability of the IDC is obtained by the proposed electric demand management solution. Price-sensitive and cooling efficiency-enabled batch computing workload dispatch with the objective of minimizing electricity cost is realized by dynamic IDC server consolidation and scheduling with virtual machine live migration technology. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed demand management solution in IDC energy consumption and electricity cost reduction.

Abstract: A power packet dispatching system is expected to be one of the advanced power distribution systems for controlling electric power, providing energy on demand, and reducing wasted energy consumption. In this paper, power packet routers are designed and experimentally verified for realizing a networked power packet distribution system. While the previously developed router directly forwards the power packet to a load, the new router forwards the packet to the other router with an information tag reattached to the power payload. In addition, the new router can adjust the starting time for forwarding the received power packet to the other site, thus utilizing storage capacity integrated into the router. The results successfully clarify the feasibility of the power packet distribution network.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel flow invariants-based approach to microgrid management that is much more intuitive, less complex, and highly scalable in comparison with existing droop control, agent-based, and model predictive control-based approaches. These proclaimed advantages are exemplified by using a renewable energy-based microgrid (a microgrid-in-a-container) for a military forward operating base camp as the model system. The ability of the proposed approach to maintain the overall system stability and valid power flows while efficiently managing distributed energy resources through multiple operational modes is reflected by using a requirements matrix, and proven techniques in distributed systems and formal analysis. A Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD) simulation is used to validate and verify the real-world practicality of the proposed control approach.

Abstract: Voltage and frequency fluctuation associated with renewable integration have been well identified by power system operators and planners. At the microgrid level, a novel device for the implementation of dynamic load response, which is known as the electric springs (ES), has been developed for mitigating both active and reactive power imbalances. In this paper, a comprehensive control strategy is proposed for ES to participate in both voltage and frequency response control. It adopts the phase angle and amplitude control which respectively adjust the active power and the reactive power of the system. The proposed control strategy is validated using a model established with power system computer aided design/electro-magnetic transient in dc system. Results from the case studies show that with appropriate setting and operating strategy, ES can mitigate the voltage and frequency fluctuation caused by wind speed fluctuation, load fluctuation, and generator tripping wherever it is installed in the microgrid.

Abstract: Proactive preparedness to cope with emergencies, especially those of nature origins, significantly improves the resilience and minimizes the restoration cost of electric power systems. In this paper, a proactive resource allocation model for repair and restoration of potential damages to the power system infrastructure located on the path of an upcoming hurricane is proposed. The objective is to develop an efficient framework for system operators to minimize potential damages to power system components in a cost-effective manner. The problem is modeled as a stochastic integer program with complete recourse. The large-scale mixed-integer equivalence of the original model is solved by the Benders' decomposition method to handle computation burden. The standard IEEE 118-bus system is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and further discuss its merits.

Abstract: We propose a compression approach for load profile data, which addresses practical requirements of smart metering. By providing linear time complexity with respect to the input data size, our compression approach is suitable for low-complexity encoding and decoding for storage and transmission of load profile data in smart grids. Furthermore, it allows for resumability with very low overhead on error-prone transmission lines, which is an important feature not available for standard time series compression schemes. In terms of compression efficiency, our approach outperforms transmission encodings that are currently used for electricity metering by an order of magnitude.

Abstract: This paper proposes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles bidirectional charging/discharging and state of charge (SoC) control for a microgrid frequency stabilization using a multiple model predictive control (MMPC). The MMPC is the improved version of a model predictive control (MPC) for working with multiple operating condition of the system. The MPC is an effective model-based prediction which calculates the future control signals by optimization of a quadratic programming based on the plant model, past manipulate, and control signals of the system. By optimization of an electric vehicle power control signal at each time instant, as well as changing the MPC by electric vehicle battery SoC, the proposed MMPC is able to improve the frequency stabilization of the microgrid effectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-step methodology for scheduling electric vehicle (EV) charging, which limits the burden on distribution and transmission assets while ensuring all the vehicles are charged. In the first step, the number of vehicles to be charged during each hour is optimized based on day-ahead requests for charging. The second step determines the maximum number of vehicles that can be charged based on operating conditions during the next hour to ensure distribution reliability requirements are met. A numerical example is given to illustrate the EV charging management scheme. This technique will limit the effects of EV charging on distribution assets.

Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) create power imbalance and congestion in the existing power network, and hence causes significant problems in the control and operation. Despite investing huge efforts from the electric utilities, governments, and researchers, smart grid (SG) is still at the developmental stage to address those issues. In this regard, a smart grid testbed (SGT) is desirable to develop, analyze, and demonstrate various novel SG solutions, namely demand response, real-time pricing, and congestion management. In this paper, a novel SGT is developed in a laboratory by scaling a 250 kVA, 0.4 kV real low-voltage distribution feeder down to 1 kVA, 0.22 kV. Information and communication technology is integrated in the scaled-down network to establish real-time monitoring and control. The novelty of the developed testbed is demonstrated by optimizing EV charging coordination realized through the synchronized exchange of monitoring and control packets via an heterogeneous Ethernet-based mesh network.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of voltage source converter interfaced distributed generators (DGs) for reactive power support in active distribution networks. Integration of DG management systems into decentralized parts of the Volt/VAR management system is proposed. The solution is designed to address issues connected to increased DG penetration, while at the same time avoiding the technical challenges and high costs related to state-of-the-art model-based Volt/VAR management. Coordination of DGs with conventional voltage regulation equipment is based on predefined control hierarchies. However, to reduce requirements for data handling capability, the distribution grid is divided into zones with individual voltage regulation and reactive support schemes. To add flexibility and scalability, these zones can be combined into larger zones with a common Volt/VAR management scheme. This is referred to as adaptive zoning. The results indicate that the control schemes successfully restore voltage to within limits after disturbance of grid conditions. Adaptive zoning effectively reduces system complexity and requirements for data handling capability, while still ensuring a grid-wide solution.

Abstract: Due to the rapid deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) on large power grids, the system operators now have access to high speed high resolution data. A new class of monitoring and control applications are made possible with the PMUs. Although PMU based monitoring systems have been well developed, implementations of PMU based fast acting closed loop wide area control systems are relatively rare. To meet the stringent latency requirements of a wide area controller the communication and power infrastructures have to collaborate strongly. In this paper, a combined process for design and simulation of both communication network and power network has been presented with the objective of damping interarea oscillations. A method to determine the optimal location of data routing hubs so as to minimize the volume of communications is also proposed. The IEEE 118 bus system is used to study the performance of communication system and the wide area power damping control system on both centralized and decentralized topologies, and the results are discussed. One of the conclusions of the paper is that the decentralized communication architectures involving data routing hubs are better suited for control applications requiring fast control actions.

Abstract: In the context of energy saving and carbon emission reduction, the electric vehicle (EV) has been identified as a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuel-driven vehicles. Due to a different refueling manner and driving characteristic, the introduction of EVs to the current logistics system can make a significant impact on the vehicle routing and the associated operation costs. Based on the traveling salesman problem, this paper proposes a new optimal EV route model considering the fast-charging and regular-charging under the time-of-use price in the electricity market. The proposed model aims to minimize the total distribution costs of the EV route while satisfying the constraints of battery capacity, charging time and delivery/pickup demands, and the impact of vehicle loading on the unit electricity consumption per mile. To solve the proposed model, this paper then develops a learnable partheno-genetic algorithm with integration of expert knowledge about EV charging station and customer selection. A comprehensive numerical test is conducted on the 36-node and 112-node systems, and the results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm.

Abstract: In the past decade, distribution network operators have been broadly engrossed toward automated distribution networks. The operators acknowledge network automation as an efficient investment toward a better service reliability. This paper aims to provide a new long-term cost/benefit analysis for an optimal level of distribution network automation. In the analysis, reduction in customer outage cost is considered as the benefit of implementing automation systems with capital investment, and annual operation and maintenance costs. In the Finnish regulation model, there is a special incentive based on customer outage cost reduction. As the main contribution of this paper, the impact of earth fault events and their required time-consuming fault management process is taken into account within the calculation of the benefit of automation systems. The solution of the analysis consists of the optimal number and location of remote-controlled sectionalizing switches, which are building blocks of automation systems. The problem is formulated in a mixed-integer linear programming format that can be effectively solved by commercially available solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the Helsinki distribution network. The results show that neglecting the impact of earth fault events can lead to suboptimal solutions.

Abstract: One of the most challenging problems associated with operation of smart micro-grids is the optimal energy management of residential buildings with respect to multiple and often conflicting objectives. In this paper, a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed for optimal energy use in a smart home, considering a meaningful balance between energy saving and a comfortable lifestyle. Thorough incorporation of a mixed objective function under different system constraints and user preferences, the proposed algorithm could not only reduce the domestic energy usage and utility bills, but also ensure an optimal task scheduling and a thermal comfort zone for the inhabitants. To verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, a number of simulations were performed under different scenarios using real data, and the obtained results were compared in terms of total energy consumption cost, users' convenience rates, and thermal comfort level.

Abstract: In modern power systems and electricity markets, demand response (DR) programs play an important role enabling the mitigation of critical load periods or price-peaking scenarios, thereby improving system reliability. Price fluctuations, in forward or real-time markets, can be an effective price-based DR mechanism for curtailing or shifting load. However, using dynamic pricing to achieve a desired load profile requires both an accurate demand forecast and knowledge of the price elasticity of demand, which is notoriously difficult to estimate. The limited accuracy of these parameter estimates is the main source of uncertainty limiting appropriate DR implementation. In this paper, we present a novel DR scheme that avoids the need to predict the price elasticity of demand or demand forecast, yet still delivers a significant DR. This is done based on the consumers' submissions of candidate load profiles ranked in the preference order. The load aggregator then performs the final selection of individual load profiles subject to the total system cost minimization. Additionally, the proposed DR model incorporates a fair billing mechanism that is enhanced with an ex post consumer performance tracking scheme implemented in a context of a virtual power plant aggregating load and generation units.

Abstract: The purpose of underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) is to maintain the frequency of an interconnected or island power system within permissible limits in case of severe power deficits. Thus, the proper performance of UFLS scheme is of great importance. In hybrid power systems, disconnecting and connecting the power generation sources and loads result in variations in the system parameters. Moreover, the output power of some distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaic (PV) or wind turbine generator (WTG), might change during the load shedding process. These factors may affect the performance of the load shedding scheme and decrease the reliability of power system. Hence, in this paper, a UFLS scheme is proposed that has two advantages: 1) it is independent of power system parameters; and 2) it considers power generation variations during the load shedding process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed load shedding method, simulation studies are carried out on a hybrid power system including PV, WTG, fuel cell, diesel generator, and battery energy storage system. Finally, the performance of the proposed method on a multiarea power system is evaluated.

Abstract: The customer domain of the smart grid naturally blends with smart home and smart building systems, but typical proposed approaches are "distributor-centric" rather than "customer-centric," undermining user acceptance, and are often poorly scalable. To solve this problem, we propose a detailed architecture and an implementation of a "last-meter" smart grid-the portion of the smart grid on customer premises-embedded in an internet-of-things (IoT) platform. Our approach has four aspects of novelty and advantages with respect to the state of the art: 1) seamless integration of smart grid with smart home applications in the same infrastructure; 2) data gathering from heterogeneous sensor communication protocols; 3) secure and customized data access; and 4) univocal sensor and actuator mapping to a common abstraction layer on which additional concurrent applications can be built. A demonstrator has been built and tested with purposely-developed ZigBee smart meters and gateways, a distributed IoT server, and a flexible user interface.

Abstract: This paper presents a rule-based approach using synchrophasor measurements for generating unit model validation and calibration. The proposed method utilizes frequency and three-phase voltage signals recorded by phasor measurement unit at the point of common coupling of unit transformers to the high voltage grid. In the simulation setup, by taking the hybrid data simulation technique in use, the signals are being injected to the subsystem of generating units through a voltage source, which models the truncated external grid. The measured and simulated active power oscillations are then compared to each other and the effects of generating unit parameters on the oscillation mismatches are extracted. The maximum amplitude and damping ratio of oscillations are two main aspects of the observed mismatches. To recognize the most effective parameters on these aspects, a sensitivity analysis technique is applied. Next, identified parameters are adjusted to calibrate the generating unit dynamic model. Finally, quantitative and qualitative perspectives of the proposed method are investigated through different sorts of actual disturbances. The obtained results demonstrate that the final calibrated model outperforms the existing one, and it can be used for power system planning and operation studies. Time domain simulations are performed by DIgSILENT power factory software.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of fractional order (FO) controllers for a microgrid. The microgrid employs various autonomous generation systems like wind turbine generator, solar photovoltaic, diesel energy generator, and fuel-cells. Other storage devices like the battery energy storage system and the flywheel energy storage system are also present in the power network. An FO control strategy is employed and the FO-proportional integral derivative (PID) controller parameters are tuned with a global optimization algorithm to meet system performance specifications. A kriging based surrogate modeling technique is employed to alleviate the issue of expensive objective function evaluation for the optimization based controller tuning. Numerical simulations are reported to prove the validity of the proposed methods. The results for both the FO and the integer order controllers are compared with standard evolutionary optimization techniques, and the relative merits and demerits of the kriging based surrogate modeling are discussed. This kind of optimization technique is not only limited to this specific case of microgrid control, but also can be ported to other computationally expensive power system optimization problems.

Abstract: In this paper, a goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) based controller is developed for the doubly-fed induction generator based wind farm to improve the system transient stability under fault conditions. The proposed controller is based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques to approximate the optimal control policy according to the interaction between the controller and the power plant. Compared to existing ADP approaches with one action network and one critic network, our GrHDP architecture introduces an additional network, i.e., the reference network, to form an internal goal/reward representation. This better mapping between the system state and the control action significantly improves the control performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated via two cases. The first case investigates a revised four-machine two-area system with high wind penetration and a static synchronous compensator. The second case is a practical size power system with wind farm in Liaoning Province in China. Detailed simulation analysis and comparative studies with traditional ADP approaches are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control strategy for coordinated operation of networked microgrids (MGs) in a distribution system. The distribution network operator (DNO) and each MG are considered as distinct entities with individual objectives to minimize the operation costs. It is assumed that both the dispatchable and nondispatchable distributed generators (DGs) exist in the networked MGs. In order to achieve the equilibrium among all entities and take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs, we formulate the problem as a stochastic bi-level problem with the DNO in the upper level and MGs in the lower level. Each level consists of two stages. The first stage is to determine base generation setpoints based on the load and nondispatchable DG output forecasts and the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based on the realized scenarios. A scenario reduction method is applied to enhance a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden. Case studies of a distribution system with multiple MGs of different types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The centralized control, deterministic formulation, and stochastic formulation are also compared.

Abstract: With the emerging area of smart grids, one critical challenge faced by administrators of wide-area measurement systems is to analyze and model streaming data with limited resources on their embedded controllers. Usually, streaming data can be modeled as a multiset where each data item has its own frequency. In this paper, we study the problem on how to generate histograms of data items based on their frequency, so we can identify various issues such as power line tripping or line faults under constraints. The primary challenge for achieving this goal using conventional methods is that keeping an individual counter for each unique type of data is too memory-consuming, slow, and costly. In this paper, we describe a novel data structure and its associated algorithms, called the loglog bloom filter, for this purpose. This data structure extends the classical bloom filter with a recent technique called probabilistic counting, so it can effectively generate histograms for streaming data in one pass with sub-linear overhead. Therefore, this method is suitable for data processing in smart grids, where limited computational resources are available on the controllers. We analyze the performance, trade-offs, and capacity of this data structure, and evaluate it with real data traces collected through the frequency disturbance recorders deployed for the FNET/GridEye infrastructure. We demonstrate that this method can identify the frequencies of all unique items with high accuracy and low memory overhead, so that data outliers can be conveniently identified.

Abstract: In this paper, a double-quadrant state-of-charge (SoC)-based droop control method for distributed energy storage system is proposed to reach the proper power distribution in autonomous dc microgrids. In order to prolong the lifetime of the energy storage units (ESUs) and avoid the overuse of a certain unit, the SoC of each unit should be balanced and the injected/output power should be gradually equalized. Droop control as a decentralized approach is used as the basis of the power sharing method for distributed energy storage units. In the charging process, the droop coefficient is set to be proportional to the nth order of SoC, while in the discharging process, the droop coefficient is set to be inversely proportional to the nth order of SoC. Since the injected/output power is inversely proportional to the droop coefficient, it is obtained that in the charging process the ESU with higher SoC absorbs less power, while the one with lower SoC absorbs more power. Meanwhile, in the discharging process, the ESU with higher SoC delivers more power and the one with lower SoC delivers less power. Hence, SoC balancing and injected/output power equalization can be gradually realized. The exponent n of SoC is employed in the control diagram to regulate the speed of SoC balancing. It is found that with larger exponent n, the balancing speed is higher. MATLAB/simulink model comprised of three ESUs is implemented and the simulation results are shown to verify the proposed approach.

Abstract: Load management is a challenging issue in microdistribution systems dealing with power utilities. To efficiently detect fraudulent and abnormal consumption, this paper proposes the use of fractional-order self-synchronization error-based Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) to detect nontechnical losses and outage events. Under the advanced metering infrastructure technique, the Sprott system is a feature extractor, which tracks the differences between profiled usages and irregular usages, such as illegal and fault events. Thus, fraudulent consumption, outages, and service restoration activities can be pointed out, randomly initiated, and terminated in a real-time application. Multiple FPNs-based making-decision systems are used to locate abnormalities. Computer simulations are conducted using an IEEE 30-bus power system and medium-scale microdistribution systems to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Smart grid is advancing power grids significantly, with higher power generation efficiency, lower energy consumption cost, and better user experience. Microgrid utilizes distributed renewable energy generation to reduce the burden on utility grids. This paper proposes an energy ecosystem; a cost-effective smart microgrid based on intelligent hierarchical agents with dynamic demand response (DR) and distributed energy resource (DER) management. With a dynamic update mechanism, DR automatically adapts to users' preference and varying external information. The DER management coordinates operations of micro combined heat and power systems (mu CHPs), and vanadium redox battery (VRB) according to DR decisions. A two-level shared cost-led mu CHPs management strategy is proposed to reduce energy consumption cost further. VRB discharging is managed to be environment-adaptive. Simulations and numerical results show the proposed system is very effective in reducing the energy consumption cost while satisfying user's preference.

Abstract: Accurate information about dynamic states is important for efficient control and operation of a power system. This paper compares the performance of four Bayesian-based filtering approaches in estimating dynamic states of a synchronous machine using phasor measurement unit data. The four methods are extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, ensemble Kalman filter, and particle filter. The statistical performance of each algorithm is compared using Monte Carlo methods and a two-area-four-machine test system. Under the statistical framework, robustness against measurement noise and process noise, sensitivity to sampling interval, and computation time are evaluated and compared for each approach. Based on the comparison, this paper makes some recommendations for the proper use of the methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the operation optimization for a microgrid (MG) aggregator, which can procure energy from various sources including the pool market and local distributed energy resources to serve MG customers. We assume that the MG aggregator sells electricity to customers at a predefined retail rate and it also offers customers various contracts for adjusting their loads. Our design objective is to determine the optimal hourly bids that the MG aggregator submits to the day-ahead market to maximize its profit. To deal with various uncertainties, a risk-constrained scenario-based stochastic programming framework is proposed where the MG aggregator's risk aversion is modeled using conditional value at risk method. The proposed formulation enables customers' demand response (DR) aggregation to be integrated into the operation of the MG aggregator via contractual agreements. This design is not only beneficial for both MG aggregator and customers, but also facilitates the operation of the system operator (SO), since a single entity (i.e., the MG aggregator) is visible to the SO instead of two separate entities (i.e., a MG aggregator and a DR aggregator). Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) programs are implemented to encourage consumers to reduce their electricity demand when needed, e.g., at peak-load hours, by adjusting their controllable load. In this paper, our focus is on controllable load types that are associated with dynamic systems and can be modeled using differential equations. Examples of such load types include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; water heating; and refrigeration. In this regard, we propose a new DR model based on a two-level differential game framework. At the beginning of each DR interval, the price is decided by the upper level (aggregator, utility, or market) given the total demand of users in the lower level. At the lower level, for each player (residential or commercial buildings that are equipped with automated load control systems and local renewable generators), given the price from the upper level, the electricity usage of air conditioning unit, and the battery storage charging/discharging schedules, are controlled in order to minimize the user's total electricity cost. The optimal user strategies are derived using the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also show that the proposed game can converge to a feedback Nash equilibrium. Based on the effect of real-time pricing on users' daily demand profile, the simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed game and show how we can optimize consumers' electricity cost in the presence of time-varying prices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the energy scheduling problem for a household equipped with a solar assisted heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, and water heating system in the real-time pricing environment. Our objective is to minimize the electricity cost while maintaining user's thermal comfort requirements. We consider different types of loads with different characteristics, detailed modeling of thermal dynamics, and uncertainty in electricity price and solar energy. The advantage of the proposed design lies in the exploitation of the solar assisted thermal system that can flexibly utilize the energy from the solar source or from the grid during low-price periods to support the home hot water demand, user thermal indoor temperature preference while reducing the electricity cost. We present numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. Specifically, we show that the proposed design can achieve significant cost saving, allow flexible tradeoff between user comfort tolerance and electricity cost reduction, and efficiently adjust the electricity consumption load profile. We also analyze the influence of solar assisted thermal system factors such as the water tank temperature limit, solar collector size, and weather condition on the achievable cost.

Abstract: Microgrid is a key enabling solution to future smart grids by integrating distributed renewable generators and storage systems to efficiently serve the local demand. However, due to the random and intermittent characteristics of renewable energy, new challenges arise for the reliable operation of microgrids. To address this issue, we study in this paper the real-time energy management for a single microgrid system that constitutes a renewable generation system, an energy storage system, and an aggregated load. We model the renewable energy offset by the load over time, termed net energy profile, to be practically predictable, but with finite errors that can be arbitrarily distributed. We aim to minimize the total energy cost (modeled as sum of time-varying strictly convex functions) of the conventional energy drawn from the main grid over a finite horizon by jointly optimizing the energy charged/discharged to/from the storage system over time subject to practical load and storage constraints. To solve this problem in real time, we propose a new off-line optimization approach to devise the online algorithm. In this approach, we first assume that the net energy profile is perfectly predicted or known ahead of time, under which we derive the optimal off-line energy scheduling solution in closed-form. Next, inspired by the optimal off-line solution, we propose a sliding-window based online algorithm for real-time energy management under the practical setup of noisy predicted net energy profile with arbitrary errors. Finally, we conduct simulations based on the real wind generation data of the Ireland power system to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, as compared with other heuristically designed algorithms, as well as the conventional dynamic programming based solution.

Abstract: Global warming and environmental pollution concerns have promoted dramatic integrations of renewable energy sources all over the world. Associated with benefits of environmental conservation, essentially uncertain and variable characteristics of such energy resources significantly challenge the operation of power systems. In order to implement reliable and economical operations, a robust energy and reserve dispatch (RERD) model is proposed in this paper, in which the operating decisions are divided into pre-dispatch and re-dispatch. A robust feasibility constraint set is imposed on pre-dispatch variables, such that operation constraints can be recovered by adjusting re-dispatch after wind generation realizes. The model is extended to more general dispatch decision making problems involving uncertainties in the framework of adjustable robust optimization. By revealing the convexity of the robust feasibility constraint set, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming based oracle is presented to verify the robust feasibility of pre-dispatch decisions. A cutting plane algorithm is established to solve associated optimization problems. The proposed model and method are applied to a five-bus system as well as a realistic provincial power grid in China. Numeric experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective and efficient.

Abstract: An average absolute frequency deviation value based active islanding detection technique is proposed in this paper. The inverter's classical q-axis current controller is modeled with a continuous periodic reference current of a small value. During the loss of mains, the island's frequency deviates with respect to the variation in the reference current; this is detected by making the use of an average absolute frequency deviation value. In case of a stable island formation, there is a small periodic frequency deviation owing to the small value of the periodic reference current, and the frequency deviation is so small that it falls inside the nondetection zone (NDZ) of the frequency relay. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it detects the stable island formation but without forcing the island to lose its stable operation. In case of nonislanding switching events, which may transiently impose a significant deviation in the frequency, the possibility of false detection is eliminated by reconfirming the occurrence of islanding once it is suspected. The reference current is kept to a small value to limit the degradation of the power quality and the power factor. Computer simulation is done with MATLAB.

Abstract: Neighborhood area network (NAN) is one of the most important sections in smart grid communications. It connects residential customers as part of a two-way communication infrastructure responsible for transmitting power grid sensing and measuring status, as well as the control messages. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective, flexible, and sustainable NAN design using wireless technologies such as IEEE 802.11s and IEEE 802.16, as well as renewable energy such as solar power. We propose an optimization problem to minimize total cost. To solve the problem, we also study the problem of selecting the optimal number of gateways in a NAN. Moreover, in order to achieve fairness for the customers and to meet the most critical latency requirements, we propose geographical deployment methods for gateway data aggregate points (DAPs). Different transmission power of each gateway DAP is also carefully determined for the fairness, as well as for the maximum power efficiency. Unlike other researches using game theoretical approaches in multiaccess systems, we manage to achieve the global optimum solution and our results are more energy efficient.

Abstract: Demand response plays an important role in the development of the smart grid, which can effectively manage society's energy consumption. Cooling devices, such as refrigerators and freezers, are ideal devices for demand-response programs because their energy states can be controlled without reducing the lifestyle and comfort of the residents. Conversely, managing air conditioning and space heating would affect a resident's comfort level. Direct compressor control and thermostat control methods have been proposed in the past for controlling cooling devices but they are never studied concurrently. This paper proposes a new control mechanism and compares the effectiveness of the three control mechanisms for cooling devices in demand response. In addition, this paper illustrates the need for a damping strategy to mitigate demand oscillations that occur from synchronous fleet control.

Abstract: This paper presents mathematical optimization models of produce storage facilities to optimize the operation of their energy systems in the context of smart grids. In the storage facilities, climate control of the storage rooms consumes considerable energy; thus, in this paper, a mathematical model of storage facilities appropriate for their optimal operation is developed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing climate controllers. The proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing climate control systems in storage facilities. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of storage facilities, i.e., inside temperature and humidity should be kept within acceptable ranges. The performance of the proposed model for various electricity prices and weather conditions and their variations are studied via Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.

Abstract: Generator coherency identification is establishing itself as an important task to aid in the resistance of cascading failures within wide-area power systems and as a necessary preprocessing stage in real-time control for transient stability. Inspired by flocking behavior in nature, we propose a novel multiflock-based technique to identify generator coherence rapidly within a short observation window. Our measurement-based approach transforms generator data from the observation space to an information space, whereby the generator frequencies and phases characterize the movement and dynamics of boids within multiple flocks. Analysis of the boids' trajectories enables the discrimination of multiple flocks corresponding to coherent generator clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique to identify generator coherency rapidly while exhibiting robustness to environmental noise and cyber attack on the 39-bus New England test system and a modified IEEE 118-Bus test system.

Abstract: In the presence of distributed generation (DG), it is important to assure a fast and reliable protection system for the distribution network to avoid unintentional DG disconnection during fault conditions. In this paper, dual setting directional over-current relays are proposed for protecting meshed distribution systems with DG. Dual setting relays are equipped with two inverse time-current characteristics whose settings will depend on the fault direction. The protection coordination problem for the dual setting directional relay is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem where the objective is to minimize the overall time of operation of relays during primary and backup operation. The proposed protection coordination scheme using dual setting relays is compared against the conventional approach, which relies on the conventional one setting directional relay. The proposed scheme is applied to the power distribution network of the IEEE 30-bus system equipped with synchronous and inverter-based DG. The results show that the proposed protection coordination scheme with dual setting relay can significantly reduce the overall relay operating time, making it an attractive option for distribution systems with DG.

Abstract: As a consequence of the developments in electric transportation and the evolution toward smart grids, large-scale deployment of smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) becomes feasible. This leads to opportunities for different market parties to use the flexibility of EVs for various objectives that may be conflicting and result in a nonoptimal shifting of peak demands for the distribution grids. In this paper, we assess the financial impact of various EV charging strategies on distribution grids. We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads (from a network operators perspective) with a strategy to minimize charging costs (from the perspective of a commercial party). In a scenario with a high wind penetration in the system, the electricity prices are, for a significant part, determined by the instantaneous wind production. Therefore, we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and, consequently, on the resulting EV load and network impacts. We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value (NPV) of the investments costs and energy losses. We found that, in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices, the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25% higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized. The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration. The results strongly suggest that the situation where EVs are controlled with a strategy to minimize charging costs that does not take the distribution grids into account may not lead to an optimal situation when the entire electricity delivery system is regarded.

Abstract: Recently, distributed energy resources (DERs) are becoming more attractive to supply local loads under concept of microgrids. These new parts of the power system have basically different dynamics compared with conventional power plants (CPPs). Some of them do not have any rotating inertia and most of them are connected to the grid by power electronic interfaces. Stability and control of microgrids and the entire power system containing DERs and CPPs is one of the most important challenges of the recent power systems. Interactions between microgrids in grid-connected mode and CPPs should be coordinated to ensure and improve the stability of power system. In this paper, the effect of the increased penetration of DERs on the load frequency problem of power system is studied. Basically, synchronous generators of CPPs determine the dynamic behavior of power system for frequency control and are responsible to compensate load changes of the system. With the high penetration of DERs, these new parts can contribute in the frequency control. It is shown that with appropriate control of DERs in microgrids, the frequency deviation of the power system will decrease and the stability margin can be increased.

Abstract: Energy storage systems (ESSs) are often proposed to support the frequency control in microgrid systems. Due to the intermittency of the renewable generation and constantly changing load demand, the charging/discharging of various ESSs in an autonomous microgrid needs to be properly coordinated to ensure the supply-demand balance. Recent research has discovered that the charging/discharging efficiency of ESSs has remarkable dependence on the charging/discharging rate and state-of-charge of the ESS. This paper proposes a distributed cooperative control strategy for coordinating the ESSs to maintain the supply-demand balance and minimize the total power loss associated with charging/discharging inefficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation results.

Abstract: Smart grid, as the next power grid, can efficiently monitor, predicate, and control energy generation/consumption by using the real-time users' electricity information. However, the fine-grained user energy consumption information may reveal the private information of the user. In this paper, we construct a linkable anonymous credential protocol based on Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signature. Then, we propose a privacy preserving smart metering scheme based on the new linkable anonymous credential. In addition to providing privacy protection for the user, our protocol also has the security properties of message authentication and traceability of fault smart metering. And there are some other useful features in our protocol, such as no need of trust-third party, dynamic users' enrollment and revocation, and complex statistical analysis of the energy use information. The computation cost and communication overhead of our scheme is O(1), which is independent of the user number. The simulation results show that our scheme is efficient.

Abstract: Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are being rapidly deployed in power grids due to their high sampling rates and synchronized measurements. The devices high data reporting rates present major computational challenges in the requirement to process potentially massive volumes of data, in addition to new issues surrounding data storage. Fast algorithms capable of processing massive volumes of data are now required in the field of power systems. This paper presents a novel parallel detrended fluctuation analysis (PDFA) approach for fast event detection on massive volumes of PMU data, taking advantage of a cluster computing platform. The PDFA algorithm is evaluated using data from installed PMUs on the transmission system of Great Britain from the aspects of speedup, scalability, and accuracy. The speedup of the PDFA in computation is initially analyzed through Amdahl's Law. A revision to the law is then proposed, suggesting enhancements to its capability to analyze the performance gain in computation when parallelizing data intensive applications in a cluster computing environment.

Abstract: A suitable networked control scheme and its stability analysis framework have been developed for controlling inherent electromechanical oscillatory dynamics observed in power systems. It is assumed that the feedback signals are obtained at locations away from the controller/actuator and transmitted over a communication network with the help of phasor measurement units (PMUs). Within the generic framework of networked control system (NCS), the evolution of power system dynamics and associated control actions through a communication network have been modeled as a hybrid system. The data delivery rate has been modeled as a stochastic process. The closed-loop stability analysis framework has considered the limiting probability of data dropout in computing the stability margin. The contribution is in quantifying allowable data-dropout limit for a specified closed loop performance. The research findings are useful in specifying the requirement of communication infrastructure and protocol for operating future smart grids.

Abstract: In this paper, the economic viability and profitability of a newly emerging storage technology, i.e., cryogenic energy storage (CES), is investigated. A real-time optimal dispatching algorithm is proposed and developed to optimally dispatch a privately owned CES unit to generate revenue by exploiting arbitrage opportunities in the day-ahead/week-ahead electricity market. Due to its special characteristics, CES can provide significantly more financial and technical benefits in a weekly scheduling compared with common daily scheduling. The electricity price modulation is proposed as a new approach to competitively offer subsidy by the utility regulator to CES owners to fill the gap between current and a stable expected rate of return. Using real-world price data from the Ontario wholesale electricity market, the method is validated. The results reveal significant benefits of weekly usage as compared to daily usage of CES. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed approach to subsidize CES owners are validated through simulation studies.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach to incorporate voltage source converter-based embedded HVDC for improving power system economic dispatch efficiency is proposed. An analytical formulation is presented to quantify the economic benefits of embedded HVDC by modeling its flow control as an injection-extraction pair in the economic dispatch of the transmission grid. A computationally efficient algorithm is proposed to rank the potential locations of such embedded HVDC. The algorithm is based on expected economic dispatch cost reduction weighted by the historical line shadow prices. The use of a distribution of historical data as a means of weighting also allows for incorporation of diurnal and seasonal influences on congestion patterns. Numerical case studies using the proposed method of locating the embedded HVDC suggest promising results in choosing the location of improved flow control devices.

Abstract: Smart meters, designed for information collection and system monitoring in smart grid, report fine-grained power consumption to utility providers. With these highly accurate profiles of energy usage, however, it is possible to identify consumers' specific activities or behavior patterns, thereby giving rise to serious privacy concerns. This paper addresses these concerns by designing a cost-effective and privacy-preserving energy management technique that uses a rechargeable battery. From a holistic perspective, a dynamic programming framework is designed for consumers to strike a tradeoff between smart meter data privacy and the cost of electricity. In general, a major challenge in solving dynamic programming problems lies in the need for the knowledge of future electricity consumption events. By exploring the underlying structure of the original problem, an equivalent problem is derived, which can be solved by using only the current observations. An online control algorithm is then developed to solve the equivalent problem based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. It is shown that without the knowledge of the statistics of the time-varying load requirements and the electricity price processes, the proposed online control algorithm, parametrized by a positive value V, is within O(1/V) of the optimal solution to the original problem, where the maximum value of V is limited by the battery capacity. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through extensive numerical analysis using real data.

Abstract: The concept of dynamic rating (DR) implies that the capacity of a component varies dynamically as a function of external parameters, while the rating traditionally is based on the worst-case. The value of DR thus lies in utilizing existing equipment to a greater extent. By implementing DR and correlating the new ratings with wind power generation, more generation can be implemented. The aim is hence to facilitate connection of renewable electricity production. This paper provides two main contributions: 1) a general dynamic line rating (DLR) calculation model on overhead lines; and 2) an economic optimization simulation model regarding wind power integration comparing DLR with more traditional approaches. These models can both be implemented together, but also separately. The DLR calculation model is easy to use by companies in daily operation where the dynamic line capacity is calculated as a function of static line capacity, wind speed, and ambient temperature. The DLR calculation model is furthermore compared with more comprehensive calculations that validate that the model is accurate enough. This paper also provides an application study where both proposed models are exemplified together and evaluated. Results from this study conclude that it is a significant economic potential of implementing DR within wind power integration.

Abstract: In order to study the impact of dynamic demand response in the future smart grid, we examine in an abstract framework how a tradeoff between efficiency and risk arises under different market architectures. We first examine the system performance under noncooperative and cooperative market architectures. The statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes show that, although the noncooperative load scheduling scheme leads to an efficiency loss, the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail, resulting in less frequent aggregate demand spikes. Cooperative dynamic demand response, on the other hand, makes the market place more efficient at the cost of increased risk of aggregate demand spikes. The market architecture determines the locus of the system performance with respect to the tradeoff curve. We also investigate how a properly designed real-time electricity pricing mechanism can help the system operator achieve a target tradeoff between efficiency and risk in a noncooperative market. We further provide a convex characterization of the Pareto front of system performance measures, which serves as a benchmark of the tradeoffs for the system operator to evaluate the pricing rules.

Abstract: Traditional proportional integral (PI) control has been extensively used for power control of voltage source converters in microgrid systems. Previous studies show that fixed-gain PI controllers cannot easily adapt to power changes, disturbances, and parameters variation, especially in large microgrids; hence the need for continuous algorithms to adjust the controller gains over the transients cannot be neglected. In this paper, a novel online tuning algorithm for PI controllers is proposed and implemented in a microgrid system. In this algorithm, which is based on the neuro-dynamic programming concept, a fuzzy critic is employed to evaluate the credibility of the control system performance and provide an evaluation signal, which is then used in the gain-tuning process. The PI controller gains are updated in an optimization process based on steepest decent rule so that the evaluation signal produced by the critic is minimized. The developed control structure, which is named critic-based self-tuning PI controller, is tested in a microgrid system with different penetrations of distributed generators and operational scenarios. The simulation results verify that implementation of a heuristic gain-tuning algorithm results in a model-independent controller with increased adaptivity compared with conventional PI control. Furthermore, due to simple learning rules, the convergence time is significantly reduced and the transient response is improved. The proposed gain-tuning algorithm can also be applied to PI controllers in other applications of controllable systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the real-time control and energy management of a dc microgrid incorporating hybrid energy sources with various loading schemes. In the proposed dc microgrid, a supercapacitor bank, a power buffer, and a pulse load are directly connected to a dc bus. The proposed system configuration highly improves the grid redundancy and reduces the total power losses. Moreover, the supercapacitor bank not only supplies the pulse load, but also supports the grid during transient periods when it is highly loaded. However, the energy management and control of such a system is more complex, since the heavy pulse load can cause high power pulsation and voltage drop. To reduce the adverse effects of the pulse load, a new real-time energy management system (EMS) with an adaptive energy calculator (AEC) based on the moving average measurement technique is developed. The proposed microgrid was implemented in hardware and experimentally tested. The results were compared with other methods, such as direct voltage control and continuous current averaging approaches. The results show that the developed EMS with AEC technique properly share the power and control the bus voltage under different loading conditions, while the adverse effects of the pulse load are highly reduced.

Abstract: Two problems are tackled in this paper: determining the active demand reduction potential of wet appliances and making time series estimates from project data. The former is an application of the latter. Household groups representative to the average population are defined by applying expectation maximization clustering to a representative measurement set (n = 1363). Attitudes toward active demand are found by conducting a survey (n = 418). Project data (n = 58) containing wet appliance measurements are scaled up by adapting the clustering algorithm, spreading the electricity demand of the wet appliances over the clusters. The potential for active demand reduction with wet appliances is 4% of the total residential power demand, assuming that 29% of the households take part. The potential is in the order of magnitude of the power reserves, but does not fulfill availability and response time requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for autonomous (islanded) operation of an electronically interfaced distributed generation unit and its load. In the grid-connected mode, the voltage-sourced converter is operated in the active and reactive power (PQ) control mode, where a conventional control scheme is used to control the active and reactive power exchange with the grid. In the islanded mode, the proposed FLC is used to control the voltage of the islanded system despite the load variability and uncertainties. In addition, this paper also presents the use of the black-box nonlinear optimization technique to tune the parameters of the membership functions of the FLC in order to achieve optimal performance. The salient features of the proposed FLC are: 1) efficient to deal with the nonlinear systems; 2) design does not depend on the mathematical model of the system; and 3) less sensitive to the parameters variation than the conventional controllers. The frequency of the islanded system is dictated through the use of an internal oscillator. The effectiveness of the proposed FLC in controlling the voltage of the islanded system, irrespective of the load variability, is extensively validated based on simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment. Moreover, the paper highlights the superiority of the proposed FLC over the conventional proportional-integral controllers through comparing the transient responses of the system based on both controllers.

Abstract: Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) seeks to determine the operation of individual loads in a building strictly from measurements made on an aggregate current signal serving a collection of loads. Great strides have been made in performing NILM for loads whose operating state can be represented by a finite-state machine, i.e., loads that consume discrete or distinct power levels for periods of time. It is much more difficult to track the operation of continuously variable loads that demand ever-changing power. These loads are becoming more prevalent as variable speed drives, daylight-responsive lighting, and other power electronic controlled loads emerge on the grid. This paper demonstrates a method for tracking the power consumption of variable demand loads nonintrusively. The method applies to any site where NILM might be of interest, including commercial and industrial buildings, residences, and transportation systems.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) can be effectively integrated with the power grid through vehicle-to-grid (V2G). V2G has been proven to reduce the EV owner cost, support the power grid, and generate revenues for the EV owner. Due to regulatory and physical considerations, aggregators are necessary for EVs to participate in electricity markets. The aggregator combines the capacities of many EVs and bids their aggregated capacity into electricity markets. In this paper, an optimal bidding of ancillary services coordinated across different markets, namely regulation and spinning reserves, is proposed. This coordinated bidding considers electricity market uncertainties using fuzzy optimization. The electricity market parameters are forecasted using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The fuzzy set theory is used to model the uncertainties in the forecasted data of the electricity market, such as ancillary service prices and their deployment signals. Simulations are performed on a hypothetical group of 10 000 EVs in the electric reliability council of Texas electricity markets. The results show the benefit of the proposed fuzzy algorithm compared with previously proposed deterministic algorithms that do not consider market uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new fault current limiting dynamic voltage restorer (FCL-DVR) concept. The new topology uses a crowbar bidirectional thyristor switch across the output terminals of a conventional back-to-back DVR. In the event of a load short, the DVR controller will deactivate the faulty phase of the DVR and activate its crowbar thyristor to insert the DVR filter reactor into the grid to limit the fault current. A fault condition is detected by sensing the load current and its rate of change. The FCL-DVR will operate with different protection strategies under different fault conditions. Design of the FCL-DVR involves selecting important parameters, such as DVR power rating, dc link voltage of the DVR, output filter reactors and capacitors, and grid-tied transformers is proposed. The design methodology of the proposed FCL-DVR is fully discussed based on power systems computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including dc (EMTDC) simulation. A scaled-down experimental verification is also carried out. Both modeling and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the new FCL-DVR concept for performing both voltage compensation and fault current limiting functions.

Abstract: The concept of electric spring (ES) has been proposed recently as an effective means of distributed voltage control. The idea is to regulate the voltage across the critical (C) loads while allowing the noncritical (NC) impedance-type loads (e.g., water heaters) to vary their power consumption and thus contribute to demand-side response. In this paper, a comparison is made between distributed voltage control using ES against the traditional single point control with STATic COMpensator (STATCOM). For a given range of supply voltage variation, the total reactive capacity required for each option to produce the desired voltage regulation at the point of connection is compared. A simple case study with a single ES and STATCOM is presented first to show that the ES and STATCOM require comparable reactive power to achieve similar voltage regulation. Comparison between a STATCOM and ES is further substantiated through similar case studies on the IEEE 13-bus test feeder system and also on a part of the distribution network in Sha Lo Wan Bay, Hong Kong. In both cases, it turns out that a group of ESs achieves better total voltage regulation than STATCOM with less overall reactive power capacity. Dependence of the ES capability on proportion of critical and NC load is also shown.

Abstract: The energy exchange between microgrids (MGs) that are capable of generating power from renewable energy sources in smart grids is investigated. As MGs are autonomous and have control over their energy exchange, prospect theory is a useful tool to provide a user-centric view on MG power trading. More specifically, in this paper, the energy exchange among MGs that are also connected to a power plant as a backup energy supply is formulated as a prospect theory-based static game and Nash equilibria are provided under various scenarios. The impact of user objective weight is evaluated during the outcome evaluation on the performance of the game. Simulation results show that user subjectivity tends to exaggerate selling and buying probabilities when battery levels are high (and low), and thus decreases the overall utility and increases the amount of the energy bought at either low battery levels or low MG selling prices. Conditions on the pricing system to ensure that the energy exchange system is not impacted by the subjective view of MGs are also provided.

Abstract: Technical innovation in power distribution networks is pointing toward a decentralized control vision to deal with the issues in design and operations related to distributed energy resources. Thus, decentralized approaches to power flow management (PFM) are of significant importance from the distributed network operator (DNO) perspective. In this paper, a new hybrid distributed control approach is proposed to deal with thermal overload issues. The control algorithm is based on constraint satisfaction problem that is applied to solve the network constraint problem. The novelty of this control approach consists in the joint control of both distributed generation and demand response units for PFM in an autonomous regional control environment. The implementation of this demand-side management, integrated active network management, and distributed control technique contributes to network reinforcement deferral, economy of supply, and efficient capital expenditure. Simulation has been implemented in a medium voltage interconnected test network with a substation controller and a network simulator. The control actions successfully achieve the desired objectives and are evaluated in comparison analysis. This new hybrid distributed control technique has potential to benefit the DNO planning and operation activities in the development of future decentralized smart grids.

Abstract: It is expected that the use of cognitive radio for smart grid communication will be indispensable in near future. Recently, IETF has standardized RPL (routing protocol for low power and lossy networks), which is expected to be the standard routing protocol for majority of applications including advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Our objective in this paper is to enhance RPL for cognitive radio enabled AMI networks. Our enhanced protocol provides novel modifications to RPL in order to address the routing challenges in cognitive radio environments along with protecting the primary users as well as meeting the utility requirements of secondary network. System level performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of proposed protocol as a viable solution for practical cognitive AMI networks.

Abstract: Energy storage devices (ESDs) have the potential to revolutionize the electricity grid by allowing the smoothing of variable-energy generator output and the time-shifting of demand away from peak times. A common approach to study the impact of ESDs on energy systems is by modeling them as electric circuits in simulations. Although recent circuit models are becoming more accurate, to obtain statistically valid results, extensive simulations need to be run. In some cases, existing datasets are not large enough to obtain statistically significant results. The impact of ESDs on energy systems has also been recently studied using analytical methods, but usually by assuming ideal ESD behavior, such as infinite ESD charging and discharging rates, and zero self-discharge. However, real-life ESDs are far from ideal. We investigate the effect of nonideal ESD behavior on system performance, presenting an analytical ESD model that retains much of the simplicity of an ideal ESD, yet captures many (though not all) nonideal behaviors for a class of ESDs that includes all battery technologies and compressed air energy storage systems. This allows us to compute performance bounds for systems with nonideal ESDs using standard teletraffic techniques. We provide performance results for five widely used ESD technologies and show that our models can closely approximate numerically computed performance bounds.
