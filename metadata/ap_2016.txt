Abstract: Rice straw was subjected to fungal pretreatment using Pleurotus ostreatus and Trichoderma reesei to improve its biodegradability and methane production via solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD). Effects of moisture content (65%, 75% and 85%), and incubation time (10, 20 and 30 d) on lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose degradation during fungal pretreatment and methane yield during anaerobic digestion were assessed via comparison to untreated rice straw. Pretreatment with P. ostreatus was most effective at 75% moisture content and 20 d incubation resulting in 33.4% lignin removal and a lignin/cellulose removal ratio (selectivity) of 4.2. In comparison Trichoderma reesei was most effective at 75% moisture content and 20 d incubation resulting in 23.6% lignin removal and a lignin/cellulose removal ratio (selectivity) of 2.88. The corresponding methane yields were 263 and 214 L/kg volatile solids (VS), which were 120% and 78.3% higher than for the untreated rice straw, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of various discharge rates on the thermal (temperature and heat generation profiles) and electrical performance of the Li-ion battery for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. For this, a prismatic Li-ion phosphate (LiFePO4) battery with 20 Ah capacity is tested under constant current discharge rates of C/10, C/5, C/2, 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C and surface temperatures and voltage distributions during both charging and discharging are measured. In addition, IR images were also captured during experiments with a Flir Therma CAM S60 IR camera at various discharge rates and are reported in this study. Furthermore, a thermal model is created and validated for a particular battery using a MATLAB Simulink in terms of temperature, voltage, heat generation, and internal resistance. The results of this study demonstrate that the increased C-rates from C/10 to 4C result in increased temperatures on the principal surface of the battery. Also, at the lower discharge rates (below 1C), the surface temperature remains close to the ambient temperature, but at higher discharge rates (above 1C); the surface temperature quickly increases for all C-rates. The most noteworthy surface temperature distribution is observed to be 58.1 degrees C towards the end of 4C discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, the cooling performance of a two-stage thermoelectric module (TEM) under pulse current operation was experimentally investigated. A commercial module TEC2-25507 was selected as the tested TTEM and a water-cooled heat sink was used. The impacts of main operation parameters on the TTEM cold side temperature were examined, including inlet water temperature and flow rate, pulse current amplitude, pulse current duration and heat load. The experimental results indicated that those parameters significantly affected the transient characteristics of the TTEM cold side temperature, such as the supercooling effect and the temperature overshoot. Especially, the amplitude and the duration of the pulse current play key roles in determining the TTEM cold side temperature. Moreover, when subjected to cyclic pulse currents, the cold side temperature profile during the first pulse current determines those during the subsequent pulse currents. The experimental results obtained in this study can provide a basis for developing TTEM applications under pulse current operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper describes the process of developing a technology roadmap for deploying bioenergy technologies at a country level. A method for energy technology roadmapping adapted to the conditions of developing countries is proposed. This method combines an acknowledged roadmapping framework from prior art, a new strategy to build consensus based on the Delphi method and a strong focus on analytical modeling for supporting expert judgment. This method aims to be simple, transparent and affordable. The proposed method is applied to Colombia for creating a plan to deploy sustainable bioenergy technologies in Colombia until 2030. This plan consists of a set of long-term goals, milestones, barriers and action items identified by over 30 experts for key bioenergy technology areas (viz. bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, biomethane, biogas, waste-to-energy and power generation and combined heat and power). Finally, the relevance of the process of developing a technology roadmap for bioenergy exploitation in Colombia in other developing countries is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Empirical evidence from recent studies suggests that the price premium on energy-efficient buildings is potentially higher than the pure capitalisation of energy savings but the empirical evidence on the size of the non-savings components is scant. This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating whether the mandatory energy efficiency ratings for residential properties imply benefits that go beyond energy savings. Using a sample of several thousand apartment transactions from Helsinki, Finland, we first test if higher ratings were significantly associated with higher prices. In addition to a large number of property and neighbourhood characteristics, this dataset contains information on building-level energy usage which allows us to distinguish between the cost savings effect of energy consumption and the value of more intangible factors associated with the energy label. The hedonic model yields a statistically significant 3.3% price premium for apartments in the top three energy-efficiency categories and 1.5% when a set of detailed, neighbourhood characteristics are included. When maintenance costs containing energy usage costs are added, a robust and significant price premium of 1.3% persists whereas no differentiation is found for the medium and lower rating categories. These findings may be indicative of energy-efficient buildings having signalling value - and therefore an additional incentive to invest in such buildings - for 'green' consumers. However, a favourable energy rating did not appear to speed up the sales process in the analysed market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study aims to assess the environmental impacts related to the provision of 1 kWh to the grid from wind power in Europe and to suggest how life cycle assessment can inform technology development and system planning. Four representative power plants onshore (with 2.3 and 3.2 MW turbines) and offshore (4.0 and 6.0 MW turbines) with 2015 state-of-the-art technology data provided by Siemens Wind Power were assessed. The energy payback time was found to be less than 1 year for all technologies. The emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to less than 7 g CO2-eq/kWh for onshore and 11 g CO2-eq/kWh for offshore. Climate change impacts were found to be a good indicator for overall hotspot identification however attention should also be drawn to human toxicity and impacts from respiratory inorganics. The overall higher impact of offshore plants, compared to onshore ones, is mainly due to larger high impact material requirements for capital infrastructure. In both markets the bigger turbines with more advanced direct drive generator technology is shown to perform better than the smaller geared ones. Capital infrastructure is the most impactful life cycle stage across impacts. It accounts for more than 79% and 70% of climate change impacts onshore and offshore respectively. The end-of-life treatment could lead to significant savings due to recycling, ca. 20-30% for climate change. In the manufacturing stage the impacts due to operations at the case company do not exceed 1% of the total life cycle impacts. This finding highlights the shared responsibility across multiple stakeholders and calls for collaborative efforts for comprehensive environmental management across organizations in the value chain. Real life examples are given in order to showcase how LCA results can inform decisions, e.g. for concept and product development and supply chain management. On a systems level the results can be used by energy planners when comparing with alternative energy sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High purity H-2 was produced by a novel low-energy sorption enhanced steam methane reforming process by introducing a second loop in order to provide part of the required heat for the endothermic sorbent calcination in the regeneration stage. The feasibility of the intensified reforming process was demonstrated experimentally over a mixture of a bifunctional NiO-based oxygen transfer material/ reforming catalyst supported on ZrO2, and a ZrO2-promoted CaO-based CO2 sorbent. The experiments were performed in a bench-scale fixed bed reactor unit. The influence of operating parameters, such as reformer's temperature, steam/methane and NiO/CaO molar ratios and space velocity of the feed stream, was investigated in order to determine the optimum operating conditions and assess the full potential of the combined process over the two solids. The presence of the CO2 sorbent in the reactor facilitated H-2 production of high purity. Equilibrium concentrations were obtained over all studied conditions, even at very high space velocities. The process was further demonstrated with a continuous cyclic test of 20 reforming/regeneration cycles at a temperature of 650 degrees C. The CO2 sorbent and the oxygen transfer material exhibited excellent stability without deterioration in performance for 20 consecutive cycles, corresponding to more than 60 h of testing. H-2 concentration over 95% was achieved throughout the sorbent's prebreakthrough region during the reduction/reforming/carbonation stage. During the reoxidation/calcination step, the highly exothermic Ni oxidation provided adequate heat to raise the temperature of the solids and decompose up to 45% of the saturated sorbent without external heating.

Abstract: As global warming intensifies, the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases have attracted great global attention. However, questions regarding whether, how and to what extent demographic factors and processes affect carbon emissions have not yet been fully explained particularly in China. This study used an improved STIRPAT model to reassess the impact of demographic and income changes on China's energy-related CO2 emissions at the national and regional levels using balanced provincial panel data from the 1990-2012 period. Whereas most previous studies of emission population/income elasticity in China have yielded wide-ranging estimates, this study showed that income rather than demographic change has been the dominant driving force behind China's growing CO2 emissions. Urbanisation has increased energy consumption and emissions, except in western China. Changes in the age structure have had a statistically insignificant effect on energy use, but resulted in increased national emissions particularly in eastern China. Shrinking household size did not reduce energy use and emissions, indicating that improved residential energy efficiency might reduce emissions. Changing the traditional mode of economic growth, reasonable controlling the pace of urbanisation, improving energy efficiency and upgrading industrial structures may yet be necessary to mitigate the environmental impact of human activities in China.

Abstract: The PEFC has emerged as the most viable fuel cell type for automotive and some portable applications, and also has potential back-up power unit applications due to its low operating temperature, comparative simplicity of construction, high power density, and ease of operation. In spite of tremendous scientific advances, as well as engineering progress over the last few decades, the commercialization of PEFCs remains unrealized, owing primarily to economic viability associated with the high prices of materials and components and technical problems relating primarily to water management. The difficulty in addressing the water management issues lies mostly in the two-phase multi-component flow involving phase-change in porous media, coupled heat and mass transfer, interactions between the porous layers and gas channel (GC) and the complex relationship between water content and cell performance. Due to the low temperature of operation, water generated by the electrochemical reactions often condenses into liquid form, potentially flooding the gas diffusion layer (GDL), GC or other components. Insight into the fundamental processes of liquid water evolution and transport is still lacking, preventing further enhanced PEFC development.
The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive introduction to PEFC modeling inside GCs and GDLs, with a focus on two-phase flow and related phase-change and transport processes. Relevant momentum, mass and heat transport processes are introduced and the microstructural effects on the transport processes inside the porous GDL are extensively discussed.
The selection of a computational approach, for the two-phase flow within a GDL or GC, for example, should be based on the computational resources available, concerns about time and scale (microscale, cell scale, stack scale or system scale), as well as accuracy requirements. One important feature, included in some computational approaches, is the possibility to track the front between the liquid and the gas phases. To build a PEFC model, one must make a large number of assumptions. Some assumptions have a negligible effect on the results and reliability of the model. However, other assumptions may significantly affect the result. It is strongly recommended in any modeling paper to clearly state the assumptions being implemented, for others to be able to judge the work.
It is important to note that a large fraction of the expressions that presently are used to describe the transport processes inside PEFC GDLs were originally developed to describe significantly different systems, such as sand or rocks. Moreover, the flow pattern maps and pressure drop correlations of two phase flow in micro channels may not be applicable for GCs due to one side wall being porous, with the resulting interaction between the GDL and GC.

Abstract: Both linear and nonlinear models 'have been proposed for forecasting the power output of photovoltaic systems. Linear models are simple to implement but less flexible. Due to the stochastic nature of the power output of PV systems, nonlinear models tend to provide better forecast than linear models. Motivated by this, this paper suggests a fairly simple nonlinear regression model known as multivariate adaptive regression" splines (MARS), as an alternative to forecasting of solar power output. The MARS model is a data-driven modeling approach without any assumption about the relationship between the power output and predictors. It maintains simplicity of the classical multiple linear regression (MLR) model while possessing the capability of handling nonlinearity. It is simpler in format than other nonlinear models such as ANN, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), classification and regression tree (CART), and support vector machine (SVM). The MARS model was applied on the daily output of a grid-connected 2.1 kW PV system to provide the 1-day-ahead mean daily forecast of the power output. The comparisons with a wide variety of forecast models show that the MARS model is able to provide reliable forecast performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The massive introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into low voltage (LV) distribution networks will lead to several problems, such as: increase of energy losses, decrease of distribution transformer lifetime, lines and transformer overload issues, voltage drops and unbalances. In this context, this paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization algorithm in order to reduce the mentioned problems. At the same time, users' interests in terms of charging cost and privacy have been taken into account. The proposed multi-objective optimization is based on minimizing the load variance and charging costs by using the weighted sum method and fuzzy control. The use of vehicle to grid (V2G) concept and load forecast uncertainties have been also considered. Furthermore, an innovative method for mitigating voltage unbalances has been developed. The effectiveness of this methodology has been tested using real data of a LV distribution network, located in Borup (Denmark). Simulation results show that this approach can reduce both energy losses and charging costs as well as it allows a high PEV penetration rates (PEV-PR). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Due to the rapid increase of the World's primary energy demand of the last decades, low-temperature processes for the purification of natural gas streams with high carbon dioxide content has gained interest, since they allow to make profitable exploitation of low-quality gas reserves. Low temperature purification processes allow the direct production of a methane stream at high purity and at low-temperature, suitable conditions for the direct synergistic integration with natural gas cryogenic liquefaction processes, while CO2 is obtained in liquid phase and under pressure. In this way, it can be pumped for transportation, avoiding significant compression costs as for classical CO2 capture units (where carbon dioxide is discharged in gas phase and at atmospheric pressure), and further uses such as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) or underground storage.
In this paper, the three most common natural gas low-temperature purification techniques have been modelled and their performances have been evaluated through energy and exergy analyses. Specifically, the dual pressure low-temperature distillation process, the anti-sublimation process and a hybrid configuration have been considered. It is found that the dual pressure low-temperature distillation scheme reach the highest thermodynamic performances, resulting in the best values of exergy efficiency and equivalent methane requirements with respect to the other configurations. This is mainly due to the distributed temperature profile along a distillation column, resulting in a less irreversible heat exchanging process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Steam-treated pellets can help to address technical barriers that limit the uptake of pellets as a fuel for electricity generation, but there is limited understanding of the cost and environmental impacts of their production and use. This study investigates life cycle environmental (greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions) and financial implications of electricity generation from steam-treated pellets, including fuel cycle activities (biomass supply, pellet production, and combustion) and retrofit infrastructure to enable 100% pellet firing at a generating station that previously used coal. Models are informed by operating experience of pellet manufacturers and generating stations utilising coal, steam-treated and conventional pellets. Results are compared with conventional pellets and fossil fuels in a case study of electricity generation in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Steam-treated pellet production has similar GHG impacts to conventional pellets as their higher biomass feedstock requirement is balanced by reduced process electricity consumption. GHG reductions of more than 90% relative to coal and similar to 85% relative to natural gas (excluding retrofit infrastructure) could be obtained with both pellet options. Pellets can also reduce fuel cycle air pollutant emissions relative to coal by 30% (NOx), 97% (SOx), and 75% (PM10). Lesser retrofit requirements for steam-treated pellets more than compensate for marginally higher pellet production costs, resulting in lower electricity production cost compared to conventional pellets ($0.14/kW h vs. $0.16/kW h). Impacts of retrofit infrastructure become increasingly significant at lower generating station capacity factors, further favouring steam-treated pellets for both environmental and financial metrics.

Abstract: Calculating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with electricity is a key component in the field of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), but is often cited as challenging due to the complex nature of electricity systems despite its importance to the outcome. While calculating the operational CO2 emissions associated with electricity generation is an active research field, the embodied CO2 emissions, typically referred to as embodied carbon, of network assets has far less representation in the literature. This paper focuses on the CO2 emissions aspect of LCA to calculate the embodied CO2 of network assets in relation to the operational grid CO2 over time. Several functional units are defined: CO2 per operational year, CO2 per asset cost, CO2 per functional unit of electricity (kW h) and the relationship between embodied emissions and operational emissions in an electricity system over time. Hybrid functional units are then applied in order to better attribute the embodied carbon to the network functions. The hybrid functional units involve network asset lifetime and the issue of temporal horizons. Several suitable horizons are suggested and the comparison of results highlight the importance of the timeframe on results. The relationship between temporal horizons and environmental discounting is discussed and recommendations are made on the appropriate level of discounting depending on the temporal horizon and the purpose of the LCA. The paper uses data from the Great Britain electricity system where planned investment in network assets is (sic)12bn at distribution level (Dx) and (sic)16.4bn at transmission level (Tx) over the next eight years. By using GB network data for embodied carbon, demand and asset data, as well as data from the decarbonisation of electricity generation, indicative results are provided into the way in which embodied carbon impacts could change over time, showing that by 2035, the embodied carbon of the transmission network could contribute almost 25% of total emissions associated with electricity. On a regional basis, DNO level network assets could reach anywhere between 40% and 130%. This network data is also used to show that new network investment could account for up to 6.5% of DNO level network embodied carbon when front loaded during the RIIO-ED1 period.

Abstract: Adding large solar photovoltaic (PV) resources into an electric grid influences the flexibility characteristics of its net load profile. The dispatch of the existing generation fleet changes as it adjusts to accommodate the new net load. This study categorizes and defines these flexibility characteristics. It utilizes a unit commitment and dispatch (UC&D) model to simulate large solar generation assets with different geographic locations and orientations. The simulations show the sensitivity of the wholesale energy price, reserve market prices, total dispatch cost, fuel mix, emissions, and water use to changes in net load flexibility requirements. The results show that generating 22,500 GW h of solar energy in a 2011 simulation of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) reduces total dispatch cost by approximately $900 million (a 103% decrease) while increasing ancillary services costs by approximately $10 million (a 3% increase). The results also show that PV reduces water consumption and water withdrawals as well as CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions. It also reduces peak load by 4% but increases net load volatility by 40-79% and ramping by 11-33%. In addition, west-located, west-oriented solar resources reduce total dispatch cost more than the other simulated solar scenarios. The west-located, west-oriented solar simulation required greater system flexibility, but utilized more low-cost generators and fewer high-cost generators for energy production than other simulated scenarios. These results suggest that the mix of energy provided by different generation technologies influences the dispatch cost more than the net load flexibility requirements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for characterization and simulation of thermoelectric generator systems that allows accurate and efficient prediction of electric and thermal performance at steady state conditions. The simulation framework relies on regression analysis of single thermoelectric modules including voltage, current, temperatures and heat flow. A physical description of the main phenomena is included in models and enables accurate prediction of module performance over large ranges in temperature and current. Moreover it allows a system of modules electrically connected to be analyzed and used together with fluid dynamics simulations. When used in conjunction with CFD analysis it allows efficient modeling of electrical and thermal performance by simultaneous solution of the coupled equations for energy transport and thermoelectric power generation. This efficiency comes from the fact the modeling does not require full resolution as first principle simulations does. Therefore it solves the scale separation problem and allows multiphysics simulation with just a minor increase in computational power.
Experimental validation on a system consisting of electrically connected modules shows excellent prediction of heat flow as well as current and voltage. Validation confirms the simulation framework allows extrapolation outside the measured operating range used when developing the models. Even under highly non-ideal conditions with reversed current, i.e. when modules operate as Peltier coolers rather than generators, very reliable predictions are obtained.
Results show the simulation framework captures the main physics and allows efficient and reliable predictions. The models allow physial separation of heat conduction, Peltier, Joule and Seebeck effects and the different phenomena are studied and discussed in detail for various thermal loads and electrical configurations.

Abstract: Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants are currently designed with either cooling towers or air-cooled condensers. These two alternatives have a trade off: cooling tower evaporative cooling systems use water, which is a scarce resource in the desert environments where CSP is implemented, but air-cooling results in decreased power plant performance. In this paper, a radiation-enhanced cooling system for thermal power plants is analyzed with a detailed heat transfer model and shown to be feasible for CSP. The proposed system consumes no water and has the potential to out-perform air-cooling. Heat transfer occurs by convection and radiation to the cold night temperatures of desert environments. The radiators are uncovered black panels with tubes of cooling fluid circulated to a cold storage system. The radiators' performance is modeled using a two-dimensional finite difference model and the complete power plant system is modeled on an hourly basis using a standard power plant with thermal energy storage. If the night sky cooling system is the same size as the solar collector field, annual simulation shows that the system can provide over 90% of the required cooling. In addition, performance is improved compared to traditional air-cooling because the parasitic load for circulating water in the radiator system is about 1% of gross energy production while the parasitic load for an air-cooled power plant is about 4%. The night sky cooling system is a potential solution to the water issues that face CSP power plants and other power plants located in desert environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays an important role in the efficient management of electric systems. Building an optimization model that will enhance forecasting accuracy is not only a challenging task but also a concern for electrical load prediction. Especially due to artificial neural networks (ANNs), the final results are dependent on the initial random weights and thresholds, which influence the forecasting stability. Most analyses are based on accuracy improvements, but the effectiveness of a forecasting model is determined equally by its stability. Considering only one criterion (accuracy or stability) is insufficient. Thus, for the model to achieve these two relatively independent objectives at the same time, high accuracy and strong stability, a modified generalized regression neural network (GRNN) based on a multi-objective firefly algorithm (MOFA), employed to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of the GRNN, is proposed. A new hybrid model composed of multiple seasonal patterns, a data pre-processing technique to reduce interferences from the original data, and MOFA-GRNN for electrical load forecasting is successfully developed in this paper. Case studies utilizing half-hourly electrical load data from three states in Australia are used as illustrative examples to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed hybrid model. Experimental results clearly showed that both the accuracy and stability of the developed hybrid model is superior to the models compared. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The current study reports on biological biogas upgrading by means of hydrogen addition to obtain biomethane. A mesophilic (37 degrees C) 0.058 m(3) trickle-bed reactor with an immobilized hydrogenotrophic enrichment culture was operated for a period of 8 months using a substrate mix of molecular hydrogen (H-2) and biogas (36-42% CO2). Complete CO2 conversion (> 96%) was achieved up to a H-2 loading rate of 6.5 m(n)(3) H-2/m(reactor)(3) vol. x d, corresponding to 2.3 h gas retention time. The optimum H-2/CO2 ratio was determined to be between 3.67 and 4.15. CH4 concentrations above 96% were achieved with less than 0.1% residual H-2. This gas quality complies even with tightest standards for grid injection without the need for additional CO2 removal. If less rigid standards must be fulfilled H-2 loading rates can be almost doubled (10.95 versus 6.5 m(n)(3), H-2/m(reactor)(3) vol, x d) making the process even more attractive. At this H-2 loading the achieved methane productivity was 2.52 m(n)(3) CH4/m(reactor)(3) vol. x d. In terms of biogas this corresponds to. an upgrading capacity of 6.9 m(n)(3) biogas/m(reactor)(3) vol. x d. The conducted experiments demonstrate that biological methanation in an external reactor is well feasible for biogas upgrading under the prerequisite that an adequate H-2 source is available.

Abstract: Studies conducted on Brayton-Rankine combined cycle power plants have shown that the performance of its gas turbine unit and hence the overall performance of the plant can be improved by decreasing the compressor inlet air temperature. In these plants, a lot of low grade heat goes waste along with the exhaust gases. Absorption refrigeration systems always attract the users to utilize the low grade waste heat wherever it is available Therefore, in this work, a simulation model of an Indian combined cycle power plant coupled with exhaust heat operated ammonia-water absorption refrigeration system has been developed to investigate the performance of the combined system according to Indian atmospheric conditions which vary throughout the year. Energy and exergy analysis reveals that by having this arrangement, in summer season, an additional net power of 9440 kW is developed thereby increasing the thermal efficiency of the plant by 1.193% and the exergy efficiency by 1.133%. But, in winter, it would further increase the power output by 400 kW. As the North Indian atmospheric temperature varies from about 45 degrees C in summer to about 3 degrees C in winter, the variation of plant performance with the variation of ammonia condenser temperature has also been studied.

Abstract: Climate change mitigation is a key issue in formulating global environmental policies. Energy production and consumption are the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Europe. Energy consumption and energy-related GHG emissions from agriculture are an important concern for policymakers, as the agricultural activities should meet food security goals along with proper economic, environmental, and social impacts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is the most significant among energy-related GHG emissions. This paper analyses the main drivers behind energy-related CO2 emission across agricultural sectors of European countries. The analysis is based on aggregate data from the World Input-Output Database. The research explores two main directions. Firstly, Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA), facilitated by the Shapley index, is used to identify the main drivers of CO2 emission. Secondly, the Slack based Model (SBM) is applied to gauge the environmental efficiency of European agricultural sectors. By applying frontier techniques, we also derive the measures of environmental efficiency and shadow prices, thereby contributing to a discussion on CO2 emission mitigation in agriculture. Therefore, the paper devises an integrated approach towards analysis of CO2 emission based upon advanced decomposition and efficiency analysis models. The research covers eighteen European countries and the applied methodology decomposes contributions to CO2 emission across of regions and factors. Results of IDA suggest that decreasing energy intensity is the main factor behind declines in CO2 emission. According to the SBM, the lowest carbon shadow prices are observed in France, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Poland, and Belgium. These countries thus have the highest potential for reduction in CO2 emission. The results imply that measures to increase energy efficiency are a more effective means to reduce CO2 emissions than are changes in the fuel-mix. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Heat loss from the kiln shell accounts for a certain proportion of total energy input in a rotary kiln. To reduce the heat loss, a novel heat recovery exchanger installed on the kiln shell is proposed to preheat water in this paper. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements are carried out to investigate the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the heat recovery exchanger. Then, multi-objective optimization models are proposed with the heat transfer area, the pressure drop and the modified entropy generation number set as objective functions. The mathematic models describe the relation between heat transfer rates and the design parameters of the heat recovery exchanger, i.e. the tube length, the tube numbers and the tube diameter. With the aid of the Matlab genetic algorithm toolbox, the optimized design parameters are obtained. Finally, economic analyses of a practical heat recovery system with nine heat recovery exchangers are proposed to estimate the saving of the fuel consumption. The optimization results show that the Pareto solutions are the trade-off between the two conflicting objective functions and give some final decisions considering specific requirements for the designers. Besides, the optimized results of heat transfer areas and pressure drop of the heat recovery exchanger are decreased by at least 18% and 11%, respectively. As the modified entropy generation number due to heat transfer and fluid friction decrease, the corresponding heat transfer area and pressure drop decrease, respectively. The economic analyses indicate that the heat recovery system is profitable and the revenue comes from the fuel savings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A modeling approach for battery as an Electrical Energy Storage System is proposed in this paper. The model aims to predict non-linear power delivery dynamics, given charge and discharge demand as a controllable input, not only in normal operating range of batteries, but also in extreme cases such as battery over-charging. In order to achieve that, the model is composed of separated voltage and current models. Several non-linear models, including Hammerstein model, non-linear open-circuit voltage characteristics, and Takacs hysteresis model are combined in the voltage and the current model, respectively. The state of charge of the battery can also be estimated in a recursive optimization fashion by the model. The parameterization and estimation methods of the model are described and also demonstrated on experimental data from a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cell. The experiment validation shows excellent agreement between measured and simulated voltage and current signals provided by the model during both normal operating and over-charging conditions. The contribution of this paper is given by the unique combination of data-based models used to capture linear dynamics, static non-linearity, and non-linear hysteresis effects in a single dynamic voltage/current model to simulate and predict the non-linear dynamic behavior of a battery as an energy storage/delivery system.

Abstract: In subtropical area, air conditioning (A/C) is widely used to provide a suitable thermal indoor environment. During operation, many parameters or configurations may influence the performance of the A/C system. Among them, the supply vane angle is an important factor, which can influence the energy saving and thermal comfort level in the occupied zone, according to previously related studies. However, it was revealed that it was difficult to get a balance between these two aspects. Therefore, based on the previous study, this further study was conducted aiming to determine the suitable angle to achieve the best performance. Hence, the technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used to calculate the combined performance considering energy saving and thermal comfort. Finally, the best supply vane angle of 30 inverted perpendicular, with the energy utilization coefficient (EUC) and draft risk (DR) at the values of 1.28 and 8.89, was obtained, at which the A/C system achieved a medium energy saving performance and a lower draft risk. It's indicated that using TOPSIS method can help tackle with conflicting effects for A/C systems in buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Multi-dimensional models were coupled with a detailed chemical mechanism to investigate the energy and exergy distributions of three different combustion regimes in internal combustion engines. The results indicate that the 50% heat release point (CA50) considerably affects fuel efficiency and ringing intensity (RI), in which RI is used to quantify the knock level. Moreover, the burn duration from the 10% heat release point (CA10) to CA50 dominates RI, and the position of 90% heat release point (CA90) affects fuel efficiency. The heat transfer losses of conventional diesel combustion (CDC) strongly depend on the local temperature gradient, while it is closely related to the heat transfer area for homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) and reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI). Among the three combustion regimes, CDC has the largest utilization efficiency for heat transfer and exhaust energy due to its higher temperature in the heat transfer layer and higher exhaust pressure and temperature. The utilization efficiency of heat transfer and exhaust in RCCI is less affected by the variation of CA50 compared to those in CDC and HCCI. Exergy destruction is closely related to the homogeneity of in cylinder temperature and equivalence ratio during combustion process, the combustion temperature, the chemical reaction rate, and the combustion duration. Under the combined effect, HCCI and RCCI demonstrate lower exergy destruction than CDC at the same load. Overall, the variations of the exergy distribution for the three combustion regimes obtained from the second law of thermodynamics are consistent with those from the first law of thermodynamics. HCCI demonstrates the highest energy and exergy efficiency, and CDC performs the worst. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, 2D CFD models have been,developed for a prototype refrigerated open type multi-deck display cabinet with and without integrated phase change material (PCM). The models can predict the effect of adding a PCM container on cabinet efficiencies, air temperature distributions, product temperatures and air flow patterns inside the cabinet at a range of operating conditions including space air temperatures and evaporator air velocities. To validate the cabinet models, the prototype cabinet was mounted in an air conditioned chamber and extensive experiments were conducted at constant space air temperature and relative humidity. The cabinet models have therefore been validated through comparison with experiment results for air temperatures at different locations of the airflow path and of food products. Simulation results show that significant energy can be saved through the installation of a PCM container. Further benefits include greater stabilization of product temperatures during defrost periods for the modified display cabinet. Consequently, the validated models can be used to explore and analyse the cabinet performance and control strategies at various operating and design conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Successful deployment of tidal energy converters relies on access to accurate and high resolution numerical assessments of available tidal stream power. However, since suitable tidal stream sites are located in relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf where tidal currents are enhanced, tidal energy converters may experience effects of wind-generated surface-gravity waves. Waves may thus influencetidal currents, and associated kinetic energy, through two non-linear processes: the interaction of wave and current bottom boundary layers, and the generation of wave-induced currents. Here, we develop a three-dimensional tidal circulation model coupled with a phase-averaged wave model to quantify the impact of the waves on the tidal kinetic energy resource of the Fromveur Strait (western Brittany)- a region that has been identified with strong potential for tidal array development. Numerical results are compared with in situ observations of wave parameters (significant wave height, peak period and mean wave direction) and current amplitude and direction 10 m above the seabed (the assumed technology hub height for this region). The introduction of waves is found to improve predictions of tidal stream power at 10 m above the seabed at the measurement site in the Strait, reducing kinetic energy by up to 9% during storm conditions. Synoptic effects of wave radiation stresses and enhanced bottom friction are more specifically identified at the scale of the Strait. Waves contribute to a slight increase in the spatial gradient of available mean tidal stream potential between the north-western area and the south-eastern part of the Strait. At the scale of the region within the Strait that has been identified for tidal stream array development, the available mean spring tidal stream potential is furthermore reduced by 12% during extreme waves conditions. Isolated effects of wave radiation stresses and enhanced bottom friction lead to a reduction in spring tidal potential of 7.8% and 5.3%, respectively. It is therefore suggested that models used for tidal resource assessment consider the effect of waves in appropriately wave-exposed regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work, the WRF meteorological model is run in three different modes to estimate the wind energy potential in the Bay of Biscay for the 1990-2001 period. The first simulation (NODA) involves a typical use of the WRF model and it does not use data assimilation. The second one (12hDA) performs 3DVAR data assimilation at 00 UTC and 12 UTC. Finally, 6hDA uses 3DVAR data assimilation at 00 UTC, 06 UTC, 12 UTC and 18 UTC. Verification for the three simulations has been carried out at a preliminary stage using wind data from buoys, and then a spatially distributed analysis has been conducted of surface wind based on satellite data from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP). To that purpose, the spatial correlation and error patterns over our study area have been used as statistical indicators. The results indicate that the wind values obtained with data assimilation every six hours (6hDA) yield the best verification scores at a 95% confidence level, thereby being the most accurate at reproducing wind observations in the area. Regarding the estimation of wind energy potential, at a second stage, we tested the calculation's sensitivity to the use of data assimilation. The most reliable simulation with data assimilation (6hDA) estimates 21% less energy potential than the simulation without data assimilation. In the absence of historical wind observation records of the sea with sufficient time and space resolution, meteorological models such as WRF provide an estimation of the wind values in tentative areas for offshore wind farms. In this line, our study highlights the need to use meteorological models with data assimilation, as future wind energy production can then be more realistically estimated beforehand. This may also contribute to a more accurate economic and technical evaluation of the risks and benefits for future investments in offshore wind energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: For the purpose of improving the thermal conductivity of the form-stable phase change materials (FSPCM), two types of nano-powders with high thermal conductivity were added into the samples. In the modified FSPCM, myristic acid (MA) was used as a solid-liquid phase change material (PCM), high density polyethylene (HDPE) acted as supporting material to prevent the leakage of the melted MA. Nano-Al2O3 (NAO) and nano-graphite (NG) were the additives for thermal conductivity enhancement. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to analyze the microstructure, chemical structure and crystalline phase of the samples, respectively. Furthermore, the specific latent heat and phase transition temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal reliability were investigated using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermal conductivity meter and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results showed that the MA was uniformly absorbed in the HDPE matrices and there was no leakage during the melting process when the mass fraction of the MA in the MA/HDPE composite was less than 70%. The DSC results revealed that the modified FSPCM have a constant phase change temperature and high specific latent heat. The thermal conductivity of the FSPCM was measured in the solid (30 degrees C) and liquid (60 degrees C) states of the MA. When the mass fraction of nano-powder additives is 12%, the thermal conductivities of the FSPCM increase by 95% (NAO) and 121% (NG) at 30 degrees C. It is anticipated that the FSPCM possess a potential application for thermal energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved:

Abstract: The liquid desiccant dehumidification system is becoming a hotspot in air dehumidification due to its promising prospects. Many models have been reported in the literature, but they are rarely applicable to control design due to various reasons. In this paper, a simplified dynamic model of liquid desiccant dehumidifier is proposed from a control point of view based on the heat and mass transfer principles, where the spatial differentials of fluid properties are approximated by discretization and dynamic interaction along the flow direction. Unknown model parameters are first estimated from static experimental data through the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and then refined from dynamic experimental data through the extended Kalman filter. The proposed model performs well in the experimental validation and is expected to be applied in a future control design and fault diagnosis application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used as enabling energy storage in many industrial fields. Accurate modeling and state estimation play fundamental roles in ensuring safe, reliable and efficient operation of lithium-ion battery systems. A physics-based electrochemical model (EM) is highly desirable for its inherent ability to push batteries to operate at their physical limits. For state-of-charge (SOC) estimation, the continuous capacity fade and resistance deterioration are more prone to erroneous estimation results. In this paper, trinal proportional-integral (PI) observers with a reduced physics-based EM are proposed to simultaneously estimate SOC, capacity and resistance for lithium-ion batteries. Firstly, a numerical solution for the employed model is derived. PI observers are then developed to realize the co-estimation of battery SOC, capacity and resistance. The moving-window ampere-hour counting technique and the iteration-approaching method are also incorporated for the estimation accuracy improvement. The robustness of the proposed approach against erroneous initial values, different battery cell aging levels and ambient temperatures is systematically evaluated, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The development on tidal turbine technology is ongoing with focus on several aspects, including hydrodynamics, operation and environment. Before considering an area for exploitation, tidal energy resource assessments in pre-feasibility energy extraction areas must include the relevant characteristics of the device to be used. The present paper uses the momentum source approach to represent a floatable tidal energy converter (TECs) in a coastal hydro-morphodynamic model and to perform model simulations utilising different TEC array schernes by quantifying the aggregated drag coefficient of the device array. Simulations for one-month periods with nested models were performed to evaluate the hydrodynamic impacts of energy extraction using as output parameters the reduction in velocity and water-level variation differences against a no-extraction scenario. The case study focuses on representing the deployment of floatable E35 Evopod TECs in Sanda Sound (South Kintyre, Argyll, Scotland). The range in power output values from the simulations clearly reflects the importance of choosing the location of the array, as slight changes in the location (of <1 km) can approximately double the potential power output. However, the doubling of the installed capacity of TECs doubles the mean velocity deficit and water level differences in the area surrounding the extraction point. These differences are amplified by a maximum factor of 4 during peak flood/ebb during spring tides. In the simulations, the drag coefficient is set to be constant, which represents a fixed operational state of the turbine, and is a limitation of coastal models of this type that cannot presently be solved. Nevertheless, the nesting of models with different resolutions, as presented in this paper, makes it possible to achieve continuous improvements in the accuracy of the quantification of momentum loss by representing turbine characteristics close to the scale of the turbine.

Abstract: Ever since the establishment of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in 1968 and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, significant strides have been made in diesel engine emission control technology. The diesel emission control is being achieved using strategies involving in-situ and after treatment techniques and even with their effective combinations. Among these techniques, recirculation of the exhaust gases back to the engine inlet is an in-situ approach for Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) control. Moreover, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has been used for controlling the onset of combustion process. In the current review, the importance of EGR for advanced diesel combustion like homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) or low-temperature combustion (LTC) system and the requirement of EGR with the use of alternate fuels are discussed. In order to facilitate better understanding, the adverse effects of EGR, the impact of EGR on diesel engine wear and lube oil deterioration is also highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The isooctane spray characteristics were experimentally investigated under flash boiling condition which represents the part load operating condition for modern gasoline engine. Various tests were carried out with back pressure ranging from 0.2 bar to 1 bar and ambient temperature varying between 20 degrees C and 100 degrees C. A long distance microscope together with an ultrahigh speed camera was employed to capture the spray development in the near field to study the primary breakup characteristics. The study was performed by using a diesel common rail injection system so that the influence of hydraulic force can be investigated. It was found that flash boiling led to dramatic radial propagation due to the explosion and collapse of the vapor bubbles, significantly boosting the atomization. The strength of vapor bubble explosion in the near field tended to be strongly affected by the flow regime in the nozzle. Besides, higher injection pressure led to larger cone angle during the initial injection stage but smaller cone angle during the quasi-steady stage due to the dominance of the hydraulic force.

Abstract: Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) is a widely used technique for lithium-ion battery state-of-health (SOH) evaluation. The effectiveness and robustness of ICA for single cell diagnostics have been reported in many published work. In this study, we extend the ICA based SOH monitoring approach from single cells to battery modules, which consist of battery cells with various aging conditions. In order to achieve on-board implementation, an IC peak tracking approach based on the ICA principles is proposed. Analytical, numerical and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the utility of the IC peak tracking framework on multi-cell battery SOH monitoring and the effects of cell non-uniformity on the proposed method. Results show that the methods developed for single cell capacity estimation can also be used for a module or pack that has parallel-connected cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The energy and environmental benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) are highly dependent on individual driving patterns. To characterize individual driving patterns in Beijing, a populated megacity in East Asian, GPS-based travel data from 459 private passenger vehicles were gathered covering nearly 17,000 sampling days in 2013-2015. The data were analyzed using a statistical model to produce 0.5 h, 4 h, 8 h and daily individual trip chain distributions, which were used to evaluate customer acceptance for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) based on inconvenience thresholds and to assess the energy consumption for plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). The mean daily distances travelled on weekdays and weekends in Beijing were found to be 44.6 km and 51.4 km respectively. In Beijing the mean habitual travel distance (40.4 km) is modest, the random component of travel distance is lower, and the fraction of habitual travel is higher than for cities in the U.S. and in Germany. These factors make EV deployment in Beijing more favorable than in the U.S. or Germany. We show that the estimated acceptance rate for BEVs is very sensitive to the predetermined inconvenience threshold level. The abundant public transportation alternatives and traffic management in Beijing are factors which reduce the inconvenience of BEVs and may make them acceptable without substantially increased cost for larger battery capacity. PHEVs with all-electric ranges of 50 km (PHEV50) have an ensemble utility factor (UF) and equivalent gasoline consumption estimated to be 0.55 and 4.39 L/100 km. However, for 50% of vehicle owners PHEV50s would have a UF of 0.94 and equivalent gasoline consumption of 3.03 L/100 km. Our results show that attention to heterogeneity among individuals instead of analysis at the ensemble level is essential to understanding the real-world acceptance and benefits of EVs.

Abstract: A new potentially high-efficiency electrolyte for water electrolysis: molten monobasic potassium phosphate, KH2PO4 or KDP has been investigated at temperatures similar to 275-325 degrees C. At these temperatures, KH2PO4 was found to dissociate into H2O gas in equilibrium with a melt mixture of KH2PO4-K2H2P2O7-KPO3-H2O. The water vapor pressure above the melt, when contained in a closed ampoule, was determined quantitatively vs. temperature by use of Raman spectroscopy with methane or hydrogen gas as an internal calibration standard, using newly established relative ratios of Raman scattering cross sections of water and methane or hydrogen to be 0.40 +/- 0.02 or 1.2 +/- 0.03. At equilibrium the vapor pressure was much lower than the vapor pressure above liquid water at the same temperature. Electrolysis was realized by passing current through closed ampoules (vacuum sealed quartz glass electrolysis cells with platinum electrodes and the electrolyte melt). The formation of mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen gases as well as the water vapor was detected by Raman spectroscopy. In this way it was demonstrated that water is present in the new electrolyte: molten KH2PO4 can be split by electrolysis via the reaction 2H(2)O -> 2H(2) + O-2 at temperatures similar to 275-325 degrees C. At these temperatures, before the start of the electrolysis, the KH2PO4 melt gives off H2O gas that pressurizes the cell according to the following dissociations: 2KH(2)PO(4) <-> K2H2P2O7 + H2O <-> 2KPO(3) + 2H(2)O. The spectra show however that the water by virtue of hydrogen-bonding has a high affinity for remaining in the melt. The formed hydrogen and oxygen gasses were detected by means of the characteristic Raman gas-phase spectra. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A 2 MW underwater compressed air energy storage (UWCAES) system is studied using both conventional and advanced exergy analyses. The exergy efficiency of the proposed UWCAES system is found to be 53.6% under the real conditions. While the theoretical maximum under the unavoidable condition is 84.3%; showing a great potential for performance improvement. Even though there are quantitative differences between conventional and advanced results, both show that the final compressor stage has the highest potential for improvement. The advanced exergy analysis reveals the real improvement potential of the UWCAES system. Further, it is revealed that the interactions between system components are complex but not very strong. Subsequently, the total exergy efficiency may not necessarily increase by improving the performance of the components individually. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The solar spectral irradiance varies significantly for different locations and time due to latitude, humidity, cosine effect of incident sunlight, etc. For convenience, the power -conversion efficiency of a solar cell is referenced to the international standard of AM1.5G spectral irradiance, which inevitably leads to varying performance of deployed solar cells under the specific local climate and insolation conditions. To predict the actual performance of solar cells under local climate conditions, we propose a methodology to compute the power -conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells based upon indoor measurement with a solar simulator, the measured local solar spectrum, and making use of both optical and electrical factors. From our study, the annual average energy density yield of poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenylC61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells under the local spectral irradiance of Malaysia is estimated to be 31.89 kW h/m(2) and the power -conversion efficiency is increased by 5.4% compared to that measured under AM1.5G conditions. In addition, diffuse solar irradiance (cloudy condition) was found to be in favor of P3HT:PCBM solar cells, with gain of 23.7-27.9% relative to AM1.5G conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to facilitate the design of a solar domestic hot water system. The MILP model does so by optimising the area of roof mounted flat plate solar thermal collectors and the volume of thermal energy storage that are required to minimise the annual capital and operational cost of the overall energy system. A new formulation of the MILP is presented in which the model is decomposed into two sub-modules that are iteratively solved. One module determines the optimal sizing of the solar thermal collectors and storage tank. The other module optimises the hourly energy production of the solar collectors based on the impact that the collector inlet stream temperature has on the collector efficiency. This iterative formulation is compared to both a conventional MILP formulation and a dynamic simulation model to determine if the iterative formulation results in a design tool that is able to accurately represent the dynamic behaviour of a solar domestic hot water system, while maintaining the computational tractability and scalability of the model. The novel iterative MILP formulation is applied to a case study of an apartment building in Rheinfelden, Switzerland. The results indicate that conventional MILP formulations overestimate the amount of energy that solar thermal collectors are able to produce, resulting in an oversizing of the required thermal storage tank. However, the iterative MILP model more accurately predicts the energy production of the solar collector, leading to the more realistic sizing of the component technologies. This result is important when evaluating the financial feasibility of solar thermal collector systems in comparison to other renewable generation technologies, as an overestimation of the generation potential of solar thermal collectors may result in an incorrect assessment of their investment attractiveness.

Abstract: Polymer extrusion is an energy intensive production process and process energy efficiency has become a key concern in the current industry with the pressure of reducing the global carbon footprint. Here, knowledge of the pattern of energy usage and losses of each component in the plant is highly useful in the process energy optimization. Moreover, it is essential to maintain the melt quality while improving the energy efficiency in polymer processing. In this work, an investigation was made on the total energy consumption, drive motor energy consumption, power factor and the melt temperature profile across the die melt flow (as an indication of the melt thermal quality) of an industrial scale extruder with three different screw geometries, three polymer types and wide range of processing conditions (altogether 135 different processing situations were observed). This aims to widen the knowledge on process energy and thermal behaviors while exploring possible correlation's between energy demand and melt quality (in terms of melt temperature fluctuations across the melt flow). The results showed that the level and fluctuations of the extruder's power factor is particularly dependent upon the material being processed. Moreover, it seems that there is a relation between the level of energy demand of the heaters and the level of melt temperature fluctuations. While the extruder specific energy consumption decreases with increasing screw speed, specific energy consumption of the drive motor may have either increasing or decreasing behavior. Overall, this study provides new insights in a wide range on process energy demand and melt thermal quality in polymer extrusion. Moreover, further research is recommended to establish strong correlation's between process energy consumption and melt thermal quality which should help to enhance process control and hence the product quality in single screw polymer extrusion.

Abstract: A new 13-value thermal comfort scale is adopted in the present study, in order to evaluate the thermal comfort sensation within non-residential buildings with the adaptive approach.
18 classrooms located both in Pavia and Perugia, the Fraschini Theatre, and one auditorium located in Pavia were investigated from October 2014 to October 2015 collecting about 1600 questionnaires. All the information reported in the questionnaires was correlated by defining several indexes and a comparative analysis was carried out between the two comfort scales (13-value and 7-value scale).
Results showed that using the new 13-value scale the percentage of people who declared a thermal sensation equal to 0 greatly decreased: from 66% to 41% for the classrooms and from 47% to 36% for the theatre-auditorium, The percentage of occupants who considered the environments not thermally comfortable, although they declared a thermal sensation equal to 0, also decreased, from a mean value of 10.4% to 2.7% for the classrooms and from 6.0% to 2.6% for the theatre-auditorium.
Considering the 7-value scale, although a thermal sensation equal to 0 was declared, a higher percentage of people who would feel a little bit cooler or a little bit warmer was found. Instead using the 13 value scale, this percentage significantly decreased; because people declared a thermal sensation equal to +/- 0.5 (more than 50% of cases) instead of 0.
In agreement with these results, the new scale seems to be more accurate than the traditional one, allowing a better correlation among all the data reported in the questionnaires. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a model which simultaneously optimises the selection and operation of technologies for distributed energy systems in buildings. The Technology Selection and Operation (TSO) model enables a new approach for the optimal selection and operation of energy system technologies that encompasses whole life costing, carbon emissions as well as real-time energy prices and demands; thus, providing a more comprehensive result than current methods. Utilizing historic metered energy demands, projected energy prices and a portfolio of available technologies, the mathematical model simultaneously solves for an optimal technology selection and operational strategy for a determined building based on a preferred objective: minimizing cost and/or minimizing carbon emissions. The TSO is a comprehensive and novel techno-economic model, capable of providing decision makers an optimal selection from a portfolio of available energy technologies. The current portfolio of available technologies is composed of various combined heat and power (CHP) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) units. The TSO model framework is data-driven and therefore presents a high level of flexibility with respect to time granularity, period of analysis and the technology portfolio. A case study depicts the capabilities of the model; optimisation results under different temporal arrangements and technology options are showcased. Overall, the TSO model provides meaningful insights that allow stakeholders to make technology investment decisions with greater assurance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) utilize the shallow ground to extract geothermal energy. Mostly they are installed in urbanized areas, where the thermal regime is strongly influenced by pavements, buildings and other urban infrastructures. In order to account for the spatial and temporal variability in the above-ground urban temperatures, a new semi-analytical model with a Cauchy-type top boundary is introduced. With this model, it is possible to estimate the transient three-dimensional temperature field in the near-surface ground influenced by the interaction of BHEs, horizontal groundwater flow, land use type and associated surface air temperature (SAT). It is verified with a numerical model and sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the relevance of the prevailing thermal regime. By adopting a dimensionless formulation, it is shown that the decoupling between temperature fields at the ground surface restraints heat fluxes and penetration depth of thermal signals above ground. A systematic comparison with traditional Dirichlet-type boundary conditions shows that a fixed temperature formulation generally overestimates the thermal effect of land surface signals on thermal plumes of BHEs. This is also addressed by investigating the ground energy balance during operation of the geothermal system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Residential energy markets in the United States are undergoing rapid change with increasing amounts of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems installed each year. This study examines the combined effect of electric rate structures and local environmental forcings on optimal solar home system size, ratepayer financials, utility financials, and electric grid ramp rate requirements for three urban regions in the United States. Techno-economic analyses are completed for Chicago, Phoenix, and Seattle and the results contrasted to provide both generalizable findings and site-specific findings. Various net metering scenarios and time-of-use rate schedules are investigated to evaluate the optimal solar PV capacity and battery storage in a typical residential home for each locality. The net residential load profile is created for a single home using BEopt and then scaled to assess technical and economic impacts to the utility for a market segment of 10,000 homes modeled in HOMER. Emphasis is given to intraday load profiles, ramp rate requirements, peak capacity requirements, load factor, revenue loss, and revenue recuperation as a function of the number of ratepayers with solar PV. Increases in solar PV penetration reduced the annual system load factor by an equivalent percentage yet had little to no impact on peak power requirements. Ramp rate requirements were largest for Chicago in October, Phoenix in July, and Seattle in January. Net metering on a monthly or annual basis had a negligible impact on optimal solar PV capacity, yet optimal solar PV capacity reduced by 20-50% if net metering was removed altogether. Technical and economic data are generated from simulations with solar penetration up to 100% of homes. For the scenario with 20% homes using solar PV, the utility would need a 16%, 24%, and 8% increase in time-of-use electricity rates ($/kWh) across all ratepayers to recover lost revenue in Chicago, Phoenix, and Seattle, respectively. The $15 monthly connection fee would need to increase by 94%, 228%, or 50% across the same cities if time-of-use electricity rates were to remain unchanged. Batteries were found to be cost-effective in simulations without net metering and at cost reductions of at least 55%. Batteries were not cost-effective even if they were free-when net metering was in effect. As expected, Phoenix had the most favorable economic scenario for residential solar PV, primarily due to the high solar insolation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In direct injection spark ignition (SI) engines, the spray dynamics and interaction with the surrounding air flow are recognised as strongly affecting mixture quality, combustion development and amount of pollutants released at the exhaust. Spray impact against walls has also to be considered since undesired deposition of liquid as wallfilm causes unburned hydrocarbons and soot formation, hence increased fuel consumption and even augmented cyclic dispersion.
Present work aims at clarifying the dynamics of sprays generated by multi-hole high pressure injectors in the combustion chamber of a gasoline direct injection,(GDI) engine, as well as to characterize the combustion development and pollutants formation under various injection modes. Stoichiometric and lean operations are both studied into detail through a combined experimental and numerical approach. Experiments are conducted on an optically accessible engine, whereas numerical simulations are made after the development and validation of a three-dimensional (3D) sub-model reproducing at the best the spray dynamics also in its impact over walls.
Early injection is shown to anyway determine at spark timing slight inhomogeneity in the equivalence ratio distribution of the stoichiometric charge, which makes for the flame propagation being anyway not spherical, but such to exhibit a preferential direction towards the richest zone of the combustion chamber. This leads to the formation of a pocket in the end gases where the knocking phenomenon is likely to occur under some circumstances. Lean charge operation is instead discussed as injection pressure and spark timing are varied to highlight mechanisms of formation of the main pollutants and to define routes for the development of proper engine control strategies. A deep insight in the in-cylinder thermo-fluidynamic processes is achieved thanks to the here followed synergic experimental-numerical approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Large quantities of waste heat generated during industrial production offer an opportunity for waste heat recovery (WHR). Several case studies are selected using flue gas as heat source, which are representative of a fairly wide range of source temperature (200-700 degrees C). The objective function of WHR refers to maximization of net power output. With a view to seeking an optimal combination of cycle configuration, fluid and cycle parameters under different heat source condition, the following researches have been performed. Different types of power cycles (e.g., Rankine cycle, transcritical cycle and combined cycle) as well as different cycle configurations (e.g., saturated or superheating, with or without regenerator) are evaluated. In order to compensate the defects of conventional cycles in some case studies, a novel improved transcritical CO2 cycle and two combined cycle designs are presented. Working fluid selection among the organics is performed. After the parametric optimization, comparison and analysis are carried out among different cycles. Results indicate that the regenerative organic transcritical cycle produces the maximum power output at source temperatures up to about 500 degrees C, and different optimum working fluids are obtained under different heat source temperature. The improved transcritical CO2 cycle shows satisfying performance in source temperature range of 500-600 degrees C. One combined cycle produces the largest work at source temperature above 600 degrees C. The traditional steam Rankine cycle shows bad performance at source temperature below 500 degrees C due to its bad thermal matching with sensible source. At source temperature of 700 degrees C, steam Rankine cycle shows satisfying performance, and produces a power output close to that of the combined cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Conventional vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) using Nafion 115 suffered from issues associated with high ohmic resistance and high capital cost. In this work, we report a commercial membrane (VANADion), consisting of a porous layer and a dense Nafion layer, as a promising alternative to Nafion 115. In the dual-layer structure, the porous layer (similar to 210 mu m) can offer a high ionic conductivity and the dense Nafion layer (similar to 20 mu m) can depress the convective flow of electrolyte through the membrane. By comparing with the conventional Nafion 115 in a VRFB, it is found that the change from the conventional Nafion 115 to the composite one results in an increase in the energy efficiency from 71.3% to 76.2% and an increase in the electrolyte utilization from 54.1% to 68.4% at a current density of as high as 240 mA cm(-2). In addition, although two batteries show the comparable cycling performance at current densities ranging from 80 mA cm(-2) to 240 mA cm(-2), the composite membrane is estimated to be significantly cheaper than the conventional Nafion 115 due to the fact that the porous layer is rather cost-effective and the dense Nafion layer is rather thin. The impressive combination of desirable performance and low cost makes this composite membrane highly promising in the VRFB applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study evaluates the potential economic and environmental benefits available by providing renewable energy for electric vehicle charging at public electric vehicle service equipment (EVSE). Willingness to pay (WTP) for charging an electric vehicle using renewable energy was collected through a U.S.-wide online survey of Plugin Electric Vehicle owners and lessees using the choice experiment method. The results indicate a 433% increase in the usage of charging stations if renewable energy was offered. Results also show a mean WTP to upgrade to renewable energy of $0.61 per hour for Level 2 EVSE and $1.82 for Direct Current Fast Chargers (DCFC). Using Blink public EVSE network as a case study, these usage and WTP values translate directly to an annual gross income increase of 655% from $1.45 million to $9.5 million, with an annual renewable energy credit acquisition cost of $13,700. Simulation results also show significant environmental benefit from emissions reductions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel combustion system has been applied to a 600 MWe, down-fired boiler to reduce NOx emissions without producing an obvious increase in the carbon content of fly ash. The system mainly includes moving fuel-lean nozzles from the arches to the front/rear walls, and re-arranging the staged air, as well as introducing separated-over-fire air (SOFA). This paper evaluates the effects of the SOFA locations (on the arches, on the throat, and on the upper furnace) on the combustion and NOx emissions characteristics using simulations. The numerical results are in good agreement with the measured results. Compared to the original combustion system, significant NOx reduction (approximately 50%) is found for all three SOFA location settings. Taking economic efficiency and NOx emissions into account, the SOFA on the upper furnace is adopted in the actual modification, and no negative effects are observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Calcium looping (CaL) is a promising technology for the decarbonation of power generation and carbon intensive (cement, lime and steel) industries. Although CaL has been extensively researched, some issues need to be addressed before deployment of this technology at commercial scale. One of the important challenges for CaL is decay of sorbent reactivity during capture/regeneration cycles. Numerous techniques have been explored to enhance natural sorbent performance, to create new synthetic sorbents, and to re-activate and re-use deactivated material. This review provides a critical analysis of natural and synthetic sorbents developed for use in CaL. Special attention is given to the suitability of modified materials for utilisation in fluidised-bed systems. Namely, besides requirements for a practical adsorption capacity, a mechanically strong material, resistant to attrition, is required for the fluidised bed CaL operating conditions. However, the main advantage of CaL is that it employs a widely available and inexpensive sorbent. Hence, a compromise must be made between improving the sorbent performance and increasing its cost, which means a relatively practical, scalable, and inexpensive method to enhance sorbent performance, should be found. This is often neglected when developing new materials focusing only on very high adsorption capacity. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines provide advantages over preceding spark ignition engine technologies in terms of reduced fuel consumption, increased power output and CO2 depletion. However, the main drawback is the increased level of Particulate Matter (PM) emissions, which is associated with the adverse effects on human health and the environment.
GDI engine's fuel economy can further be enhanced by exhaust gas fuel reforming, a thermochemical recovery technique, which utilizes the engine exhaust gas heat, CO2 and H2O to produce a hydrogen-rich gas named reformate. Furthermore, additional benefits in gaseous emissions can be achieved through the combustion of reformate. In this investigation, a prototype on-board fuel reformer has been employed in a GDI engine to study the effects of reformate combustion as a supplementary fuel to gasoline on PM and gaseous emissions. Between 5% and 6% reduction in the engine fuel consumption was achieved by using the fuel reformer. The different effects (i.e. dilution, thermal, chemical, etc.) of the reformate combustion on the PM nature and gaseous emissions has been identified. It was found that the reformate combustion can decrease notably the engine PM emissions, however, the reduction is dependent on the PM nature. Reformate combustion was found to remove soot cores more efficiently than the volatile PM. The study has shown that the three-way catalytic converter (TWC) can reduce PM emissions. The possible interactions between the reformate and the TWC operation have also been analyzed. For the studied conditions, fuel reforming technology has not shown significant detrimental influence on the TWC operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The major goal of this paper is to focus on interaction patterns among global crude-oil-import-dependent countries (OIDCs) and to study global crude oil supply risk from the perspective of crude oil import dependency. Import values of crude oil of 38 OIDCs were selected as sample data. To analyze and visualize the global evolution and transmission characteristics of interaction patterns, we propose a method by using complex network theory. In this method, the holistic time is divided into different small-scale fragments by sliding windows, and then the series of interaction networks of OIDCs (OIDCIN) is obtained. In order to characterize the global evolution of such series of interaction networks, indexes of dynamic topological structure and the long-term global recurrence plots are introduced. Underlying dynamics of time-evolving interaction networks are revealed. A formula to measure the risk in crude oil supply is designed from the perspective of crude oil import dependency. To analyze the transmission characteristics of the interaction patterns, the interaction modes are defined. The interaction modes transfer into each other over time, forming a process of transmission. Then the interaction modes transmission network of OIDCs (OIDCIMTN) is obtained. Numerical simulations show that OIDCIN has co-movement, group-occurring and small-word property. The interaction patterns have both a short-range correlation and a long-range correlation. The evolution process of the interaction patterns can be divided into four different periods. Dates of 2008/05, 2010/09, and 2012/10 are broken dates. Dates of the inflection point of the risk in crude oil supply transformation are June 2007, June 2010, and February 2013. Risk in crude oil supply presents an increasing trend from February 2013. The strength of OIDCIMTN basically satisfies a power-law distribution. In OIDCIMTN, modes with large strength almost have large clustering coefficient. The interaction modes are transferred into each other conveniently, although the crude oil import dependency system is highly complicated. The transformation of the interaction patterns mainly revolves around three core interaction modes and each transformation needs to undergo 5 non-core modes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The Kalina cycle is believed to be one of the most promising technologies for power generation from low temperature heat sources such as geothermal energy. So far, most Kalina cycle power plants are designed with a working fluid mixture having a fixed composition, and thus normally operate at a fixed condensing temperature. However, the ambient temperature (i.e., heat sink) varies over a large range as the season changes over a year, particularly in continental climates. Recently, a new concept, i.e., composition adjustable Kalina cycle, was proposed to develop power plants that can match their condensing temperature with the changing ambient conditions, aiming at improving the cycle's overall thermal efficiency. However, no detailed analysis of its implementation and the potential benefits under various climate conditions has been reported. For this reason, this paper carried out a comprehensive numerical research on its implementation and performance analysis under several different climate conditions. A mathematical model is firstly established to simulate the working principle of a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle, based on which a numerical program is then developed to analyse the cycle's performance under various climate conditions. The developed numerical model is verified with some published data. The dynamic composition adjustment in response to the changing ambient temperature is simulated to evaluate its effect on the plant's performance over a year. The results show that a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle could achieve higher annual-average thermal efficiency than a conventional one with a fixed mixture composition. However, such an improvement of thermal efficiency strongly depends on the heat source temperature, climate conditions, etc. The composition-adjusting system introduces extra capital and operation costs. The economic viability of a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle power plant depends on the balance between these extra costs and the increase of thermal efficiency. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract: Private households are increasingly taking cooperative action to change their energy consumption patterns in pursuit of green, social, and economic objectives. Cooperative demand response (DR) programs can contribute to these common goals in several ways. To quantify their potential, we use detailed energy consumption and production data collected from 201 households in Austin (Texas) over the year 2014 as well as historic real-time prices from the Austin wholesale market. To simulate cooperative DR, we adapt a load-scheduling algorithm to support both real-time retail prices and a capacity-pricing component (two-part pricing schemes). Our results suggest that cooperative DR results in higher cost savings for households than individual DR. Whereas cooperative DR that is based on real-time pricing alone leads to an increase in peak demand, we show that adding a capacity-pricing component is able to counteract this effect. The capacity-pricing component successfully reduces the cooperative's peak demand and also increases the cost savings potential. Effective peak shaving is furthermore only possible in a cooperative setting. We conclude that cooperative DR programs are not only beneficial to customers but also to energy providers. The use of appropriate tariffs allows consumers and suppliers to share these benefits fairly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The main purpose of this study involved investigating the primary energy saving potential of a liquid desiccantand evaporative cooling-assisted 100% outdoor air system (LD-IDECOAS) integrated with a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). During the cooling season, the heat produced by the PEMFC was used to regenerate a weak desiccant solution, and the electricity generated was used to operate the LD-IDECOAS. A pilot LD-IDECOAS powered by a PEMFC was installed and operated in an office space to experimentally verify the annual operating energy savings of the proposed system. The findings indicated that the heat reclaimed from the PEMFC saved 42% of the desiccant solution regenerating energy when compared to that in the case of a conventional gas-fired water heater. The results also suggested that the LD-IDECOAS combined with a PEMFC consumed 21% less primary energy when compared with that of a system powered by grid electricity and a conventional gas-fired water heater.

Abstract: Their high energy density and low heat losses between storage and recovery times make thermochemical processes a promising way to achieve long-term (seasonal) storage. Among the available reactor configurations, open systems using a packed bed of reactive solid are simple and efficient. This paper reports on the local operation and reactive bed behavior of such systems. Mass transfer changes within the reactive bed, which is the main limitation of such systems, was investigated using several state variables (reaction advancement, pressure drop across the salt bed and bed temperatures). Results from two experimental set-ups were analyzed: a small bench for mass transfer characterization, and a prototype at a larger scale. Both used SrBr2/H2O as reactive pair.
A salt bed temperature analysis evidenced a reaction front moving within the reactive layer from the moist air inlet to its outlet. A mass transfer study showed marked changes in the reactive bed permeability during the reaction (by one order of magnitude) and with the reactive bed density (from 10(-9) to 10 m(2) when density range from 300 to 600 kW h m(-3)). During the reaction an asymmetric time course of the bed permeability was also highlighted: as f(X) in dehydration and f(1/X) in hydration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Advances in semiconductor-based power electronics and growing direct current loads in buildings have led researchers to reconsider whether buildings should be wired with DC circuits to reduce power conversions and facilitate a transition to efficient DC appliances. The feasibility, energy savings, and economics of such systems have been assessed and proven in data centers and commercial buildings, but the outcomes are still uncertain for the residential sector.
In this work, we assess the technical and economic feasibility of DC circuits using data for 120 traditionally-wired AC homes in Austin, Texas to understand the effect of highly variable demand profiles on DC-powered residences, using appliance-level use and solar generation data, and performing a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify costs and benefits.
Results show site energy savings between 9% and 20% when solar PV is distributed to all home appliances. When battery storage for excess solar energy is considered, these savings increase to 14-25%. At present DC equipment prices, converting all equipment to DC causes levelized annual costs of electricity to homeowners to roughly double. However, by converting only homes' air conditioning condensing units to DC, the costs of direct-DC are greatly reduced and home site energy savings of 7-16% are generated.
In addition to quantifying savings, we find major nontechnical barriers to implementing direct-DC in homes. These include a lack of standards for such systems, a relatively small market for DC appliances and components, utility programs designed for AC power, and a workforce unfamiliar with DC. Experience with DC is growing in other sectors, and with time this will be transitioned to a broader audience of engineers, electricians, and building inspectors to ensure that not only are the systems themselves safe, but that the image of direct current circuits becomes less foreign over time. Direct current may very well have a place in the residential sector, and research and development should continue to explore other potential benefits that might make a stronger case for a more widespread transition to what now appears a promising technology.

Abstract: An optimal day-ahead scheduling method (ODSM) for the integrated urban energy system (IUES) is introduced, which considers the reconfigurable capability of an electric distribution network. The hourly topology of a distribution network, a natural gas network, the energy centers including the combined heat and power (CHP) units, different energy conversion devices and demand responsive loads (DRLs), are optimized to minimize the day-ahead operation cost of the IUES. The hourly reconfigurable capability of the electric distribution network utilizing remotely controlled switches (RCSs) is explored and discussed. The operational constraints from the unbalanced three-phase electric distribution network, the natural gas network, and the energy centers are considered. The interactions between the electric distribution network and the natural gas network take place through conversion of energy among different energy vectors in the energy centers. An energy conversion analysis model for the energy center was developed based on the energy hub model. A hybrid optimization method based on genetic algorithm (GA) and a nonlinear interior point method (IPM) is utilized to solve the ODSM model. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed ODSM is able to provide the IUES with an effective and economical day ahead scheduling scheme and reduce the operational cost of the IUES.

Abstract: Fischer Tropsch (F-T) diesel produced from biomass through gasification is a promising alternative fuel. In this study, a biomass-to-liquid (BTL) system involving a dual fluidized bed gasifier (DFBG), a methanol absorption tower, and an F-T synthesis process was investigated for producing clean biodiesel as an automotive fuel. A DFBG, which is an efficient indirect gasifier, can produce syngas with high caloric value while minimizing the amount of nitrogen in the product gas. In order to meet the strict requirements of syngas for F-T synthesis, any contaminants in the syngas must be minimized and its composition must be carefully controlled. In this work, the syngas mainly comprised 35 vol% of H-2 and 21.3 vol% of CO. The concentrations of H2S and COS in the syngas were less than 1 ppmV owing to the use of chilled methanol cleaning process. Furthermore, long-term operation of a fully integrated BTL system was successfully conducted for over 500 h. The results showed that the BTL diesel can be used as an alternative automotive diesel fuel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper considers the financial costs of a rapid national transition to electric vehicles (EVs) in comparison to a baseline scenario that is characterised by continuing use of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs). The Australian car fleet, which is responsible for 8% of national greenhouse emissions, is used as a case study. To explore the potential range of costs associated with rapid climate mitigation via the transport sector, the transition is assumed to occur very rapidly (by 2025). The analysis focusses on urban areas, where extensive charging infrastructure is assumed to be made available, including rapid charging facilities. Due to uncertainty over input variables, two "boundary" scenarios were constructed. In the High Cost Scenario, a rapid shift to EVs was found to cost approximately 25% more than the continuing use of ICEs, assessed over the period 2015-2035. However, in the Low Cost Scenario, where costs of EVs (especially batteries) fall more rapidly, EV maintenance costs are at the lower end of projections, and liquid fuel costs at the higher end of projections, a rapid transition to EVs is found to cost approximately the same as the use of ICE vehicles. This suggests that a rapid transition towards EV technologies for urban car travel may offer a cost-effective second-best climate change mitigation strategy. More comprehensive transport sector transformation, including changes in transport and land use policy designed to facilitate mode shift, might further reduce the costs of such a transition.

Abstract: The intermittency of renewable energy systems remains one of the major hurdles preventing a large scale uptake of these technologies and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems are no different. However, CSP has the benefit of being able to store excess heat using thermal energy storage (TES). For the uptake of CSP with TES it must be demonstrated that the technology is both economically as well as environmentally feasible. This paper aims to investigate the economic and environmental impact of several TES options that are available for CSP systems. The investigated systems include an encapsulated phase change material (PCM) system, a coil-in-tank PCM system and a liquid sodium TES system. The economic impact in the current study refers to the capital cost (CAPEX) of each system including the tank, storage material, encapsulation cost (if applicable) and allowances for construction and engineering. The environmental impact of each system is accounted by calculating the embodied energy of each of the system components. Each storage system will be required to store a comparable amount of energy so that reliable conclusions can be drawn. The results from this analysis conclude that the encapsulated PCM (EPCM) and coil-in-tank system represent an embodied energy of roughly one third of the corresponding state-of-the-art two-tank molten salt system.
Furthermore, the EPCM and coil-in-tank systems result in CAPEX reductions of 50% and 25% over the current state-of-the-art two-tank molten salt system. The liquid sodium system was found to result in higher embodied energy and CAPEX than any previously studied TES system. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each system was discussed and compared to previous literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study investigated the emissions of a modern (Tier 4) 4-cylinder direct injection (DI) diesel engine at idling with no load conditions. Three idling speeds: low (800 rpm), medium (1000 rpm) and high (1200 rpm), respectively are considered. Two additives (5% and 15% by volume), ethanol and diethyl ether (DEE) were mixed with biodiesel-diesel blends B20, B50 and B100. B100 was produced from canola oil. Engine was tested from cold start to warm up in real world conditions. Emissions analysis was conducted for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). Investigation results show that, CO and NOx emissions decrease, but HC emissions increase after warm-up than cold start. Diesel-biodiesel blends with additives produce lower CO emissions then neat diesel; ethanol and DEE additives can reduce NOx emissions in diesel-biodiesel blends, and increasing biodiesel content reduced HC emissions.

Abstract: This paper quantifies the impacts of policy objectives on the composition of an optimum new passenger vehicle fleet. The objectives are to reduce individually absolute energy use and associated emissions of CO2, NOx and PM2.5. This work combines a top down, diversity-led approach to fleet composition with bottom-up models of 23 powertrain variants across nine vehicle segments. Changing the annual distance travelled only led to the smallest change in fleet composition because driving less mitigated the need to shift to smaller vehicles or more efficient powertrains. Instead, managing activity led to a 're-petrolisation' of the fleet which yielded the largest reductions in emissions of NOx and PM2.5. The hybrid approach of changing annual distance travelled and increasing willingness to accept longer payback times incorporates management of vehicle activity with consumers' demand for novel vehicle powertrains. Combining these changes in behaviour, without feebates, allowed the hybrid approach to return the largest reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions. Introducing feebates makes low emitting vehicles more affordable and represents a supply side push for novel powertrains. The largest reductions in energy use and associated emissions occurred without any consumer behaviour change, but required large fees ((sic)79-99 per g CO2/km) on high-emitting vehicles and were achieved using the most specialised fleets. However, such fleets may not present consumers with sufficient choice to be attractive. The fleet with best diversity by vehicle size and powertrain type was achieved with both the external incentive of the feebate and consumers modifying their activity. This work has a number of potential audiences: governments and policy makers may use the framework to understand how to accommodate the growth in vehicle use with pledged reductions in emissions; and original equipment manufacturers may take advantage of the bottom-up, vehicle powertrain inputs to understand the role their technology can play in a fleet under the influence of consumer behaviour change, external incentives and policy objectives.

Abstract: This paper explores the effects of residential neighborhood types on building energy consumption and solar energy trade-offs with the goal of developing an operational methodology to achieve the best conditions towards a zero nonrenewable energy neighborhood. Six typical Chongming neighborhood types are identified, termed the Farmhouse, Linear-village, Nucleated-village, Townhouse, Slab and High-rise types with the effects of increased installation of solar energy panels estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. To achieve a more comprehensive view of cost-effective opportunities to improve the performance of buildings at the neighborhood scale, we use actual energy use data obtained from both the survey and electricity bills' analysis to show that considerable variations exist due to hitherto unrecorded socioeconomic factors relating to the type of occupants involved. By concluding that the associated variables are interdependent, the paper continues with an empirical study in which the solar energy potential of each neighborhood is quantified to show that, in the case of Chongming, the Nucleated-village and Slab neighborhood types have the greatest retrofitting potential. These investigations into energy trade-offs with existing retrofitting and construction technologies therefore provide a metric for other eco-cities to use as a tool for future policy guidance.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated probabilistic framework by combining Monte Carlo Simulation with a gas transport model of a horizontal well with multi-fracturing stages to assess shale gas resources in the Wangyinpu Formation of the Xiuwu Basin, China. Modeling results suggest that the 30-year cumulative production of a single horizontal well is predicted at a likely value of 3.50 x 10(8) m(3) with a maximum of 6.78 x 10(9) m3. Potential shale gas production from a "sweet spot" area is estimated at a range of 1.13 x 10(19)-1.76 x 10(13) m(3) with a likely value of 8.24 x 10(11) m(3). Sensitivity analysis indicates that the gas production rate and cumulative gas production of a single horizontal well are most sensitive to the relative volume occupied by kerogen in the bulk volume of the shale, gas desorption rate, number of fracturing stages, and permeability of the stimulated zone. Assessment of water demand for horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing suggests that shale gas development at the Xiuwu Basin will not likely cause regional water-supply stress because of abundant water resources in the region. The probabilistic approach presented in this study can provide valuable information for planning shale gas development and can also be applied to other shale gas reservoirs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Dust deposition on a solar photovoltaic (PV) system mounted on the windward roof of an isolated building was investigated by CFD simulation. The SST k-omega turbulence model with UDF inlet profiles and the discrete particle model (DPM) were adopted to simulate the wind flow fields and the dust deposition behavior, respectively. The CFD wind flow velocity profiles around the building were in good agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. The effects of various dust particle sizes, differing quantities of released dust particles, and the force of gravity on the rates of dust deposition upon the PV panels were investigated in detail. It was found that the dust deposition rate first rose and then declined with the increase of dust particle size. The maximum deposition rate was about 0.28% for 10 gm dust, and the minimum deposition rate was about 0.13% for 50 pm dust. Gravity also had a significant effect on the rate of dust deposition for large-particle dust (d(p) > 5 mu m), and the rate could reach 75% for 50 mu m dust. However, the effect of gravity on dust, deposition was less than 5% for small-particle dust (d(p) < 5 mu m). The effect of releasing differing quantities of dust particles on the dust deposition rate was less than 8%. Moreover, the mechanisms by which dust was deposited on the PV roof were analyzed and discussed. Finally, a simple empirical model was developed to estimate the PV efficiency reduction ratios in relation to exposure time, as based on this study's CFD results and the experimental data reported in the literature.

Abstract: At any particular moment, the energy security of an energy system is at risk from events, both external and internal, that can affect its operation. By analyzing these risks, the state of the system's energy security can be determined. If the method is generic, it can be applied to any energy system and the entities that support its operation. Despite the potential benefits of such a method, a review of the literature shows that existing methods of analysis focus on, for example, limited parts of the system or specific types of energy.
To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a method for analyzing the risks to the energy security of any entity in an energy system. The method, derived from work at the National Institute for Statistics and Technology (NIST), determines the risks to an entity using the well-known properties of events (rate of-occurrence and expected stress) and entities (flows, time-to-recover, and stress-tolerance). The paper demonstrates how the method can be applied using both qualitative and quantitative data to measure, analyze, and potentially improve a system's energy security. Several examples are included. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The reserves and exploitable capacity of the wind power resource in China are both ranked first in the world and could be developed to strengthen China's energy security and mitigate global warming. Carbon footprint accounting of wind farms is vital for large-scale wind energy exploitation. This paper establishes a systematic accounting framework with life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output analysis (IOA) for the overall carbon footprint of the life cycle of a typical wind farm. Carbon emissions from the construction, operation, and dismantling phases are considered in the LCA of the wind farm. Then, each expense of the wind farm is treated as a change in exogenous demand for the output of the corresponding economic sectors according to the IOA. In addition, the virtual carbon footprint from peak regulation triggered by the on-grid fluctuation of wind power is incorporated. The results show the total carbon footprint of the studied wind farm is 1.45 x 10(4) tCO(2) over the 21-year lifetime. The construction phase accounts for the largest fraction (76.74%), followed by the operation phase (15.32%) and dismantling phase (7.94%). According to the IOA, the indirect carbon footprint of the wind farm is greater than the direct footprint. The "Smelting and Pressing of Metals" sector that produces the steel and copper used to manufacture the wind turbines dominates the carbon footprint. The virtual carbon footprint of coal-fired power for wind power peak regulation is estimated to be 2.08 x 10(3) tCO(2), which is close to that of the operation phase. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Thermal management is critical for large-scale, shipboard energy storage systems utilizing lithium-ion batteries. In recent years, there has been growing research in thermal management of lithium-ion battery modules. However,, there is little information available on the minimum cell-to-cell spacing limits for indirect, liquid cooled modules when considering heat release during a single cell failure. For this purpose, a generic four-cell module was modeled using finite element analysis to determine the sensitivity of module temperatures to cell spacing. Additionally, the effects of different heat sink materials and interface qualities were investigated. Two materials were considered, a solid aluminum block and a metal/wax composite block. Simulations were run for three different transient load profiles. The first profile simulates sustained high rate operation where the system begins at rest and generates heat continuously until it reaches steady state. And, two failure mode simulations were conducted to investigate block performance during a slow and a fast exothermic reaction, respectively. Results indicate that composite materials can perform well under normal operation and provide some protection against single cell failure; although, for very compact designs, the amount of wax available to absorb heat is reduced and the effectiveness of the phase change material is diminished. The aluminum block design performed well under all conditions, and showed that heat generated during a failure is quickly dissipated to the coolant, even under the closest cell spacing configuration.

Abstract: The paper examines and compares the potential of storage in batteries versus demand response strategies for electricity bill reduction in the residential sector, in the context of the new trend of installing PV systems for self-consumption. The performances of the two methodologies are investigated by applying them to the data of a real household which owns a small solar photovoltaic installation. The benefits of storage and demand response are evaluated through an optimization analysis with a linear programming algorithm. The simulations are carried out both for real market prices of the equipment and for reduced ones, to simulate the case of strong technological development and the corresponding price decrease in the coming years. The electricity pricing scheme is a dual tariff regime modeled according to the Portuguese current rules. The results suggest that at the moment, demand response should be preferred with the current market prices of the hardware. However, a significant decrease in the batteries price can make storage an interesting alternative, especially for the cases in which demand response is not easily applicable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: We present a parametric programming based approach for energy management in microgrids. An operational planning problem for a grid-connected microgrid with energy sources including solar photovoltaic, wind turbine and battery energy storage system, in addition to a household load demand, is captured as a parametric mixed-integer linear programming problem (p-MILP) through parameterizations of the uncertain coordinates of wind and solar energy resources. Thus, the energy management problem - typically nonlinear - is transformed into a linear hi-level optimization problem, where choice of the parameterization scheme is made at the upper level while system operation decisions are made at the lower level. The p-MILP formulation leads to significant improvements in uncertainty handling, solution quality and computational ease; by removing dependency of the solution on meteorological forecasts and avoiding the multiple computational cycles of the traditional online optimization techniques. The problem is solved offline on a flexible time-scale basis, allowing online implementation to be achievable on real-time system state updates. The proposed parametric programming approach extends the state-of-the-art in microgrid energy management methods and the results from various case studies are used to demonstrate the feasibility of our method.

Abstract: A copper nanoparticle deposited graphite felt electrode for all vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) is developed and tested. It is found that the copper catalyst enables a significant improvement in the electrochemical kinetics of the V3+/V2+ redox reaction. The battery's utilization of the electrolyte and energy efficiency are found to be as high as 83.7% and 80.1%, at a current density of 300 mA cm(-2), which are 53.1% and 17.8% higher than those of the battery without the catalyst. Moreover, the present battery shows a good stability during the cycle test. The results suggest that the inexpensive copper nanoparticle catalyst without tedious preparation process offers a great promise for VRFB application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Suspended particle device (SPD) switchable glazing has potential to control transmission of solar radiation in the visible range by changing its transparency from 55% to 5%. Outdoor test cell characterisation of a SPD switchable glazing offered the dynamic solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) which varied between 0.05 (when opaque) and 0.38 (when transparent). Reduction of maximum temperature rise of 11% and 15% was possible using SPD "transparent" and "opaque" state compared to same area double-glazing. Insulated test cell with water flow heat exchanger was employed to measure the cooling load reduction potential of SPD glazing while its transmission changed from "transparent" to "opaque" state. A cooling load reduction up to 6 kW h for a 0.343 m(3) volume test cell was possible by changing a 0.21 m x 0.28 m SPD glazing transparency from "transparent" to "opaque". Average overall heat transfer coefficient of SPD glazing varied between 5.02 W/m(2) IC and 5.2 W/m(2) IC for two different states. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a generic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that integrates a Midterm Energy Planning (MEP) model, which implements generation and transmission system planning at a yearly level, with a Unit Commitment (UC) model, which performs the simulation of the Day Ahead Electricity Market. The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated in a case study of the Greek interconnected power system. The aim is to evaluate a critical project in the Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) of the Independent Power Transmission System Operator S.A. (ADMIE), namely the electric interconnection of the Crete Island with the mainland electric system. The proposed modeling framework identifies the implementation (or not) of the interconnection of the Crete Island with the mainland electric system, as well as the optimum interconnection capacity. It also quantifies the effects on the Day-Ahead electricity market and on the energy mix. The paper demonstrates that the model can provide useful insights into the strategic and challenging decisions to be determined by investors and/or policy makers at a national and/or regional level, by providing the optimal energy road map and management, as well as clear price signals on critical energy projects under real operating and design constraints.

Abstract: For pilot fuel compression ignition natural gas (CING) engine, pre-injection strategy of pilot fuel is an important ways to improve engine performance, emissions and combustion. In this study, effects of pre-injection parameters on combustion and emissions performance were experimentally studied in a pilot diesel CING engine which was modified from a turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engine. The cylinder pressure, heart release rate (HRR), start of combustion (SOC), duration of combustion (DOC) and coefficient of variation (COVIMEP), as well as NOx and HC emissions were analyzed. The results indicate that early pre-injection mode leads to lower cylinder pressure and HRR due to decrease of combustion intensity, and thereby lower NOR emission is obtained. In contrast, closely pre-injection timing leads to largely strengthening in combustion which is not beneficial for improving NOR emission performance.
Furthermore, effects of pre-injection quantity ratio and fuel injection pressure on combustion and emissions of early pre-injection operation modes (on pre-injection timing of 70 degrees CA BTDC) were analyzed. Increase of pre-injection quantity ratio leads to decreasing in ignition intensity which delayed SOC and slowed burning rate of in-cylinder mixture, and thereby leads to lower cylinder pressure and HRR. Due to slowing in in-cylinder combustion, combustion temperature decreased, and hence leads to lower NOR emission and higher HC emission. However, too high pre-injection quantity ratio leads to unstable ignition and even unstable combustion which is not beneficial for engine performance. Increasing fuel injection pressure leads to larger fraction of premixed quantity of injected fuel which increased ignition energy and leads to rapid combustion, and hence higher cylinder pressure and HRR were obtained. Due to the increase of burning rate of in-cylinder mixture, in-cylinder combustion temperature was increased, and hence leads to higher NOR emission and lower HC emission. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A thermodynamic model for the design of ejectors is described, validated and applied for conditions prevailing in refrigeration systems. Contrary to previous models the present one determines all the dimensions of the ejector and uses polytropic (instead of isentropic) efficiencies thus taking into account the effects of the pressure ratio on the entropy increase during the irreversible acceleration and deceleration processes. The results include dimensions and fluid properties for a base case as well as a parametric study which analyzes the effect of inlet and outlet conditions on the dimensions and efficiencies of the acceleration, deceleration and mixing processes. The parametric study coupled to recommended constraints from the literature leads to the determination of design conditions for which the axial evolution of pressure, temperature and velocity are determined. The effects of the polytropic efficiency on the ejector dimensions and the efficiencies of the processes taking place in the ejector are also presented and analysed. It is also shown that the total exergy losses increase linearly when the mixing efficiency decreases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To enhance the thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCM) such as sugar alcohol and molten salts, the preparation of a phase change composite (PCC) with a PCM and a filler with high thermal conductivity has been widely investigated. Although many reported PCCs have high thermal conductivity, the stability during thermal cycling endurance is often too low for practical use. This paper describes the development of a PCC with both high thermal conductivity and high cyclic durability. The PCCs were prepared by a hot -pressing method. Erythritol (melting point: 118 degrees C, thermal conductivity: 0.73 W m(-1) K-1) was used as a PCM, and carbon fiber (thermal conductivity: 900 W m(-1) K-1 in the fiber direction) and indium particles (thermal conductivity: 82.8 W m(-1) K-1) were used as the high thermal conductivity fillers. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCC was measured using the laser flash method and the network structures were analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Thermal cycling tests through the melting and solidification phases of the erythritol were performed to investigate the cyclic durability of the PCCs. We found that the indium particles melted during hot pressing, welding together the carbon fiber to produce a stable percolating network, which significantly enhanced the thermal conductivity and cyclic endurance of the PCCs.

Abstract: Methane hydrates are potential valuable energy resources. However, finding an efficient method for methane gas recovery from hydrate sediments is still a challenge. New challenges arise from increasing environmental protection. This is due in part to the technical difficulties involved in the efficient dissociation of methane hydrates at high pressures. In this study, a new approach is proposed to produce valuable products of: 1. Net methane gas recovery from the methane hydrate sediment, and 2. Deep ocean power generation. We have taken the first steps toward utilization of a fuel cell system in methane gas recovery from deep ocean hydrate sediments. An integrated high pressure and high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and steam methane reformer (SMR) system is analyzed for this application and the recoverable amount of methane from deep ocean sediments is measured. System analysis is accomplished for two major cases regarding system performance: 1. Energy for SMR is provided by the burning part of the methane gas dissociated from the hydrate sediment. 2. Energy for SMR is provided through heat exchange with fuel cell effluent gases. We found that the total production of methane gas is higher in the first case compared to the second case. The net power generated by the fuel cell system is estimated for all cases. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of integrated electrochemical devices to accomplish energy efficient dissociation of methane hydrate gases in deep ocean sediments. Concepts for use of electrochemical devices (e.g., high temperature fuel cells) for methane gas recovery from hydrates and efficient electricity production from the released gases are developed. The technical feasibility of these integrated systems for operation in hydrate reservoirs in deep ocean sediments was then evaluated using combined systems of thermodynamic and heat transfer equations, which are presented in detail.

Abstract: In this paper, a pilot scale solar Linear Fresnel Reflector of 154 m(2) is designed and optically analyzed with two different profiles for the secondary concentrator. Compounded profiles of parabolic (PB) and involute (IN) shapes are compared for the secondary reflector geometry. Non-uniform intensity distribution of the solar disc with the flux transmission by the Monte Carlo Ray tracing method is used. Analyses are carried out with a 3D optical model and the combined optical performance of the Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) system with the parabolic secondary reflector is compared with that of the involute secondary reflector. The effects of truncating the secondary reflectors, optimizing the focusing distance of the absorber and the gap between the absorber and the secondary reflector, are investigated. Also the effects of errors caused by sun-tracking and contour of the mirror surface are studied. The efficiency of the Linear Fresnel Reflector system with the two models of secondary concentrators at different incidence angles of the solar beam are evaluated with Incidence Angle Modifier. Optical performance at different Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) conditions is also performed. It is found that the Linear Fresnel Reflector system with Parabolic secondary reflector provides a higher optical efficiency of 62.3% with secondary efficiency of 83.3%. The Involute secondary on the other hand, provides an optical efficiency of 59.5% and secondary efficiency of 78.33%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Solar irradiation is intermittent, but concentrated solar thermal (CST) plants are typically designed and analyzed solely based on their steady design point. Unlike coal power plants, however, CST plants frequently experience thermal loads well above and below their rated design point, leading to off-design operation for much of the operational year. Importantly, if a latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) system is employed, the receiver inlet temperature can vary under these conditions. To date, there is a clear lack of knowledge for how to handle off-design conditions in terms of developing appropriate control strategies to maximize the receiver thermal output and its operational region. In this study, a thermal model was developed and validated that is suitable for design/off-design performance analyses of molten salt cavity receivers in both steady state and transient conditions. The study investigated two control strategies - a fixed receiver flow rate (FF) and fixed receiver outlet temperature (FT) - for their off-design performance in each of two off-design operational modes (storage and non-storage). Solar field utilization (SFU) is variable in non-storage mode, but in the storage mode, it is whether variable or fixed at design point (SFU = 1). The feasible operating region in this study refers to the zone restricted by maximum allowable operational parameters defined based on design point analysis, mainly maximum receiver outlet temperature, maximum flow rate, and maximum receiver surface temperature.
Through this analysis, it was found that receiver inlet temperatures above the design point (560 K) degrade the receiver performance in both control strategies and under all operational modes. The results also revealed that the maximum allowable receiver inlet temperature that maintains the receiver operation inside the feasible region could not go beyond 700 K or 600 K with the FF and FT strategies (in the storage mode with variable or fixed SFU), respectively. These values also indicate the charging cut-off temperature for the fluid flowing out in LHTES systems. In the non-storage mode, the receiver inlet temperature is remained constant at design point by varying the SFU over the time. While the design point direct normal irradiation (DNI) was 900 W m(-2), the maximum allowable DNI is 700 W m(-2) and 500 W m(-2) with the FF and FT strategies, respectively. These results motivate a hybrid control strategy that switches between the FF and FT strategies to maximize the performance and the number of operational hours of a CST plant during the day. As a final aspect of this study, off-design receiver efficiency correlations are developed that can be used in any simulation environment to accurately predict receiver performance.

Abstract: The widely used measurement for energy efficiency are in form of physical quantity, thus neglecting the economic cost and the imperfect substitution among energy and other production factors such as capital and labor. In the real world, least energy input does not always leads to optimal factor combinations in production processes. The goal of producers is to minimize the total factor cost or maximize the profit instead of minimizing the physical input. The optimum factor combination is constrained not only by the available technology but also by the relative prices of factors. Based on the production theory and mathematical programming, the "energy economic efficiency (e(e))" is constructed to calculate energy efficiency which connects energy productivity and economic efficiency (E-e). In this paper, we have a further discussion on the properties of the energy economic efficiency diagrammatically and mathematically and measure the efficiency in electricity generation sector of 23 International Energy Agency (IEA) countries. Compared with traditional energy efficiency indicators (in physical form), we develop a more proper way of evaluating energy efficiency with better performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Comparative study of effects of pilot injection strategy and properties of fuels on the spray, combustion and emissions of a four-cylinder diesel engine was investigated under an intermediate exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratio. Four different fuels including pure diesel (D100) and three blended fuels consisting of diesel/gasoline (in a volume ratio of 70:30, D70G30), diesel/n-butanol (in a volume ratio of 70:30, D70B30) and diesel/gasoline/n-butanol (in a volume ratio of 70:15:15, D70G15B15) were investigated. The pilot injection strategies were accomplished by varying the pilot injection ratios and the pilot main intervals. The results showed that, although the addition of gasoline or n-butanol to diesel had little influence on the spray characteristics, it can greatly reduce soot emissions and lead to an increase in maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). Using the pilot injection strategy with a larger pilot injection ratio and a shorter pilot-main interval can effectively reduce MPRR. A smaller pilot-main interval can remarkably reduce BSFC. Compared to single injection, pilot injection results showed that soot, THC and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions for four fuels increased, while the corresponding NOx emissions decreased. Both the decrease of pilot injection ratio and increase of pilot-main interval can lead to a decline in soot emissions. Nevertheless, the addition of gasoline or n-butanol to diesel can greatly offset the deterioration of soot emissions, induced by the adoption of pilot injection strategy. Additionally, compared to D100, the variations in soot emissions from the combustion of three blended fuels are less sensitive to variations in pilot injection ratios and pilot-main intervals. For all the studied fuels, effects of pilot injection ratios on NOx emissions are less obvious than the effects induced by the pilot-main interval. A decrease in pilot-main interval can further reduce the NOx emissions. For all the studied fuels, decrease in pilot injection ratios or pilot-main intervals can reduce the emissions of THC and CO, whereas the difference among four fuels is quite small. However, the pilot-main interval shows a more remarkable effect on the THC emissions than the pilot interval ratio. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The promotion and deployment of storage technologies in autonomous and grid-connected systems plays a relevant part in the massive integration of renewable power sources required for the worldwide development of a sustainable society. In this regard, analyzing the behavior of electrochemical storage devices such as lead-acid batteries installed on hybrid energy systems and microgrids in terms of their lifetime and economic profitability is an important research topic. Since renewable generation is characterized by its random nature, lead-acid batteries typically work under stress conditions, which directly influence their lifetime in a negative way by increasing the net present cost. Due to the fast growing of renewable sources as a consequence of governmental policies and incentives, the number of manufacturers to be considered worldwide is becoming really high, so that optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms (GM) are frequently used in order to consider the performance of a high number of manufacturers of wind turbines, photovoltaic panels and lead-acid batteries subject to the environmental conditions of the location under analysis to determine a cost-effective design. In this paper, GA method combined with weighted Ah ageing model is improved by including expert experiences by means of stress factors and the categorization of operating conditions, as a new contribution to earlier studies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by analyzing a hybrid energy system to be installed in Zaragoza, Spain, resulting in a near-optimal design in a reduced computational time compared to the enumerative optimization method.

Abstract: Anaerobic degradation of protein-rich materials has high methane potential and produces nutrient-rich residue, but requires strategies to avoid ammonia inhibition. A well-adapted process can cope with substantially higher ammonia levels than an unadapted process and analyses of pathways for methanisation of acetate, combined with determination of microbial community structure, strongly indicate that this is due to a significant contribution of syntrophic acetate oxidation. The microorganisms involved in syntrophic acetate oxidation thus most likely occupy a unique niche and play an important role in methane formation. This review summarises current insight of syntrophic acetate oxidising microorganisms, their presence and the detection of novel species and relate these observations with operating conditions of the biogas processes in order to explore contributing factors for development of an ammonia-tolerant microbial community that efficiently degrades acetate through the syntrophic pathway. Besides high ammonia level, acetate concentration, temperature and methanogenic community structure are considered in this review as likely factors that shape and influence SAO-mediated microbial ecosystems. The main purpose of this review is to facilitate process optimisation through considering the activity and growth of this key microbial community. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In order to achieve the complete utilization of both sludge organic and inorganic components, this study proposed a novel method for synchronous production of clean syngas and ash adsorbent during steam gasification process based on composite conditioning. Sewage sludge was pretreated by Fenton's reagent (Fe2+/H2O2) and CaO, then gasified in a lab-scale fluidized bed at 873-1273 K. The ash adsorption performance was also evaluated in a self-designed reactor. According to the results, both residual iron and calcium salts were able to promote H-2-rich fuel gas generation. The effect of iron compounds became more strongly with temperature increased, while the influence of calcium substances tend to be more obviously with temperature decreased. Thus after combined conditioning, very good sludge gasification performance and the highest cold gas efficiency were achieved at a wide temperature range. Moreover, separate gasification of Fenton-oxidized or CaO-treated sludge released H2S emission respectively from sulfonic acid/sulfone/heterocyclic-S and inorganic sulfide in char. However, H2S releasing amount was less than 1.8% of total sulfur with the co-usage of two conditioners due to oxidation and fixation reactions. Meanwhile, although CaCxNy that formed in CaO-added sludge char reacted with steam to produce NH3, the residual iron and calcium compounds could synergistically inhibit the final emissions of NH3 and HCN. In this case, no nitrogenous gas was generated at 1273 K. Besides this outstanding role, the remaining conditioners were still able to boost the adsorption performance of sludge gasification ash and significantly prolong its life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The reliable benchmarks are required to evaluate building energy efficiency fairly. This study aims to develop the energy benchmarks and relevant process for a multi-family housing complex (MFHC), which is responsible for huge CO2 emissions in South Korea. A database, including the information on building attributes and energy consumption of 503 MFHCs, was established. The database was classified into three groups based on average enclosed area per household (AEA) through data mining techniques. The benchmarks of site energy use intensity (EUI), source EUI, and CO2 emission intensity (CEI) were developed from Groups 1, 2, and 3. Representatively, the developed benchmarks of CEI for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 28.17, 24.16, and 20.96 kg-CO2/m(2) y, respectively. A comparative analysis using the operational rating identified that the developed benchmarks could solve the irrationality of the original benchmarks from overall database. In the case of the original benchmarks, 93% of small-AEA-groups and 16% of large AEA-groups received lower grades. In the case of the developed benchmark, the upper and lower grades in Groups 1-3 were both adjusted to 50%. The proposed process for developing energy benchmark is applicable to evaluate the energy efficiency of other buildings, in other regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an environmental tool to evaluate the sustainability of different bioenergy pathways has become a common practice since the European Renewable Energy Directive was published in 2009. In the evaluation of bioenergy produced out from dedicated energy crops, nitrogen fertilizer production and use are commonly identified as the most important contributors to fossil energy consumption and to several environmental impacts categories including Global Warming Potential. In considering the impacts produced by the nitrogen fertilization of energy crops and in addition to the effects of fertilization schemes on the biomass yield, more attention should be paid to the changes in soil nitrogen to know if fertilization doses and application schemes are sufficient enough to maintain soil nitrogen stocks and ensure that soil quality is preserved for future years. To this aim, in this work soil nitrogen balance is used as an indicator to estimate the evolution of soil nitrogen stocks and complement LCA calculations. In this paper, the effects of three nitrogen top fertilization doses (null, 30 and 80 kg NI (hay)) used for rye cultivation are compared when ry is grown as a dedicated energy crop for electricity generation under the Spanish province of Soria conditions. A LCA was carried out using experimental crop testing results and a centralised (25 MWe) straw power plant data in combination with soil nitrogen balance obtained in each of the experimental crop trials. After that, the LCA results were compared with those obtained when electricity is generated from natural gas in Spanish power plants. According to the average calculations, each additional kg N/(ha y) applied in top fertilization produces a reduction of 0.18% on GHG savings with respect to natural gas electricity, as well as a worsening in the energy balance of 0.00084 TJ fossil energy per TJ of electricity generated but reduces soil nitrogen deficit in 0.43 kg N/(ha y). For top fertilization doses of 80 kg N/(ha y) the average GHG savings with respect to natural gas were 63.7% and the average non-renewable energy consumption was 6, 4 times less for the bioenergy system than for natural gas. Fossil energy accounted for more than 95% of total nonrenewable energy in this calculation. This work evidences that determinate biomass growing conditions associated to high GHG savings and improved energy balances may cause detrimental effects for soil fertility due to considerable associated negative soil nitrogen balances. This finding suggests the convenience to include the soil nitrogen balance as a complementary indicator for bioenergy LCA calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper is focused on the detailed analysis of a PCM plate heat storage unit with a particular configuration, looking for the maximum contact area with the fluid (water) and the minimum volume to be used in a real household application. In that sense, a numerical study of the thermal and fluid dynamic behaviour of the water flow and the PCM melting-solidification processes, together with the thermal behaviour of the solid elements of the unit, has been carried out. On the other hand, an experimental set-up has been designed and built to validate the numerical model and characterise the performance of the heat storage unit. The purpose of the numerical and experimental study is to present a series of results to describe the heat storage unit performance in function of the time. Thus, after a preliminary design study three different cases have been simulated and tested. A 7.2% of discrepancy between numerical results and experimental data has been evaluated for the heat transfer. The PCM heat storage unit designed is capable to store approx. 75% of the thermal energy from the previous process wasted water heat, and recover part of it to supply around 50% of the thermal energy required to heat up the next process.

Abstract: Biochar derived from orchid tree leaves is utilised as the fuel of a direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC), with yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as electrolyte and cermet of silver and gadolinium doped ceria (Ag-GDC) as the material of both cathode and anode, operating without any liquid medium or feeding gas. The performance of the DC-SOFC operated on the leaf char is higher than that operated on the best reported carbon fuel for DC-SOFCs, Fe-loaded activated carbon. XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM and EDX are applied to characterize the leaf char. It turns out that the leaf char is with porous structure and there is much Ca along with some K and Mg uniformly distributing in the leaf char. The effects of the naturally existing alkaline earth metal and alkaline metal and their distribution on the performance of the DC-SOFCs operated on the leaf char are analyzed in detail.

Abstract: The fuel injection system in two stroke engine is very important, therefore the hydraulic electronic unit injector system is developed and the injection characteristics of hydraulic electronic unit injector are investigated. Firstly the HFPE and the hydraulic electronic unit injector working principle are analyzed, and then PID control strategy is built by engine demand. In order to validate the feasibility of hydraulic electronic unit injector, the prototype test bench is established. The specific measurement principle is presented. Further the injection characteristics, such as the effect of injection pressure on injection delay and the effect of engine frequency on injection delay, are analyzed. In order to optimize the engine stability performance, the BDC control based on fuel injection control is investigated. The load control based on fuel injection is also discussed and the BDC feedforward control with the load variation is investigated. Experiment results of stead engine operation shows that the hydraulic electronic unit injector system based on PID control can be satisfied with the engine operation demand. In addition, cycle fuel injection quantity is tested online and off-line engine operation. It is obvious that the fuel injection quantity is affected by the hydraulic pressure. The fuel injection quantity variation can be improved with decreasing the fluctuation of drive pressure or adopting more suitable oil common rail instead of connected with exhaust valve hydraulic drive oil-way. The energy flow in HFPE is analyzed and the hydraulic output energy can be optimized by selecting suitable hydraulic valves parameters. The fuel injection quantity should be designed by the energy balance and the stable operation requirement in spite of the higher thermal efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, wheat straw (WS) and dairy manure (DM) were ultrasonically pretreated to optimize the time for ultrasonic pretreatment (UP), identify the most appropriate optimization method, clarify whether UP is a high efficiency method for application, and explain why UP improves total methane production (TMP). The pretreatment conditions were designed using orthogonal experiment design (OED) and central composite design (CCD) and were optimized using the direct measurement method and response surface method, the relationships among the initial digestion characteristics and TMP were subsequently analyzed, the net energy, and energy benefit were calculated. The OEM results showed that mixed DM pretreated for 30 minutes (min) and WS pretreated for 20 min (DM30WS20) produced the maximum TMP, net energy, and energy benefit of 186 mL/g TS (total solid), 6.04 kJ/g TS, and 2.88 kJ/g TS, respectively. For CCD, the maximum TMP, net energy, and energy benefit were 146.61 mL/g TS, 4.91 kJ/g TS, and 1.75 kJ/g TS, respectively, and were obtained with DM9WS25. The maximum TMP, net energy, and energy benefit of OED were greater than those of CCD, indicating that OED is more suitable for UP in anaerobic digestion (AD). When pretreated with UP, the surface of DM showed an increasingly uniform distribution and WS became increasingly rough and displayed fractures of different degrees. Cellulose activity contributed the maximum (0.3856) direct decision influence to TMP, and the comprehensive decision influence at a pH of 0.328 was the highest in TMP. This study concluded that the direct measurement, method in OED was best suited for the design and optimization of pretreatment conditions by UP in AD. UP improved TMP, net energy, and energy benefit by changing the initial environment of AD. Therefore, UP is a high-energy benefit method and worth popularizing for AD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A type of composite surface was manufactured for trial to achieve integrated solar heating and radiative cooling functions. The spectral properties of the composite surface present a relatively clear selectivity in the spectra of solar heating and radiation cooling wavelengths. A combined system for both solar heating and radiative cooling (named SH-RC system) based on the composite surface was mounted together with a traditional flat-plate solar heating system. Comparative experiments were carried out to investigate their thermal performances both at daytime and nighttime. Results showed that the composite surface has a relatively evident spectral selectivity. In diurnal collector testing mode, the thermal efficiency of the SH-RC collector was 62.7% at zero-reduced temperature, which was about 86.4% of that of the traditional flat-plate solar heating collector. In nocturnal collector testing mode, the SH-RC collector had net radiative cooling powers of 50.3 W/m(2) on a clear night and 23.4 W/m(2) on an overcast night; by contrast, the traditional flat-plate solar heating collector exhibited very little radiative cooling capacity. In diurnal system testing mode, the daily average thermal efficiency of the SH-RC system and the traditional flat plate solar heating system at zero-reduced temperature was 38.6% and 48.4%, respectively. Based on experimental results, the SH-RC system showed a considerable performance for both diurnal solar heating and nocturnal radiative cooling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, numerical and experimental studies were performed to explain the effect of hydrogen enrichment on LPG fuelled engine; and consequently its effect on in-cylinder flow characteristics, engine performances and exhaust emissions. Also, the influence of the intake system geometry on in-cylinder mixture flow behavior was studied. The in-cylinder flow velocity, turbulence characteristics and hydrogen mass fraction were evaluated in the intake stroke in order to analyze the intake flow behavior. For this purpose, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code is adopted. The variation of brake torque (BT), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), NOx and CO emissions for various engine speeds were investigated for gasoline, LPG and LPG-hydrogen fuelled engines, using an experimental study. Engine performances were investigated on various fractions of LPG-hydrogen blends (0%, 10% and 20% of H-2). The results has shown that the BT produced by LPG-hydrogen blend is increased by 12% and 20% compared to gasoline and pure LPG operations respectively when the hydrogen fraction equal to 20%, particularly for high engine speeds. CO emissions tend to be eliminated with the addition of hydrogen. NOx emissions for LPG-hydrogen operation was decreased by 3.25% and 1.89% compared to gasoline and LPG fuels, respectively. Simulation and experiments results demonstrate the benefits of the hydrogen enrichment on the in-cylinder flow characteristics and engine performances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The needle shutdown of fuel injectors leads to an undesired fuel dribble that forms unburned hydrocarbons and decreases the engine thermal efficiency in modern engines. Understanding of the fuel dribbling process is of great importance to establish its minimization strategy for optimal use of conventional fuels. However, the detailed needle dynamics and in-and near-nozzle flow characteristics governing the fuel dribble process have not been thoroughly understood. In this study, the needle dynamics, in-and near-nozzle flow characteristics and fuel dribble of a mini-sac type three-hole diesel injector were investigated using a high-speed X-ray phase-contrast imaging technique at different injection pressures. The results showed that an increase in injection pressure increased the flow evacuation velocity at the needle close that induced a more intense fuel cavitation and air ingestion inside the nozzle. The fuel dribbling process showed a high shot-to-shot deviation. A statistical analysis of 50-shot results exhibited two breakup modes of fuel dribble determined by the flow evacuation velocity at the needle close and presence of air ingestion. In the first mode, the fast breakup with a short residence time of fuel dribble occurred. Meanwhile, the dripping of undisturbed liquid column with a long residence time of fuel dribble occurred in the second mode. An increase in injection pressure increased the population of the first mode due to more intense air ingestion that primarily caused by an increase in needle closing speed other than an increase in peak injection velocity. Based on the results, the formation mechanism and control strategies of the fuel dribble from modern diesel injectors were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems in Building Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (BCHP) plants are attracting more attentions nowadays in China. In this paper, a simple linear programming optimization model is developed for BCHP systems with an Ice Storage System (ISS), a hybrid Electric Chiller (EC) and Absorption Chiller (AC). Two BCHP systems (one with TES and the other without TES) are compared with the conventional system in a super high-rise building in Shanghai city. The design and operation of both BCHP systems are optimized with the linear programming tool. The results show that natural gas price is the most important factor regarding the economic performance of the BCHP plants, followed by electricity utility price and the price of the prime motor. In this case study, both BCHP options show higher energy use efficiency and better economic performance than the conventional solution. Compared with the BCHP system without TES, the one with TES has similar energy efficiency level, but lower operation cost due to its load shifting capability. Thus, considering the overall life cycle cost, the BCHP system with TES option is suggested to be used in similar high-rise buildings in Shanghai city. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We model scenarios of the U.S. electric sector in which wind generation reaches 10% of end-use electricity demand in 2020, 20% in 2030, and 35% in 2050. As shown in a companion paper, achieving these penetration levels would have significant implications for the wind industry and the broader electric sector. Compared to a baseline that assumes no new wind deployment, under the primary scenario modeled, achieving these penetrations imposes an incremental cost to electricity consumers of less than 1% through 2030. These cost implications, however, should be balanced against the variety of environmental and social implications of such a scenario. Relative to a baseline that assumes no new wind deployment, our analysis shows that the high-penetration wind scenario yields potential greenhouse-gas benefits of $85-$1,230 billion in present-value terms, with a central estimate of $400 billion. Air-pollution-related health benefits are estimated at $52-$272 billion, while annual electric-sector water withdrawals and consumption are lower by 15% and 23% in 2050, respectively. We also find that a high-wind-energy future would have implications for the diversity and risk of energy supply, local economic development, and land use and related local impacts on communities and ecosystems; however, these additional impacts may not greatly affect aggregate social welfare owing to their nature, in part, as resource transfers.

Abstract: CO2 separation for natural gas purification by the adsorption method was studied in detail using volumetric adsorption apparatus. The crystalline phase and microstructure of the experimental sample were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The XRD pattern proves that the experimental sample consists of 13X zeolites. The SEM images show that the 13X zeolites expose a large number of micro-channels on the surface of the particles. The microporous volume is 0.22 cm(3) (STP)/g. The ideal swing frequency for the adsorption tank can improve the adsorption performance of an adsorbent compared with a static adsorption tank. The pure CO2 adsorption experimental data agrees well with the extended Langmuir model. The Langmuir-Freundlich model correlates the CO2/CH4 mixture adsorption experimental data fairly well. The relative errors between the simulated results and the experimental data are very little, which indicates that these fitted models are correct. The average selectivity of CO2/CH4 in a static and swing adsorption tank are, respectively, 3.57 and 3.93, considerably higher than 1, indicating preferential CO2 adsorption over CH4 in CO2/CH4 mixtures. This also shows that the swing can improve CO2 separation for natural gas purification. For the three types of motion status, the temperature of the adsorption tank increased in the order swing 2 > swingl > static state for pure CO2 adsorption in 13X zeolites. The temperature variation decreased as the pressure increased. The amplitude and time of temperature variations in the adsorption tank can explain the adsorption capacity and adsorption speed. This research will improve the efficiency of offshore natural gas exploitation, and will affect the optimization of energy structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An investigation of the effects of contour conditions and fuel properties on the auto-ignition and combustion process under HCCI conditions is presented in this study. A parametric variation of initial temperature, intake pressure, compression ratio, oxygen concentration and equivalence ratio has been carried out for Primary Reference Fuels in a Rapid Compression Expansion Machine while applying spectroscopy. The results have also been contrasted with natural chemiluminescence measurements. Additionally, the experiments have been simulated in CHEMKIN and the results derived from the optical techniques have been compared with the results from the chemical kinetics of the process, validating the chemical kinetic mechanism and an additional sub-model of excited OH*. Two different scenarios can be seen according to the results from the spectrograph. For very lean or very low-temperature combustions no peak of OH* is seen at 310 nm of wavelength, proving that the luminosity came from the CO continuum rather than from the OH*. However, for more intense combustions (richer equivalence ratios, higher temperatures or lower EGR rates) spectrography shows a clear peak of OH* that has much longer time of life than the corresponding to the CO continuum. The main chemical reaction that causes this two scenarios has been identified as H + HO2 double right arrow 2OH. The increase of relevance of this reaction at high combustion temperatures causes a higher OH* accumulation, which leads to a brighter OH* emission. Finally, for low temperature combustions the CO continuum out-shines the OH* radiation so the light emitted by this radical cannot be detected by means of natural chemiluminescence.

Abstract: A direct injection (DI) diesel engine is tested in this work with biodiesel-diesel and biodiesel-diesel cold flow additive blends for emissions at idling conditions. Biodiesel is produced from pure canola oil by transesterification process and the effect of a cold flow additive, Wintron Synergy in different proportions is examined for cold flow property (cloud point) and engine emissions. Systematic tests are undertaken over different engine speeds (800, 1000 and 1200 rpm), with 0, 20, 50 and 100 vol% of biodiesel in biodiesel-diesel and 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 vol% of Wintron Synergy in biodiesel-diesel-additive blends. The emission of carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbon (HC), acetaldehyde and formaldehyde from different blends are measured and compared to neat diesel emissions. Test results show that B20S2 has the lowest cloud point of the fuel blends at -34.8 degrees C. Biodiesel and Synergy are found to be effective in reducing both CO and HC emissions. Biodiesel and Synergy content can increase NOx emissions. After warmup, acetaldehyde emissions remain the same for all tests at 5 ppm and formaldehyde emissions increases for all fuel blends and neat diesel. It is also found that Synergy can change the crystal size and structure of biodiesel-diesel blend B20. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study mainly aims to investigate the effect of reformer gas (RG) addition on the performance of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines using a multi zone model. The developed model is validated using a wide range of experimental data of a cooperative fuel research engine. Blended fuels of isooctane and n-heptane, known as primary reference fuels, with different octane numbers are used as the main engine fuel. A semi detailed chemical-kinetic mechanism containing 101 species and 594 reactions is used to simulate the combustion of blended fuels. The study is performed with different percentages of RG (0-30%). The results show that RG reduces the rate of some H abstraction reactions, which extends the fuel decomposition time and decreases the peak of the low temperature heat release rate. The peak values of OH, H2O2, and HO2 radicals decreased by RG addition. RG addition retards the start of combustion, reduces in-cylinder peak pressure and temperature, and affects combustion duration and exhaust emissions. When RG concentration is increased, the levels of exhaust carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons increase and that of nitrogen oxides decrease. The results show that the chemical effects of RG on the HCCI combustion of primary reference fuels are stronger than dilution and thermodynamic effects. The chemical effects of RG increase when the concentration of isooctane decreases in blended fuels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In 2014 the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) adopted the global technical regulation No. 15 concerning the Worldwide harmonized Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP). Having significantly contributed to its development, the European Commission is now aiming at introducing the new test procedure in the European type-approval legislation for light duty vehicles in order to replace the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) as the certification test.
The current paper aims to assess the effect of WLTP introduction on the reported CO2 emissions from passenger cars presently measured under the New European Driving Cycle and the corresponding test protocol. The most important differences between the two testing procedures, apart from the kinematic characteristics of the respective driving cycles, is the determination of the vehicle inertia and driving resistance, the gear shifting sequence, the soak and test temperature and the post-test charge balance correction applied to WLTP. In order to quantify and analyze the effect of these differences in the end value of CO2 emissions, WLTP and NEDC CO2 emission measurements were performed on 20 vehicles, covering almost the whole European market. WLTP CO2 values range from 125.5 to 217.9 g/km, NEDC values range from 105.4 to 213.2 g/km and the Delta CO2 between WLTP and NEDC ranges from 4.7 to 29.2 g/km for the given vehicle sample. The average cold start effect over WLTP was found 6.1 g/km, while for NEDC it was found 12.3 g/km. For a small gasoline and a medium sized diesel passenger car, the different inertia mass and driving resistance is responsible 63% and 81% of the observed Delta CO2 between these two driving cycles respectively, whereas the other parameters (driving profile, gear shifting, test temperature) account for the remaining 37% and 19%.

Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT), which transmits power by an electromagnetic field across an intervening space, provides the prospect of new opportunities for electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance sustainable mobility. This review article evaluates WPT technology for EV applications from both technical and sustainability perspectives. The objectives of this review include: (1) to present the state-of-the-art technical progress and research bottlenecks in WPT development and applications in the transportation sector; (2) to characterize the demonstrations of the real-world deployment of WPT EV systems; and (3) to evaluate the sustainable performance and identify challenges and opportunities for improvement. From the technical perspective, progress on coil design, compensation topologies, and power electronics converters and control methods are reviewed with a focus on system performance. From the sustainability perspective, performance is defined in terms of energy, environmental, and economic metrics, and policy drivers and issues of health and safety are also examined.

Abstract: Biomass torrefaction and wind power with natural gas are compared to determine which renewable energy system to adopt when both plant biomass and wind are available. The renewability of both systems was compared in terms of energy return on investment (EROI) by quantifying the fossil energy input and renewable energy output. On the basis of a functionally equivalent amount of electrical power (100 MWe) and heat (50 MWth), a breakeven wind velocity of 9.875 m/s resulted in both systems having the same EROI. In regions with available biomass feedstock, facilities suitable for biomass power and wind velocities below 9 m/s, torrefaction is a more renewable approach. Conversely, regions with velocities greater than 10 m/s or little access to biomass sources and facilities, wind combined with natural gas is superior. Due to average wind speeds below 10 m/s and the wide availability of biomass in Michigan, the torrefaction bioenergy system outperforms the wind-natural gas system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is a promising power source for portable applications. This study aims to reveal the two-phase flow characteristics of an active liquid-feed DMFC by using the visualization method. Different flow fields based on the serpentine, parallel and porous patterns and their effects on reactant and product managements are experimentally investigated. Results show that the performance of serpentine flow field is closely influenced by the change of methanol feed rate but the parallel pattern shows less sensitivity. The use of serpentine flow field enables the fuel cell to be operated with a higher methanol concentration. A higher methanol feed rate promotes removal of the produced gas bubbles. The oxygen feed rate has a negligible effect on the fuel cell with a cathode serpentine flow field but produces a more obvious performance difference in the case of parallel pattern. The visualization tests indicate that the use of a higher oxygen flow rate is helpful in water removal. The temperature characteristics of the anode serpentine channel are evaluated and how the temperature behaviors relate to different operating conditions are accordingly discussed.

Abstract: Woody biomass has been considered as a low carbon or carbon neutral source of energy when viewed from the life cycle perspective. Analytical techniques generally assume that there is a connection between the biogenic forest system and the anthropogenic biomass electricity generation system. In the conventional approach, carbon emission from the biomass electricity generation system assumes to be completely sequestered by the replenishment of the forest. There are fundamental issues with the assumption of complete sequestration. These issues are caused by critical errors in formulating the system and boundary conditions. In the attempt to detect and resolve these errors, the concept of partial temporal boundary for synchronizing interconnected systems over a common life cycle is introduced to facilitate accurate formulation of the boundary conditions. Findings from the case studies demonstrate that woody biomass is not carbon neutral. Instead, coal may be considered as a carbon neutral source of energy when connected to the biogenic forest system. This study concludes that woody biomass can negatively impact the global climate policy developments if the current misunderstanding continues. Furthermore, managed rotation for woody biomass production can cause harmful impacts to the larger environmental and ecological spheres by introducing constant disturbance to the biogenic forest system. As such, it is doubtful whether woody biomass is a sustainable source of energy for addressing global climate targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Urban areas in developed countries are characterized by an increasing decline in air quality state mainly due to the exhaust emissions from vehicles. Besides, due to catalyst improvements and electronic mixture control of last generation engines, nowadays CO and HC cold start extra-emissions are heavily higher than emissions exhausted in hot conditions, with a clear consequence on air quality of the urban contexts. Ethanol combined with gasoline can be widely used as an alternative fuel due to the benefit of its high octane number and its self-sustaining characteristics. Ethanol, in fact, is well known as potential alcohol alternative fuel for SI engines, since it can be blended with gasoline to increase oxygen content, then decreasing CO and HC emissions and the depletion of fossil fuels.
Literature data about cold emissive behaviour of SI engines powered with ethanol/gasoline blended fuels are rather limited. For this reason, the aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the effect of ethanol/gasoline blends on CO and HC cold start emissions of four-stroke SI engines: a last generation motorcycle was operated on the chassis dynamometer for exhaust emission measurements without change to the engine design, while the ethanol was mixed with unleaded gasoline in different percentages (10, 20 and 30 vol.%). Results of the experimental tests and the application of a new calculation procedure, designed and optimised to model the cold transient behaviour of SI engines using different ethanol-gasoline blends, indicate that CO and HC cold start emissions decrease compared to the use of commercial gasoline, with the 20% v/v ethanol blend achieving the highest emission reduction. Moreover, in this paper a review of the recent scientific literatures was performed on the emissive behaviour of SI engines fuelled with ethanol-gasoline blended fuels. (C) 2016 Elseviei. Ltd.

Abstract: We offer a simulation of low-carbon electricity supply for Australia, based on currently and economically operating technologies and proven resources, contributing new knowledge by: featuring a GIS-based spatial optimisation process for identifying suitable generator locations; including expanded transmission networks; covering the entire continent; and investigating the significance of biofuel availability and carbon price. We find that nation-wide low-carbon electricity supply is possible at about 160 GW installed capacity, at indicative cost of around 20 (sic)/kWh, involving wind, concentrating solar, and PV utilities, and less than 20 TWh of biofuelled generation. Dispatchable hydro and biofuel plants are required to plug gaps caused by occasional low-resource periods. Technology and cost breakthroughs for storage, geothermal, and ocean technologies, as well as offshore wind deployment would substantially alter our assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Energy storage is nowadays recognised as a key element in modern energy supply chain. This is mainly because it can enhance grid stability, increase penetration of renewable energy resources, improve the efficiency of energy systems, conserve fossil energy resources and reduce environmental impact of energy generation. Although there are many energy storage technologies already reviewed in the literature, these technologies are currently at different levels of technological maturity with a few already proven for commercial scale application. Most of the review papers in energy storage highlight these technologies in details, however; there remains limited information on the real life application of these technologies for energy storage purpose. This review paper aims to address this gap by providing a detailed analysis of real life application and performance of the different energy storage technologies. The paper discusses the concept of energy storage, the different technologies for the storage of energy with more emphasis on the storage of secondary forms of energy (electricity and heat) as well as a detailed analysis of various energy storage projects all over the world. In the final part of this paper, some of the challenges hindering the commercial deployment of energy storage technologies are also highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Due to the discrepancy between simulated energy consumption and measured data, it is essential to calibrate building energy models to improve its fidelity in evaluating the performance of retrofitting. Currently, most calibration methods are conducted manually to minimize this discrepancy, heavily relying on the knowledge and experience of analysts to discover a reasonable set of parameters. Because of the myriad independent and interdependent variables involved, the reliability of the entire simulation is largely undermined. In the presented paper, we propose a complete and fluent optimization automated calibration flow by introducing the mathematical optimization method (Particle Swarm Optimization is adopted) into the building energy model calibration process, thus leveraging the advantages of the efficiency and flexibility of the automated computer procedure. This approach is also characterized by its inclusivity, for it is compatible with other advanced manual methods and able to largely assist the experts in improving the efficiency of tuning relative input parameters. Moreover, a case in Shanghai is presented to verify the validity of the proposed method. After calibration, the simulation model demonstrates a satisfactory predicting accuracy. The calculated electricity consumption from the HVAC, lighting and equipment matches the actual monitored data with 11.6%, 7.3% and 7.2% CV (RMSE), respectively, and the total electricity consumption is within 6.1%.

Abstract: This work focuses on the design and operation of a heterogeneous combustor capable of operating on both gaseous and liquid fuels, featuring a highly porous (up to 90% porosity) silicon carbide ceramic media within the combustion chamber where the combustion reactions take place. Four interlinked devices - a heat exchanger, a vaporization chamber where liquid fuel may be injected, a mixing chamber, and combustion chamber - comprise the flow loop of the combustor. Operation of the combustor is presented using temperatures recorded via thermocouples at various locations in the flow loop as well as along the axis of the combustion chamber. Demonstration of the combustor's ability to operate on gaseous methane and air at a low equivalence ratio of 0.50 is presented across various total flow rates. Additionally, the ability of the combustor to operate on liquid fuel was also verified upon the inclusion of kerosene in the fuel-air mixture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermodynamic and economic analysis of two variants (W1 and W2) of an oxy-type power plant (with or without waste heat recovery) are presented in this paper. This plant consists of: a hard-coal-fired pulverized-fuel boiler, a steam turbine unit, a CO2 capture and compression unit and an air separation unit (with a four-end-type high-temperature membrane). A steam turboset gross electric power of 600 MW was assumed. Variants of the oxy-type plant have different live steam parameters (W1-650 degrees C/30 MPa; W2-700 degrees C/35 MPa), reheated steam parameters (W1-670 degrees C/6 MPa; W2-720 degrees C/6.5 MPa) and structures of the steam turbine unit. Two methods of utilization of waste heat were analyzed: replacement of regenerative feed water heaters and implementation of an additional ORC unit. The characteristics of the thermodynamic and economic analysis of the analyzed plant were determined as a function of the air compressor pressure ratio (beta) and oxygen recovery rate (R). The values of these quantities were determined to ensure maximal net efficiency of the plant and the best value of the economic indicator. The results show that utilization of waste heat is essential for efficiency and economic indicator values of the oxy-type plant and optimal values of beta and R. The net efficiency of the oxy-type plant can be 4.06 p.p. lower than the analogous efficiency of the reference plant (consisting of a classic pulverized-fuel boiler and steam turbine unit). This decrease of the efficiency is one of the lowest among the CO2 capture technologies. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sets an overall framework for intergovernmental efforts to tackle the challenge posed by climate change. Besides the "flexibility mechanisms" defined by the Kyoto Protocol to lower the overall costs of achieving their emissions targets, The Voluntary Green House Gases (GHG) reduction projects can have a lead role in GHG reduction in "non Emissions Trading System ETS sectors". Nowadays, the voluntary market is characterised by critical aspects, such as fragmentation, lack of accounting, monitoring and validation rules that have led to the low spread of voluntary emission reduction projects developed by local authorities in the European Union despite their high potentiality.
The aim of this paper is to test the applicability of voluntary emission reduction projects in the public sector following a homogeneous and consistent pattern. A research has been performed at local level on 143 voluntary emission reduction projects implemented by Public Administrations in Northern and Central Italy in renewable energy, energy efficiency and transport sectors. The applicable standards and methodologies have been checked and the case studies have been analysed though a three-step process: Preliminary additionality assessment; Projects selection; Validation of the selected project. The assessment shows that energy efficiency projects, once overcoming additionality issues, are the most promising for public entities while renewable energy and transport projects resulted to be mainly affected by double counting problems and lack of reliable methodologies.

Abstract: This paper evaluates potential changes in the power system associated with sustained growth in wind generation in the United States to 35% of end-use demand by 2050; Wiser et al. (2016) evaluate societal benefits and other impacts for this same scenario. Under reference or central conditions, the analysis finds cumulative wind capacity of 404 gigawatts (GW) would be required to reach this level and drive 2050 incremental electricity rate and cumulative electric sector savings of 2% and 3% respectively, relative to a scenario with no new wind capacity additions. Greater savings are estimated under higher fossil fuel costs or with greater advancements in wind technologies. Conversely, incremental costs are found when fossil fuel costs are lower than central assumptions or wind technology improvements are more-limited. Through 2030, the primary generation sources displaced by new wind capacity include natural gas and coal-fired generation. By 2050, wind could displace other renewables. Incremental new transmission infrastructure totaling 29 million megawatt-miles is estimated to be needed by 2050. In conjunction with related societal benefits, this work demonstrates that 35% wind energy by 2050 is plausible, could support enduring benefits, and could result in long-term consumer savings, if nearer-term (pre-2030) cost barriers are overcome; at the same time, these opportunities are not anticipated to be realized in their full form "under "business-as-usual" conditions.

Abstract: The safe operation of appliances is of great concern to users. The safety risk increases when the appliances are in operation during periods when users are not at home or when they are asleep. In this paper, multi objective demand side scheduling is investigated with consideration to the appliances' operational safety together with the electricity cost and the operational delay. The formulation of appliances' operational safety is proposed based on users' at-home status and awake status. Then the relationships between the operational safety and the other two objectives are investigated through the approach of finding the Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, this approach is compared with the Weigh and Constraint approaches. As the Pareto-optimal front consists of a set of optimal solutions, this paper proposes a method to make the final scheduling decision based on the relationships among the multiple objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that the operational safety is improved with the sacrifice of the electricity cost and the operational delay, and that the approach of finding the Pareto-optimal front is effective in presenting comprehensive optimal solutions of the multi-objective demand side scheduling.

Abstract: This paper presents an Energy Use Intensity (EUI) indicator model for energy benchmarking subway stations.
Among the mass transportation systems, a subway, in terms of its rapidity, punctuality, and efficiency, has been preferred in metropolitan area and recently spotlighted as it mitigates environmental impacts to global warming. Of its several advantages, a subway's carbon footprint is negligible, which directly contributes to energy savings. Therefore, demands of subway systems have increased.
However, subway stations have rarely been included in most energy performance studies and surveys. Due to a lack of information and design complexity, most designers are not able to do optimal design practices.
A statistical model was developed in this study using the benchmark process for 157 actual subway stations in Seoul, South Korea. It includes measured data, utility bills, simulation results, and regression modeling. This adjusted EUI benchmark model was developed using characteristics of subway stations and a statistical validation process. The effectiveness of the model is tested and verified by comparing between measured EUI and adjusted normalized EUI (EUInorm) of actual subway stations. This paper includes the test results of EUI indicator model to benchmark energy performance and assesses existing subway station. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The green economy policy discourse has devoted a lot of attention to the design of public policy addressing low-carbon technologies. In this paper we examine the impacts of public R&D support and feed-in tariff schemes on innovation in the wind energy sector. The analysis is conducted using patent application data for four western European countries over the period, 1977-2009. Different model specifications are tested, and the analysis highlights important policy interaction effects. The results indicate that both public R&D support and feed-in tariffs have positively affected patent application counts in the wind power sector. The (marginal) impact on patent applications of increases in feed-tariffs has also become more profound as the wind power technology has matured. There is also some evidence of policy interaction effects in that the impact of public R&D support to wind power is greater at the margin if it is accompanied by the use of feed-in tariff schemes. These results support the notion that technological innovation requires both R&D and learning-by-doing, and for this reason public R&D programs should typically not be designed in isolation from practical applications. The paper ends by outlining some important avenues for future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy efficiency policies play a key role in the transformation to a 'green energy economy'. In this paper, we take stock of the impacts of the existing energy efficiency policy instruments in Germany and review the energy, environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the country's latest energy efficiency and climate strategies for the year 2020. We find evidence supporting the findings of other studies that enhanced green energy policies will trigger tangible economic benefits in terms of GDP growth and new jobs even in the short term. Whereas policy makers have already acknowledged and implemented this conclusion in the case of renewable energies, our paper shows that striving for more ambitious energy efficiency policies represents a similar win-win strategy, which should be exploited to a much larger extent.

Abstract: Natural ventilation (NV) is a key sustainable solution for reducing the energy use in buildings, improving thermal comfort, and maintaining a healthy indoor environment. However, the energy savings and environmental benefits are affected greatly by ambient air pollution in China. Here we estimate the NV potential of all major Chinese cities based on weather, ambient air quality, building configuration, and newly constructed square footage of office buildings in the year of 2015. In general, little NV potential is observed in northern China during the winter and southern China during the summer. Kunming located in the Southwest China is the most weather-favorable city for natural ventilation, and reveals almost no loss due to air pollution. Building Energy Simulation (BES) is conducted to estimate the energy savings of natural ventilation in which ambient air pollution and total square footage at each city must be taken into account. Beijing, the capital city, displays limited per-square-meter saving potential due to the unfavorable weather and air quality for natural ventilation, but its largest total square footage of office buildings makes it become the city with the greatest energy saving opportunity in China. Our analysis shows that the aggregated energy savings potential of office buildings at 35 major Chinese cities is 112 GWh in 2015, even after allowing for a 43 GWh loss due to China's serious air pollution issue especially in North China. 8-78% of the cooling energy consumption can be potentially reduced by natural ventilation depending on local weather and air quality. The findings here provide guidelines for improving current energy and environmental policies in China, and a direction for reforming building codes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: More than 80% of energy is consumed during operation phase of a building's life cycle, so energy efficiency retrofit for existing buildings is considered a promising way to reduce energy use in buildings. The investment strategies of retrofit depend on the ability to quantify energy savings by "measurement and verification" (M&V), which compares actual energy consumption to how much energy would have been used without retrofit (called the "baseline" of energy use). Although numerous models exist for predicting baseline of energy use, a critical limitation is that occupancy has not been included as a variable. However, occupancy rate is essential for energy consumption and was emphasized by previous studies. This study develops a new baseline model which is built upon the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) model but includes the use of building occupancy data. The study also proposes metrics to quantify the accuracy of prediction and the impacts of variables. However, the results show that including occupancy data does not significantly improve the accuracy of the baseline model, especially for HVAC load. The reasons are discussed further. In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the influence of parameters in baseline models. The results from this study can help us understand the influence of occupancy on energy use, improve energy baseline prediction by including the occupancy factor, reduce risks of M&V and facilitate investment strategies of energy efficiency retrofit.

Abstract: Polymers have rarely been used as storage materials in latent heat storages up to now. Thus, we systematically screened all polymers available on a large-scale, selected promising ones based on their theoretical properties and experimentally tested more than 50 candidates. We found that polyethylene, polyoxymethylene and polyamides are promising even as recycled material. Especially high density polyethylene (HDPE) turned out to be suitable as was shown by detailed thermophysical characterization including more than 1000 heating and cooling cycles for INEOS Rigidex HD6070EA. We built a storage with 170 kg HDPE and a total mass of 600 kg based on a fin-tube heat exchanger and characterized its energy capacity, power characteristics and temperature profiles using a thermal oil test rig. A 3-dimensional model was implemented in ANSYS Fluent achieving excellent agreement between experiment and simulation. By analyzing the internal heat transfer contributions, temperature distributions and flow conditions, we were able to propose an optimized design and operation for future polymer latent heat storages.

Abstract: The demand for energy is continually increasing day after day; but at the same time, investigations around the world into sustainable sources of power are growing in number. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) can act as an efficient low cost energy conversion system to produce electricity which could lead to reducing the continuous demand on conventional fossil fuels. Most of the literature concerning CSP concentrates on the heat losses and their relationship to the receivers' geometries; where these receivers are evaluated according to their thermal efficiency. The majority of the literature has often neglected heat gain enhancement by the receivers' geometries, which helps to increase the heat transfer to the working fluid. This work concentrates on the optical efficiency as well as the heat flux distribution of three different geometries. The cylindrical, conical and spherical geometries of a cavity receiver are considered with the objective of analysing their optical and thermal behaviour optically and thermally, using the ray tracing method and a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model. The results showed that the conical shape of the receiver gathered, as well as absorbed, a higher amount of reflected flux energy than the other shapes, with about 91% and 82% for 75% and 85% absorption ratios respectively. The cavity receiver shapes and their absorption ratio are key parameters which affect the focal point location; thereby there is an optimum distance for each design depending on these two parameters. The results of the simulated work are validated using the experimental work found in the literature. Overall, in order to evaluate the heat balance, 3-D thermal analysis was employed using Fluent 15 and the amount of heat losses for the three shapes was determined. It was observed that the conical shape receiver experienced a lower heat loss. To ensure more confidence in the results, the thermal outcomes were validated against experimental works in the literature and they demonstrated good agreement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A packed-bed thermocline tank represents a proved cheaper thermal energy storage for concentrated solar power plants compared with the commonly-built two-tank system. However, its implementation has been stopped mainly due to the vessel's thermal ratcheting concern, which would compromise its structural integrity. In order to have a better understanding of the commercial viability of thermocline approach, regarding energetic effectiveness and structural reliability, a new numerical simulation platform has been developed. The model dynamically solves and couples all the significant components of the subsystem, being able to evaluate its thermal and mechanical response over plant normal operation. The filler material is considered as a cohesionless bulk solid with thermal expansion. For the stresses on the tank wall the general thermoelastic theory is used. First, the numerical model is validated with the Solar One thermocline case, and then a parametric analysis is carried out by settling this storage technology in two real plants with a temperature rise of 100 degrees C and 275 degrees C. The numerical results show a better storage performance together with the lowest temperature difference, but both options achieve suitable structural factors of safety with a proper design.

Abstract: A novel liquefied natural gas (LNG) cryogenic energy utilization method for gas turbine inlet air cooling is proposed in this work. In this method, the temperature difference potential between LNG and cooling medium is utilized step by step. The novel cold production process consists of a CO2 Rankine cycle subsystem and a CO2 compression-refrigeration subsystem. A sensitivity analysis is performed to optimize the performance of the proposed novel cold production process. Results show that the cold energy output of the novel process is increased by about 36.5%, compared with that of the conventional cold production process via direct LNG evaporation. The off-design performance of the gas turbine combined cycle under different ambient conditions is also analyzed to identify the effect of the cold production process for inlet air cooling on a combined cycle power plant. The results indicated that by applying the novel cold production method for inlet air cooling, the combined cycle relative power output increment varies from 1.6% to 11.6%, when air humidity changes from 90% to 30%, compared with that without inlet air cooling. The combined cycle relative power and relative efficiency by the novel air cooling is by 0.50-2.47% and 0-0.11%, respectively, higher than that by conventional inlet air cooling. The novel cold production process is beneficial to the augmentation of cold energy output and combined cycle power output. However, there is no significant difference in the combined cycle efficiency between the novel and the conventional power systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources, but is intermittent by its nature. The study of efficient thermal heat storage technologies is of fundamental importance for the development of solar power systems. This work focuses on a robust mathematical model of a Latent Heat Storage (LHS) system constituted by a storage tank containing Phase Change Material spheres. The model, developed in EES environment, provides the time-dependent temperature profiles for the PCM and the heat transfer fluid flowing in the storage tank, and the energy and exergy stored as well.
A case study on the application of the LHS technology is also presented. The operation of a solar power plant associated with a latent heat thermal storage and an ORC unit is simulated under dynamic (time-varying) solar radiation conditions with the software TRNSYS. The performance of the proposed plant is simulated over a one week period, and the results show that the system is able to provide power in 78.5% of the time, with weekly averaged efficiencies of 13.4% for the ORC unit, and of 3.9% for the whole plant (from solar radiation to net power delivered by the ORC expander).

Abstract: Power systems that plan to replace generation of energy from conventional sources to renewable sources need to increase flexibility. While most demand side management (DSM) models are limited to load shedding, as communications technology develops, using a DSM model that includes load shifting is becoming feasible. Our study focuses renewable energy management with a DSM model that contains two M/M/s queues: queue 1 for renewable and queue 2 for fossil-fired energy. As the queue length for renewable energy increases, new customers who had originally wanted renewable energy service may opt for fossil-fired energy service. Due to this behavior, having dependent M/M/s queues is more realistic than independent ones. The service provider can maximize profit by allocating server capacity and setting pricing for each kind of service. Besides, we propose a coordination policy: when there are m customers in the queue of renewable service and some fossil-fired energy servers are available, the service provider invite the first customer of the queue of the renewable energy service to be served in the fossil-fired energy server but the price charged to the customer will be the low price. Sharing resources between the two kinds of service can improve service system utilization, so as to benefit both the service provider and customers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel compression heat pump driven and hollow fiber membrane-based two-stage liquid desiccant air dehumidification system is presented. The liquid desiccant droplets are prevented from crossing over into the process air by the semi-permeable membranes. The isoenthalpic processes are changed to quasi isothermal processes by the two-stage dehumidification processes. The system is set up and a model is proposed for simulation. Heat and mass capacities in the system, including the membrane modules, the condenser, the evaporator and the heat exchangers are modeled in detail. The model is also validated experimentally. Compared with a single-stage dehumidification system, the two-stage system has a lower solution concentration exiting from the dehumidifier and a lower condensing temperature. Thus, a better thermodynamic system performance is realized and the COP can be increased by about 20% under the typical hot and humid conditions in Southern China. The allocations of heat and mass transfer areas in the system are also investigated. It is found that the optimal regeneration to dehumidification area ratio is 1.33. The optimal first to second stage dehumidification area ratio is 1.4; and the optimal first to second stage regeneration area ratio is 1.286. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a study on the characterization of the performance of a water-to-water heat pump of 40.5 kW fixed heating capacity under different cycling conditions scenarios. Semi-virtual laboratory experiments were conducted to analyse the influence of inertia from 1.23 to 24.7 L/kW on the efficiency of the heat pump operating at partial load. Different parameterizations in standards were compared to assess their ability to predict the energy efficiency degradation caused by cycling. Performance deterioration at part load was found to be highly dependent on inertia conditions, with non-negligible start-up parasitic effects detected for the heat pump under study, particularly for decreasing inertia. Results suggest that current standards for characterising the performance of systems at partial load, such as the European EN14825, should be reviewed to account for the influence of inertia on equipment performance and for the potential occurrence of start-up efficiency losses for water-to-water heat pumps. An expression is derived in this study for the start-up losses degradation coefficient C-d and a single parameterization accounting for different sources of efficiency losses is proposed, together with a simple method to determine degradation coefficients from reduced experimentation.

Abstract: Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) are an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional heating and cooling systems because of their high efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions. The ground acts as a heat sink/source for the excess/required heat inside a building for cooling and heating modes, respectively. However, imbalance in heating and cooling needs can change ground temperature over the operating duration. This increase/decrease in ground temperature lowers system efficiency and causes the ground to foul-failing to accept or provide more heat. In order to ensure that GSHPs can operate to their designed conditions, thermal modelling is required to simulate the ground temperature during system operation. In addition, the borehole field layout can have a major impact on ground temperature. In this study, four buildings were studied-a hospital, fast-food restaurant, residence, and school, each with varying borehole configurations. Boreholes were modelled in a soil volume using finite-element methods and heating and cooling fluxes were applied to the borehole walls to simulate the GSHP operation. 20 years of operation were modelled for each building for 2 x 2, 4 x 4, and 2 x 8 borehole configurations. Results indicate that the borehole separation distance of 6 m, recommended by ASHRAE, is not always sufficient to prevent borehole thermal interactions. Benefits of using a 2 x 8 configuration as opposed to a 4 x 4 configuration, which can be observed because of the larger perimeter it provides for heat to dissipate to surrounding soil were quantified. This study indicates that it is important to carefully consider ground temperature during the operation of a GSHP. Borehole separation distances, layout, and hybridization should be studied to alleviate ground fouling problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: With the different kinds of fuel now available, modern spark ignition engines have to be adapted, owing not only to the difference between the characteristic heat of combustion of the different fuels, but also to the response of the flame to stretch. As the burning rate is a function of the laminar burning speed which is a function of the flame stretch, this parameter has to be taken into account by combustion models.
In this study, a zero-dimensional combustion model, based on the Flame Surface Density equation, is enhanced with a model for the stretched laminar burning speed. Numerical results are compared with the experimental results of three lean air-fuel mixtures with isooctane, propane and methane as fuels, that have similar unstretched laminar burning speeds but different Lewis numbers. Laminar burning speed, flame radius, burnt mass fraction, and turbulent flame wrinkling are compared with experimental results. The simulation trends are similar to those of experimental results. Methane and propane (Lewis number 0.99 and 1.80 respectively) show similar wrinkling rates, while isooctane (Lewis number 2.90) has a lower wrinkling rate. The observed difference between computed burnt mass fraction with stretched and unstretched flame speed models reveals that the impact of stretch and Lewis number needs to be taken into account and that a stretched laminar burning speed must be used for modeling, especially for mixtures with a Lewis number much greater than unity.

Abstract: China has set ambitious goals for the development of offshore wind energy to meet the increasing energy demand of coastal provinces. Many studies have assessed the potential offshore wind energy in Chinese territorial waters. However, few studies have focused on the climatology, variability, and extreme climate of wind speeds and wind power, especially at hub height in this area. This type of study is important for selecting promising sites for offshore wind farms. In the present study, a 35-year (1979-2013) high resolution (7 km) wind hindcast over the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea (BYS) at 100-m height was constructed using the regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM) driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. The quality of wind speeds reconstructed by CCLM was assessed by a comparison with observation data at several stations. After verification, the climatology, variability, and extreme climate of winds over the BYS were spatially and temporally investigated. The results show that the 35-year mean wind speed is mostly between 7.0 and 7.5 m/s; in the coastal areas of the BYS, the mean is less than 7.0 m/s, and in the remote offshore areas, the mean is greater than 7.5 m/s. The daily mean wind speed is stronger (weaker) in winter (summer) half year, with stronger (weaker) spatial variability. Wind power density is mainly 300-500 W/m(2). The interannual variability of annual mean wind speed and the wind power are in the range of 0.1-03 m/s and 10-40 W/m(2), respectively. Decadal variances of the mean wind speed and the wind power are roughly within +/- 2% and +/- 5%, respectively, with a stronger variability along the southwestern coasts of the Yellow Sea. The distribution patterns of extreme winds (i.e., 5, 10, 30, and 50-year return values) are generally similar, with strength increasing from the northwest to the southeast. The wind energy characteristics for water areas and potential wind farm sites are summarized. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The term 'Green Energy Economy' (GEE) received increasing policy and scientific attention following the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, leading to the implementation of numerous 'Green Growth' economic stimulus packages that targeted low-carbon energy technologies. These initiatives were portrayed as key elements in the transition to a green economy, in which low-carbon energy systems would play a vital role. However, and setting aside conceptual variations, uncertainties and fragmented knowledge remain in the interplay between a green economy, low-carbon energy systems and governance. This research area raises various questions regarding the performance, implications and complexities of policies and strategies addressing GEE transitional pathways. In addition, achieving a GEE compatible with climate, social and economic goals is an enormous challenge for society, and goes beyond the technological domain. This special issue provides a series of articles that critically investigate these concerns from an interdisciplinary point of view, and provide relevant policy insights using a variety of analytical approaches. Overall, they call for strong leadership, ambitious policy instruments, rigorous assessments, effective multi-level governance, inter/national cooperation, institutional capacity development, and the immediate alignment of the financial system with the energy sector on numerous challenges associated with the GEE transition. It is concluded that not only from an environmental point of view, but also due to economic and social reasons, the GEE transition needs to be accelerated and that a radical transformation is required.

Abstract: This paper defines the '2 degrees C capital stock' as the global stock of infrastructure which, if operated to the end of its normal economic life, implies global mean temperature increases of 2 degrees C or more (with 50% probability). Using IPCC carbon budgets and the IPCC's AR5 scenario database, and assuming future emissions from other sectors are compatible with a 2 degrees C pathway, we calculate that the 2 degrees C capital stock for electricity will be reached by 2017 based on current trends. In other words, even under the very optimistic assumption that other sectors reduce emissions in line with a 2 degrees C target, no new emitting electricity infrastructure can be built after 2017 for this target to be met, unless other electricity infrastructure is retired early or retrofitted with carbon capture technologies. Policymakers and investors should question the economics of new long-lived energy infrastructure involving positive net emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Anaerobic Digestion (AD) has been recognized as a viable solution to produce renewable energy and to reduce global warming especially when secondary feedstock and/or wastes are used. Several LCA studies analysed the environmental performances of biogas production systems. The results of this review highlight that the goal, scope, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodology, feedstocks and geographical regions covered by the studies vary widely. Most studies are based in Europe, several in China and few in South and North America and in Africa.
To better highlight how the choices on the feeding mix, the digestate storage, the surplus heat valorisation as well as the plant size can affect the environmental performances of agricultural AD plants four plants have been analysed in this study. The results suggest that the energy crops production and the operation of anaerobic digesters, including digestate emission from open tanks, are the main contributors to the impacts from biogas electricity. This entails that it is environmentally better to have smaller plants using slurry and waste rather than bigger plants fed with energy crops. Recovering heat waste as well as covering of digestate tank would improve significantly the environmental sustainability of biogas electricity, and particularly the global warming category.

Abstract: Perturb and Observe (P&O) and Incremental Conductance (INC) are widely used as Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques in Photovoltaic (PV) systems. But, they fail under rapidly varying of sunlight levels. This paper proposes a new MPPT technique, which can make a distinction between perturbation in the reference voltage and sudden-changing of sunlight and thus optimize the PV system efficiency. This method consists on a modified INC algorithm, which is used to fine-tune the duty cycle of the DC/DC converter in order to avoid divergences of the maximum power point (MPP) when using basic INC under fast varying of luminosity levels.
The proposed PV-MPPT system, which is composed by a step-up converter as the interface to feed the load, is tested by simulation within the Matlab/Simulink software by taking into account the luminosity, the temperature-and the load variation. The simulation results are satisfactory and demonstrate that the improved INC technique can track the PV maximum power at diverse operating conditions with the most excellent performance, the energy conversion efficiency is increased by approximately 5%.

Abstract: An orthogonal experiment with five factors and four levels was designed and numerical studies were performed to reveal the effects of molten salt PCM thermophysical properties on heat and exergy storage performance of a shell-and-tube latent heat storage (LHS) unit. The range analysis, regression analysis and optimization were conducted. The PCM selection criteria were established. The results show that for short time LHS system, the order of PCM properties effects on heat storage performance is melting temperature, thermal conductivity, specific heat, density and melting enthalpy successively. PCM with lower melting temperature, higher thermal conductivity and specific heat is beneficial to improve the heat storage rate and heat storage quality. For long time heat storage system, the order of PCM properties effects on heat storage performance is density, melting enthalpy, specific heat, melting temperature and thermal conductivity successively. PCM with higher density, melting enthalpy and specific heat can both improve the heat storage rate and heat storage quality. The orthogonal experiment method is reliable to investigate the effects of PCM properties on LHS performance; and the optimization based on regression analysis is more efficient than that based on range analysis.

Abstract: Rotary desiccant wheels are used to regulate the relative humidity of airstreams. These are commonly integrated into Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning units to reduce the relative humidity of incoming ventilation air. To maximise the surface area, desiccant materials are arranged in a honeycomb matrix structure which results in a high pressure drop across the device requiring fans and blowers to provide adequate ventilation. This restricts the use of rotary desiccant wheels to mechanical ventilation systems. Passive ventilation systems are able to deliver adequate ventilation air but cannot control the humidity of the incoming air. To overcome this, the traditional honeycomb matrix structure of rotary desiccant wheels was redesigned to maintain a pressure drop value below 2 Pa, which is required for passive ventilation purposes. In addition to this, the temperature of the regeneration air for desorption was lowered. Radial blades extending out from the centre of a wheel to the circumference were coated in silica gel particles to form a rotary desiccant wheel. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of the design was validated using experimental data. Reduction in relative humidity up to 55% was seen from the system whilst maintaining a low pressure drop across the new design. As an outcome of the work presented in this paper, a UK patent GB1506768.9 has been accepted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The optimized performance of two advanced CO2 capture processes is compared to that of a monoethanolamine (MEA) baseline for a gas-powered CO2 capture retrofit of an existing coal-fired facility. The advanced temperature-swing processes utilize piperazine and mixed-salt solvents. The mixed-salt treatment involves the use of ammonia for CO2 absorption and potassium carbonate primarily to control ammonia slip. The processes are represented in terms of energy duty requirements within a modular heat integration code developed for CO2 capture modeling and optimization. The model includes a baseload coal plant, a gas-fired subsystem containing gas turbines and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and a CO2 capture facility. A formal bi-objective optimization procedure is applied to determine the design (e.g., detailed HRSG components and pressure levels, gas turbine capacity, CO2 capture capacity) and time-varying operations of the facility to simultaneously maximize net present value (NPV) and minimize total capital requirement (TCR), while meeting a maximum CO2 emission intensity constraint. For a realistic scenario constructed using historical data, optimization results indicate that both advanced processes outperform MEA in both objectives, and the mixed-salt process in turn outperforms the piperazine process. Specifically, for the scenario considered, the base case mixed-salt process achieves 16% greater NPV and 14% lower TCR than the MEA process, and 10% greater NPV and 5% lower TCR than the piperazine process. A five-case sensitivity study of the mixed-salt process indicates that it is competitive with the piperazine process and consistently outperforms the MEA process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The blade deflection is accomplished by interaction of blades and related mechanisms as the turbine rotates. To enhance the turbine performance, it is designed that the blade deflection not only increases the power output for a downstream blade, but also decreases the resistance for an upstream blade. The observation of the prototype in laboratory flume is displayed to validate the feasibility. Furthermore, a commercial code is employed to analyze the turbine performance. The velocity and pressure contours of the calculation domain are simulated to obtain the torque and power output of deflectable-blade turbine. Moreover, the results of performance analysis are validated by the experimental data.
The detailed flow field analysis and hydrodynamic characteristic are reported as deflectable-blade turbine is driven by the water stream. The results show that the maximum and minimum total torque for this turbine occur at theta = 45 degrees and theta = 75 degrees, respectively as it rotates one-quarter turn. In performance comparison, the maximal power coefficient of the deflectable-blade turbine is 41.1% higher than that of traditional vertical axis turbine with fixed blades for stream velocity of 1 m/s. Furthermore, the correlations of optimal angular velocity and maximal power output for the deflectable-blade turbine are obtained for current velocity from 0.6 m/s to 2.2 m/s for hydropower applications.

Abstract: Industrial activities have a huge potential for waste heat recovery. In spite of its high potential, industrial waste heat (IWH) is currently underutilized. This may be due, on one hand, to the technical and economic difficulties in applying conventional heat recovery methods and, on the other, the temporary or geographical mismatch between the energy released and its heat demand. Thermal energy storage (TES) is a technology which can solve the existing mismatch by recovering the IWH and storing it for a later use. Moreover, the use of recovered IWH leads to a decrease of CO2 emissions and to economic and energy savings. Depending on the distance between the IWH source and the heat demand, TES systems can be placed on-site or the IWH can be transported by means of mobile TES systems, to an off-site heat demand. Around 50 industry case studies, in which both on-site and off-site recovery systems are considered are here reviewed and discussed taking into account the characteristics of the heat source, the heat, the TES system, and the economic, environmental and energy savings. Besides, the trends and the maturity of the cases reviewed have been considered. On-site TES systems in the basic metals manufacturing are the technology and industrial sector which has focused the most attention among the researchers, respectively. Moreover, water (or steam), erythritol and zeolite are the TES materials used in most industries and space comfort and electricity generation are the most recurrent applications.

Abstract: In this study, conversion of soybean oil was carried out in a continuous pyrolysis system with feed injected through an atomizer. This allowed introduction of micron-sized droplets of oil that could be rapidly vaporized inside the reactor. With this novel design, we were able to achieve feed vapor residence times (tau) of 6-300 s without use of carrier gas, which would significantly reduce the overall cost of pyrolysis. Effects of reaction temperature (450 < T < 500 degrees C) and tau on conversion, product yields and composition were investigated. At the optimum experimental conditions of T = 500 degrees C and tau = 60 s, the yield of pyrolysis liquids was as high as 88% (relative to feed mass). Under these conditions, the identified products consisted of 38% hydrocarbons (22% C-5-C-12 and 16%> C-12), 33% long-chain fatty acids (C-16-C-18, but primarily oleic acid) and 15% short-chain fatty acids (C-6-C-12). Upon distillation of the liquid products, the long-chain fatty acids were cleanly separated from the hydrocarbons. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing liquid products at high yields, including a wide range of fuels (gasoline, jet and diesel) and enriched oleic acid (for oleochemicals production), using our reactor design for pyrolytic conversion of vegetable oil.

Abstract: In this paper, an innovative adsorptive chiller based on 3 hybrid adsorbers is presented as well as results of the first testing campaign performed under real HVAC operating conditions. The prototype presents two main innovative features aimed to achieve high values of cooling power density: (i) a new architecture, with 3 adsorbers connected to a single evaporator and condenser, that allows to perform an advanced machine's management strategy employing unbalanced durations of the isobaric ads-/desorption steps, (ii) hybrid adsorbers realized embedding microporous Silica Gel loose grains into aluminium finned flat tube heat exchangers previously coated with the Mitsubishi AQSOA FAM Z02 sorbent. Water was selected as refrigerant while up to now the machine operates without any mass/heat recovery.
A first testing campaign has been carried out at ITAE labs by a test bench specifically developed for thermally driven chillers. Influence of the cycle time as well as the temperature difference between condenser (T-M) and evaporator (T-L) on the overall performance were highlighted. The experimental measurements showed that the chiller is able to deliver an average cooling power (ACP) ranging between 3.4 and 4.4 kW, a volumetric cooling power (VCP) of 7.25-9.36 kW/m(3), with a COP of 0.3-0.35 at T-H = 90 degrees C, T-L similar to 15-18 degrees C and T-M 25-28 degrees C.

Abstract: In this paper, a new approach is presented to determine the optimal number, location and capacity of each Electric Vehicle (EV) parking lot to maximize the profit of electrical distribution companies. In the proposed approach, while considering the term of "EV owners' welfare", the effect of this term on optimal location and capacity of the EV parking lots is also investigated. Moreover, the expected growth percentage of the EVs in the upcoming years is presented as a probabilistic parameter. The way of affecting the planning of the parking lots is analyzed. Also, an approach has been presented based on K-means clustering method to estimate the number of EVs approaching for a parking lot which can lead to a more accurate prediction of the costs and incomes of establishing a parking lot. The presented approach is performed on the 69 node radial distribution system and the results are analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The increased presence of variable renewable generation drives a greater need for authorities to procure more ancillary services (AS) for grid balance. One of these services is contingency reserve (CR), which is used to regulate the grid frequency in contingencies. Many Independent System Operators (ISO) are structuring the rules of AS markets such that demand response (DR) can participate along side traditional supply-side resources. The available capacity of the generators can be used more efficiently for power production which they were designed for and not CR; cutting costs, and reducing pollution. As the ratio of inverter-based generation compared to conventional generation increases, the mechanical inertia used to stabilize frequency decreases. When coupled with the sensitivity of inverter-based generation to transient frequencies, the provision of ancillary services from other sources than generators becomes increasingly important. This paper provides a method to use AS for providing CR using DR to ensure system stability for a set of credible contingencies, while also satisfying economic and market goals. In the AS market, optimal power flow (OPF) is used to find the optimal offers/bids and transient behavior of frequency is considered. Our model separates DR into two categories-faster and slower-based on the deviation from the normal frequency of grid power. In a standard numerical example, we show that the proposed model can clear energy and ancillary service bids simultaneously while minimizing the total operating cost and satisfying transient frequency requirements.

Abstract: The modeling of Lithium-ion batteries usually utilizes discrete-time system identification methods to estimate parameters of discrete models. However, in real applications, there is a fundamental limitation of the discrete-time methods in dealing with sensitivity when the system is stiff and the storage resolutions are limited. To overcome this problem, this paper adopts direct continuous-time system identification methods to estimate the parameters of equivalent circuit models for Lithium-ion batteries. Compared with discrete-time system identification methods, the continuous-time system identification methods provide more accurate estimates to both fast and slow dynamics in battery systems and are less sensitive to disturbances. A case of a 2nd-order equivalent circuit model is studied which shows that the continuous-time estimates are more robust to high sampling rates, measurement noises and rounding errors. In addition, the estimation by the conventional continuous-time least squares method is further improved in the case of noisy output measurement by introducing the instrumental variable method. Simulation and experiment results validate the analysis and demonstrate the advantages of the continuous-time system identification methods in battery applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The present paper describes a numerical and experimental testing of a thermal energy storage system (TES) that contains phase change material (PCM). The definitions and assumptions of the developed numerical models to assess the performance and to simulate the thermal energy behavior are presented. The numerical calculation was performed using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, and a real scale test cell with two window shutters, one with and the other without phase change materials, was used to validate the numerical model. The windows shutters were applied into two similar compartments that were tested and the thermal behavior was analyzed.
The numerical models are based on 2D analysis and the indoor temperature comparison between the experimental and the simulated model are evaluated for both compartment models. To validate and evaluate the data agreement of the numerical results were used the most common statistical indexes (based on ASHRAE, IPMVP) and FEMP).
According to the used criteria acceptance, the results of the numerical model presented good agreement and reliability, and the numerical model was considered as calibrated with well prediction data.
Comparing the temperature improvement and the time delay between both compartments, the compartment with the PCM window shutter (i) decreased the maximum indoor temperature up to 8.7% for the warming period, (ii) increased 16.7% the minimum indoor temperature for the night period and (iii) increased the time delay 1 h for the maximum temperature peak and 30 min for the minimum temperature peak, compared with the reference compartment.

Abstract: There are many types of high-power batteries used in HEVs, and their durabilities and degradation mechanisms are different. In this paper, four types of commercial high-power batteries, including two types of LTO/NCM lithium-ion battery from two different manufacturers, a C/LMO battery and a supercapacitor (SC), are studied. A durability test with a realistic current profile for an HEV is used so that the durability results more closely reflect real operating conditions than a general cycle life test. Incremental capacity (IC) curves are used to qualitatively analyze the degradation mechanism. To compensate for defects in the IC method, a prognosis model, using a genetic algorithm to reconstruct constant current charge voltage curves, is adopted to quantitatively identify the battery aging mechanism.

Abstract: Among many options to improve energy self-sufficiency in sewage treatment plants, heat extraction using a heat pump holds great promise, since wastewater contains considerable amounts of thermal energy. The actual heat energy demand at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) varies widely with time; however, the heat pumps typically installed in WWTPs are of the on/off controlled fixed-speed type, thus mostly run intermittently at severe part-load conditions with poor efficiency. To solve this mismatch, a specially designed, fixed-inverter hybrid heat pump system incorporating a fixed-speed compressor and an inverter-driven, variable-speed compressor was developed and tested in a real WWTP. In this hybrid configuration, to improve load response and energy efficiency, the base-heat load was covered by the fixed-speed compressor consuming relatively less energy than the variable-speed type at nominal power, and the remaining varying load was handled by the inverter compressor which exhibits a high load-match function while consuming relatively greater energy. The heat pump system developed reliably extracted heat from the treated effluent as a heat source for heating and cooling purposes throughout the year, and actively responded to the load changes with a high measured coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.06 for heating and 3.64 for cooling. Moreover, this hybrid operation yielded a performance up to 15.04% better on part loads than the single inverter operation, suggesting its effectiveness for improving annual energy saving when applied to highly load-fluctuating real WWTPs. To improve the overall efficiency of the heat recovery system, although the heat pump is the largest energy-consuming component, taking up 56.0-68.5% of the total energy, new efforts to develop a novel design are also needed to make the heat exchanger more energy-efficient.

Abstract: For latent heat storage with phase change materials (PCM), heat transfer rate and energy storage efficiency are often limited by the low PCM thermal conductivity. Therefore, this paper develops a sort of new phase change composites (PCC) with double-layer network to enhance the thermal conductivity and thermal stability. Different mass fractions of expanded graphite (EG) as heat transfer promoter were added in the spindle microencapsulated phase change materials (MicroPCM). The relationship between the PCC thermal conductivity and carbon network structure was investigated. The thermal conductivity was measured by transient plane source method. The carbon network structure of PCC was detected by energy dispersive spectroscopy. Temperature-regulated property was captured by infrared imager. As a result, distinct carbon network structure in PCC was observed with 20% mass fraction of EG, the corresponding thermal conductivity was increased up to 7.5 times of the pristine paraffin. Negligible change in thermal properties of the PCC was confirmed after 100 times thermal cycling and 7 days serving durability tests. The enhancement on thermal properties of the PCC is a promising route to achieve high energy storage efficiency targets of numerous thermal applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The increasing share of uncertain wind generation has changed traditional operation scheduling of power systems. The challenges of this additional variability raise the need for an operational flexibility in providing both energy and reserve. One key solution is an effective incorporation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into the power system operation process. To this end, this paper proposes a two-stage stochastic programming market-clearing model considering the network constraints to achieve the optimal scheduling of conventional units as well as PEV parking lots (PLs) in providing both energy and reserve services. Different from existing works, the paper pays more attention to the uncertain characterization of PLs takes into account the arrival/departure time of PEVs to/from the PL, the initial state of charge (SOC) of PEVs, and their battery capacity through a set of scenarios in addition to wind generation scenarios. The results reveal that although the cost saving as a consequence of incorporating PL to the grid is below 1% of total system cost, however, flexible interactions of PL in the energy and reserve markets can promote the integration of wind power more than 13.5%.

Abstract: The free-piston engine generator (FPEG) is a linear energy conversion system, which is known to have greater thermal efficiency than an equivalent and more conventional reciprocating engine. The piston motion of a FPEG is not restricted by a crankshaft-connection rod mechanism, it must be controlled to overcome challenges in the starting process, risk of misfire, and unstable operation. In this paper, the global control structure for a FPEG prototype is presented. A Cascade control strategy is proposed for the piston stable operation level, and PID controllers are used for both of the outer loop and inner loop. The measured top dead centre of the previous stroke and the piston velocity during the current stroke are taken for controller feedback, and the injected fuel mass is used as the control variable. The proposed cascade control implemented in the FPEG is shown to have good performance, the piston returns to a stable state in 0.5 s. Compared with a single loop control strategy, the performance of cascade control is improved in terms of the control delay, peak error and settling time. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract: The growing use of variable energy sources is pushing the need for energy storage. With Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) representing most of the world's energy storage installed capacity and given its maturity and simplicity, the question stands as to whether this technology could be used on a smaller scale, namely in buildings. In this paper, the feasibility of such an installation is analysed by modelling each one of its components and applying it to several installation scenarios. Proposed and existing installations are also reviewed, including a first-time analysis of an installation in France, which is presumably the only existing building with an integrated PHES system. It was found that the economies of scale that render large PHES installations competitive are not present in small installations. This limitation, associated to other important disadvantages, such as the large volume required, seem to point out PHES as an ill-suited solution for energy storage in buildings, an important finding for building design and energy policy. Nevertheless, if synergies with existing reservoirs could be found (for example for a building on a riverside), costs could be significantly lowered. Further research on possible synergies with other building systems as well as a life-cycle assessment analysis are recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Efficiency and durability are becoming two key issues for the energy storage system in electric vehicles together with their associated power management strategies. In this paper, we present a procedure for the design of a near-optimal power management strategy for the hybrid battery and ultracapacitor energy storage system (HESS) in a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The design procedure starts by defining a cost function to minimize the electricity consumption of the HESS and to optimize the operating behavior of the battery. To determine the optimal control actions and power distribution between two power sources, a dynamic programming (DP)-based novel analysis method is proposed, and the optimization framework is presented accordingly. Through analysis of the DP control actions under different battery state-of-health (SoH) conditions, near-optimal rules are extracted. A rule based power management is proposed based on the abstracted rules and simulation results indicate that the new control strategy can improve system efficiency under different SoH and different SoC conditions. Ultimately, the performance of proposed strategy is further verified under different types of driving cycles including the MANHATTAN cycle, 1015 6PRIUS cycle and UDDSHDV cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The use of microalgae for wastewater treatment has recently attracted increased interest due to the effective nutrient removal abilities of such microorganism, and additional benefits of biofuel production. Microalgae also have the advantages of high growth rates, high cellular lipid productivities, capability to bio-sequester carbon dioxide, capability to remove pollutants from wastewater and their abilities to produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals. However, large scale, cost-effective and sustainable microalgae biofuel production remains still uncertain. In this review, the pathway of integrating wastewaters (including palm oil mill effluent (POME), sewage and landfill leachate) as the medium for microalgal cultivation is comprehensively discussed. The technology/potential of using microalgae to remove pollutants from wastewaters as well as converting the resulting microalgal biomass for biofuel production, are critically reviewed.

Abstract: Retrofitting building systems is known to provide cost-effective energy savings. However, prioritizing retrofits and computing their expected energy savings and cost/benefits can be a complicated, costly, and an uncertain effort. Prioritizing retrofits for a portfolio of buildings can be even more difficult if the owner must determine different investment strategies for each of the buildings. Meanwhile, we are seeing greater availability of data on building energy use, characteristics, and equipment. These data provide opportunities for the development of algorithms that link building characteristics and retrofits empirically. In this paper we explore the potential of using such data for predicting the expected energy savings from equipment retrofits for a large number of buildings. We show that building data with statistical algorithms can provide savings estimates when detailed energy audits and physics-based simulations are not cost- or time-feasible. We develop a multivariate linear regression model with numerical predictors (e.g., operating hours, occupant density) and categorical indicator variables (e.g., climate zone, heating system type) to predict energy use intensity. The model quantifies the contribution of building characteristics and systems to energy use, and we use it to infer the expected savings when modifying particular equipment. We verify the model using residual analysis and cross-validation. We demonstrate the retrofit analysis by providing a probabilistic estimate of energy savings for several hypothetical building retrofits. We discuss the ways understanding the risk associated with retrofit investments can inform decision making. The contributions of this work are the development of a statistical model for estimating energy savings, its application to a large empirical building dataset, and a discussion of its use in informing building retrofit decisions.

Abstract: In response to strong growth in energy intensive wastewater treatment, public agencies and industry began to explore and implement measures to ensure achievement of the targets indicated in the 2020 Climate and Energy Package. However, in the absence of fundamental and globally recognized approach evaluating wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) energy performance, these policies could be economically wasteful. This paper gives an overview of the literature of WWTP energy-use performance and of the state of the art methods for energy benchmarking. The literature review revealed three main bench marking approaches: normalization, statistical techniques and programming techniques, and advantages and disadvantages were identified for each one. While these methods can be used for comparison, the diagnosis of the energy performance remains an unsolved issue. Besides, a large dataset of WWTP energy consumption data, together with the methods for synthesizing the information, are presented and discussed. It was found that no single key performance indicators (KPIs) used to characterize the energy performance could be used universally. The assessment of a large data sample provided some evidence about the effect of the plant size, dilution factor and flowrate. The technology choice, plant layout and country of location were seen as important elements that contributed to the large variability observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel conceptual design of a low temperature multi-effect desalination (LT-MED) system is presented in this paper. The LT-MED system operates at vacuum pressure and is composed of several modules of tubular solar still (TSS) cells, each of which can independently produce freshwater. To verify the performance of the modules in different stages of the system, an experimental TSS was fabricated and tested under different vacuum pressures and heating conditions from 20 to 80 kPa and 100 to 300 W, respectively. The results showed that the energy utilization efficiency exceeded 0.7 in most cases, with a maximum value of approximately 0.81, which was nearly double that of a basin still operated at normal pressure. A 5-effect modular MED system for practical application with a capacity of 86 kg/d was proposed according to the presented theoretical and experimental work A structural design and control scheme were also presented. Performance and economic analyses indicated a wide applicability of the system, especially for remote and desert regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper seeks to better understand how one plausible development in a green energy economy transition of the transport sector can be governed: a breakthrough of battery-electric vehicles (BEV). Drawing on recent results and lessons from BEV studies at local, national and regional scales, the paper presents two alternative scenarios of BEV uptake until 2030 - one incremental growth scenario and one breakthrough scenario. It then draws on the multilevel perspective (MLP) on socio-technical systems as an approach to identify the governance implications of the breakthrough scenario. Based on a characterisation of barriers and drivers at landscape, regime and niche levels, it identifies governance interventions to enable a BEV breakthrough. The results point towards a multidimensional governance approach that includes conventional policy instruments such as durable incentive policies, with a predictable mechanism for adjustment and phase-out, and mechanisms for mobilising investment finance for fast and super-fast charging and home charging along public roads. In addition, more innovation-systems oriented governance is required, such as familiarisation and experience building to ease cognitive barriers and build knowledge for both consumers and businesses, and supporting structural and technological change within automotive industries.

Abstract: In the present study, a flash-binary geothermal power system using organic Rankine cycle (ORC) as subsystem was modeled under a steady state. An exergoeconomic performance indicator, namely the average levelized cost per unit of exergy products for the overall system (c(system)), was newly developed to analyze and optimize the system. Parametric analysis was performed to examine the effects of key thermodynamic parameters including flash pressure, ORC turbine inlet pressure and ORC turbine inlet temperature on the system performance. Exergoeconomic optimization for minimum csystem was carried out on the system. As comparison, thermodynamic optimization for maximum exergy efficiency was also conducted. Optimization results implied that the most exergoeconomically effective system couldn't obtain the best system thermodynamic performance and vice versa. It was shown that in exergoeconomics the significant improvement in system's economy is at the expense of the slight diminishment in system's thermodynamic performance. Therefore, the exergoeconomic models developed in the current study provide comprehensive understanding of geothermal power systems as well as useful guidelines for designers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study aims to develop the four-node-based finite element model for estimating the techno-economic performance of the building-integrated photovoltaic blind (FEM4-nodeEIPB), which can be used by decision-maker in the early design phase. In developing the proposed model, this study uses various research methodologies such as energy simulation, finite element method, life cycle cost analysis, policy analysis, and visual basic application. Compared to the simulation results, the mean absolute percentage error of the proposed model was determined to be 4.54%, showing that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model was found to be excellent. Furthermore, the practical application was conducted for the 'S' elementary school facility in South Korea, which allows potential readers to easily and clearly understand the operating mechanism of the proposed model as well as its usability and extendability. The proposed model can be used to conduct the detailed analysis of the techno-economic performance of the BIPB by the type of utilization plan and to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing the value of the investment. Furthermore, the proposed research framework can be extended to any other technology, industry, and country in the global environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the present study, the in-situ produced fungal mash rich in hydrolytic enzymes was used for the pretreatment of activated sludge, food waste and their mixture prior to anaerobic digestion. The enzymatic pretreatment of activated sludge mixed with food waste resulted in the production of 3.72 g/L glucose and 51 mg/L free amino nitrogen, equivalent to 7.65 g/L soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) within 24 h, accompanied with 19.9% of volatile solids (VS) reduction. After pretreatment of activated sludge and food waste by fungal mash, 19.1% and 21.4% of VS reduction were achieved respectively. Furthermore, the bio-methane yield of mixed waste pretreated with fungal mash was found to be 2.5 times higher than activated sludge without pretreatment, with a further VS reduction of 34.5%. These suggest a total VS reduction of 54.3% in the proposed anaerobic system with the pretreatment by fungal mash. Theoretical estimation further revealed that about 678 million kW h of electrical energy could be potentially recovered annually through the co-digestion of mixed waste activated sludge and food waste after the pretreatment with fungal mash in Singapore. In this case, the energy produced was higher than energy consumed by wastewater treatment. It was demonstrated in this study that the pretreatment of mixed activated sludge and food waste by in-situ produced fungal mash would be a promising option for enhancing biomethane production as well as for maximizing volume reduction of mixed waste via anaerobic co-digestion.

Abstract: With impending climate change and ever decreasing supplies of easily extractable fossil fuel, means to produce renewable and sustainable replacement fuels are being sought. Plants or algae appear ideal since they can use sunlight to fix CO2 into usable fuel or fuel feedstocks. However, as the world population approaches the 1010 (10 billion) mark, the use of agricultural land to produce fuel instead of food cannot be justified. Microalgal biofuel production is under intense investigation due to its promise as a sustainable, renewable biofuel that can be produced using non-arable land and brackish or non-potable water. Some species accumulate high levels of TAGs (triacylglycerols) that can be converted to fatty acid esters suitable as replacement diesel fuels. However, there are many technical barriers to the practical application of microalgae for biofuel production and thus a number of significant challenges need to be met before microalgal biodiesel production becomes a practical reality. These include developing cost-effective cultivation strategies, low energy requiring harvesting technologies, and energy efficient and sustainable lipid conversion technologies. The large culture volumes that will be necessary dictate that the necessary nutrients come from wastewaters, such as the effluents from secondary treatment of sewage. Economical and energy sparing harvesting will require the development of novel flocculation or floatation strategies and new methods of oil extraction/catalysis that avoid the extensive use of solvents. Recent advances in these critical areas are reviewed and some of the possible strategies for moving forward are outlined. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Most authors consider that gas-solid K2CO3 carbonation occurs sequentially, with K2CO3 center dot(1.5 H(2)0) as the intermediate to the formation of KHCO3. However, it is demonstrated here that K2CO3 hydration and carbonation occur in parallel, with no direct conversion from K2CO3 center dot(1.5 H(2)0) to KHCO3. The novel results presented were obtained by separately tracking the individual uptake quantities of CO2 and H2O by K2CO3 derived from four different precursors. The K2CO3 precursors were subjected to 50 regeneration-carbonation cycles at the temperatures of 150 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively. In the initial cycles, K2CO3 derived from KHCO3 (phase I) showed higher reactivity and bicarbonate yield compared to K2CO3 derived from previously hydrated samples containing K2CO3 center dot(1.5 H2O) (phase II). After sufficient cycling, however, the carbonation performances were independent of the K2CO3 precursors and stabilized at similar final conversions related to the carbonation conditions. This behavior is explained by the stabilization in the constituent phase compositions of K2CO3 produced by regeneration. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that phase I might be a slightly different monoclinic phase of K2CO3. Comparing the kinetic analysis of the observed uptake data with qualitative kinetic simulations of possible reaction mechanism scenarios revealed that carbonation and hydration of K2CO3 proceed as competing reversible reactions in parallel.

Abstract: Challenges that smart grids aim to address include the increasing fraction of supply by renewable energy sources, as well as plain rise of demand, e.g., by increased electrification of transportation. Part of the solution to these challenges lies in exploiting the opportunity to steer residential electricity consumption (e.g., for flattening the peak load or balancing the supply and demand in presence of the renewable energy production). To optimally exploit this opportunity, it is crucial to have insights on how flexible the residential demand is. Load flexibility is characterized by the amount of power, time of availability and duration of deferrable consumption. Residential flexibility however, is challenging to exploit due to the variation in types of customer loads and differences in appliance usage habits from one household to the other. Existing analyses of individual customer flexibility behavior in terms of timing are often based on inferences from surveys or customer load patterns (e.g., as observed through smart meter data): there is a high level of uncertainty about customer habits in offering the flexibility. Even though some of these studies rely on real world data, only few of them have quantitative data on actual flexible appliance usage, and none of them characterizes individual user behavior. In this paper, we address this gap and contribute with: (1) a new quantitative specification of flexibility, (2) two systematic methodologies for modeling individual customer behavior, (3) evaluation of the proposed models in terms of how accurately the data they generate corresponds with real world customer behavior, and (4) a basic analysis of factors influencing the flexibility behavior based on statistical tests. Experimental results for (2)-(4) are based on a unique data set from a real-life field trial. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the view of pressing unemployment and environmental problems, different policies have been proposed to create jobs in the transition to a green economy, including the so-called "green jobs". There has been an intense debate on the quantification of these employment effects, especially in the European Union. Most studies have focused on estimating gross future employment effects and have ignored the effects between different sectors and countries. This paper looks, for the first time, at the past net employment impacts from the transformation of the EU energy sector including spill-over effects, by using a multi-regional input-output model and the World Input-Output Database. The analysis is focused on the period (1995-2009) when the EU's energy structure went through a significant shift, away from the more carbon intensive sources, towards gas and renewables. We estimate the net employment generated from this structural change at 530,000 jobs in the EU (0.24% of total employment in 2009), of which one third is due to trans-boundary effects within the EU (i.e. employment generated in one country due to the changes in another). Within the EU, the main gainers were Poland, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Spain, and the main losers were Ireland, Lithuania, France and Czech Republic. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract: Stabilization at concentrations consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degrees C above the preindustrial level will require drastic cuts in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions during the first half of the century; net negative emissions approaching 2100 are required in the vast majority of current emission scenarios. For negative emissions, the focus has been on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), where carbon-neutral bioenergy would be combined with additional carbon capture thus yielding emissions lower than zero. Different BECCS technologies are considered around the world and one option that deserves special attention applies CCS to ethanol production. It is currently possible to eliminate 27.7 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 emissions per year through capture and storage of CO2 released during fermentation, which is part of sugar cane-based ethanol production in Brazil. Thus, BECCS could reduce the country's emissions from energy production by roughly 5%. Such emissions are additional to those due to the substitution of biomass-based electricity for fossil-fueled power plants. This paper assesses the potential and cost effectiveness of negative emissions in the joint production system of ethanol and electricity based on sugar cane, bagasse, and other residues in Brazil. An important benefit is that CO2 can be captured twice along the proposed BECCS supply chain (once during fermentation and once during electricity generation). This study only considers BECCS from fermentation because capturing such CO2 is straightforward, thus potentially representing a cost-effective mitigation option for Brazil compared to other alternatives. The assessment shows that fuel prices would increase by less than 3.5% due to the adoption of BECCS from fermentation, while increasing investors' revenues are sufficient to compensate for the investment required. With appropriate government subsidies, or by sharing BECCS costs between all car fuels and all electricity supplied by hydro and bioelectricity, the increment in ethanol and electricity prices could be less than 1% for the final consumer. Meanwhile it would supply 77.3% of all cars' fuel (private cars) and 17.9% of all electricity in Brazil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Due to the increasing generation capacity of intermittent renewable electricity sources and an electrical grid ill-equipped to handle the mismatch between electricity generation and use, the need for advanced energy storage technologies will continue to grow. Currently, pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage are used for grid-scale energy storage, and batteries are used at smaller scales. However, prospects for expansion of these technologies suffer from geographic limitations (pumped storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage), low roundtrip efficiency (compressed air energy storage), and high cost (batteries). Furthermore, pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage are challenging to scale-down, while batteries are challenging to scale-up. In 2015, a novel compressed gas energy storage prototype system was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In this paper, a near-isothermal modification to the system is proposed. In common with compressed air energy storage, the novel storage technology described in this paper is based on air compression/expansion. However, several novel features lead to near-isothermal processes, higher efficiency, greater system scalability, and the ability to site a system anywhere. The enabling features are utilization of hydraulic machines for expansion/compression, above-ground pressure vessels as the storage medium, spray cooling/heating, and waste-heat utilization. The base configuration of the novel storage system was introduced in a previous paper. This paper describes the results obtained from a transient, analytical, physics-based thermodynamic system model used for the system design and evaluation of three design configurations (including base configuration). The system model captures real gas effects and all loss mechanisms. The model demonstrates an energy storage roundtrip efficiency of 82% and energy density of 3.59 MJ/m(3). Experimental evaluation of system performance and detailed cost analysis will be presented in future publications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Experimental studies have been performed in conjunction with a novel differential based multi-shell model to investigate the flame structure and measure laminar burning speeds of H-2/CO/air/diluent premixed flames at high pressures and temperatures. This paper focuses on synthetic gas (syngas) as the fuel blend, which is a mixture of H-2 and CO, and investigates the effect of synthetic exhaust gas recirculation (SEGR) as the diluent on flame structure and laminar burning speed. SEGR is a mixture of 14% CO2 and 86% N-2. In these experiments two different SEGR concentrations of 5% and 10% have been used. The experiments were performed in two constant volume spherical and cylindrical chambers. The cylindrical chamber was set up in a schlieren system equipped with a high speed CMOS camera, capable of taking pictures up to 40,000 frames per second, which was used to study the structure and stability of the flame. The laminar burning speed of the combustion process was calculated from the pressure rise measurement during flame propagation in spherical chamber. Power law correlations have been developed for laminar burning speeds of smooth H-2/CO/air/SEGR flames over a wide range of temperatures (298 K up to 450 K), pressures (from sub-atmospheric up to 5.5 atm), equivalence ratios (phi = 0.6-3) and three different hydrogen concentration of 5%, 10% and 25% in the fuel mixture. SEGR lowers the laminar burning speed and has significant effect on the flame stability compared to H-2/CO/air, especially for very lean and very rich mixtures. Experimental burning speeds of H-2/CO/air/SEGR mixtures have been compared with available measurements as well as computed values obtained by 1D free flame simulations using two chemical kinetics mechanisms. Very good agreements have been observed with the experimental data available in the scientific literature as well as computational burning speeds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: For commercialization-oriented solid oxide fuel cells, the state-of-the-art nickel cermet anodes are still the preferable choice because of their several favorable features, such as high electrical conductivity, good thermo-mechano compatibility with other cell components, and favorable electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation. One big drawback of such anodes is their susceptibility to sulfur poisoning, which may cause catastrophic damage to cell performance even at ppm concentration level in fuel gas, while practical fuels usually contain a certain amount of sulfur impurity with concentration usually higher than ppm level. In an attempt to make them applicable for operation on practical carbonaceous fuels, materials/morphology/cell operation mode modification has been intensively tried to alleviate the sulfur poisoning problem. Herein, recent progress in understanding the sulfur poisoning effect on the performance of SOFCs with Ni-based cermet anodes operating on sulfur-containing methane and CO fuels, and related strategies for improving the sulfur tolerance were reviewed. The application status of SOFCs operating with sulfur-containing fuels was also referred. The purpose of this review is to provide some useful guidelines for further modifications of Ni-based cermet anodes with enhanced sulfur tolerance when operating on practical sulfur-containing carbonaceous fuels.

Abstract: Abiotically catalysed glucose fuel cells (AGFC) can take two different forms, external and implantable. They can be used to power computers, mobile phones and other portable low-power devices, and to power implantable medical devices such as pacemakers or devices for electrical stimulation. At present, the maximum power density of implantable AGFC is about 6 mu W cm(-2) whereas the maximum power density of external ones is around 35 mW cm(-2). Despite this value is still lower than that obtained from direct methanol and ethanol fuel cells, abundance of glucose make glucose fuel cells an interesting option to be developed. To achieve its commercial application, it becomes necessary to improve their performance and lifespan. In recent times, there have been remarkable advances in catalytic materials, electrodes structure and fuel cell layout, which have enabled to improve the power density and the poisoning resistance of both AGFC types. A critical and quantitative analysis on implantable and external AGFC and their materials has been conducted in this review. In general, Pt is not a good catalyst for glucose oxidation due to its high poisoning facility, and protective membranes that prevent the poisoning or other catalysts such as bimetallic catalysts (Pd-Bi, Pt-Bi) should be used in implantable applications. In external glucose fuel cells, Pd, Ni and other transition metals are good catalysts for glucose oxidation in alkaline medium, even better than Pt is. Moreover, new substrates (Ni foams or multi-walled carbon nanotubes) and catalysts (hierarchical, 3D or hollow) structures with high active surface should be further investigated.

Abstract: The 2015 EU Energy Union Package proposes integrating renewables into the market, just as the UK has moved away from Premium Feed-in Tariffs (FiTs) for renewable electricity supply (RES-E) to something closer to the standard FiT, which, when auctioned, demonstrated a 3% real fall in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The UK, which has experimented with nearly all forms of RES-E support, offers the evidence base for designing the Energy Union's RES-E support. Innovation needs a further redesign to deliver adequate funding, best done through country contributions to an EU-wide innovation competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We use a continuous wavelet approach and deploy asymmetric, multi-horizon Granger-causality tests between the return series of the oil price and the India-US exchange rate, over the time-span 1980M1-2016M2. The results highlight important co-movements in the post-reform period, especially for the 2-4-years band. The wavelet Granger-causality tests show that the exchange rate Granger-causes the oil price in the long run, while the opposite applies in the short run. Moreover, we find that the Granger-causal relationship between variables is non-linear, asymmetric and indirect, which will help policymakers and traders to make better strategic and investment decisions.

Abstract: The work was concerned with improving understanding of the chemical and physical trade-offs when employing transient over-fuelling to control auto-ignition in gasoline spark ignition engines under knock intensities not usually tolerated in optical engines. The single cylinder engine used included full bore overhead optical access capable of withstanding unusually high in-cylinder pressures. Heavy knock was deliberately induced by adopting inlet air heating and a primary reference fuel blend of reduced octane rating. High-speed chemiluminescence imaging and simultaneous in-cylinder pressure data measurement were used to evaluate the combustion events. Under normal operation the engine was operated under port fuel injection with a stoichiometric air-fuel mixture. Multiple centred auto-ignition events were regularly observed, with knock intensities of up to 30 bar. Additional excess fuel was then introduced directly into the end-gas in short transient bursts. As the mass of excess fuel was progressively increased a trade-off was apparent, with knock intensity first increasing by up to 65% before lower unburned gas temperatures suppressed knock under extremely rich conditions. This trade-off is not usually observed during conventional low intensity knock suppression via over-fuelling and has been associated with the competing effects of reducing auto-ignition delay time and charge cooling/ratio of specific heats. Overall, the results demonstrate the risks in employing excess fuel to suppress knock deep within a heavy knocking combustion regime (potentially including a Super-Knock regime).

Abstract: In order to enhance energy efficiency as a pillar of transition to a green energy economy it is important to understand whether and under which conditions energy efficiency programs could have positive economic and social impacts. There are a growing number of studies on macroeconomic impacts of energy efficiency programs for various countries and regions. However, in Switzerland only few evaluations have been performed. The present study evaluates the impacts on GDP and employment of Geneva's energy efficiency program portfolio eco21 which is operated by the local utility. Two programs aiming for electricity savings in the residential sector are analyzed: Eco-sociales targets social housing and Communs d'immeubles focuses on common spaces in buildings. An input-output model is developed, based on the Swiss input-output table, program administrator data, Swiss, and European statistics. Both impacts of initial expenditure and energy cost savings are evaluated. We estimate and compare the impacts of the two programs and discuss factors that cause differences. Our results show that energy efficiency programs can have positive impacts on GDP and employment. According to our estimates, each Swiss Franc (CHF) spent within the energy efficiency program creates approximately 0.2 CHF of additional GDP compared to the reference case scenario. Net impacts on employment are approximately 0.7 and 1.6 additional jobs in full-time equivalent for 1 million CHF of expenditure driven by Eco-sociales and Communs d'immeubles respectively, compared to the reference case scenario. However, the results strongly depend on several hypotheses, including the impact of energy savings on the domestic energy sector, the import share in consumed goods and services, electricity prices, lifetimes of energy efficiency measures, and the assumed expenditure patterns. Based on our results we provide recommendations on measures for improving the macroeconomic impacts of energy efficiency programs: a preference for expenditure on local goods and services, maximization of cost effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, and their integration with energy supply planning. We conclude that energy efficiency programs and policies should be well coordinated with other policies in practice, the roles of stakeholders should be clearly defined, and all stakeholders should be provided with necessary instruments and powers.

Abstract: Organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) convert low temperature waste heat into power. When there are multiple waste heat sources in a refinery, operability and safety considerations may make it more practical to use hot water as the medium to recover waste heat. The hot water stream can then release the heat to the organic working fluid in an ORC system. In this paper, how to customize an efficient ORC for a heat exchanger network (HEN) to optimally recover multiple strands of waste heat is investigated. Because the heat exchanger network structure, the hot water loop, and ORC system interact with each other, the coordination and synthesis of these systems ought to be considered simultaneously to maximize the energy performance. A methodology is proposed using the waste heat composite curve (WHCC) and grand composite curve (GCC) to diagnose inefficiencies in an existing heat exchanger network. In addition, the WHCC can be used to solve the problem of the tradeoff between waste heat quality and quantity recovered with an intermediate stream. WHCCs are classified into two types, and procedures for designing the recovery network for each type are presented while considering the interaction with working fluid selection. The methods proposed in this paper can help engineers diagnose problems with the original heat exchanger network, and determine the flowrate of hot water, the structure of the waste heat recovery network, the best working fluid and the operating conditions of ORC system in an integrated manner. The ideas are applied to an illustrative case study in collaboration with Sinopec. The case study shows the effectiveness of this method and compares different extents of heat exchanger network modification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Major shipping companies utilize fuel oil additives to reduce fuel costs and to comply with emission regulations. Although the use of fuel additives for marine heavy fuel oil has increased dramatically, their effects on performance have not been verified. This study investigated the effects of fuel additives, not only at the scale of the engine test bed but also through chemical laboratory tests. Fuel separability tests were conducted to evaluate fuel oil stability. The results indicated that there was improved stability with certain dosages of fuel additives. Fuel combustion and ignition characteristics were evaluated via a Fuel Combustion Analysis (FCA) test, which showed that combustion parameters, including the pressure trace and rate of heat release (ROHR), were significantly affected by the use of fuel additives. The ROHR results showed modified performance indicators, particularly in regard to the position of the ROHR, ignition delay, end of main combustion, and end of combustion. The testing only aimed to determine the tendency at low engine loads, because engines typically operate at low loads within emission controlled areas. The engine test results showed that some additives were associated with reduced fuel consumption, but that some resulted in higher specific fuel oil consumption levels than those for fuel oils without additives. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emission characteristics were also investigated, and data revealed that fuel additives affected the emission components. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Directly heated supercritical oxy-fuel gas turbines have potential to provide a higher thermal efficiency and lower pollutant emissions compared to current gas turbine systems. Motivated by the advantages of an oxyfuel-based directly heated supercritical power system, this paper presents an analysis of different operating conditions using ASPEN HYSYS (R). This study first investigates the efficiency of gaseous or liquid methane and oxygen feed systems. T-s and P-v diagrams are generated and compared to each other to determine which is more efficient. The analysis revealed that the entropy generated during the combustion process for a liquid feed system is approximately three times higher than when methane and oxygen are compressed in gaseous form and delivered to the combustor and burned. To mitigate the high temperatures (3300 K) of the methane and oxygen combustion reaction, carbon dioxide is recirculated. For this portion of the system, the use of gaseous and liquid carbon dioxide recirculation loops and their corresponding efficiencies are determined. The investigation shows that the system yielded a higher net efficiency of 55.1% when gaseous carbon dioxide is recirculated as a diluent with liquid methane and oxygen delivery to the combustor.

Abstract: Rapid pyrolysis (similar to 10(4) K/s) experiments investigating lignite, bituminous coal and anthracite were conducted to study the effect of the thermal process on the coal structure. The interest was focused on the chemical structure variation occurring at the early stage of pyrolysis (0-500 ms) and high temperature (1173-1773 K), which includes the mass loss ratio, volatile content, element content and organic groups. A series of parameters was used to characterize the chemical structure, CH2/CH3 ratio, fraction of aromatic hydrogen and aromaticity (f(a)). The char's molecular size was determined based on both ring condensation degree (R/C)(u) and equivalent diameter of the aromatic monomer (D-C). This result demonstrated that these five chemical structural parameters (CSPs) increase with the pyrolysis time and temperature. The comparison of three types of coals reveals that the CSPs of lignite are lower and increase faster than those of bituminous coal and anthracite. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The economic assessment of low-carbon energy options is the primary step towards the design of policy portfolios to foster the green energy economy. However, today these assessments often fall short of including important determinants of the overall cost-benefit balance of such options by not including indirect costs and benefits, even though these can be game-changing. This is often due to the lack of adequate methodologies.
The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive account of the key methodological challenges to the assessment of the multiple impacts of energy options, and an initial menu of potential solutions to address these challenges.
The paper first provides evidence for the importance of the multiple impacts of energy actions in the assessment of low-carbon options.
The paper identifies a few key challenges to the evaluation of the co-impacts of low-carbon options and demonstrates that these are more complex for co-impacts than for the direct ones. Such challenges include several layers of additionality, high context dependency, and accounting for distributional effects.
The paper continues by identifying the key challenges to the aggregation of multiple impacts including the risks of overcounting while taking into account the multitude of interactions among the various co-impacts. The paper proposes an analytical framework that can help address these and frame a systematic assessment of the multiple impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The Green Economy (GE) paradigm aims to reconcile environmental and socio-economic objectives. Policies to deploy renewable energy (RE) are widely perceived as a way to tap the potential synergies of these objectives. It is, however, still largely unclear whether the potential of simultaneously achieving both environmental and socio-economic objectives can be fully realized, and whether and how multiple objectives influence policy design, implementation, and evaluation. We aim to contribute to this aspect of GE research by looking at selected country experiences of renewable energy deployment with respect to the socio-economic goals of job creation or energy access. Across the cases examined, we find the following implications of relevance for the GE framework: First, we confirm the important role of governmental action for GE, with the specific need to state objectives clearly and build monitoring capacity. Second, consistent with the "strong" green growth variant of GE, some of the cases suggest that while renewable deployment may indeed lead to short-term socio-economic benefits, these benefits may not last. Third, we underline the urgent need for new methodologies to analyze and better understand multiple objective policies, which are at the heart of the GE paradigm. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study presents new ambient-temperature-based models for estimating global solar radiation as alternatives to the widely used sunshine-based models owing to the unavailability of sunshine data at all locations around the world. Seventeen new temperature-based models are established, validated and compared with other three models proposed in the literature (the Annandale, Allen and Goodin models) to estimate the monthly average daily global solar radiation on a horizontal surface. These models are developed using a 20-year measured dataset of global solar radiation for the case study location (Lat. 30 degrees 51'N and long. 29 degrees 34'E), and then, the general formulae of the newly suggested models are examined for ten different locations around Egypt. Moreover, the local formulae for the models are established and validated for two coastal locations where the general formulae give inaccurate predictions. Mostly common statistical errors are utilized to evaluate the performance of these models and identify the most accurate model. The obtained results show that the local formula for the most accurate new model provides good predictions for global solar radiation at different locations, especially at coastal sites. Moreover, the local and general formulas of the most accurate temperature-based model also perform better than the two most accurate sunshine-based models from the literature. The quick and accurate estimations of the global solar radiation using this approach can be employed in the design and evaluation of performance for different solar applications.

Abstract: This study combines electricity supply mix profiles and observed charging behaviour to compare the environmental performance of a petrol-hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) with a class-equivalent internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle over the full life cycle. Environmental performance is compared using a suite of indicators across the life cycle, accounting for both marginal and average electricity supply mixes for Australia's National Energy Market (NEM) grid. The use of average emission factors for the NEM grid can serve as a good proxy for accounting charging behaviour, provided that there is a strong correlation between the time of charging and total electricity demand. Compared with an equivalent ICE, PHEVs charged from Australia's NEM can reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the life cycle. Potential burden shifts towards acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity impacts may occur, but these impacts are uncertain due to modelling limitations. This study has the potential to inform both short and long term forecasts of the environmental impacts associated with EV deployment in Australia and provides a better understanding the temporal variations in emissions associated with electricity use in the short term.

Abstract: The Wind Farm Layout Optimization (WFLO) problem has attracted a lot of attention from researchers and industry practitioners, as it has been proven that better placement of wind turbines can increase the overall efficiency and the total revenue of a wind farm. Although the engineering wake models are commonly used for layout optimization, the literature seems to have settled on using metaheuristics and stochastic optimization methods. In the present study, we show the effectiveness of non-linear mathematical programming in solving continuous-variable WFLO problems by utilizing exact gradient information of the problem's objective and constraints. Moreover, mathematical models for handling land -use constraints are developed to solve highly constrained practical problems. For demonstration purposes, the results were compared with those obtained by a genetic algorithm, using a set of test cases that have been frequently used in the WFLO literature. Additional test cases with higher dimensionality, significant land -availability constraints and higher wind farm turbine densities (i.e., turbines per square kilometer) are devised and solved to show the merits of the proposed approach. Our results show the superiority of mathematical programing in solving this problem, as evidenced by the resulting wind farm efficiency and the computational cost required to obtain the solutions.

Abstract: Improved process separation factor and heat integration are two key issues to increase the energy efficiency of ethanol production in a pervaporation membrane bioreactor (PVMBR). A PVMBR with permeate fractional condensation and mechanical vapor compression was developed for energy efficient ethanol production. A condensation model based on the mass balance and thermodynamic equilibrium in the partial vacuum condenser was developed for predicting the purification performance of the permeate vapor. Three runs of ethanol fermentation-pervaporation experiment were carried out and ethanol concentration of higher than 50 wt% could be achieved in the final condensate, with the separation factor of the process for ethanol increased to 20. Ethanol production could be enhanced in the bioreactor and 17.1 MJ of the energy could be produced in per liter of fermentation broth, owing to 27.0 MJ/kg heating value of the recovered ethanol. Compared with the traditional pervaporation process with low temperature condensation for ethanol production, 50% of the energy would be saved in the process. The energy consumption would be further reduced, if the available energy of the permeate vapor was utilized by integrating the mechanical vapor compression heat pump. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper provides a regional, empirical analysis of policy portfolios that aim to contribute towards a 'Green Energy Economy' (GEE) transformation. Taking green economy policies and related indicators as the analytical framework, the study examines (i) the composition of policy portfolios promoting low carbon energy technologies, (ii) short-term trends related to the GEE, (iii) long-term empirical observations of GEE-related factors, and (iv) whether, given these results, CO2 emission reduction targets can be met. The study focuses on the following regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, Non-OECD Europe and countries from the Former Soviet Union, Oceania, OECD Europe, and OECD North America. Findings reveal that low-carbon energy technology policies have spread rapidly since the 2000s. Economics incentives are widespread across all regions, highlighting the growing use of market-based policies. The short-term analysis shows that per capita income growth (and to a lesser extent population growth) are the main obstacles to transition towards a GEE transformation. From a longer-term perspective, results are highly consistent and show no, or limited, progress in making the transformation. Relative improvements in efficiency have not offset the negative effects of growing economic activity, suggesting that this factor per se is a roadblock to GEE transformation. From a policy perspective, the analysis strongly suggests that, despite a plethora of policy initiatives aimed at the market uptake of low-carbon energy technologies, the impacts on key areas of a GEE remain insufficient. A far more ambitious and integrated policy approach is needed to transition towards a GEE, particularly if emission reduction targets in line with a 2 degrees C mitigation scenario are to be met.

Abstract: The management of energy-water nexus in buildings is increasingly gaining attention among domestic end-users. In developing countries, potable water supply is unreliable due to increasing demand, forcing end-users to seek alternative strategies such as pumping and storage in rooftop tanks to reliably meet their water demand. However, this is at an increased cost of energy cost. In this paper, the open loop optimal control model and the closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) model, both with disturbances, are compared while minimizing the maintenance cost of the pump. The open loop optimal model is suitable in instances where only random disturbances due to measurement errors are present. However, in case the demand pattern changes for reasons such as occupancy change in the house, the closed-loop MPC model is suitable as it robustly minimizes the pumping cost while meeting the customer demand. Further, MPC proves its robustness as it is able to overcome the turnpike phenomenon. Each of these two models has their own strengths. The open loop model is cost effective and easy to implement for customers that have a steady demand pattern while the closed-loop MPC model is more robust against demand pattern changes and external disturbances. It is recommended that these two models are adopted according to the specific application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Forecasting heat demand is necessary for production and operation planning of district heating (DH) systems. In this study we first propose a simple regression model where the hourly outdoor temperature and wind speed forecast the heat demand. Weekly rhythm of heat consumption as a social component is added to the model to significantly improve the accuracy. The other type of model is the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model with exogenous variables as a combination to take weather factors, and the historical heat consumption data as depending variables. One outstanding advantage of the model is that it peruses the high accuracy for both long-term and short-term forecast by considering both exogenous factors and time series. The forecasting performance of both linear regression models and time series model are evaluated based on real-life heat demand data for the city of Espoo in Finland by out-of-sample tests for the last 20 full weeks of the year. The results indicate that the proposed linear regression model (T168h) using 168-h demand pattern with midweek holidays classified as Saturdays or Sundays gives the highest accuracy and strong robustness among all the tested models based on the tested forecasting horizon and corresponding data. Considering the parsimony of the input, the ease of use and the high accuracy, the proposed T168h model is the best in practice. The heat demand forecasting model can also be developed for individual buildings if automated meter reading customer measurements are available. This would allow forecasting the heat demand based on more accurate heat consumption data directly from the customers and almost in real time. Also, the model can be used for production planning of combined heat and power (CHP) system to improve the energy efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Employing a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach, energy consumption and renewable energy generation in a cluster of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) was thoroughly investigated with hourly simulation. Moreover, the cumulative energy consumption and generation of the whole cluster and each individual building within the simulation space were accurately monitored and reported. The results indicate that the developed simulation algorithm is able to predict the total instantaneous and cumulative amount of energy taken from and supplied to the central energy grid over any time period. During the course of simulation, about 60-100% of total daily generated renewable energy was consumed by NZEBs and up to 40% of that was fed back into the central energy grid as surplus energy. The minimum grid dependency of the cluster was observed in June and July where 11.2% and 9.9% of the required electricity was supplied from the central energy grid, respectively. On the other hand, the NZEB cluster was strongly grid dependant in January and December by importing 70.7% and 76.1% of its required energy demand via the central energy grid, in the order given. Simulation results revealed that the cluster was 63.5% grid dependant on annual bases. In general, this stochastic algorithm is a self-learning one, i.e., at the end of each year, it utilizes the instantaneous energy consumption and generation data of each building to predict its energy balance in subsequent years. Hence, the accuracy and validity of the predictions increase over time. The simulation results are capable of modifying and readjusting the energy consumption patterns of buildings via appropriate predefined policies and well designed monitoring systems.

Abstract: This paper develops a novel solution to integrate electric vehicles and optimally determine the siting and sizing of charging stations (CSs), considering the interactions between power and transportation industries. Firstly, the origin-destination (OD) traffic flow data is optimally assigned to the transportation network, which is then utilized to determine the capacity of charging stations. Secondly, the charging demand of charging infrastructures is integrated into a cost-based model to evaluate the economics of candidate plans. Furthermore, load capability constraints are proposed to evaluate whether the candidate CSs deployment and tie line plans could be adopted. Different scenarios generated by load profile templates are innovatively integrated into the economic planning model to deal with uncertain operational states. The models and framework are demonstrated and verified by a test case, which offers a perspective for effectively realizing optimal planning of the CSs considering the constraints from both transportation and distribution networks.

Abstract: The reduction of in the emissions of CO2, which is the representative greenhouse gas, is actively investigated worldwide because of its contribution to global warming. Energy generation processes involving the gasification of fossil fuels separate the constituent gases before combustion occurs, rendering the capture of CO2 more attainable. Generally, CO2 is captured through an absorption method by using a liquid absorbent in large scale gasification systems. According to Henry's solubility law, the absorption and regeneration processes should be operated at low and high temperatures respectively, and these require high energy consumption. As a solution, nanoparticles are added to the absorbent (methanol) to reduce energy consumption required in the absorption and regeneration processes. In this study, the absorption/regeneration performance was evaluated through a lab-scale combined CO2-absorption/regeneration system. The nanoparticles used are SiO2 and Al2O3, which are added at a 0.01 vol% concentration. In the case of the Al2O3/methanol nanoabsorbent, the performance decreases as the number of cycle increases, whereas the performance is improved steadily in the case of the SiO2/methanol nanoabsorbent. Thus, the SiO2 nanoparticles are more suitable for the combined CO2 absorption/regeneration process. Furthermore, the mass transfer enhancement mechanisms of the absorption/regeneration process according to the addition of nanoparticles are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As a result of the global warming potential of fossil fuels there has been a rapid growth in the installation of photovoltaic generating capacity in the last decade. While this market is dominated by crystalline silicon, thin-film photovoltaics are still expected to make a substantial contribution to global electricity supply in future, due both to lower production costs and to recent increases in conversion efficiency. At present, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper-indium-gallium diselenide (CuInxGa1-xSe2) seem to be the most promising materials and currently have a share of approximate to 9% of the photovoltaic market. An expected stronger market penetration by these thin-film technologies raises the question as to the supply risks associated with the constituent elements. Against this background, we report here a semi-quantitative, relative assessment of mid- to long-term supply risk associated with the elements Cd, Te, Cu, In, Ga, Se and Mo. In this approach, the supply risk is measured using 11 indicators in the four categories "Risk of Supply Reduction", "Risk of Demand Increase", "Concentration Risk" and "Political Risk". In a second step, the single indicator values, which are derived from publicly accessible databases, are weighted relative to each other specifically for the case of thin film photovoltaics. For this purpose, a survey among colleagues and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach are used, in order to obtain a relative, element-specific value for the supply risk. The aggregation of these elemental values (based on mass share, cost share, etc.) gives an overall value for each material. Both elemental and "technology material" supply risk scores are subject to an uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. CdTe shows slightly lower supply risk values for all aggregation options. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermocline storage in packed-bed is taken into consideration for cost reduction of thermal energy storage (TES) system in concentrating solar power (CSP). With a novel packed-bed configuration proposed recently, multi-layered solid-PCM (MLSPCM) thermocline TES is regarded as a more cost-effective alternative for current TES due to its lower thermocline degradation, which results in a higher energy utilization during the cyclic operation of the system comparing to other thermocline TES patterns. Thermal performance of several MLSPCM thermocline TES system with specific packed-bed configurations have been numerically evaluated both on pilot and practical scale. In this work, transient thermal behaviors of charging and discharging process in a cyclic operating state of a practical scale MLSPCM thermocline TES is investigated using a modified one-dimensional dispersion-concentric (D-C) model, while a comprehensive cost model is adopted to estimate capital cost of TES system. The influence of packed-bed configuration on several evaluation indexes of system performance such as cyclic operating time duration, total capacity factor and capital cost per kW ht are explored based on parametric studies. Optimum design configurations are identified to minimize capital cost per kW ht on the specific operating requirements. A cost comparison among different thermocline TES patterns as well as the two-tank TES are presented. The results show that the MLSPCM thermocline TES with an optimum packed-bed configuration is more cost-competitive than the two tank TES and any other thermocline TES systems. Overall, this study illustrates a methodology for packed-bed configuration optimization of a practical-scale MLSPCM thermocline TES and provide a design reference on cost-effective TES system for current CSP tower plants.

Abstract: Nowadays, due to the increased price of fossil fuels and their decreasing resources on the one hand, and the importance of environmental pollution on the other, use of electric vehicles (EVs) has been increased. Charging of EVs has imposed new loads on power systems. These new and major loads along with the deregulation of power systems, which introduces new uncertainties to grid, have caused new challenges for the frequency control and stability of power systems. Use of EVs as moving batteries in deregulated power systems is one of the ways for dealing with this problem. In this method, charging EVs is controlled and, when necessary, EV battery is discharged in grid. This concept is called vehicle to grid (V2G), which was employed in this study for the control of the frequency of a smart deregulated grid. For this purpose, an optimized fuzzy controller was used to control EVs. Using the proposed method, charging or discharging of batteries was carried out with respect to grid frequency and battery state of charge. To investigate the proposed approach, a 35-bus system as a deregulated system was assumed. Then, this system was converted into a three area system in order for the frequency analysis. Simulations were performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and the results illustrated the good performance of the proposed method in terms of frequency control of deregulated system. Moreover effect of proposed method on under frequency load shedding was verified. It was illustrated that by using of proposed method under frequency load shedding is postponed.

Abstract: Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions during operation and have thus been considered a most promising method for providing mobility while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation sector in the future. The life-cycle cost of electric vehicles has been widely studied to evaluate their competitiveness compared to conventional vehicles. However, the competitiveness of electric vehicles is highly dependent on government promotion policies, and the effects of non-economic incentive policies are currently difficult to include in life-cycle cost analysis. These non-economic effects are usually measured by the intangible cost. Traffic policies represent typical non-economic incentive policies. In China, electric vehicles are exempted from purchase restrictions (license plate control policy) and driving restrictions; thus, the intangible cost of traffic policies has significant effects on the comparison of electric vehicles and conventional vehicles. In this paper, from the consumers' perspective, the intangible cost of purchase and driving restrictions is modeled and expressed in monetary terms; then, the impact of these non-economic incentive policies are compared with subsidies and other costs of vehicles. Thus, a more comprehensive comparison between electric and conventional vehicles can be provided. Using three selected typical battery electric vehicles and three correspondingly similarly sized conventional vehicles in China, the private life-cycle costs of battery electric vehicles and conventional vehicles are calculated and compared, a parametric variation analysis is performed, and the effects of economic and non-economic incentive policies in different cities are discussed. The comparison shows that, considering the tangible costs of vehicles, battery electric vehicles are not currently economically competitive compared with conventional vehicles, and both national and local subsidies are necessary for battery electric vehicles to compensate the cost gap between battery electric vehicles and conventional vehicles in the short term. However, considering the intangible costs, the advantages of traffic policies are very prominent in mega-cities but are significantly smaller in second-tier cities. With the increasingly worse traffic and environmental problems China facing, it is suggested that the promotion of electric vehicles in mega-cities be prioritized and that electric vehicle promotion policies based on taxes, subsidies and traffic control be balanced.

Abstract: It is noted that human behaviour changes can have a significant impact on energy consumption, however, qualitative study on such an impact is still very limited, and it is necessary to develop the corresponding mathematical models to describe how much energy savings can be achieved through human engagement. In this paper a mathematical model of human behavioural dynamic interactions on a social network is derived to calculate energy savings. This model consists of a weighted directed network with time evolving information on each node. Energy savings from the whole network is expressed as mathematical expectation from probability theory. This expected energy savings model includes both direct and indirect energy savings of individuals in the network. The savings model is obtained by network weights and modified by the decay of information. Expected energy savings are calculated for cases where individuals in the social network are treated as a single information source or multiple sources. This model is tested on a social network consisting of 40 people. The results show that the strength of relations between individuals is more important to information diffusion than the number of connections individuals have. The expected energy savings of optimally chosen node can be 25.32% more than randomly chosen nodes at the end of the second month for the case of single information source in the network, and 16.96% more than random nodes for the case of multiple information sources. This illustrates that the model presented in this paper can be used to determine which individuals will have the most influence on the social network, which in turn provides a useful guide to identify targeted customers in energy efficiency technology rollout programmes.

Abstract: Quality of indoor environment as well as energy consumption in buildings are a growing concern in the context of overheating of buildings, as the EU legislation is primarily focused on heating season. The statistical data of EU have shown that there is already a large amount of buildings not comfortably cool during summer and the trend is increasing. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to evaluate the influence of high intensity passive cooling as one of the passive solutions for overheating of buildings on the overall thermal response of building envelope systems. Specifically, a variety of multi-layer external walls during realistic summer time conditions of Central European climate were considered. For this purpose, a finite element method was used to simulate the non-stationary thermal response of several heavy weight and light weight external wall constructions. The results have shown that indoor air change intensity as well as internal heat gains have a significant impact on heat flow through the building envelope. Clear difference in thermal behaviour was detected. between light weight and heavy weight envelope systems, as a consequence of different thermal mass and thermal insulation position. While the results of the conducted study represent guidelines to architects, designers, investors and other stakeholders in building industry, the growing popularity of light weight constructions, especially in residential buildings, dictates further research of building envelope configurations and passive cooling system impact on the thermal response of constructions.

Abstract: With distributed generation of electricity growing in importance (especially with photovoltaics) and buildings being one of the main consumers of energy in modern societies, distributed storage of energy in buildings is expected to become increasingly present. This paper analyses the use of residential lead acid energy storage coupled with photovoltaics and its possible interaction with the grid for different limits of feed-in power without any support policies. In the literature, these subjects are often treated independently and for very specific, non-optimised cases, thus motivating further research. Results show that reaching self-sufficiency values up to 40% is possible, close to grid parity values, and only with photovoltaics. Beyond 40%, energy storage must be used, strongly raising the cost of the electricity consumed and therefore the need for support policies for widespread adoption. Also, peak power consumption from the grid remains constant and load variability rises, suggesting that an increase in self-sufficiency would be accompanied by lower utilisation factors of power plants and, consequently, higher wholesale electricity prices during no sunshine hours. Limiting feed-in power attenuates the increased load variability and only slightly affects the economic viability of such installations. These results present a novel optimisation tool for developers and should be considered in future studies of distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as in energy policy.

Abstract: Emulsification characteristics of bio-oils and diesel at various operating conditions are analyzed. Three different commercial emulsifiers (i.e., Span 80, Tween 80, and Atlox 4914) and four bio-oils from fast pyrolysis of wood wastes are studied. When the three emulsifiers are individually employed, the performance of the emulsifiers is characterized by the order of Atlox 4914 > Span 80 > Tween 80. Atlox 4914, consisting of the hydrophilic portion of PEG and the hydrophobic portion of poly alkyd resin, has a better performance. The HLB value of an emulsifier can be obtained by blending Span 80 and Tween 80 or Span 80 and Atlox 4914. The optimum HLB for the emulsification of bio-oils and diesel linearly increases with increasing the atomic O/C or H/C ratio, water content, and decreasing higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil. The correlation of the optimum HLB and HHV provides the best result, which can be employed for practical emulsification operation between bio-oils and diesel and is conduce to reducing operation cost. The functional groups in the emulsifiers, bio-oils, and diesel are analyzed by a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to recognize the characteristics of emulsions. It is found that FTIR is a fast and effective tool to examine the stability and homogeneity of emulsified fuels, even though no stratification is observed. Accordingly, this developed method can be used to rapidly and precisely identify the performance of emulsification in industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In recent years, wind farm optimization has received much attention in the literature. The aim of wind farm design is to maximize energy production while minimizing costs. The wind farm layout optimization (WFLO) problem on uniform terrains has been tackled by a number of approaches; however, optimizing wind farm layouts on complex terrains is challenging due to the lack of accurate, computationally tractable wake models to evaluate wind farm layouts. This paper proposes an algorithm that couples computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with mixed-integer programming (MIP) to optimize layouts on complex terrains. CFD simulations are used to iteratively improve the accuracy of wake deficit predictions while MIP is used for the optimization process. The ability of MIP solvers to find optimal solutions is critical for capturing the effects of improved wake deficit predictions on the quality of wind farm layout solutions. The proposed algorithm was applied on a wind farm domain in Carleton-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada. Results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing excellent layouts in complex terrains.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCM) cooling has been considered as the most potential alternative to traditional battery thermal management (BTM) technology, but significant challenges remain: PCM leakage, poor mechanical properties and low surface heat transfer capability between PCM and the external environment. Here, we develop a BTM technology based on the ternary composite materials of expanded graphite (EG), paraffin (PA) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) coupled with low fins. The as-doped LDPE framework can not only enhance the mechanical molding property but also prevent PA leakage to a great extent. Coupling with low fins endows the entire BTM system with high surface heat transfer capability. For instance, the as-prepared LDPE/EG/PA composite PCM shows much better mechanical properties and cooling effect in comparison to EG/PA composite and air cooling, respectively. After coupling with low fins, the as-constructed PCM-based battery module presents excellent heat dissipation performance, keeping the battery pack working under the safety temperature of 50 degrees C and temperature difference of 5 degrees C for lithium-ion power batteries, even at an extremely high discharge rate of 3.5 degrees C.

Abstract: Current climate, environmental and energy policies aim at a decarbonisation of the energy sector by a transition to renewable energies on the one hand and at an increased energy efficiency on the other hand. Thereby they stimulate the interest in space-, cost-, and energy-efficient heat storage technologies. Thermochemical conversion is an attractive candidate technology for heat storage fulfilling these efficiency requirements. The design of practically any complex engineered system is accompanied by theoretical analyses based on model representations. Thus, numerical modelling is particularly important for thermochemical heat storage systems to help realise their potential and to advance the technology from the laboratory to a commercial setting. This article reviews modelling work in the context of heat storage and transformation aimed at capturing the coupled multi-physical processes that are relevant to the simulation of thermochemical heat storage in a space- and time-resolved manner.

Abstract: The use of natural gas for power generation is becoming increasingly important in many regions in the world. Given that the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power stations are lower in capital cost and carbon intensity than their coal-fired counterparts, natural gas fired power stations are considered a vital part of the transition to a low carbon economy. However, CCGTs are not themselves "low carbon" and in order to reach a carbon intensity of less than 50 kg(CO2)/MWh, it will be necessary to decarbonise them via CCS, with post-combustion CCS currently regarded as being a promising technology for this application. In this study, we present a detailed model of a 420 MW triple-pressure reheat CCGT and evaluate its technical and economic performance under full and part load conditions. We evaluate the technical performance of our CCGT model by comparison to an equivalent model implemented in Thermoflow THERMOFLEX and observe agreement of power output and efficiency to within 4.1% and the temperature profile within the HRSG within 2.9%. We further integrate the CCGT with a dynamic model of an amine based CCS process, and observe a reduction in the base plant efficiency from 51.84% at full-load and 50.23% at 60% load by 8.64% points at full-load and 7.93% points at 60% load. A core conclusion of this paper is that CCGT power plants equipped with post-combustion CCS technologies are well suited to dynamic operation, as might be required in an energy system characterised by high penetrations of intermittent renewable power generation.

Abstract: With important implications for global climate change mitigation, the development of a cap-and-trade emission trading scheme (ETS) in China is embedded in distinctive political, economic, and institutional contexts and has been attracting increasing attention in recent years. To offer a clear perspective on current research progress, this paper systematically reviews the recent literature on China's ETS from three main aspects: mechanism design, policy and regional linkages, as well as impact assessment. The current research consensuses are summarized based upon detailed literature analyses and commentaries, and together with observations of international experience and China's actual condition, the paper provides policy proposals for the development of China's national ETS during 2016-2020. Finally, several important controversies in the current literature are discussed with regard to the practical demands of China's ETS development. Five pressing topics that need to be further studied in the coming years are highlighted, including cap setting, allowance allocation among sectors and enterprises, carbon pricing, policy package and unified carbon market construction, as well as ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments.

Abstract: Despite the fact that there are some commercial concentrated solar power plants worldwide, there is currently a lack of experimental reports about the operational characteristics of this type of plants. Therefore, a two-tank molten salts thermal energy storage (TES) pilot plant at the University of Lleida (Spain) was used to analyze charging and discharging processes under real conditions. In this facility, 1000 kg of molten salts are used as TES material and Therminol VP-1 is used as heat transfer fluid (HTF). This facility is equipped with measurement equipment which allows an exhaustive analysis of the processes. In this study, the fact of varying the flow arrangement in the heat exchanger (parallel and counter flow arrangements) and the temperature difference between the molten salts and the HTF have been studied and discussed in terms of temperature profiles, energy and power stored/released from/to both HTF and molten salts, efficiencies and effectiveness. The best working conditions found were counter flow arrangement with a temperature grading of about 65 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work introduces a new predictive multi-zone model for the description of combustion in Homogeneous Charge Compressioh Ignition (HCCI) engines. The model exploits the existing OpenSMOKE++ computational suite to handle detailed kinetic mechanisms, providing reliable predictions of the in-cylinder auto-ignition processes. All the elements with a significant impact on the combustion performances and emissions, like turbulence, heat and mass exchanges, crevices, residual burned gases, thermal and feed stratification are taken into account. Compared to other computational approaches, this model improves the description of mixture stratification phenomena by coupling a wall heat transfer model derived from CFD application with a proper turbulence model. Furthermore, the calibration of this multi-zone model requires only three parameters, which can be derived from a non-reactive CFD simulation: these adaptive variables depend only on the engine geometry and remain fixed across a wide range of operating conditions, allowing the prediction of auto-ignition, pressure traces and pollutants. This computational framework enables the use of detail kinetic mechanisms, as well as Rate of Production Analysis (RoPA) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to investigate the complex chemistry involved in the auto-ignition and the pollutants formation processes. In the final sections of the paper, these capabilities are demonstrated through the comparison with experimental data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel electric power autonomy to satisfy the requirement of power generation optimization of smart grid and decentralized energy management system. A decentralized virtual tribes control (VTC) is developed which can effectively coordinate the regional dispatch centre and the distributed energy. Then a wolf pack hunting (WPH) strategy based VTC (WPH-VTC) is designed through combining the multi-agent system stochastic game and multi-agent system collaborative consensus, which is called the multi-agent system stochastic consensus game, to achieve the coordination and optimization of the decentralized VTC, such that different types of renewable energy can be effectively integrated into the electric power autonomy. The proposed scheme is implemented on a flexible and dynamic multi-agent stochastic game-based VTC simulation platform, which control performance is evaluated on a typical two-area load-frequency control power system and a practical Guangdong power grid model in southern China. Simulation results verify that it can improve the closed-loop system performances, increase the utilization rate of the renewable energy, reduce the carbon emissions, and achieve a fast convergence rate with significant robustness compared with those of existing schemes.

Abstract: Performance-based building requirements have become more prevalent because it gives freedom in building design while still maintaining or exceeding the energy performance required by prescriptive based requirements. In order to determine if building designs reach target energy efficiency improvements, it is necessary to estimate the energy performance of a building using predictive models and different weather conditions. Physics-based whole building energy simulation modeling is the most common approach. However, these physics-based models include underlying assumptions and require significant amounts of information in order to specify the input parameter values. An alternative approach to test the performance of a building is to develop a statistically derived predictive regression model using post-occupancy data that can accurately predict energy consumption and production based on a few common weather-based factors, thus requiring less information than simulation models. A regression model based on measured data should be able to predict energy performance of a building for a given day as long as the weather conditions are similar to those during the data collection time frame. This article uses data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) to develop and validate a regression model to predict the energy performance of the NZERTF using two weather variables aggregated to the daily level, applies the model to estimate the energy performance of hypothetical NZERTFs located in different cities in the Mixed-Humid Climate Zone, and compares these estimates to the results from already existing EnergyPlus whole building energy simulations. This regression model exhibits agreement with EnergyPlus predictive trends in energy production and net consumption, but differs greatly in energy consumption. The model can be used as a framework for alternative and more complex models based on the experimental data collected from the NZERTF. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of changes in fuel price on the equity returns of airlines associated with International Air Transport Association (IATA), as listed on the stock market. While it is simple to comprehend that airline price stock returns are related to fuel price variations, it is not as simple to establish whether this relationship is direct or indirect. It could be assumed to be indirect given the high influence of fuel price on airline costs. However, when taking into account the market inertia theory and the paradigm that increases in oil price are indicators of economic growth, these relations could also be assumed to be direct.
In order to solve this puzzle, 56 airlines were studied, relating their price returns to the price variations of West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Jet Fuel by using GARCH models. The main results show a strong positive influence of fuel price fluctuation on a daily basis. These results support the market inertia theory, confirming the paradigm that increases in oil price are signals of improving economic growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) model is used to investigate the effects of different flow arrangements, as well as those of non-uniform air flow across channels, on temperature profile and thermal gradients under transient and steady state response. A high performance multi-input multi-output feedback controller has been developed to minimize SOFC spatial temperature variations during changes in power demands for different flow patterns. Numerical results show that the controller would result in negligible temperature variations for the modified cross-flow arrangement proposed here, even for large changes in the power drawn. The combination of a high performance controller and design modification results in a more uniform temperature profile at steady state nominal conditions, and modest variations in temperature profile, from the nominal, for +/- 15% change in power. Similarly, non-uniform air flow rate decreases the temperature gradient as well as maximum temperature across the cell, though its effect is less pronounced in the closed loop response.

Abstract: A computer simulation model of an integrated solar-hydrogen combined heat and power system with solar-thermal collectors (SH CHP-ST) is developed in TRNSYS to supply both power and heat (i.e. hot water demand) for a standalone application. The model is applied to a case study of a remote household in southeast Australia with conservative loads. Two possible configurations of the integrated system are studied and the optimal one is selected. The simulation results show that the system (i.e. designed to meet the full power demand) with the adopted configuration can supply 95% of the annual hot water demand, with more than 90% of this demand met in winter compared to 54% met from the collectors of the solar-thermal (ST) only. The fuel cell heat that is transferred for utilisation is evaluated in this integration along with that of the solar collectors. An important aspect about the heat matching capability of the fuel cell with the un-supplied demand from the ST throughout the year is concluded. This presents an advantageous characteristic of this integration and permits the system to be effectively used to supply full power and almost the entire hot water demand in the standalone remote domestic case (i.e. in southeast Australia) studied in this paper.

Abstract: The power electronic subsystems within electric vehicle (EV) powertrains are required to manage both the energy flows within the vehicle and the delivery of torque by the electrical machine. Such systems are known to generate undesired electrical noise on the high voltage bus. High frequency current oscillations, or ripple, if unhindered will enter the vehicle's battery system. Real-world measurements of the current on the high voltage bus of a series hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) show that significant current perturbations ranging from 10 Hz to in excess of 10 kHz are present. Little is reported within the academic literature about the potential impact on battery system performance and the rate of degradation associated with exposing the battery to coupled direct current (DC) and alternating currents (AC). This paper documents an experimental investigation that studies the long-term impact of current ripple on battery performance degradation. Initial results highlight that both capacity fade and impedance rise progressively increase as the frequency of the superimposed AC current increases. A further conclusion is that the spread of degradation for cells cycled with a coupled AC-DC signal is considerably more than for cells exercised with a traditional DC waveform. The underlying causality for this degradation is not yet understood. However, this has important implications for the battery management system (BMS). Increased variations in cell capacity and impedance will cause differential current flows and heat generation within the battery pack that if not properly managed will further reduce battery life and degrade the operation of the vehicle.

Abstract: As a renewable and non-polluting energy source, wind is used to produce electricity via large-diameter horizontal or vertical axis wind turbines. Such large wind turbines have been well designed and widely applied in industry. However, little attention has been paid to the design and development of miniature wind energy harvesters, which have great potential to be applied to the HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditions) ventilation exhaust systems and household personal properties. In this work, 10 air-driven electromagnetic energy harvesters are fabricated using 3D printing technology. Parametric measurements are then conducted to study the effects of (1) the blade number, (2) its geometric size, (3) aspect ratio, presence or absence of (4) solid central shaft, (5) end plates, and (6) blade orientation. The maximum electrical power is 0.305 W. To demonstrate its practical application, the electricity generated is used to power 4 LED (light-emitting diode) lights. The maximum overall efficiency eta(max) is approximately 6.59%. The cut-in and minimum operating Reynolds numbers are measured. The present study reveals that the 3D printed miniature energy harvesters provide a more efficient platform for harnessing 'wind power'. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Wind speed forecasting plays a vital role in dispatch planning and operational security for wind farms, however, its difficulty is commonly accepted. This paper develops a nonlinear autoregressive (exogenous) model for one-day-ahead mean hourly wind speed forecasting, where general regression neural network is employed to model nonlinearities of the system. Specifically, this model is a two-stage method consisting of the model selection and training stage along with the iterative forecasting and correcting stage. In the former stage, the model is in the series-parallel configuration, and its test error is estimated by the cross-validation (CV) method. With the help of ARIMA identification results, CV errors are minimized by the Fibonacci search method to select the best lag structure and the only adjustable parameter. In the latter stage, the model is in the parallel configuration, and the so-called leave-one-day-out resampling method is proposed to iteratively estimate correction parameters for horizons up to 24 h ahead, which holds out each full-day data segment from the sample of observations in turn to faithfully reproduce the entire process of training, iterative forecasting and correcting in the in-sample period. Finally, the out-of-sample corrected forecasts can be successively obtained by using the model selected and trained in the former stage and the correction parameters estimated in the latter stage. Furthermore, effectiveness of this model is verified with four real-world case studies of two wind farms in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: PEM fuel cells are considered to be viable alternatives to Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) in automotive applications due to their many advantages. However, one of the challenges is the need to remove considerable heat at relatively low temperatures (i.e. similar to 60-80 degrees C). Nanofluids may offer a promising solution to help reduce the size of thermal management part of PEM fuel cell systems. This paper describes a simulation model developed to theoretically study the effect of using of nanofluids as coolants on the size of the heat exchanger (HE) and the pumping power in PEM fuel cell cooling systems. Considering a 2.4 kW PEM fuel cell, 50/50 water-ethylene glycol based nanofluids with concentration of 0.05-2 vol% have been investigated. By using 0.05 vol% concentration, similar to 21% reduction of frontal area of the HE is obtained compared with that using the base fluid at constant coolant mass flow rate. By increasing nanoparticle concentration from 0.05 to 2 vol%, a further reduction of only similar to 4% of the frontal area of HE can be obtained. No significant difference was found in pumping power when using nanofluids compared that using the base fluid. Using standard models there is negligible differences in the thermal performance using a variety of nanofluids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Running fractures in long-distance CO2 pipelines are considered catastrophic pipeline failures and can result in the rapid tearing of the pipeline for several hundred metres and the release of massive amounts of inventory within a short time. The prediction of inventory pressure response and phase transition in the event of accidental pipeline rupture is of paramount importance to determining fracture behaviour in a CO2 pipeline. In order to simulate an actual CO2 pipeline, a large-scale experimental pipeline with a total length of 258 m and the inner diameter of 233 mm is developed to study the fluid dynamic behaviour of CO2 pipeline blowdown. High frequency transducers were used to measure the evolution of fluid pressure after rupture. Thermocouples on the top and bottom of pipeline were installed to monitor the temperature distributions inside the pipeline. The pressure responses and phase transitions of supercritical CO2 were studied following pipeline rupture with three orifice diameters (15 mm, 50 mm and Full Bore Rupture). The waveform characteristics of the pressure response and the pressure change rate were studied in supercritical leakage with different orifice diameters, which could be applied to ascertain the leakage location and the leakage diameter size in the real-time monitoring of CO2 pipeline.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of rice husk with or without catalyst was investigated in a fixed bed reactor to determine the effect of sodium chloride (NaCl) catalyst on the yields of three products, the properties of the bio-oils and the gas composition. At the optimum pyrolysis conditions, the bio-oil yield obtained in non catalytic pyrolysis process was 53.81 wt.%, while that of catalytic pyrolysis maximumly increased to 57.61 wt.% with 3 wt.% NaCl catalyst. The composition of bio-oils was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the results indicated that the catalyst would pierce through the rice husk textures to act on cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin and change the pyrolysis reaction pathways, which decreased the percentage of organic acids, esters, ketones, guaiacols and aldehydes, but increased the percentage of alcohols, phenols, furans and anhydrosugars, along with getting more small molecular compounds. Quality of the bio-oils from catalytic pyrolysis was improved, which carried higher heating value and lower acid value. The maximum heating value and the minimum acid value of bio-oils were 27.09 MJ/kg and 68.33 mg KOH g(-1), obtained with 3 wt.% and 4 wt.% NaCl catalyst, respectively, which were 5.12% higher and 14.83% lower than that of non-catalytic pyrolysis. The gas chromatography (GC) analysis of non-condensable gas showed that CO content decreased and CO2 and H-2 increased with NaCl catalyst addition, obviously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The energy source of vehicles is changing rapidly and significantly in recent years with the increase in renewable energy technologies especially in the case of electric vehicles (EVs). A smart solution has emerged in which the wasted energy in a vehicle's shock absorber is converted to an alternative energy for the cars themselves, and this is called an energy regenerative shock absorber. Whereas existing regenerative shock absorbers mainly focus on the methods of energy harvesting, there is no such regenerative shock absorber for use in extended range EVs. In this paper, we present a novel high-efficiency energy regenerative shock absorber using supercapacitors that is applied to extend the battery endurance of an EV. A renewable energy application scheme using regenerative shock absorbers for range extended EVs is designed and proposed for the first time. This system collects the wasted suspension power from the moving vehicle by replacing the conventional shock absorbers as these energies are normally dissipated through friction and heat. The proposed system consists of four main components: the vibration of the suspension input module, transmission module, generator module and power storage module. The suspension vibration induced by the road roughness acts as the system excitation to the energy regenerative shock absorber. The vibration is then transmitted through the mechanical transmission module, which changes bidirectional vibration into unidirectional rotation based on gears and a rack to drive the generator module. The power storage module stores the regenerative energy of the shock absorber in the supercapacitor, which is applied to the EV to improve the cruising mileage. Higher efficiency up to 54.98% at most and 44.24% on average were achieved in the simulation and bench tests is proof that the energy regenerative shock absorber is beneficial and promising in generating energy used for renewable energy applications in extended range EVs.

Abstract: In this work, a novel detailed mathematical model for the performance assessment of diabatic compressed air energy storage (D-CAES) systems with underground storage site is proposed. The model was implemented in Matlab environment and it was validated using the D-CAES Huntorf plant data, demonstrating a close agreement with the data reported in literature. The analysis of some case studies of the D-CAES plant showed that the characteristic curves of the compressors, that were assumed for the operation in steady state conditions, are not suitable for modeling the operation in time-dependent conditions. Thus, different characteristic curves of the compressors and turbines were identified in such a way that the operation points of turbomachinery lay within the admissible range during the entire process sequence, in steady state or time-dependent conditions. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that the presence of the throttling valves in the charging and discharging circuits is preferable due to a higher simplicity of construction and regulation despite a low increase of the fuel consumption in the combustion chambers.

Abstract: This paper presents a thorough thermodynamic analysis and optimization of the NET Power cycle (also called Allam cycle), a natural-gas-fired oxy-combustion cycle featuring nearly 100% CO2 capture level, very high net electric efficiency, and potentially near-zero emissions level. The main goals of this study are the systematic optimization of the cycle for the maximum efficiency, and the quantification of the effects of the modelling assumptions and equipment performance on the optimal cycle variables and efficiency. An Aspen Plus flow-sheet featuring accurate first-principle models of the main equipment units (including cooled turbine) and fluid properties (equation of state) has been developed. The influence of the cycle variables on the thermodynamic performance of the cycle is first assessed by means of sensitivity analyses. Then, the cycle variables, which maximize the net electric efficiency, are determined with PGS-COM, a black-box numerical optimization algorithm, linked to the simulation software. The corresponding maximum cycle efficiency is equal to 54.80% (with 100% CO2 capture), confirming the outstanding performance of the NET Power cycle. Moreover, the optimization indicates the existence of promising combinations of the cycle variables which lead to reduced component costs (due to the lower operating pressures and temperatures) of the most critical components, without considerably affecting the net electric efficiency. The analysis also indicates that the cooling medium temperature, the power consumption of the air separation unit, the effectiveness of the regenerator and the effectiveness of the turbine cooling system are the main factors influencing the cycle efficiency.

Abstract: The uncoordinated charging load of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) may increase the gap between peak load and valley load of future power grids. By designing proper charging pricing mechanisms for EVs to guide their charging behaviors, the negative effect caused by uncoordinated EV charging can be alleviated and the flexible EV charging load can even help achieve valley filling for the power grid and therefore increases the social welfare. This paper designs two valley-filling pricing mechanisms under non-cooperative and cooperative scenarios respectively that can intent EV owners to shift their charging schedules for flattening the power load profiles. In the non-cooperative scenario, each EV schedules its own charging power without cooperation with the other EVs, while in the cooperative scenario, all the EVs are controlled by an aggregator. Sufficient and necessary conditions of the valley-filling pricing mechanisms are derived for both the non-cooperative and cooperative scenarios. And the corresponding coordinated charging strategies are proposed for the two scenarios, respectively. Simulation results show that under the proposed pricing mechanisms, cost-minimizing charging schedules of self-interested EVs can also fill the load valley effectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Driven by the development of smart buildings and smart grids, numerous of research has focused on developing optimal operation strategies for smart buildings with the aims of reducing energy consumption and cost, as well as improving the grid reliability. Unfortunately, most of the studies from smart building perspective only target on a single building with elaborated energy forecasting models. Few of them addresses the effects of multiple buildings on power grid operation. On the other hand, a few studies from smart grid area focus on multiple buildings and their influence on power grid, they usually, however, use simplified linear energy forecasting models, which are hard to guarantee the findings reflecting the cases in real fields. As a result, this research proposes to bridge this research gap, through developing and validating high fidelity energy forecasting models for a building cluster with multiple buildings and distributed energy systems, as well as creating a collaborative operation framework to determining the optimal operation strategies of this building cluster. The operation framework utilizes multi-objective optimizations to determine the operation strategies: building temperature setpoints, energy storage charging and discharging schedules, etc., using particle swarm optimization. Pareto curves for energy cost saving and thermal comfort maintaining are also derived with different thermal comfort requirements. The results from this study show that the developed building cluster collaborative operation framework is able to reduce the energy cost by 12.1-58.3% under different electricity pricing plans and thermal comfort requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a modeling framework to address the energy, economy, emissions and land use nexus when exploiting bioenergy in developing countries. The modeling framework combines a qualitative and a quantitative element. The qualitative element integrates two components: (1) technology roadmapping to identify long-term technology targets through expert judgment and (2) scenario analysis to investigate different future storylines. The quantitative element comprises four integrated tools, namely the energy system model (ESM), the land use and trade model (LUTM), an economic model, and an external climate model. An overview of the modeling framework, scenario analysis, structure of the models, modeling techniques, mathematical formulations and assumptions is presented and discussed. The modeling framework is applied to the particular context of Colombia, as a case study of a developing country with large bioenergy potential. In this study case, the impacts that an accelerated deployment of bioenergy technologies might cause on the energy demand and supply, emissions and land use until 2030 are evaluated. Results suggest that a plan to exploit bioenergy in Colombia should prioritize the deployment of technologies for biomethane production, power generation & CHP, which can reduce more GHG emissions and more emissions per incremental hectare of land than first-generation biofuels. Moreover, while the share of bioenergy in the primary energy demand decreases in all the analyzed scenarios, it is possible to envision significant increases in the share of bioenergy in road transport energy demand, power generation and natural gas supply for scenarios implementing roadmap goals. In addition, impacts of El Nino oscillation on the dependence of hydro for power generation can be partly mitigated by exploiting the complementarity of hydro and bioenergy, which might result in a reduction of up to 5-6% in the demand for fossil fuels used in power generation in dry years. However, despite the ambitious goals proposed here, bioenergy alone cannot significantly reduce emissions by 2030 (maximum 10% reduction relative to baseline) and effective climate change mitigation requires a portfolio of additional measures.

Abstract: The thermal mechanics of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is explored with a focus on thermal swelling. Experiments show for the first time that the swelling shape of prismatic battery cells due to temperature variations is significantly different from that due to Li-ion intercalation in unconstrained conditions. In contrast to uniform and orthotropic Li-ion intercalation swelling in a direction perpendicular to electrodes, the nonuniform temperature distribution in the jellyroll and the gaps/voids between electrodes result in distinguishable different swelling shapes. A unique coupled thermal-structural analysis with a simple, but efficient 3-D finite numerical model is proposed to investigate the impact of temperature variations on the thermal behaviors of battery cells. Anisotropic heat conduction and temperature dependency of the coefficient of thermal expansion are taken into account and found to have an impact on temperature distribution and thermal expansion. Experimental validation of the proposed model clearly demonstrates that the coupled thermal-structural analysis with the proposed model can predict accurately the thermal swelling at unconstrained conditions. The solution at pack (constrained) conditions shows that the nonuniform temperature distribution of the jellyroll still plays a critical role for the thermal swelling shape, although the gaps/voids do not occur because of the constraints from spacers in the pack, suggesting that the estimation of core temperature is important. Such an accurate model, able to estimate cell thermal behavior, is beneficial to the design of Li-ion batteries, development of stress or strain sensors, optimum sensor placement, and thermal management of not only single battery cells but also battery packs.

Abstract: Substantial changes need to occur in the electricity generation sector in order to address greenhouse gas and urban air quality goals. These goals, combined with increasing energy prices, have led to elevated interest in alternative, low to zero carbon and pollutant emission technologies in this sector. The challenge is to assess the impacts of various technologies, policies, and market practices in order to develop a roadmap to meet energy and environmental goals.
To this end, a spatially and temporally resolved resource dispatch model is developed that simulates an electricity market while taking into account physical constraints associated with various components of an electricity grid. Multiple technology simulation modules are developed to provide inputs to the model.
The model is used to design a market-based grid, and to develop and evaluate different dispatch strategies. To maintain the system cost at acceptable levels and reduce emissions, the results reveal that the best approach is a combination of economic and environmental dispatch strategies. The methodology and the tools developed provide a means to examine various aspects of future scenarios and their impacts on different sectors, and can be used for both decision making and planning.

Abstract: Energy performance certificates are considered to be tools for knowledge and energy planning in the residential sector. Although energy performance certificates describe primary energy consumption and the associated emissions of a home or building, they do not consider the influence of building automation control systems (BACS) or technical building management (TBM) systems on these parameters. The European Standard EN 15232 remedies this shortcoming and evaluates the savings in primary energy and the reduction of CO2 emissions that can be achieved by these systems. This study investigates the energy performance certificates registered in the Autonomous Community of La Rioja and considers the policy changes in the Technical Building Code (codigo Tecnico de la Edificacion) and, specifically, the Basic Document for Energy Saving (Documento Basic de Ahorro de Energia) (CTE-DB-HE). Due to this regulatory change, we corrected the certificates and outlined different scenarios based on the implementation of these systems in this study. These scenarios show the potential distribution of energy performance certificates and the improvements in the ratings obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy and water are essential, inseparable, and inextricably linked resources that are recognized as indispensable inputs to modern economic and national security. Understanding the nexus of energy and water may help minimize energy and water consumption and reduce environmental emissions. This paper presents a literature review of the current status, research gaps, dependence factors, and possible improvement measures to reduce energy consumption in the water sector. The energy use in the extraction, desalination, pumping, collection, and wastewater treatment stages of the water sector from a global perspective in various developed and developing countries is investigated. The results show that water supply and wastewater services are energy intensive globally owing to old infrastructures and technologies. Energy intensities in the water sector vary with technology, geographical distances, and demographic conditions. The methodologies for energy accounting for various water uses are also summarized. Finally, knowledge gaps, challenges and policy implications are identified by synthesizing previous research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Anaerobic digestion not only produces raw biogas which needs to be upgraded, but also nutrient-rich waste stream biogas slurry which needs decontamination. Therefore, this research focused on the effects of various light wavelengths, light intensities, and photoperiods on biogas upgrading and simultaneously biogas slurry decontamination by using of microalgae photobioreactor. The microalgae photobioreactor was a transparent polyethylene bag (80 cm x 60 cm x 11 cm). The results demonstrated that biogas upgrading and simultaneously biogas slurry decontamination was successfully achieved by the use of the photosynthetic CO2 uptake by microalgae photobioreactor. The optimal light wavelength was the mixed LED red:blue = 5:5; whereas the optimized lighting control strategy was: low light intensity (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with long photoperiod (16 h light:8 h dark) for the time course of 0-48 h, moderate light intensity (600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with middle photoperiod (14 h light:10 h dark) for the time course of 48-96 h, and high light intensity (900 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with short photoperiod (12 h light:12 h dark) for the time course of 96-144 h. Its biogas CO2 removal efficiency was 85.46 +/- 6.25%. Its removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were 85.23 +/- 8.32%, 87.10 +/- 7.55%, and 92.40 +/- 3.05%, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate a solar driven direct-expansion heat pump system employing the novel PV/micro-channels-evaporator modules, in terms of its solar thermal, electrical and overall efficiency, as well as coefficient of performance (COP), at the real-time operational condition. This work was undertaken through a dedicated system design, construction, field-testing and performance analysis. It was found that the novel PV/micro-channel-evaporator modules could achieve an average thermal, electrical and overall efficiency of 56.6%, 15.4% and 69.7% respectively at the specified operational condition, while average COP of the system reached 4.7. The innovative feature of the system lied in the structure of the evaporator that was made of the parallel-laid micro-channels. Such a structure created the reduced interior cross-sectional area and thus increased vapor flow velocity within the channels, while the high vapor velocity generated a higher shear stress exerted upon the liquid-vapor interface, leading to the reduced liquid film thickness, increased refrigerant evaporation rate, and increased electrical and heat outputs. The research has provided the fundamental data and experience for developing a highly efficient and practically feasible solar heat pump system applicable to the cold climatic conditions, thus contributing to significant fossil fuel saving and carbon reduction in the global extent.

Abstract: Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have become increasingly popular due to their high fuel economy performance. HEVs typically fall into three categories according to their powertrain configuration, namely serial, parallel, and power-split hybrid. All these configurations use small internal combustion engines (ICEs), which can suffer from high torque fluctuations detrimental for noise, vibration and harshness performance. This paper introduces a novel architecture of hybrid electric powertrain systems (patent pending) which suppresses torque fluctuations and carries out the functionality of hybrid driving. This new hybrid architecture conceptually lies between a serial and a power-split. The new system uses an ICE and two electric machines, including one with a rotating stator, and has the functionalities of existing hybrid powertrains, including transmission, boost, regenerative braking. The paper presents a model for this new powertrain, and a unique controller implemented in MATLAB Simulinlc. A specially designed ruled-based multi-state controller is included in the model to achieve control and enhance fuel economy. Results of drive cycle simulations show the systems performance including torque fluctuation suppression and great fuel economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The nexus between energy and water introduces cross-sectoral vulnerabilities, which provides crosscutting opportunities to mitigate urban energy and water demand pressure. The existing nexus research has generally been limited to inventorying energy-related water and water-related energy. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework to study the interwoven connections of energy consumption and water use for urban agglomerations. The energy-related water and water-related energy are also systematically inventoried with the multi-regional input-output method. Then, a multi-regional nexus network is established, based on ecological network analysis, to explore the structural properties and sectoral interactions between sectors within urban agglomerations. A case study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region shows the differences of direct energy/water and embodied energy/water consumption between sectors and regions. There are significant changes of control/dependence relationships between sectors and regions after considering the urban agglomeration nexus. Also, the effect of the nexus on water networks is smaller than energy networks. The nexus effect on energy and water networks for Beijing is bigger than those of Tianjin and Hebei. The recycling rates in water networks are around 20-23%, which are lower than those of energy networks (28-30%). The recycling rates of Tianjin and Beijing are higher than that of Hebei. According to the results of energy and water flows between regions, Beijing and Tianjin are dependent on Hebei for water and energy resources, while Hebei is more self-sufficient. The multi regional network approach presents great potential for bridging nexus analysis with sustainable planning for urban agglomerations by simultaneously mitigating the energy and water burden.

Abstract: In China, the storage of hydrocarbon energies is extremely insufficient partially due to the lack of storage space, but on the other side the existence of a large number of abandoned salt caverns poses a serious threat to safety and geological environments. Some of these caverns, defined as abandoned caverns under adverse geological conditions (AGC), are expected to store hydrocarbon energies (natural gas or crude oil) to reduce the risk of potential disasters and simultaneously support the national strategic energy reserve of China. Herein, a series of investigations primarily related to the tightness and suitability of the caverns under AGC is performed. Laboratory measurements to determine the physical and mechanical properties as well as porosity and permeability of bedded salt cores from a near target cavern are implemented to determine the petro-mechanical properties and basic parameters for further study. The results show that the mechanical properties of the bedded rock salts are satisfactory for the stability of caverns. The interface between the salt and interlayers exhibits mechanical properties that are between those of rock salt and interlayers and in particular is not a weak zone. The silty mudstone interlayers have relatively high porosity and permeability, likely due to their low content of clay minerals and the presence of halite filled cracks. The conditions for evaluating the tightness and suitability of a cavern for storing hydrocarbons are proposed, including "No tensile stress," "Factor of Safety" and "A threshold of leakage amount". Three-dimensional numerical geomechanical models are developed to indicate how gas seepage evolves around the caverns. The results show that the permeability of the interlayers is a key factor in influencing gas seepage in the vicinity of the caverns and that interlayers form primary channels for gas migration. By evaluating the fluid seepage around the cavern by the above conditions, the upper-threshold permeability of the interlayers is suggested to be no more than 10(-16)-10(-17) m(2) to guarantee tightness when storing natural gas and no more than 10(-16) m(2) when storing oil. In principle, this work provides references for alternate uses of abandoned caverns for hydrocarbon storage under adverse geological conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Concerns about global warming have encouraged the interest in hydrocarbon combustion techniques that allow easy capture of carbon dioxide. One technique for achieving this objective is through the use of pure oxygen instead of air for combustion or what is called oxy-combustion carbon capture technology. The main goal of the manuscript is to study flammability limits, visual flame appearance and exhaust emissions of diffusion flame stabilized over a bluff body over ranges of operating and design conditions. The operating conditions include flow Reynolds number, equivalence ratio and oxidizer composition. The design parameter considers the change of blockage ratio (BR) of the bluff body namely, BR = 036, 0.5, 0.67 and 0.82. Based on this, three sets of experiments were performed utilizing compressed natural gas (CNG) as a fuel to be burned with three different oxidizers including air, oxygen enriched-air and oxy-fuel mixtures (O-2 plus CO2 with a controlled oxygen fractions, OF). The three sets of experiments were performed to identify ranges for stable flame operation considering different oxidizers under different operating conditions. Stability limits, visual flame appearance and extinction limits of these flames are quantified and analyzed. Furthermore, three different regions were observed; precisely, jet flames, central jet dominated flames and recirculation zone flames, depending on the ratio between oxidizer and fuel momentum. The flame color changed from yellow for air combustion, to bright white for oxygen-enriched-air combustion and finally to blue with yellow tips for oxy-combustion. The flame length was the highest for air combustion, then lower for oxy-combustion and the lowest for oxygen enriched-air combustion. This was attributed to the effect of oxygen-enrichment which results in increase in the flame speed making flame length shorter. For the sake of comparison, the flammability limits of the three sets were reported and the results revealed that oxygen-enriched-air-flames have higher stability than air-flames and oxy-flames, respectively.

Abstract: Thermodynamic cycles such as organic Rankine cycles, absorption chillers, absorption heat pumps, absorption heat transformers, and mechanical heat pumps are able to utilize wasted thermal energy in process sites for the generation of electrical power, chilling and heat at a higher temperature. In this work, a novel systematic framework is presented for optimal integration of these technologies in process sites. The framework is also used to assess the best design approach for integrating waste heat recovery technologies in process sites, i.e. stand-alone integration or a systems-oriented integration. The developed framework allows for: (1) selection of one or more waste heat sources (taking into account the temperatures and thermal energy content), (2) selection of one or more technology options and working fluids, (3) selection of end-uses of recovered energy, (4) exploitation of interactions with the existing site utility system and (5) the potential for heat recovery via heat exchange is also explored. The methodology is applied to an industrial case study. Results indicate a systems-oriented design approach reduces waste heat by 24%; fuel consumption by 54% and CO2 emissions by 53% with a 2 year payback, and stand-alone design approach reduces waste heat by 12%; fuel consumption by 29% and CO2 emissions by 20.5% with a 4 year payback. Therefore, benefits from waste heat utilization increase when interactions between the existing site utility system and the waste heat recovery technologies are explored simultaneously.
The case study also shows that the novel methodology can select and design optimal solutions for waste heat exploitation which are technically, economically and environmentally feasible from a range of technology options, heat sources and end-uses of recovered energy.

Abstract: Direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC) is a promising energy conversion device for power generation using solid carbon fuel. In this paper, a 2D model is developed for a tubular DC-SOFC for CO and electricity co-generation. Parametric simulations are conducted to understand the physical/chemical processes in the DC-SOFC. Good performance of DC-SOFC is observed even at a large distance between the carbon bed and the porous anode, indicating the feasibility of large-scale DC-SOFC applications. The DC-SOFC performance is found to decrease with decreasing temperature due to the decreased Boudouard reaction kinetics. It's also found that the molar fraction of CO at the anode can be well controlled by adjusting the operating conditions, enabling DC-SOFC for electricity and CO cogeneration. Another finding is that the current density in the DC-SOFC increases slightly along the cell length, which is different from the H-2-fueled SOFC. In addition, the anode-supported configuration is found to be beneficial in improving the electrical output of the DC-SOFC but is unfavorable for CO generation. A small D-ce and a high potential are recommended to improve CO generation from the DC-SOFC. The model can be used for design optimization of DC-SOFC at a system level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Most hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) currently sold are power-split HEVs that use single, double or occasionally even multiple planetary gear (PG) sets to connect their powertrain elements. Adding PG sets can provide more design flexibility; however, it also increases system complexity and cost. This paper presents a comparative study of hybrid powertrains with different numbers of PG sets, which we term configurations. The analysis of different configuration types is investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the qualitative analysis, the performances of operating modes for different configurations are compared, in terms of mode number, normalized efficiency, and maximum output torque. The quantitative approach compares the designs of different configurations; the fuel economy and acceleration performance of all superior designs are evaluated to make the comparison iconic. The results show that triple-PG hybrids do not have significant fuel economy improvement compared with double-PG hybrids, but they achieve a dramatic improvement in acceleration performance; this can be beneficial for sport utility vehicles (SUVs), light trucks, and buses. For cost consideration, it is suggested that passenger cars adopt double-PG hybrid powertrains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper an overloading prevention of a private customer power distribution transformer (PDT) in an island in Portugal through the means of a new smart electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduler is proposed. The aim of this paper is to assess the repercussion of the penetration of additional power to restore the full level of EV battery state of charge (SoC) on dielectric oil deterioration of the PDT of a private industry client. This will allow EVs to charge while their owners are at work at three different working shifts during the day. In addition, the system is part of an isolated electric grid in a Portuguese Island. A transformer thermal model is utilised in this paper to assess hot-spot temperature by having the information of the load ratio. The data used for the main inputs of the model are the private industry client daily load profile, PDT parameters, the characteristics of the factory and EV parameters. This paper demonstrates that the proposed solution allows avoiding the overloading of the PDT, thus mitigating the loss-of-life, while charging all the EVs plugged-in at the beginning of each working shift.

Abstract: Hydrogen, an important energy carrier of the future, produces no pollution and has a high content of energy. It is formed as a direct product of the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, which occurs in various processes for the production of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and different hydrocarbons, and is also a side reaction during the steam reforming of hydrocarbons and Fisher-Tropsch synthesis. Since it is an equilibrium reaction, it may be intensified by the selective removal of the products, which can lead to higher yields and energy savings. In this study, carbon dioxide was removed through chemisorption on CaO particles. In the first part, the WGS reaction kinetics were obtained on an industrial iron chromium catalyst in a packed-bed reactor. In the second part, the CO2 chemisorption kinetics on CaO sorbent particles were examined, simultaneously with the WGS reaction. A modified dynamic shrinking-core model was used to describe the carbonation reaction, which accounted for the non ideal core shrinkage. With the introduction of a sorbent conversion-dependent effective diffusion coefficient, the model perfectly reproduced the obtained experimental results. Valuable insight into the sorption-enhanced process was obtained with the full concentration profiles of the species involved (CO, H2O, CO2, H-2) in time and space, as well as the conversion of the sorbent particles, also in the radial dimension. The developed model was used to simulate a cyclic sorption-enhanced water-gas shift operation in a revolver-type manner which allows for continuous sorbent regeneration and a much higher than-equilibrium hydrogen production for various operational parameters. The significance of the model lies in the precise replication of the experimental results and its applicability to the vast area of the newly-emerged industrial sorption-enhanced technologies.

Abstract: Hierarchically porous MnO2/rice husks derived carbon (MnO2/RHC) composite with excellent electrochemical properties has been prepared as active material for supercapacitors. In this study, a two-step process was utilized for constructing this composite, involving carbonization-activation of rice husks to obtain RHC and in situ chemical precipitation to incorporate MnO2. Ultimately, MnO2 was uniformly distributed on the surface of RHC and hierarchically porous structure was well retained in the resultant MnO2/RHC composite. Based on cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution, MnO2/RHC composite exhibits much higher specific capacitance than that of RHC. The specific capacitance of MnO2/RHC composite reaches 197.6 F g(-1) at the scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) and 210.3 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1). MnO2/RHC composite also displays favorable cycling stability with 80.2% capacitance retention after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. Therefore, taking advantage of the interconnected hierarchical pores that exist in its microstructure, MnO2/RHC composite is supposed to be a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new methodology to provide a flexible optimum design tool for the multi-objective optimization of energy systems. There are many articles published on the optimization of energy systems, which use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for different cases. However a general method for optimization results utilization in design process is not presented to the authors' knowledge and usually equilibrium point concept is used to select the optimal solution. Here a new method is proposed to improve the optimization results utilization in the design process. This method is applied on a simple energy system to consider the correlations between the design parameter and objective functions. The proposed method is flexible and easy to implement in any design problem. Results provide a neat process of optimum design includes cost limited maximum efficiency and components parameters selection like the condenser pressure and sub cool and superheat degrees. Results also show that compressor efficiency is the most powerful parameter in the case, which has the most significance effects on the optimization results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper provides experimental investigation on the potential of hydrogen production from hydrogen sulfide and methane mixtures in nitrogen. The reformation of H2S in natural gas represents a viable alternative option for the treatment of acid gases extracted from gas wells that contains H2S, CH4 and N-2 in the gases without their separation, using for example, the amine process to remove H2S. A laboratory-scale quartz reactor was used to investigate experimentally the effect of temperature and inlet stream composition on the production of hydrogen from a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and methane diluted in nitrogen. The results reveal the important role of reactor temperature on the decomposition of both hydrogen sulfide and methane as well as the production of hydrogen. The results also showed that the production of hydrogen increased dramatically at temperatures exceeding 1473 K wherein the conversion of hydrogen sulfide is more significant. The methane was consumed at temperatures above 1373 K. The conversion of hydrogen sulfide in presence of methane was higher than that in case of hydrogen sulfide only. The carbon disulfide formed during the reformation process increased with increase in temperature. These results provide favorable reactor operational conditions for the reformation of methane with hydrogen sulfide. These results also provide a viable alternative option for the treatment of various waste streams containing hydrogen sulfide to produce clean hydrogen and sulfur. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate a black start-up process for micro cogeneration (combined heat and power, CHP) systems based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). A novel micro-CHP system concept using a flame fuel cell (FFC) for start-up is proposed. An FFC unit is experimentally implemented and studied by integrating a porous media burner with a micro-tubular SOFC. The FFC is demonstrated to start up within seconds with the fuel-rich combustion of a methane-air mixture. The porous media burner acts as a non-catalytic fuel processor for the SOFC with a maximum methane reforming efficiency of 49%. The flame fuel cell performance is tested for various equivalence ratios at a fixed inlet gas velocity of 0.15 m/s. The power reaches a significant value of 1.5 W at 0.7 V with a single fuel cell when operating with a fuel-rich flame at the equivalence ratio of 1.6. A flame fuel cell unit with multi-cell configurations has the potential to provide heat and power simultaneously for micro-CHP systems during the start-up process without an external energy source.

Abstract: Increasing penetration of variable loads and renewable resources in smart distribution networks brings about great challenges to the conventional scheduling and operation due to the uncertain nature. This paper presents a novel uncertainty handling framework, based on the underlying idea of robust optimization approach, to portray the uncertainties of load demands and wind power productions over uncertainty sets. Accordingly, a tractable min-max-min cost model is proposed to find a robust optimal day-ahead scheduling of smart distribution network immunizing against the worst-case realization of uncertain variables. In addition, considering demand response programs as one of the important resources in the smart distribution network, participation of customers in both energy and reserve scheduling is explicitly formulated. As the proposed min-max-min cost model cannot be solved directly by commercial optimization packages, a decomposition algorithm is presented based on dual cutting planes to decouple the problem into a master problem and a sub-problem. The master problem finds the day-ahead scheduling, while the sub-problem determines the worst-case realization of uncertain variables within uncertainty sets. Computational results for the modified version of IEEE 33-bus distribution test network demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A relevant objective of the sulphuric acid (H2SO4) production industry today is to obtain sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas streams with the highest possible SO2 concentration after the elemental sulphur combustion stage in order to reduce both capital and operating costs. A new technology, Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC), is able to generate gaseous streams that are highly concentrated in combustion products by means of oxygen transfer from air to the fuel using a solid oxygen carrier. This work proposes a new process for H2SO4 production via CLC and using elemental sulphur as fuel. An oxygen carrier with high sulphur resistance should be used for this purpose. The analysis of this process has brought promising results, such as the easy integration of the CLC system into the entire H2SO4 production plant and the confirmation that this is a process in which the energy potential of sulphur is exploited to a very high degree. Furthermore, the proof of concept was carried out by burning elemental sulphur in a 500 Wth CLC unit with a high sulphur-resistant oxygen carrier based on iron oxide, Fe20 gamma Al. This work presents the first ever results of elemental sulphur combustion by an oxygen carrier. Complete combustion of sulphur to SO2 was achieved, and no deactivation of the oxygen carrier was observed. Considering all the results obtained in this work, it can be concluded that the production of H2SO4 via CLC is a feasible technology which can provide a series of relevant techno-economic benefits in comparison with current industrial production process.

Abstract: A gas turbine system is extensively investigated for micro/mini-Combine Heat and Power (CHP) applications. The prime mover in the system, i.e., the microturbine, has a nameplate electrical capacity of 65 kW while the coupled Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) produces 112 kW. Experiments were conducted for assorted power demands spanning from part-load to full-load operations. A simple thermodynamic model together with a nonlinear optimization scheme is applied to determine the properties at various state points that are not provided by the manufacturer. The second law analysis and the Energy Utilization Factor (EUF) technique are employed to assess the efficacy of the system. The actual chemical compositions of the CNG, the exhaust gas, the moist air and subsequently the amount of water condensation at the dead state are accounted for in the analysis. Here, the excess air usage in the combustion process at various loads is quantitatively reported for the first time. The results show that the combustor is responsible for almost 70% of the total exergy destruction followed by the recuperator, the compressor, and the turbine in the descending order. The first law efficiency of the system varies from 15.7% at 25% load to 28.95% for full load operation. The itemized exergetic efficiency for all the processes is evaluated while the second law efficiency of the overall system is found to be around 30.4% at full load condition. The presented results pinpoint the bottleneck of the microturbine operation, particularly at part-load conditions and are crucial in designing and performance mapping of an optimized cogeneration system.

Abstract: A replacement technique has been regarded as a promising strategy for both CH4 exploitation from gas hydrates and CO2 sequestration into deep-ocean reservoirs. Most research has been focused on replacement reactions that occur in sI hydrates due to their prevalence in natural gas hydrates. However, sII hydrates in nature have been also discovered in some regions, and the replacement mechanism in sII hydrates significantly differs from that in sI hydrates. In this study, we have intensively investigated the replacement reaction of sII (C3H8 + CH4) hydrate by externally injecting CO2/N-2 (50:50) gas mixture with a primary focus on powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and gas chromatography analyses. In particular, it was firstly confirmed that there was no structural transformation during the replacement of C3H8 + CH4 hydrate with CO2/N-2 gas injection, indicating that sll hydrate decomposition followed by sI hydrate formation did not occur. Furthermore, the cage-specific replacement pattern of the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate revealed that CH4 replacement with N-2 in the small cages of slI was more significant than C3H8 replacement with CO2 in the large cages of sII. The total extent of the replacement for the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate was cross-checked by NMR and GC analyses and found to be approximately 54%. Compared to the replacement for CH4 hydrate with CO2/N-2 gas, the lower extent of the replacement for the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate with CO2/N-2 gas was attributable to the persistent presence of C3H8 in the large cages and the lower content of N-2 in the feed gas. The structural sustainability and cage-specific replacement observed in the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate with external CO2/N-2 gas will have significant implications for suggesting target gas hydrate reservoirs and understanding the precise nature of guest exchange in gas hydrates for both safe natural gas production and long-term CO2 sequestration.

Abstract: Modern district heating grids are typically operated using variable flow control. Challenges arise when modeling thermal interactions in variable flow networks as tracking of transport delays is required. In this work, a pipe model is constructed using a steady state heat transfer model combined with a variable transport delay model. The resulting model (i.e. the SS-VTD model) is validated experimentally using measured data from a district energy grid located in Saanich, Canada. Modeling error and computational intensity of the SS-VTD model are assessed numerically by comparing simulation outputs with those obtained using a transient model (i.e. the 1D-PDE model). Matlab (R)/Simulink (R) software is used to construct the models and conduct the simulations. Fifteen scenarios are simulated over a range of time step sizes and pipe segment lengths. In all scenarios, decreasing pipe segment length and/or time step size results in greater computational intensity. Varying pipe segment length is found to have a minimal impact on the error of the SS-VTD model, whereas varying time step size is found to have a significant impact. Results show that when compared with the 1D-PDE model at the same fixed time step of 1 s, the computational intensity of the SS-VTD model is approximately 4000 times less. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Unlike conventional internal combustion engines, a free-piston linear engine has no a crankshaft, and thus the pistons move freely in the cylinder. This allows a free-piston linear engine to easily adjust the compression ratio and optimize the combustion process. Free-piston linear engines include two main parts: a free-piston engine and a linear alternator. The free-piston engine is classified into three main types: single piston, dual piston, and opposed piston. The linear alternator is generally categorized as flat-type or tubular-type. Free-piston linear engines can operate with multi-fuel and HCCI combustion because of their variable compression ratios. Furthermore, they are used to generate the electric power applied in hybrid electric vehicles. To promote understanding of the unique features of free-piston linear engines, this paper presents a review of their different designs and operating characteristics. We also discuss the varied experimental systems and applications of free-piston linear engines. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The development of adaptive building envelope technologies, and particularly of switchable glazing, can make significant contributions to decarbonisation targets. It is therefore essential to quantify their effect on building energy use and indoor environmental quality when integrated into buildings. The evaluation of their performance presents new challenges when compared to conventional "static" building envelope systems, as they require design and control aspects to be evaluated together, which are also mutually interrelated across thermal and visual physical domains.
This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel simulation framework for the performance evaluation of responsive building envelope technologies and, particularly, of switchable glazing. This is achieved by integrating a building energy simulation tool and a lighting simulation one, in a control optimisation framework to simulate advanced control of adaptive building envelopes. The performance of a photovoltachromic glazing is evaluated according to building energy use, Useful Daylight Illuminance, glare risk and load profile matching indicators for a sun oriented office building in different temperate climates. The original architecture of photovoltachromic cell provides an automatic control of its transparency as a function of incoming solar irradiance. However, to fully explore the building integration potential of photovoltachromic technology, different control strategies are evaluated, from passive and simple rule based controls, to optimised rule based and predictive controls.
The results show that the control strategy has a significant impact on the performance of the photovoltachromic switchable glazing, and of switchable glazing technologies in general. More specifically, simpler control strategies are generally unable to optimise contrasting requirements, while more advanced ones can increase energy saving potential without compromising visual comfort. In cooling dominated scenarios reactive control can be as effective as predictive for a switchable glazing, differently than heating dominated scenarios where predictive control strategies yield higher energy saving potential. Introducing glare as a control parameter can significantly decrease the energy efficiency of some control strategies, especially in heating dominated climates. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Abstract: PDEC towers with spray systems are known to achieve substantial energy savings. Various parameters such as the wet-bulb depression, the tower height, and the wind speed have been known to be key factors affecting the performance of the system. To date, the significance of these parameters and other important factors have not been adequately treated in the literature. There also has been a lack of models that can successfully investigate potential benefits of the system under various conditions where this particular system could be applicable. To address these critical issues, this study performed a parametric analysis by using a FLUENT model validated against experimental data. It demonstrated the significance of individual parameters including water droplet sizes. As a result, practical design guidelines for important system parameters were presented. A statistical analysis was then used to formulate analytic models that account for all of the relationships found in this study between the parameters and the supply air conditions of the system. Two regression equations were formulated for predicting supply air temperature and velocity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The transient performance of solar thermal power plants is critical to the system design and optimization. This study numerically investigates the dynamic efficiencies of an open-loop air receiver and a thermal energy storage unit. One-dimensional dynamic models of the air receiver and thermal energy storage were developed using the Modelica language with a graphical user interface and the Dymola solver to provide comprehensive thermal simulation at low computational cost. An air receiver and thermal energy storage experimental platforms were built to validate the simulation models. The simulation results compare well with the experimental data, so the models can be used to predict the variations of air receiver and thermal energy storage efficiencies. The models were then combined into a receiver and thermal energy storage system model with control schemes. The schemes control the air receiver outlet air temperature at relatively stable values while the thermal energy storage automatically switches between charging, discharging and stand-by modes.

Abstract: To improve heat transfer performance of the gas heater in the supercritical CO2 Rankine cycle, heat transfer characteristics of supercritical CO2 heated in Internally Ribbed Tubes (IRT) was experimentally and numerically investigated over a wide range of buoyancy effect. Experiments reveal that for IRT with a geometric parameter of beta = 109, serious local heat transfer deterioration did not occur and buoyancy consistently improved heat transfer. IRT showed far superior performance over smooth tubes. Empirical Nusselt correlations were recommended for both upward and downward flows. A numerical model was then developed and verified against experimental data from IRT with different geometries. Further numerical studies on 7 different IRT demonstrate that buoyancy effect relates closely to rib geometries. For IRT with beta = 0.48-4, heat transfer to supercritical CO2 in upward flow was impaired when Bo is around 10(-4), though the impairment became weaker as beta increased. When beta reached 16, buoyancy-induced impairment disappeared and Nusselt number increased gradually as buoyancy became stronger. Further increase in beta up to 109 didn't lead to obvious heat transfer enhancement of supercritical CO2, indicating that rib geometries play a smaller role in heat transfer than buoyancy for IRT with beta > 16. Finally, design strategy for IRT was provided for the optimization of gas heaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The battery state of energy (SOE) allows a direct determination of the ratio between the remaining and maximum available energy of a battery, which is critical for energy optimization and management in energy storage systems. In this paper, the ambient temperature, battery discharge/charge current rate and cell aging level dependencies of battery maximum available energy and SOE are comprehensively analyzed. An explicit quantitative relationship between SOE and state of charge (SOC) for LiMn2O4 battery cells is proposed for SOE estimation, and a moving-window energy-integral technique is incorporated to estimate battery maximum available energy. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches can estimate battery maximum available energy and SOE with high precision. The robustness of the proposed approaches against various operation conditions and cell aging levels is systematically evaluated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy Internet is a new development form of energy system. It realizes the integration of energy flow, information flow and business flow. More and more business model and service model innovations are stimulated in Energy Internet. In this paper, we present a systemic study of Energy Internet from the business perspective. We first propose the evolution stages of energy systems. Since they were invented in the second industrial revolution period, energy systems have mainly experienced four stages, i.e., decentralized energy system, centralized energy system, distributed energy system and smart & connected energy system. Energy Internet is the innovative representation of energy systems in the fourth development stage. We also introduce some key concepts in Energy Internet, including prosumer, micro grid, Virtual Power Plant (VPP), smart grid and smart energy. Then the business values of Energy Internet are discussed from the energy big data analytics perspective. Finally, the business research agendas of Energy Internet are pointed out from five aspects, i.e., strategic issues, data issues, behavioral issues, security issues and regulatory issues.

Abstract: Use of biomass for energy purposes has many advantages, but it is not always profitable due to the characteristics of biomass. In order to improve the utilization of biomass it is necessary to create optimal conditions which require employment of several methods and technologies. This paper describes developed approach for consideration of options for the optimal utilization of available biomass potential under the current conditions (technological, economic, environmental and social). The developed approach is focused on support for decision making process on community level. Proposed approach includes mapping of biomass potential with defining both potential primary storage locations and potential locations of plant using geographic information system technologies. Also, it includes determining the optimal amount of biomass that can be justifiably used for energy purposes under current conditions by using the mathematical optimization with objective function related to maximizing net present value quotient. Four groups of technologies that can be used for biomass valorisation have been considered in the paper; biofuels production, thermal power plants, district heating and cogeneration.
The proposed approach has been applied (as a case study) on Municipality of Ivanjica located in South-West region of Serbia. Municipality of Ivanjica is characterized by both significant forest area and significant forest biomass potential. There are 30 potential primary storages locations and 57 potential plants locations determined by geographic information system. However, only one of potential locations of plant and two of potential primary storage locations (6% of available potential) are determined by mathematical optimization as optimal and could be used under current conditions.

Abstract: We report the synthesis of nanocrystalline Ni-ZrO2 catalyst for tri-reforming of methane (5CH(4) + O-2 + CO2 + 2H(2)O -> 6CO + 12H(2)) to produce synthesis gas with H-2/CO mole ratio similar to 2. Nanocrystalline Ni-ZrO2 catalyst of size between 10 and 40 nm was prepared by hydrothermal method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant. The prepared catalysts were characterized by N-2-physisorption studies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), H-2-chemisorpton, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic activity was monitored over temperature range between 500 and 800 degrees C. Different reaction parameters like temperature, Ni-loading, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and time on stream (TOS) were studied in detail. 4.8 wt% Ni loading for Ni-ZrO2 catalyst was found to be the optimum Ni loading which showed the superior catalytic activity for methane tri-reforming. The catalyst was found to be stable for more than 100 h on time on stream with methane, carbon dioxide and steam conversion of similar to 95% at 800 degrees C. The H-2/CO ratio was almost constant to 1.9 throughout the time on stream experiment. Highly dispersed nickel and the presence of strong metal support interaction were found to be the key factor for the superior activity of the catalyst. The effect of O-2 and H2O concentration on reactant conversions and H-2/CO ratios were also studied in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A pore scale Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is developed for multi-component mass transport and carbon deposition in the porous anode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fed with methane. In this model, the reforming and electrochemical reactions are discretely coupled via local molar fluxes of reactive gas species at catalytically active sites and triple phase boundaries (TPBs). By considering the heterogeneity of anode microstructure, the present pore scale LB model is capable of quantitatively predicting the local distributions of both the position and the amount of deposited carbon in the irregular porous anode. Using this model, the characteristics of carbon deposition in the anode are investigated. It is found that the heterogeneity of anode microstructure has significant influence on mass transport and carbon deposition. Increasing the pre-reforming extent of methane and decreasing the operating temperature are beneficial for the suppression of carbon deposition, whereas they will cause a relatively inferior cell performance. The LB model and results presented in this study are beneficial to mechanism investigation of carbon deposition. Furthermore, they are also helpful for studying the correlations between anode microstructure and carbon deposition and then bridging the manufacture of SOFC electrodes and their performance, which is useful to propose effective suggestions for avoiding performance degradation of SOFC induced by carbon deposition.

Abstract: An industrial heat pump can upgrade heat from a low temperature level to a high temperature level with the aid of an external energy source. It has received considerable attention as an efficient means of waste energy recovery in the recent years in China. This paper summarizes the research work done and advances in the application of industrial heat pump systems in China, including advances in refrigerants, multistage system, double-effect absorption system, compression-absorption system, solar assisted system, and chemical heat pump system. Industrial heat pumps used in three industrial fields (drying of wastewater sludge, crude oil heating in oil field, and process heating in printing and dyeing) are discussed in detail. Three basic problems in designing an engineering heat pump system, i.e., selection of the type of heat pump and determination of its capacity, energetic and exergetic analyses of the heat pump, and estimation of investment payback time are discussed in the above three industries, respectively. Further research needs in China on industrial heat pumps are proposed, which may also be beneficial to the international community. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel capric-myristic-stearic acid (CA-MA-SA)/modified expanded vermiculite composite phase change material (PCM) with simultaneously enhanced thermal conductivity and latent heat was prepared in this study. The expanded vermiculite/carbon composite (EVC), obtained by in-situ carbonizing cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide in the layer of expanded vermiculite, was treated with nitric acid (aEVC) to be used as the CA-MA-SA supporting matrix. The results showed that the thermal conductivity of CA-MA-SA/aEVC was greatly enhanced by introducing carbon and the CA-MA-SA adsorption capacity was improved by the acid-treatment of EVC. The thermal conductivity of CA-MA-SA/aEVC was 0.667 W/mK, which was 31.6% higher than that of CA-MA-SA/expanded vermiculite (EV). The latent heats of the CA-MA-SA/aEVC were 86.4 J/g at the melting temperature of 22.92 degrees C and 80.43 J/g at the freezing temperature of 21.03 degrees C, which were also greatly higher than those of CA-MA-SA/EV. The results of the thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), thermal cycling test and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) indicated that the CA-MA-SA/aEVC composite PCM was thermally stable and chemically inert. Thus, the prepared CA-MA-SA/aEVC composite PCM is a promising material for the building energy efficiency applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: While single pump design allows operation at high performance levels, multi-pumping systems are controlled to cover actual flow rate requirements, with less emphasis on power consumption. Widely accessible sensors and programmable controllers can improve this approach.
This paper discusses the methodology for optimizing analysis of a complex pumping system with set of parallel centrifugal pumps. For this purpose, an experimental model pumping station, with four pumps in a parallel configuration, was designed and constructed. Auxiliary equipment allows control of each pump by three possible methods: (i) discharge valve, (ii) by-pass flow, and (iii) variable speed drive (VSD). For system performance optimization, three estimating strategies, that are functions of control input parameters at each pump were proposed: (i) minimization of power consumption, (ii) flow rate balancing and (iii) maximization of overall efficiency.
A Uniquely developed (C++) genetic algorithm (GENOCOP) determined solutions and these were positively verified by measurements at the model experimental station. Results show the existence of multiple local extrema for all of estimating strategies. These solutions show it is possible to control a complex pumping station with various combinations of control parameters, giving similar results. This analysis demonstrates that the strategy of minimizing power consumption is the most energy efficient and proves the described methodology as a powerful tool for optimizing of complex pumping stations.

Abstract: Ocean thermal energy is formed by temperature difference between sea surface and deep sea. Underwater glider is a new kind of autonomous underwater vehicle. It ascends and descends between the sea surface and deep sea periodically by adjusting its net buoyancy. Thermal underwater glider can harvest ocean thermal energy through the utilization of phase change material (PCM) and convert it into mechanical energy for buoyancy-driven. In this paper, the fundamental principle of this thermal engine is unveiled. A nonlinear model for relationship between system pressure and phase change rate is established. Based on the established nonlinear model, influencing factors for system pressure and stored energy are analyzed comprehensively. Selected PCM is Hexadecane. Value range for air solubility in liquidus PCM is 0.06-0.1, and for residual air in the system is -0.02 to 0.05. The influence of these two factors on relative energy storage is similar. For typical values of air solubility 0.08 and residual air 0.005, utilization ratio of the thermal engine is less than 50%. Through experiment in the lake, the nonlinear model was verified, maximum system pressure was 12.5 MPa, and average stored energy of each cycle was 2.48 kJ. A prototype of thermal underwater glider has also been tested in the South China Sea. It had worked continuously for 29 days without any failure. Total number of working profile was 121 and total cruising range was 677 km, total stored energy was 300 kJ. High reliability and performance was validated by the sea trial. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Utilization of forest and wood residues to produce bioenergy and biofuels could generate additional revenue streams for forestry companies, reduce their environmental impacts and generate new development opportunities for forest-dependent communities. Further development of forest-based biorefineries entails addressing complexities and challenges related to biomass procurement, logistics, technologies, and sustainability. Numerous optimization models have been proposed for the economic and environmental design of biomass-to-bioenergy or biofuel supply chains. A few of them also maximized the job creation potential of the supply chain through the use of employment multipliers. The use of a total job creation indicator as the social optimization objective implies that all new jobs generate the same level of social benefit. In this paper, we quantify the potential social benefit of new forest-based biorefinery supply chains considering different impacts of new jobs based on their type and location. This social benefit is incorporated into a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model that maximizes the social benefit, net present value and greenhouse gas emission saving potential of a forest based biorefinery supply chain. The applicability of the model is illustrated through a case study in the interior region of British Columbia, Canada where different utilization paths for available forest and wood residues are investigated. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using a Pareto-generating method. The analysis of the generated set of Pareto-optimal solutions show a trade-off between the net present value of the supply chain and the other two investigated objectives. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the potential to generate high impact jobs in the region and its potential to generate greenhouse gas emission savings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In Tunisia, the building sector is considered as a major issue of energy consumption. A special attention should be drawn to improve the thermal quality of the building envelope with real consideration of the Tunisian climate specificity. One of the most effective measures is the roof insulation. Therefore, the present study is concerned with the determination of the optimum insulation thickness and the resulting energy savings and payback period for two typical roof structures and two types of insulation materials. An efficient analytical dynamic model based on the Complex Finite Fourier Transform (CFFT) is proposed and validated in order to handle the nonlinear longwave radiation (LWR) exchange with the sky. This model provides a short computational time solution of the transient heat transfer through multilayer roofs, which could be a good alternative to some numerical methods. Both heating and cooling annual loads are rigorously estimated and used as inputs to a life-cycle cost analysis. Among the studied cases, the most economical one is the hollow terracotta-based roof insulated with rock wool, where the optimum insulation thickness is estimated to be 7.9 cm, with a payback period of 6.06 years and energy savings up to 58.06% of the cost of energy consumed without insulation. The impact of the LWR exchange component is quantified and the results show its important effect on the annual transmission loads and, consequently, on optimum insulation thickness. A sensitivity analysis shows the efficiency of cool roofs in the Tunisian climate context, where the cooling energy cost benefits outweigh the wintertime penalty. Comparison of CFFT results with those of sol-air Degree-Hours (DH) shows that optimum insulation thickness and energy savings are overestimated and payback period is underestimated using the latter model. The proposed CFFT model could be an efficient tool for the design and the energy analysis of building envelope components in various climatic locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Smart grids are a promising solution to the rapidly growing power demand because they can considerably increase building energy efficiency. This study developed a novel time-series sliding window metaheuristic optimization-based machine learning system for predicting real-time building energy consumption data collected by a smart grid. The proposed system integrates a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and metaheuristic firefly algorithm-based least squares support vector regression (MetaFA-LSSVR) model. Specifically, the proposed system fits the SARIMA model to linear data components in the first stage, and the MetaFA-LSSVR model captures nonlinear data components in the second stage. Real-time data retrieved from an experimental smart grid installed in a building were used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed system. A kappa-week sliding window approach is proposed for employing historical data as input for the novel time-series forecasting system. The prediction system yielded high and reliable accuracy rates in 1-day-ahead predictions of building energy consumption, with a total error rate of 1.181% and mean absolute error of 0.026 kW h. Notably, the system demonstrates an improved accuracy rate in the range of 36.8-113.2% relative to those of the linear forecasting model (i.e., SARIMA) and nonlinear forecasting models (i.e., LSSVR and MetaFA-LSSVR). Therefore, end users can further apply the forecasted information to enhance efficiency of energy usage in their buildings, especially during peak times. In particular, the system can potentially be scaled up for using big data framework to predict building energy consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Most of the countries have increased the production of renewable energy to reduce pollution and their dependency on oil and natural gas. In case of Japan, solar power is increased rapidly, especially after the Fukushima Nuclear Accident. The load leveling and fluctuation absorption are the main bottlenecks to the integration of solar PV power into the future electricity system. Hydrogen is considered as an energy carrier in a future energy system based on renewable resources. Totalized Hydrogen Energy Utilization System (THEUS) consists of a unitized reversible fuel cell and a hydrogen storage tank. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the THEUS operation and performance at different variations in solar photovoltaic (PV) power during a sunny day and a partly cloudy day and to characterize its dynamic response. Energy efficiency of the THEUS was evaluated in water electrolyzer and fuel cell mode operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes a predictive segmentation technique for identifying sub-groups in a large population that are both homogeneous with respect to certain patterns in customer attributes, and predictive with respect to a desired outcome. Our motivation is creating a highly-interpretable and intuitive segmentation and targeting process for customers of energy utility companies that is also optimal in some sense. In this setting, the energy utility wants to design a small number of message types to be sent to appropriately-chosen customers who are most likely to respond to different types of communications. The proposed method uses consumption, demographics, and program enrollment data to extract basic predictive patterns using standard machine learning techniques. We next define a feasible potential assignment of patterns to a small number of segments described by expert guidelines and hypotheses about consumer characteristics, which are available from prior behavioral research. The algorithm then identifies an optimal allocation of patterns to segments that is feasible and maximizes predictive power. This is formulated as maximizing the minimum enrollment rate from across the segments, which is then expressed as solving a mixed-integer linear-fractional program. We propose a bisection-based method to quickly solve this program by means of identifying feasible sets. We exemplify the methodology on a large-scale dataset from a leading U.S. energy utility, and obtain segments of customers whose likelihood of enrollment is more than twice larger than that of the average population, and that are described by a small number of simple, intuitive rules. The segments designed this way achieve a 2-3 x improvement in the probability of enrollment over the overall population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The incremental capacity (IC) analysis method is widely used to analyze the aging origins and state of health (SOH) of lithium ion batteries. This paper analyzes the technical difficulties during the application of the IC analysis method at first. A universal capacity model based on charging curve is then proposed, which not only inherits the advantages of IC analysis method but also avoids the tedious data preprocessing procedure, to estimate SOH of lithium ion batteries. The feasibility and accuracy of the model are demonstrated. To verify the accuracy and flexibility of the proposed capacity model, it is applied on different types of lithium ion batteries including LiFePO4, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, and Li4/3Ti5/3O4. Furthermore, the proposed capacity model is applied on the aged cells to validate the model accuracy during the whole life span of lithium ion batteries. The results show that the model error is less than 4% of the nominal capacity for each case. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the capacity of a battery pack is essential for the battery management system (BMS) in electric vehicles. The SOCs and capacities of individual cells are the prerequisites for accurately estimating the capacity of a battery pack. This paper proposes quantitative analysis on how the estimation errors of individual cells' SOCs and capacities influence the estimation error of the battery pack capacity using an approach named Capacity-Quantity diagram (C-Q diagram). The analysis concludes that the estimation error of cell SOC has more influence on the estimation error of pack capacity than the estimation error of cell capacity does. The theoretical analysis is further validated by an experiment using six NCM batteries connected in series with different initial SOC variations. The results help to guide the determination of specifications, e.g., the estimation error of the SOC and that of the capacity, during the design process of a BMS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper tests to what extent different types of variables (building factors, socio-demographics, appliance ownership and use, attitudes and self-reported behaviours) explain annualized electricity consumption in residential buildings with gas-fuelled space and water heating. It then shows which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the study recognizes the problem of multicollinearity between predictors in regression analysis and uses Lasso regression to address this issue.
Using data from a sample of 845 English households collected in 2011/12, a comparison of four separate regression models showed that a model with the predictors of appliance ownership and use, including lighting, explained the largest share, 34%, of variability in electricity consumption. Socio-demographic variables on their own explained about 21% of the variability in electricity consumption with household size the most important predictor. Building variables only played a small role, presumably because heating energy consumption is not included, with only building size being a significant predictor. Self-reported energy-related behaviour, opinions about climate change and 'green lifestyle' were negligible. A combined model, encompassing all predictors, explained only 39% of all variability (adjusted R-2 = 34%), i.e. adding little above an appliance and lighting model only. Appliance variables together with household size, and dwelling size were consistently significant predictors of energy consumption.
The study highlights that when attempting to explain English household non-heating electricity consumption that variables directly influenced by people in the household have the strongest predictive power when taken together.

Abstract: The use of natural gas as fuel for solid oxide fuel cell is one of main potentials of this technology to be exploited as an efficient and profitable future power generation source. However, using direct methane (main component of natural gas) in conventional nickel-based fuel cells leads, to carbon deposition problem which causes performance failure even in short period (24 h). According to thermodynamic principles, fuel addition with oxygen carriers is a good solution to prevent carbon deposition problem. Among the different options, a deep investigation is here presented for the air addition case. Through experimental activity under different operating conditions and suitable performance and structural cell characterization, the 1:5 optimal air addition to methane is determined, providing outcomes of interest for SOFC operation optimization in case of direct methane feeding. In fact, through impedance spectroscopy analysis and voltage measurements, as well as ex-post structural analysis, it is proved that in these conditions both carbon deposition and anode layers delamination are avoided, also after 100 h operation; moreover a cell stable operation at 0.6 V is guaranteed. The proposed operation mode, therefore, represents a promising solution, to be deeply investigated in the future at stack level, for SOFCs directly fed with natural gas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Higher availability of future climate data sets, generated by regional climate models (RCMs) with fine temporal and spatial resolutions, improves and facilitates the impact assessment of climate change. Due to significant uncertainties in climate modeling, several climate scenarios should be considered in the impact assessment. This increases the number of simulations and size of data sets, complicating the assessment and decision making. This article suggests an easy-to-use method to decrease the number of simulations for the impact assessment of climate change in energy and building studies. The method is based on synthesizing three sets of weather data out of one or more RCMs: one typical and two extremes. The method aims at decreasing the number of weather data sets without losing the quality and details of the original future climate scenarios. The application of the method is assessed for an office building in Geneva and the residential building stock in Stockholm.
Results show that using the synthesized data sets provides an accurate estimation of future conditions. Variations and uncertainties of future climate are represented by the synthesized data. In the case of synthesizing weather data using multiple climate scenarios, the number of simulations and the size of data sets are decreased enormously. Combining the typical and extreme data sets enables to have better probability distributions of future conditions, very similar to the original RCM data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work, we investigated the gas and water production profiles from methane hydrates formed in an excess water environment that mimic marine locations. Instead of pressurization by the addition of gas, water was injected into the sediment to create the high pressure environment of the reservoir, thereby creating a hydrate bearing sediment of high water saturation similar to those in marine locations. A framework is introduced to determine fractions of methane converted into hydrates during hydrate formation stage taking into account the effect of density changes, solubility and the in-situ pressure and temperature conditions. As opposed to 100% conversion assumed in the previous excess water works, our quantification shows that on average, the fractional conversion of methane is around 81.5% at comparable or larger experimental time scales (76-408 h). Upon the formation of quantitatively similar hydrate bearing sediments, the dissociation of methane hydrate was done under a constant pressure of 4.5 MPa subjecting to different thermal stimulation extents from 278.7 K to 285.2 K. It was found that low temperature driving force would result in an extremely low dissociation rate, and a minimum temperature of 280.7 K (corresponding to 2.1 K temperature driving force) is required to achieve a 90% dissociation within 10 h. In addition, through a simplified estimation of energy efficiency ratio (EER) and analysis of water production profile, we demonstrated the importance of water management in developing methods to effectively recover energy from hydrate bearing sediments.

Abstract: In this study, a novel titanium thin LGDL with well-tunable pore morphologies was developed by employing nano-manufacturing and was applied in a standard PEMEC. The LGDL tests show significant performance improvements. The operating voltages required at a current density of 2.0 A/cm(2) were as low as 1.69 V, and its efficiency reached a report high of up to 88%. The new thin and flat LGDL with well-tunable straight pores has been demonstrated to remarkably reduce the ohmic, interfacial and transport losses. In addition, well-tunable features, including pore size, pore shape, pore distribution, and thus porosity and permeability, will be very valuable for developing PEMEC models and for validation of its simulations with optimal and repeatable performance. The LGDL thickness reduction from greater than 350 mu m of conventional LGDLs to 25 mu m will greatly decrease the weight and volume of PEMEC stacks, and represents a new direction for future developments of low-cost PEMECs with high performance.

Abstract: With a rapid increase in capacity, independently-invested energy storage systems (ESSs) might take up a significant share in the generation mix, and would be required to participate in the electricity market. Considering the arbitrage capability of ESSs, their behaviors would be remarkably different from those of conventional generators, impacting the market equilibrium. These impacts would vary with the type of ESSs and the generation mix. Therefore, this paper formulates a multi-period market equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to study the strategic behaviors of different types of ESSs and their impacts on the market outcomes, assuming that ESSs behave as price-makers. The EPEC model is established within a general framework, which considers the individual profit-maximization behaviors of different ESSs and generators, including thermal units, hydro units and renewable units. Interactions between different generators and the market operator are also represented. Finally, numerical studies based on a modified IEEE 57-node system with different wind generation curves are performed for illustration and validation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A solar energy driven and membrane-based air humidification-dehumidification desalination (MHDD) system is proposed. A test rig is designed and constructed to investigate the performance of the system. The test rig consists of a U-tube evacuated solar collector, a heat storage water tank, a membrane-based humidifier (hollow fiber membrane module) and a dehumidifier (a fin-and-tube heat exchanger). A theoretical model for the whole system simulation is developed and validated. Performance indices of the system, such as the specific water production rate on the basis of unit area of membrane (SWR), specific electric energy consumption on unit volume of water production (SEC), coefficient of performance (COP) and electric coefficient of performance (COPE) are investigated. The effects of various parameters including the saline water flow rate, the air flow rate and the packing fraction of the membrane module, etc., on system performance are examined. It indicates that solar energy accounts for 92.0% of the energy consumption by the whole system. Sensible heat losses account for most of the energy losses from the system. High-purity water is produced by this system at a SWR of 25.88 kg m(-2) d(-1), a SEC of 19.23 kW h/m(3),

a COP of 0.75 and a COPE of 36.13. The feasible operating parameters investigated are: hot saline water flow rate, 2361411 for per unit area of membrane; air flow rate, 25 m(3)/h for per unit area of membrane; module packing faction, 30%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A comprehensive review of phase change materials (PCMs) with phase transition temperatures between 0 and 250 degrees C is presented. From that review, organic compounds and salt hydrates seem more promising below 100 degrees C and eutectic mixtures from 100 to 250 degrees C.
Practical indirect heat exchanger designs for latent heat storage systems were also assessed and feasible heat enhancement mechanisms reviewed. The focus on this temperature range is due to potential CO2 emissions reduction able to be achieved replacing conventional heating and cooling applications in the domestic, commercial and public administration sectors, which represented around a quarter of the UK's final energy consumption in 2015.

Abstract: A char combustion model is developed to study the effect of CO2 on the combustion of coarse char particles under oxy-fuel conditions in a fluidized bed (FB). It is a transient one-dimensional model, taking into account the heat and mass transfer from the bed to the particle and the heterogeneous combustion and gasification of char. The model shows good ability to predict the char temperature history measured in our previous work for different combinations of O-2/CO2 and O-2/N-2 with various coal types. Simulations are carried out to establish the role of CO2 in oxy-fuel conversion at different O-2 levels, particle sizes, and bed temperatures. The model is used to analyze the relative contribution of carbon in the char consumed by CO2 (gasification) and O-2 (combustion), as well as the differences of the peak temperatures and the burnout times in O-2/CO2 and O-2/N-2 for char particles in a commercial FB combustor. The results indicate that the conversion of coarse (mm size) char particles in an oxy-FB is controlled by the diffusion of O-2 both in the O-2/CO2 and O-2/N-2 case. The burn-out time decreases with the bed temperature also in both cases. The lower O-2 diffusion rate in CO2 compared to N-2, is the main reason for the longer burnout time and lower peak temperature found using O-2/CO2 at bed temperatures of 1073-1173 K. In that temperature window, the contribution of the CO2-char gasification is limited, being notable only at high bed temperature in O-2/CO2, e.g. 1223 K. In such high temperature conditions (rarely expected to be found in commercial coal FBC) the predicted burnout time of a lignite char-particle becomes shorter in O-2/CO2 than in O-2/N-2.

Abstract: The growth of worldwide environmental awareness has prompted numerous countries to focus on developing energy-conservation and carbon-reduction technology. The advancement of such technology enables the emergence of low-noise, low-polluting alternatives for bus systems, such as hybrid electric, battery-electric, and fuel-cell electric buses (e-buses). For such buses to serve the existing schedules and lines operated by their conventional counterparts, reorganizing bus transportation systems is a major challenge and entails construction costs that comprise the costs of e-buses, battery capacity, chargers, and bus scheduling.
To facilitate the development of environmentally friendly public transportation, this study proposes a model for simulating the operation and battery charging schedule of plug-in e-buses on the basis of an existing schedule and line network. The model was used to estimate the overall construction cost of converting the existent bus transportation system into an all plug-in e-bus one. Focusing on the bus transportation system in Penghu, an archipelago of Taiwan, this case study examined the effects of day- and nighttime charging requirements on the construction cost of an e-bus transportation system to improve the practicability of e-buses. It also applied a genetic algorithm to determine the minimum construction cost, which varied depending on the number of e-buses, level of battery capacity, number of chargers, and electricity costs. The optimized parameters, involved the hourly residual battery capacity and battery charging times during the daytime operating hours. The results showed that although daytime charging involved electricity uses during peak hours and thus incurred additional costs, it contributed to the use of e-buses and an overall reduction in the construction cost. In summary, the proposed optimization method would successfully reduce the construction cost of the Penghu e-bus transportation system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Due to decreasing solar module prices, some solar developers are increasing their projects' inverter loading ratio (ILR), defined as the ratio of DC module capacity to AC inverter capacity. In this study, we examine the operational impacts of this trend. Using minute-level solar data, we examine the relationship between inverter induced clipping losses and AC, generation. We find minimal clipping losses at an ILR of 1.25; at an ILR of 2.0, we observe that 16% of potential annual generation is lost. Minute-level data prove to be essential in determining the generation lost to clipping, as hourly data mask key clipping and ramping events. Higher ILRs lead to a greater frequency of time spent at maximum generation, but also a greater frequency and magnitude of large solar ramping events. Module degradation can attenuate the impacts of inverter clipping over time. We observe that the effective degradation rate (net of any changes to inverter clipping losses) can be as little as half the actual degradation rate for projects with high ILRs. The diurnal and seasonal trends in clipping correspond with solar insolation patterns, with the highest clipping occurring around noon. For fixed tilt installations with tilt angles at latitude, we observe the highest clipping near the autumnal and vernal equinoxes. Increasing the tilt angle leads to more winter clipping, while lower tilt angles shifts the clipping, to summer months. Shifting from fixed tilt to north-south single axis tracking increases the generation lost to clipping significantly. At an. ILR of 1.25, annual clipping approximately doubles to 1% compared to fixed tilt at latitude, while clipping under an ILR of 2.0 increases to 22%, compared to 16% for the fixed configuration. As expected, more clipping occurs during the hours preceding and following noon when using single axis tracking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We present a mathematical model to diagnose HVAC systems in buildings based upon the analysis of a small number of ambient state variables. In particular, the equations of the model accurately fit recorded data of temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentration in different workplaces. For validation, data were obtained under different conditions and with different sensors. In particular, we designed and fabricated a wireless sensor that measures and transmits data to a remote device and we also, applied our model to data collected using a commercial sensor. For each case, information was obtained that could be used to understand and predict the evolution of ambient variables that impact thermal comfort and energy consumption in buildings. The tools presented here can thus be of great interest to achieve affordable, smart energy-efficient buildings, while adhering to environmental laws and comfort for work spaces.

Abstract: The production of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) from steel slag has been proposed as a potential method of simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions from the steelmaking process and turning its waste stream into a valuable product. On average the production of one ton of steel results in two tons of CO2 emissions and 600 kg of slag. Globally, more than 400 Mt of steel slag are produced annually. If all the slag were used for the production of PCC, 64 Mt CO2 could be utilized and 145 Mt of calcium carbonate would be produced. In 2014 the research group Energy Engineering and Environmental Protection at Aalto University in Finland has designed, constructed and tested the world's first mineral carbonation pilot plant test facility that converts steel slag and CO2 into PCC. In batch mode the pilot plant can handle up to 20 kg of solid steel slag and 190 L of liquid solvent, and it can produce about 10 kg of calcium carbonate, The solvent can be regenerated and reused in the calcium extraction stage, which makes the process economically more feasible. Almost 80% of the calcium in the slag was extracted, while more than 70% of the CO2 was utilized and converted into PCC. In high temperature carbonation tests, ammonia gas was detected from the flue gases. At 60 degrees C more than 2 vol.% of NH3 was detected in the flue gas, and at 50 degrees C it was 0.65 vol.%, while at 45 degrees C the NH3 concentration in the flue gas was only 0.11 vol.%. To avoid ammonia evaporation, aragonite PCC can be produced at 45 degrees C by optimizing the CO2 flow rate.
The paper presents the process design as well as the early results achieved from the pilot plant. The paper also presents technical challenges that occurred during the scale-up work and experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this article we present an approach that enables joint wind speed and wind power forecasts for a wind park. We combine a multivariate seasonal time varying threshold autoregressive moving average (TVARMA) model with a power threshold generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (power-TGARCH) model. The modeling framework incorporates diurnal and annual periodicity modeling by periodic B-splines, conditional heteroscedasticity and a complex autoregressive structure with non-linear impacts. In contrast to usually time-consuming estimation approaches as likelihood estimation, we apply a high-dimensional shrinkage technique. We utilize an iteratively re-weighted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) technique. It allows for conditional heteroscedasticity, provides fast computing times and guarantees a parsimonious and regularized specification, even though the parameter space may be vast. We are able to show that our approach provides accurate forecasts of wind power at a turbine-specific level for forecasting horizons of up to 48 h (short- to medium-term forecasts).

Abstract: With increasing concern over ultrafine Particulate Matter (PM) emissions from Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) engines and ever tightening emissions legislation, substantial research work is required to obtain a better understanding of influence of advanced engine technologies on particulate formation and oxidation. In this work, experimental investigation of engine-out particulate emissions were carried out on a single cylinder spray-guided DISI engine. With regard to effects of engine hardware on PM emissions; impacts of fuel spray angle, fuel flow rate and intake valves' lift and camshaft phasing were examined over a wide start of injection sweep window. Injector tests highlighted a complex relation between injector characteristics and engine operating parameters with PM emissions as a result of fuel impingement and poor mixture preparation. Valvetrain tests indicated some benefits from engine throttling by valve lift and intake camshaft phasing in particulate number concentration reduction at low load. This was associated with increased intake flow turbulence and improved mixture preparation. Number weighted particle size distribution was also affected by intake valve modes at low load. Nevertheless, at high load, impacts of variable valve lift and camshaft phasing on particulate number concentration and size distribution became negligible. Furthermore, combustion phase indicators were studied in order to probe impacts of combustion performance on PM emissions. While no satisfactory correlation of initial flame development with PM emissions was identified; shorter rapid-burning angles were observed with lower particulate number concentrations.

Abstract: Ground-coupled heat pumps are widely applied in cold regions, but soil thermal imbalances in some projects greatly deteriorate the systems' practical performances and heavily inhibit the systems' reasonable applications. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the main problems caused by soil thermal imbalance and the existing solutions targeting on them. The caused problems mainly present in the following aspects: soil temperature decrease, heating performance deterioration, heating reliability decline, and even system failure. Three kinds of existing solutions can be classified. Ground heat exchanger modified solutions including increasing borehole space, increasing borehole length, modifying borehole layout, and improving thermal properties, can retard the thermal imbalance to some extent, suitable to projects with slight imbalance. System-modified solutions integrating auxiliary energy sources like fossil fuel, solar energy, ambient air and waste heat with ground-coupled heat pumps or using ground-coupled absorption heat pumps, can eliminate serious thermal imbalance essentially by increasing soil thermal injection and decreasing the extraction. Thus, they are dominant in the applications and attract more attention along with the utilization of renewable energies. Apart from the modifications of system design, operation-modified solutions, like seasonal and intermittent operations, are also helpful to maintain better soil thermal balance. Based on the overview, the current application situations and economic performance of different solutions are discussed. Finally, some suggestions for the applications of ground source heat pumps in cold regions are proposed to make the overview helpful for the system research and applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Because of the limited resources of micro-controller, rule-based energy management strategies are still very popular for online control of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, however, the control results may deviate from the optimal control results. Since the city bus routes are predetermined, the speed profiles of the certain bus route do not make much difference, this indeed creates an opportunity to design a novel energy management strategy that can reduce the micro-controller resources usage. and achieve close to optimal control performance. To accomplish these goals, the single parameter of length ratio was introduced to represent trip information, and a novel efficient neural network module structure was designed to reduce the calculation time and memory usage of micro-controller. Finally, the length ratio based neural network energy management strategy was proposed for online control of plug-in hybrid electric city bus. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can greatly decrease the total cost compared with the charge-depleting and charge-sustaining control strategy and can be regarded as an approximated global optimal energy management strategy.

Abstract: Outdoor characterization of thermal and daylight performance of an evacuated (vacuum) glazing has been conducted using an outdoor test cell for clear sunny day, intermittent day and overcast days. An average overall heat transfer coefficient of 1.4 W/m(2) K was found for vacuum glazing. Solar heat gain coefficient of vacuum glazing varied between 0.58 and 0.19. Vacuum glazing has potential to reduce 53% heat loss compared to a same area of double-glazing while offering nearly equal amount of heat gain. Internal daylight illuminance was found to be similar to double glazing,indicating that the presence of small pillars inside vacuum glazing had no significant visual impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Latent heat storage units utilizing stable supercooling of sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) composites were tested in a laboratory. The stainless steel units were 1.5 m high cylinders with internal heat exchangers of tubes with fins. One unit was tested with 116 kg SAT with 6% extra water. Another unit was tested with 116.3 kg SAT with 0.5% Xanthan rubber as a thickening agent and 4.4% graphite powder. The heat exchange capacity rate during charge was significantly lower for the unit with SAT and Xanthan rubber compared to the unit with SAT and extra water. This was due to less convection in the thickened phase change material after melting. The heat content in the fully charged state and the heat released after solidification of the supercooled SAT mixtures at ambient temperature was higher for the unit with the thickened SAT mixture. The heat discharged after solidification of the supercooled SAT with extra water decreased over repeating charge and discharge cycles while the heat discharged from the SAT with Xanthan rubber remained stable. In both units, the solidification started spontaneously in the majority of the test cycles. This was due to the design of the unit of the method for handling the expansion and contraction of the SAT during charge and discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hydrogen production by sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of bio-oil model compounds was thermodynamically and experimentally studied by mixing acetic acid (AcH) and acetone (ACCO), in a fluidized bed reactor. In the SESR process the catalytic reforming reaction and CO2 removal by sorption were carried out simultaneously in a single reactor. The SESR of the model compounds and their blends was performed under atmospheric pressure over a Pd/Ni-Co hydrotalcite-like material (HT) catalyst using dolomite as CO2 sorbent. The effects of the reaction temperature (475-725 degrees C), steam/C molar ratio and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) were studied. For the SESR of acetic acid, acetone and their blends it was observed that the H-2 yield and H-2 concentration increase as the temperature increases, reaching a maximum value, and then they decrease with the temperature. It was also found that the CH4 concentration, decreases as the temperature increases, while the CO and CO2 concentrations increase with the rise in temperature. High steam/C molar ratio values and low WHSV values favor the H-2 yield and H2 concentration, while they lead to a decrease in the CH4 concentration. Hydrogen purities as high as 99.2-99.4% with small amounts of methane, CO and CO2 were obtained for the SESR of the model compounds of bio-oil and their blends at a temperature of 575 degrees C at atmospheric pressure. The effect of temperature on the SESR of the blends of model compounds of bio-oil is similar to that of the individual model compounds studied, except in the fact that lower H-2 yield values are obtained by the SESR of the blends (83.3-88.6%) compared to the individual model compounds (90.2-95.9%), a decrease which becomes more noticeable as the proportion of acetone in the blend is increased.

Abstract: In this study, the enrichment of trace elements in two coals under air and oxy-combustion conditions was studied. Twenty-one trace elements were evaluated. The two coal samples had a different concentration for the 21 trace elements, which was due to differences in the maceral composition. Based on the Relative Enrichment (RE) values calculated for the 21 trace elements in this study, 16 of them are non-volatile and the rest (5) are semi-volatile and volatile elements. The non-volatile elements are Li, Cr, V, Mn, Sr, Ba, Cu, Rb, Co, Ni, Ga, Pb, Be, Mo and U. The semi volatile and volatile elements are Ag, Cd, Te, Bi and Ti.
In air combustion, only 9 of the 16 non-volatile trace elements have the same enrichment behaviour in the two coals when the temperature was increased from 900 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. The 9 trace elements are Cr, Mn, Cu, Co, Ni, Mo, V, Zn and Pb. In oxy combustion, only 5 of the 16 non-volatile trace elements and they are Cr, Sr, Rb, Ni and Mo. Only 3 of the 16 non-volatile trace elements have the same enrichment behaviour under both air and oxy-combustion conditions. The three elements were Cr, Mn and Mo.
For the 5 semi-volatile and volatile trace elements, only 3 had the same enrichment behaviour in air combustion in both coal samples when the temperature was increased from 900 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. The three are Bi, Te and Ti. In oxy-combustion, Bi had the same enrichment behaviour when the temperature was increased from 900 degrees C to 1000 degrees C.
The results show that the difference in the enrichment behaviour for both coal samples at different combustion temperatures is more significant under oxy-combustion conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Active demand response (ADR) is a powerful instrument among electric demand side management strategies to influence the customers' load shape. Assessing the real potential of ADR programmes in improving the performance of the electric power system is a complex task, due to the strict interaction between supply and demand for electricity, which requires integrated modelling tools. In this paper an analysis is performed aimed at evaluating the benefits of ADR programmes in terms of electricity consumption and operational costs, both from the final user's and the overall system's perspective. The demand side technologies considered are electric heating systems (i.e. heat pumps and electric resistance heaters) coupled with thermal energy storage (i.e. the thermal mass of the building envelope and the domestic hot water tank). In particular, the effect of the penetration rate of ADR programmes among consumers with electric heating systems is studied. Results clearly show that increasing the number of participating consumers increases the flexibility of the system and, therefore, reduces the overall operational costs. On the other hand, the benefit per individual participant decreases in the presence of more ADR-adherent consumers since a reduced effort from each consumer is needed. Total cost saving ranges at most between about 400(sic) and 200(sic) per participant per year for a 5% and 100% ADR penetration rate respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Gas-fired tankless water heaters are gaining popularity as a means of producing domestic hot water for residential applications. As they become more widespread, these devices are increasingly becoming important to researchers who are seeking models of these devices that can be used to make reasonable predictions of their energy consumption. This is especially true for the case of condensing tankless water heaters as they have been shown to be the most efficient method of producing domestic hot water. Current models of these devices do exist, however, the uncertainties of their predictions are unclear and require data collected from onerous field-trials for calibration.
This article makes a contribution by introducing a new model of a condensing tankless water heater whose uncertainties are well described that can be calibrated by a less-onerous experimental program in a laboratory. The model was calibrated with data spanning a range of conditions: inlet temperatures between 10 and 23 degrees C, water flow rates between 0.08 and 0.27 L s(-1) and outlet temperatures between 36 and 48 degrees C.
The model predictions were validated against data emanating from a previous field-trial. Above domestic hot water consumption values of 15 MJ day(-1), the coefficient of determination (r(2) value) was 0.98. The average error (difference between the average model predictions and the measured values) was 3.0% (in relative terms) while the root mean square error was 4.2%. The maximum error for a single point was 8.7% at a domestic hot water consumption of approximately 30.2 MJ day(-1). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Waste biomass is generated during the conservation management of semi-natural habitats, and represents an unused resource and potential bioenergy feedstock that does not compete with food production. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to characterise a representative range of biomass generated during conservation management in Wales. Of the biomass types assessed, those dominated by rush (Juncos effuses) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) exhibited the highest and lowest volatile compositions respectively and were selected for bench scale conversion via fast pyrolysis. Each biomass type was ensiled and a sub-sample of silage was washed and pressed. Demineralization of conservation biomass through washing and pressing was associated with higher oil yields following fast pyrolysis. The oil yields were within the published range established for the dedicated energy crops miscanthus and willow. In order to examine the potential a multiple output energy system was developed with gross power production estimates following valorisation of the press fluid, char and oil. If used in multi fuel industrial burners the char and oil alone would displace 3.9 x 10(5) tonnes per year of No. 2 light oil using Welsh biomass from conservation management. Bioenergy and product development using these feedstocks could simultaneously support biodiversity management and displace fossil fuels, thereby reducing GHG emissions. Gross power generation predictions show good potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel demand response estimation framework for residential and commercial buildings using a combination of EnergyPlus and two-state models for thermostatically controlled loads. Specifically, EnergyPlus models for commercial and multi-dwelling residential units are applied to construct exhaustive datasets (i.e., with more than 300M data points) that capture the detailed load response and complex thermodynamics of several building types. Subsequently, regression models are fit to each dataset to predict DR potential based on key inputs, including hour of day, set point change and outside air temperature. For single residential units, and residential thermostatically controlled loads (i.e. water heaters and refrigerators) a two-state model from the literature is applied. For commercial office building and Multiple Dwelling Units (MDUs) building, the fitted regression model can predict DR potential with 80-90% accuracy for more than 90% of data points. The coefficients of, determination (i.e. R-2 value) range between 0.54 and 0.78 for the office buildings and 0.39-0.81 for MDUs, respectively. The proposed framework is then validated for commercial buildings through a comparison with a dataset composed of 11 buildings during 12 demand response events. In addition, the use of the proposed simplified DR estimation framework is presented in terms of two cases (1) peak load shed prediction in an individual building and (2) aggregated DR up/down capacity from a large-scale group of different buildings.

Abstract: This paper aims at providing insight on the ability that thermal energy storage (TES) systems have to reduce the cost of operating CHP plants, when an optimal switching policy is adopted to regulate the storage level under uncertain market conditions and also uncertain load demands.
To achieve this goal, this paper first proposes an efficient program to determine such an optimal policy, conceptually in line with the energy arbitrage capabilities attributed to electrical energy storage. The proposed algorithm is based on dynamic programming to cope with the stochastic nature of the problem in a Monte Carlo framework, while still keeping down its dimensionality. In addition, it is structured around simple manipulations of third-order tensors, which demonstrate to be effective in accelerating the speed of convergence.
The program has been thereafter applied to a case analysis, based on a gas microturbine (MT) powering a small-size CHP plant, with associated TES and peak boiler; with a detailed formulation of the efficiency deterioration of the system at part-load operation. The optimal switching policy ensuing from solving the problem by means of the proposed algorithm shows to be strongly dependent on the plant layout. Additionally, the efficiency deterioration, as well as the existence of operation thresholds because of increased pollutant emissions, relevantly affect the optimal switching policy. An interpretation of the reasons why this occurs, along with a characterization, is provided based on the results yielded by the algorithm. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the cost of operating the plant under different assumptions leads to a discussion about the optimal and threshold sizes of the MT and the TES.

Abstract: The penetration of the electric vehicle (EV) has increased rapidly in recent years mainly as a consequence of advances in transport technology and power electronics and in response to global pressure to reduce carbon emissions and limit fossil fuel consumption. It is widely acknowledged that inappropriate provision and dispatch of EV charging can lead to negative impacts on power system infrastructure. This paper considers EV requirements and proposes a module which uses owner participation, through mobile phone apps and on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II), for scheduled vehicle charging. A multi-EV reference and single-EV real-time response (MRS2R) online algorithm is proposed to calculate the maximum and minimum adjustable limits of necessary capacity, which forms part of decision-making support in power system dispatch. The proposed EV dispatch module is evaluated in a case study and the influence of the mobile app, EV dispatch trending and commercial impact is explored. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Prognostics applications on PEMFC are developing these last years. Indeed, taking decision to extend the lifetime of a PEMFC stack based on behavior and remaining useful life predictions is seen as a promising solution to tackle the too short life's issue of PEMFC5. However, the development of prognostics shows some lacks in the literature. Indeed, performing prognostics requires health indicators that reflect the state of health of stack, while being able to interpret them in an industrial context. It is also important to propose criteria to set its end of life. Moreover, to trust any prognostics' application, one should be able to evaluate the performance of its algorithms with respect to standards. To help launching a discussion on these subjects among scientific and industrial actors, this paper addresses some of the issues encountered when performing prognostics of a PEMFC stack. After showing the link between prognostics and decision, this paper proposes guidelines to set the limits of a prognostics approach. The definitions of healthy and degraded modes are discussed as well as how to choose the time instant to perform predictions. Then, three criteria based on the power produced by the stack are proposed as indicators of the state of health of the stack. The definition of the end of life of the stack is also discussed before proposing some criteria to assess the performance of any prognostics algorithm on a PEMFC. Some perspectives of works are also discussed before coneluding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, the effect of latitude on the performance of different solar trackers is examined. The hourly solar radiation data of different locations around Europe and Africa measured on a horizontal surface is collected and utilized. Widely validated Perez anisotropic model is used to predict the diffuse component of the solar radiation on an inclined surface. Different solar trackers namely, Full/dual-axis, East-West (EW), North-South (NS), Inclined East-West (IEW), and Vertical-axis (V) trackers are considered in calculating the available solar potential of the locations. The performance of the solar trackers in terms of the energy gain is ranked according to the area location latitudes. The results show that the tracking performance is highly dependent on the locations, thus changes with the latitude. The percentage variation among the implemented one-axis tracking options relative to dual-axis trackers ranges from 0.42% to 23.4%. Overall, the increase in the energy gain of dual-axis trackers compared to the optimal fixed panel for the locations varies from 17.72% to 31.23%, thus emphasizes the importance of solar trackers. Finally, the study is expected to aid designers in the selection and installation of appropriate solar trackers in the regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The constant polarization voltage is managed for battery heating to achieve a good tradeoff between short heating time and less damage to battery lifetime based on an electro-thermal coupled model. The optimal frequency for maximum heat generation rate at a certain temperature is determined, which is different from the frequency for minimum total impedance. Heating under variable frequency is almost the same as under a constant frequency in terms of heating time and efficiency. However, engineering realization for variable frequency is more difficult, implying that constant frequency heating is a more promising candidate. The optimal frequency during the overall heating process, which is always lower than that at the initial temperature, can be evaluated from the intermediate temperature with low computational effort. Experimental results demonstrate that the heating time at the optimal frequency, corresponding to the maximum heat generation during the overall heating process, is. the shortest with high efficiency. The battery is heated from -15.4 degrees C to 5.6 degrees C within 338 s, an average temperature-rise rate of 3.73 degrees C/min with an essentially uniform temperature distribution. The proposed heating strategy, which is experimentally verified with no apparent detrimental effect on battery health, is of great potential for rapidly improving operating performance of electric vehicles in cold weather.

Abstract: The application of solar energy is investigated for the synthesis of di-methyl ether (DME) in a solar irradiated dry methane reformer (DMR). Solar radiations are concentrated onto a receiver and distributed to the reaction zone to provide necessary energy for syngas (CO and H-2) generation. In order to maintain a H-2/CO molar ratio of '1', as required in DME synthesis, the produced syngas is processed via two alternative routes: solar reformer coupled in parallel with a non-solar reformer (SoR-NSoR) and solar reformer integrated with a water-gas shift reactor (SoR-WGS). It is found that steam methane reforming (SMR) is the most suitable methodology when coupled with a solar reformer due to high H-2 content in the SMR syngas. Further performance analysis is conducted by simulating three days of operation under different insolation levels (high, medium and low irradiations). The simulation results showed that the SoR-WGS configuration produces the highest improvements of 18.7%, 32.2% and 20% in terms of methane, energy and CO2 emission intensity respectively. This enhanced process performance originates from the exothermic nature of the WGS process which helps in controlling the overall syngas composition, whereas the SoR-NSoR requires fossil based thermal energy to drive the NSoR process to similar control targets. This promising improvement of all metrics in SoR-WGS may stimulate in-depth techno-economic feasibility of this unique solar integration for DME and other synthetic fuels production.

Abstract: Following a request of the European Commission in 2012, different bodies within the gas energy sector have been working on a Network Code for transmission tariffs. The final goal is to get a more harmonized structure within the European Union. This paper complements those efforts by developing a formal treatment of some methodological aspects arising in past and present drafts of the Network Code.
First, the analysis provides simple formulas for the computation of the tariffs resulting from the application of two of the main methodologies that have been discussed in the official documents: the capacity-weighted distance approach and the least squares approach. Second, it is shown that the tariffs delivered by the two approaches are perfectly correlated with each other. Maybe more importantly, if a natural adjustment is performed to control tariff dispersion, then both approaches lead to exactly the same tariffs.
Moreover, the analysis highlights an issue that may have been overlooked by regulators and also by past publications: the difference between weighted and unweighted versions of the methodologies under study and the reasons why weighted versions should be preferred. The paper concludes with a brief comparison with other methodologies and discussing some policy implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Small-scale distributed gasification can provide energy access for low-carbon sustainable development, though current understanding of the economic and environmental performance of the technology relies mostly on assumption-heavy modeling studies. Here we report a detailed empirical assessment and uncertainty estimation for four real-world gasification power systems operating at rice mills in rural Cambodia. System inputs and outputs were characterized while operating in both diesel and dual-fuel modes and synthesized into a model of carbon and energy balance, economic performance, and greenhouse gas mitigation. Our results confirm that the best-performing systems reduce diesel fuel use by up to 83%, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and recouping the initial system capital investment within one year. However, we observe a significant performance disparity across the systems observed leading to a wide range of economic outcomes. We also highlight related critical sustainability challenges around the management of byproducts that should be addressed before more widespread implementation of the technology.

Abstract: A novel bidirectional mechanism and a backward forecasting model based on extreme learning machine (ELM) are proposed to address the issue of ultra-short term wind power time series forecasting. The backward forecasting model consists of a backward ELM network and an optimization algorithm. The reverse time series is generated to train backward ELM, assuming that the value to be forecasted is already known whereas one of the previous measurements is treated as unknown. In the framework of bidirectional mechanism, the forward forecast of a standard ELM network is incorporated as the initial value of optimization algorithm, by which error between the backward ELM output and the previous measurement is minimized for backward forecasting. Then the difference between forward and backward forecasting results is used as a criterion to develop the methods to correct forward forecast. If the difference exceeds a predefined threshold, the final forecast equals to the average of forward forecast and latest measurement. Otherwise the forward forecast keeps as the final forecast. The proposed models are applied to forecast wind farm production in six time horizons: 1-6 h. A comprehensive error analysis is carried out to compare the performance with other approaches. Results show that forecast improvement is observed based on the proposed bidirectional model. Some further considerations on improving wind power short term forecasting accuracy by use of bidirectional mechanistn are discussed as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative and holistic approach to the analysis of the impact of selected design parameters of a new solar community on its environmental performance, in terms of energy efficiency and carbon footprint (green-house gas (GHG) emissions). The design parameters include energy performance level of buildings, density, type of the neighborhood (mixed-use vs residential), location of the commercial center relative to residential areas and the design of the streets. Energy performance is measured as the balance between overall energy consumption for building operations (assuming an all electric neighborhood) and electricity generation potential through integration of PV panels on available roof surfaces. Greenhouse gas emissions are those associated with building operations and transport.
Results of simulations carried out on prototype neighborhoods located in the vicinity of Calgary, Alberta, Canada indicate that, while adopting high-energy efficiency measures can reduce the buildings' impact by up to 75% in terms of energy consumption and GHG emissions, transport still has a large environmental impact. The parameters of highest impact on transport and its associated GHG emissions are the design of the neighborhood and the distance to the business center. Density, as isolated parameter, has a modest effect on the selected mode of transportation, in terms of using private or public transportation.
While this study relates to a specific location and a range of design assumptions, the methodology employed can serve as a template for evaluating design alternatives of new sustainable developments and their environmental impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of offshore wind power is becoming increasingly important towards a sustainable growth worldwide. In Italy, as well as in other countries where wind energy is provided only by onshore plants, the interest in the deployment of offshore wind resources is rapidly growing, despite relatively modest average wind speeds, compared to typical wind conditions in the North Sea. Research efforts have, so far, addressed the exploration of the most promising locations, based on wind characteristics; however, more extended evidence of technical and economic feasibility is now needed to raise awareness in the decision makers and secure to this source of renewable energy a proper role in the future energy policies. Within such a context, the paper presents the first feasibility study for the development of an offshore wind farm off the coast of Rimini, in the Northern Adriatic Sea. The study is based on an anemometric campaign started at the site in 2008 to provide a statistical assessment of the wind characteristics and the related wind energy potential, and on a 10-year wave measurement record next to the area, together with a thorough analysis of the site geological and environmental characteristics. Environmental data are interpreted with a proper consideration of the extreme events distribution and relevant results are used to select the most appropriate commercially available wind turbine and to design the site-specific support structure. A comprehensive evaluation of the investment costs and revenues is then carried out with reference to two wind farm layouts (a first smaller, constituted of 15 elements, and another one, featuring up to 60 elements) and in relation to two different scenarios, conservative and comparatively more realistic. Results of the study clearly show that the Northern Adriatic Sea is potentially suitable for the development of a large wind farm and should encourage investments on more advanced experimental campaigns and related studies in order to prove the feasibility of innovative technological solutions that would substantially increase the profitability of such installation.

Abstract: Smart grid is a platform that enables the participants of electricity market to adjust their bidding strategies based on Demand-Side Management (DSM) models. Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand. Moreover, the interactive effects of demand-side management programs on load factor (load curve) and price signal are investigated by numerical indices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There is no lack of studies on "net zero energy buildings" ("nZEB"). However, the vast majority of these studies focus on theories and simulation. The actual operational performance of "net zero energy building" during occupation has been largely overlooked by previous studies. This study aims to investigate the operational performance of net "zero energy buildings" via the case study of an office building in Tianjin, China. Using simulation, the energy consumption of the building at design phase was estimated and a solar photovoltaic (PV) system was selected. A whole year operation of the occupied building showed that energy consumption of the case building was much higher than the energy generated from the solar PV system. This was mainly due to three issues. Firstly, the equipment was different in terms of category, quantity and running time between operation and design stages, leading to considerable underestimate of energy consumption at the design stage. Secondly, the operational strategies need to be further improved in order to regulate users' behaviors. Thirdly, the efficiency of solar PV system was substantially reduced due to poor atmospheric environment (i.e. haze weather). Therefore, during the design process of "net zero energy buildings", it is imperative to ensure that the energy simulation accurately reflects how the building will actually operate once occupied. The research also revealed other barriers to the design and implementation of "nZEB" in China, such as extra efforts required for effective communicating the capacity of the HVAC design and systems to clients, and the increased cost of "nZEB" (e.g. solar PV system) particularly for public buildings. Finally, the solar radiation intensity of standard year adopted in the simulation needs to be replaced by the most recent meteorological data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hybrid energy systems (HES) have been proposed to be an important element to enable increasing penetration of clean energy. This paper proposes a methodology for operations optimization to maximize their economic value based on predicted renewable generation and market information. A multi environment computational platform for performing such operations optimization is also developed. To compensate for prediction error, a control strategy is accordingly designed to operate a standby energy storage element (ESE) to avoid energy imbalance within HES. The proposed operations optimizer allows systematic control of energy conversion for maximal economic value. Simulation results of two specific HES configurations illustrate the proposed methodology and computational capability. Economic advantages of such operations optimizer and associated flexible operations are demonstrated by comparing the economic performance of flexible operations with that of constant operations. Sensitivity analysis with respect to market variability and prediction error are also performed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: With large-scale commercialization of wind technology, one must investigate economical and sustainable wind resource utilization. In this paper, emergy analysis is used to quantify the environmental pressure, renewability, economic efficiency, and sustainability of a typical wind power system, considering the lifetime stages from extraction and processing of raw materials and resources to the final product (electricity) via material transportation, construction and operation. Possible pathways to achieve sustainable management of wind energy supply chain were also analyzed based on scenario analysis. Results show that wind power is a promising means of substituting traditional fossil fuel-based power generation systems, with the lowest transformity of 4.49 x 10(4) sej/J, smaller environmental loading ratio of 5.84, and lower greenhouse gas emission intensity of 0.56 kg/kWh. To shed light on potential pathways to achieve sustainable and low-carbon wind energy supply chain management and make informed choices, a sensitivity analysis was done by establishing scenarios from the perspectives of material recycling and technical development. Results suggest that using new materials of lower energy intensity or recycled materials in upstream wind turbine manufacturing and construction materials are the most effective measures.

Abstract: The European Commission has been actively involved in the development of the World-wide harmonized Light duty Test Cycle (WLTC) and corresponding Test Procedure (WLTP), and is currently working to introduce them in the European type approval (TA) procedure. The present study analyzes and estimates the effects of the introduction of WLTP on the average CO2 emissions and average vehicle energy demands (VEDs) from different segments of the European vehicle market. Twenty gasoline and eleven diesel vehicles were tested on the current European TA procedure NEDC, and on the evolving WLTP. These WLTP tests were then used as base line to estimate for each vehicle a WLTP best case and a WLTP worst case scenario, in line with the finalized version of the WLTP. In the WLTP worst case scenario (WLTP-H) results showed CO2 emissions and energy demands to be on average 11% and 44% higher than NEDC, respectively. Best case scenario (WLTP-L) has on average I% higher CO2 emissions and 26% higher energy requirements than the NEDC. These values should be considered on top of the 8% average difference between the JRC NEDC test results and the official type approval values. The higher vehicle inertia and road loads (RLs) along with the higher vehicle speeds, are the key parameters of the new procedure that contribute to the increased CO2 emissions and vehicle energy demand (VED). Results from the present study show that moving from NEDC to WLTP have a stronger impact on diesel than on gasoline vehicles. The highest effect of WLTP introduction is measured for vehicles that comply with EURO 6 emission standard (14% increase in CO2 emissions from NEDC to the simulated worst case WLTP), with also the largest difference between JRC measured NEDC tests and declared type approval values (11% difference).

Abstract: The development of an environmentally sustainable and financially viable replacement for fossil fuels continues to elude industry investors even though the benefits of replacing them is undisputed. Biofuels are among the promising replacements for fossil fuels. However, the development and production process for bio-based fuels creates uncertainty for industry investors. In order to increase process profitability, financial tools can be implemented with current technology. This paper proposes the use of forward contracts to mitigate risk, and it also considers the impact of carbon tax constraints and price uncertainty. Specifically, a stochastic optimization approach is implemented to develop strategies, which increases the net present value (NPV) of a production facility through determination of an optimal production schedule, as well as the creation of a portfolio of forward contracts to reduce product price risk. Results of numerical case studies show that if the policymaker is risk averse, production is higher in the early planning period rather than the later period. This paper also investigates the ability to maintain inventory in order to create additional financial benefit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Brown seaweeds are a suitable substrate for biogas production through anaerobic digestion (AD). Since the carbohydrates' content is subjected to a seasonal variation, this research aimed to select the best harveking period of beach cast brown seaweed Laminaria sp. for methane production, while optimising the use of a beating pretreatment and the organic substrate concentration. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to estimate the effect of the beating pretreatment in terms of pretreatment time (5-10-15 min) and organic matter concentration in terms of volatile solids (VS) (1-2.5-4%) on methane production. The highest methane yield of 342 +/- 17 ml g(-1) VS was observed during November at 1% of VS and after 5 min of pretreatment, while the lowest yields were registered in March with an average of 163 28 ml g-1 VS. However, an enhancement of 47% with respect to the untreated sample was achieved at 2.5% of VS and after 15 min of pretreatment, in March. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to address the trading strategies of a proactive distribution company (PDISCO) engaged in the transmission-level (TL) markets. A one-leader multi-follower bilevel model is presented to formulate the gaming framework between the PDISCO and markets. The lower-level (LL) problems include the TL day-ahead market and scenario-based real-time markets, respectively with the objectives of maximizing social welfare and minimizing operation cost. The upper-level (UL) problem is to maximize the PDISCO's profit across these markets. The PDISCO's strategic offers/bids interactively influence the outcomes of each market. Since the LL problems are linear and convex, while the UL problem is non-linear and non-convex, an equivalent primal-dual approach is used to reformulate this bilevel model to a solvable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A refined char gasification model, successfully validated in a pilot-scale 20 kW down-fired furnace, is now applied to a numerical investigation of the characteristics of the flow, temperature, and species distribution under various air-staged levels of combustion in a 600 MWe tangentially fired (T-fired) pulverized coal (PC) boiler. The simulation results with char gasification show that the CO concentration profile in both the primary combustion zone and the reduction zone is much higher than the corresponding case without the gasification model for deep (burnout air rate, f(S) = 0.42), middle (f(s) = 030), and shallow (f(s) = 0.17) air-staged cases. Moreover, this result is in accordance with the tests from an industrial pulverized-coal-fired furnace. It can be concluded that the char gasification mechanism should be considered in the numerical simulation of large-scale air-staged T-fired PC boilers. On the basis of a reasonable prediction of combustion characteristics, the gas temperature deviation in the crossover pass was also depicted under conditions of various air-staged levels. The result of the thermal load curve of the final super-heater panels clearly presents a saddle-type distribution for the existing two peak values. These inherent deviations originate from the residual swirling flow at the furnace exit. More specifically, parameters of swirling momentum intensity (delta) in the furnace and heat flow intensity (psi) at the entry of the final super-heater were employed to identify the temperature deviation in degrees.

Abstract: In this work, a novel dynamic modeling and validation of a dead-end cascade H-2/O-2 polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack are presented. The PEM fuel cell stack is subdivided into two stages in order to minimize the quantity of exhaust gases during operation. The dead-end condition was applied for both cathode and anode of a PEM fuel cell. Periodical purging is utilized to remove accumulated water of both cathode and anode sides of PEM fuel cell stack. The mathematical model includes submodels for the PEM fuel cell stack, humidifier and water separator. The two main modules of the model are fluid dynamic model (hydrogen, oxygen, liquid water and vapor) and electrochemical static model. For the model calibration and validation, different stack currents, inlet reactant gases pressures and purge intervals are studied. The results reveal good match between model simulation and experimental data with sufficient certainty. The model can be further employed for control and diagnostic purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: With increasing levels of integration of intermittent renewable energy in the power grid, it has become essential for power system planners to quantify future requirements of power systems in terms of flexibility. It is also equally important to evaluate whether the flexibility available in a given power system is adequate to meet more frequent and larger variations in the net load. In this paper, we present a novel framework to develop a composite metric that provides an accurate assessment of flexibility within conventional generators of a power system. This assessment is performed using eight technical characteristics of generating units as indicators. An Analytic Hierarchy Process is applied to assign weights to these indicators in order to reflect their relative importance in the supply of flexibility. Following normalization with min-max method, the indicators are linearly aggregated to give the composite flexibility index for each generator. The proposed methodology is tested on an adapted IEEE RTS-96 system. Our results demonstrate the consistency of the composite flexibility metric. It is further observed that the proposed metric is adaptive since it automatically adjusts to the addition and/or removal of generating units. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed framework, we also performed sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in the presence of alternative methodological choices in the composite metric construction process.

Abstract: Modeling of wind turbine power curve is greatly important in performance monitoring of the turbine and also in forecasting the wind power generation. In this paper, an accurate parametric model called modified hyperbolic tangent (MHTan) is proposed to characterize power curve of the wind turbine. The paper also presents the development of both parametric and nonparametric models of wind turbine power curve. In addition, least square error (LSE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are employed to estimate vector parameter of the proposed model. Here, three evolutionary algorithms, namely, particle swarm optimization, Cuckoo search, and backtracking search algorithm aid LSE and MLE. The performance of all presented methods is evaluated by a real data collected from a wind farm in Iran as well as three statistically generated data sets. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model compared to some other existing parametric and nonparametric models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hydrogen (H-2) is well-known effective, ecologically clean and renewable fuel. Bacterial H-2 production is a promising one and its use in industrial level is expected to increase in the nearest future to establish sustainable and renewable energy source. Escherichia coil wild type BW25113 growth yield was shown to be stimulated 1.3-1.5-fold by nickel (Ni2+), iron (Fe2+, Fe3+) ions and by some metal ion mixtures: Ni2+ + Fe2+ + molybdenum (Mo6+), Ni2+ + Fe3+, Ni2+ + Fe2+ and Mo6+ + Fe3+ in low concentrations (<0.05 mM) stimulated the growth during glycerol (10 g L-1) fermentation up to stationary phase at pH 6.5; Ni2+ + Fe2+ mixture showed the maximal effect. However, the same concentrations of these metals and their mixtures had no effects or slightly inhibited bacterial specific growth rate: it was suppressed similar to 1.2-fold upon Ni2+, Fe3+, Mo6+ and Ni2+ + Mo6+ mixture supplementation. H-2 production by E. coli from glycerol was observed with the yield of 0.75 +/- 0.02 mmol L-1. Moreover, H-2 yield was markedly stimulated 1.7-3-fold in the presence of Ni2+ + Fe3+, Ni2+ + Fe3+ + Mo6+ and Fe3+ + Mo6+ mixtures, but not sole metals: maximal stimulation was established by Fe3+ + Mo6+ mixture with the concentrations of 0.05 mM and 0.02 mM, respectively. While copper (Cu+, Cu2+) ions in low concentration (0.1 mM) had H-2 production suppressing effect. The results point out that some heavy metal ions and their mixtures can stimulate E. coil growth, as well as enhance bio-hydrogen production. Discrimination between Fe2+ and Fe3+ was important for H-2 production. Some interaction of Ni2+ with Fe2+ was suggested to be effective factor increasing bacterial biomass and determining activity of H-2 producing hydrogenases together with Fe3+. Mo6+ was significant for H-2 production. The results obtained were important to develop H-2 production biotechnology using glycerol as cheap substrate and optimizing the technological conditions by some heavy metals and their mixtures at low concentrations.

Abstract: The penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, for instances wind power, in the power system of isolated islands is limited, even when there is large potential. The wind power that cannot be directly injected in the power grid is usually curtailed. In addition, some islands need to desalinate seawater to produce fresh water, increasing the pressure on the power system, because desalination needs electricity. Nevertheless, the water scarcity problem of an island can be part of the solution of the problem of its integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. To tackle this issue, a system was proposed to use the excess wind power in desalination units and in a pumped hydro storage, resulting in an integrated power and water supply system that would minimize the wind power curtailed. This paper proposes a methodology to optimize the size and operational strategy of this wind powered desalination and pumped hydro storage system. The objective is to minimize the total annualized production costs, maximize the percentage of renewable energy sources in the total power production and minimize the wind power curtailed. To solve this optimization problem, a derivative free multiobjective optimization method (Direct MultiSearch) is used. This methodology is applied to the integrated power and water supply system proposed for the island of S. Vicente, in Cape Verde. The results show that the penetration of renewable energy sources can reach 84% with a 27% decrease of power and water production costs and 67% decrease of CO2 emissions, in relation to the values foreseen for 2020.

Abstract: A low-temperature electro-thermal coupled model, which is based on the electrochemical mechanism, is developed to accurately capture both electrical and thermal behaviors of batteries. Activation energies reveal that temperature dependence of resistances is greater than that of capacitances low-temperature electro-thermal coupled model, which is based on the electrochemical mechanism, is developed to accurately capture both electrical and thermal behaviors of batteries. Activation energies reveal that temperature dependence of resistances is greater than that of capacitances. The influence of frequency on polarization voltage and irreversible heat is discussed, and frequency dependence of polarization resistance and capacitance is obtained. Based on the frequency-dependent equation, a reduced low-temperature electro-thermal coupled model is proposed and experimentally validated under different temperature, frequency and amplitude conditions. Simulation results exhibit good agreement with experimental data, where the maximum relative voltage error and temperature error are below 2.65% and 1.79 degrees C, respectively. The reduced model is demonstrated to have almost the same accuracy as the original model and require a lower computational effort. The effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methodology for model reduction is verified using batteries with three different cathode materials from different manufacturers. The reduced model, thanks to its high accuracy and simplicity, provides a promising candidate for development of rapid internal heating and optimal charging strategies at low temperature, and for evaluation of the state of battery health in on-board battery management system.

Abstract: It is conventionally believed that there are no self-sustained thermoacoustit oscillations in the absence of acoustic modes in combustors. However, such oscillations (also known as intrinsic thermoacoustic instability) are recently found to occur in a premixed combustor with a mean flow present but no acoustic eigenmodes involved. Practical combustors are associated with entropy waves, pressure jump and mean flow, which are ignored in previous studies without justification. In this work, an entropy involved energy measure is defined and used to study the stability behaviors of intrinsic thermoacoustic modes. The concepts and methods are exemplified with the classical time-delay n-tau unsteady heat release model. The intrinsic thermoacoustic eigenmodes are found to be related to not only a flame transfer/describing function but also the acoustic impedance at the flame, which is boundary-dependent. It is shown that the predicted frequency omega(r)(f) of the intrinsic modes and the critical gain n(c) depend on the ratio (T) over bar (2)/(T) over bar (1) between the after- and before-combustion temperatures and the inlet mean flow Mach number (M) over bar1. Comparison is then made between the present results and those available in literature. Good agreement is obtained for omega(r)(f). Furthermore, the predicted stability of intrinsic modes based on calculated tie is found to agree well with direct numerical simulations (DNS). It is also interesting to show that as (T) over bar (2)/(T) over bar (1) -> 1, the critical gain as predicted from the previous models is n(c) -> +infinity, which means that all intrinsic eigenmodes are stable. However, the present works shows that n(c) -> 1.0. Further illustration is then performed by conducting case studies of measured flame transfer and describing functions in premixed combustors. The present work opens up an alternative but more applicable way to study intrinsic thermoacoustic oscillations via the entropy-involved energy measure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work studies the aging processes of commercial LiCoO2/mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) cells which are cycled at 25 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 45 degrees C respectively at the 0.6 C charge/discharge rate and 30% depth of discharge. The capacity degradation of the cells is fast at elevated temperature, and the cycle life tested at 45 degrees C is about a quarter of the cycling time at 25 degrees C. The fresh and the aged cells are disassembled to characterize the morphology and the composition of electrode surface, as well as the bulk structure and the electrochemical performance of single electrode. It is found that the formation of SEI film and the polarization of the full cell lead to state of charge (SOC) shift in the cathode. The cathode SOC shift and the decay in the reversible capacity of LiCoO2 cathode dominate the aging of the full cell. The former is the prevailing aging factor at 25 degrees C, while the latter factor becomes the leading cause of cell aging at 45 degrees C. The unstable and thick SEI film on the cathode under elevated temperature influences the lithium ion diffusion, resulting in the increased polarization and the decreased intrinsic performance of LiCoO2 cathode. The proper range of test temperature ensuring no changes in aging mechanism and the, decay rate of capacity caused by each aging factor are proposed by analyzing the performance of the full cells and the electrodes. After comparing the test results, it is concluded that the aging process at 45 C is not the same as that at room temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Active building envelope is an evolved and enhanced version of traditional envelope which received extensive attention. This paper presented a novel and promising active building integrated photovoltaic thermoelectric (BIPVTE) wall system that can use the electric power converted from solar energy by PV cells directly serves for the operation of thermoelectric radiant panel. This active system is highly self adaptive to ambient thermal environment and can reduce heat gain by considerable scale. A dynamic state systematic model was established and validated through experiment data. Three analytic sub models related to the electric and thermal model of PV panel, heat transfer in air duct and model of thermoelectric radiant panel were coupled to describe the thermal behavior of BIPVTE wall system. The electric model of PV panel was solved by Lambert W function to deliver an explicit expression; the thermal model equations of PV panel, air duct and insulation board were solved in a matrix form by adopting state-space method; the analytic model of thermoelectric radiant panel was derived from previous study. After model validation, the traditional wall was taken as the reference to evaluate thermal performance of BIPVTE wall system. The simulation results showed that when indoor air temperature is 24 degrees C, the thickness and thermal conductivity of insulation is 0.04 m and 0.05 W/m K, BIPVTE wall can reduce about 70% daily heat gain compared with traditional wall in typical day simulation.

Abstract: Methanol is a feasible and promising alternative fuel for passenger cars, particularly in China. However, methanol-fueled vehicles struggle with stronger low-temperature operating instability and increased chance of misfire. In prior publications, the impacts of engine misfire on the regulated and unregulated emissions from methanol-fueled vehicles have been merely discussed. In this paper, regulated emissions, unburned methanol, carbonyl and VOC emissions from a China-5 (equivalent to Euro-5b+IUPR) certificated methanol-fueled car were measured over new European driving cycle (NEDC). By using a SAE J2901-compatible generator, two misfire rates (6% and 9%) were employed to mimic ordinary and severe engine malfunction statuses. Emission results were also put into comparison with the current Euro-5 and the upcoming Euro-6c OBD threshold limits, and used to estimate Carter MIR-based ozone forming potential. The results demonstrated that, both CO and THC emissions increased with misfire rate while NOx emission persistently decreased with intensified engine misfire. Even with a misfire rate up to 9%, all the regulated emissions were significantly lower than their thresholds regulated in Euro-5 and Euro-6c, which meant the current OBD requirements were too tolerant for methanol vehicles. It is proposed that, countries regarding methanol as a future option, shall promulgate methanol-specific emission standards in advance. Unburned methanol emission increased by at least 1.6 and 5.7 times when misfire rates of 6% and 9% were used. Both carbonyl and VOC emissions increased corresponding to higher misfire rates. Formaldehyde and toluene were found the key pollutants of carbonyls and VOCs. An increase in anticipated ozone forming potential (OFP) together with a decrease in specific reactivity (SR) was also noticed with the rising of misfire rate. Among all the pollutants, CO, toluene, xylene and formaldehyde were the chief species contributing to secondary ozone formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The present study has focused on the refinement of a previously developed tool for the optimization of the layout of hybrid electric vehicles and on its application to a newly proposed non-plug in parallel hybrid vehicle, which has been equipped with a planetary gear set and a single-speed gearbox positioned between a compression ignition engine and a permanent magnet electric machine. This vehicle is capable of torque-coupling and speed-coupling between the engine and the electric machine, and for this reason has been referred to as a "dual-mode vehicle".
The tool performs a bi-level (nested) coupling of design and control strategy optimization, and is able to identify the optimal design of each hybrid vehicle by minimizing the powertrain costs over a 10-year time span. The vehicle design determines the size of battery, engine and electric machine, as well as the values of the speed ratio of each power coupling device. Different powertrain cost definitions, which account for the production costs of the components and the operating costs related to fuel consumption and battery depletion over the lifetime of the vehicle, have been proposed. The latter cost contribution depends directly on the control strategy adopted to manage the power flow between the electric machine and the engine, as well as on the selection of the transmission gear. The optimal control strategy has been identified using a specifically developed fast running dynamic programming-based optimizer, which minimizes an objective function over a given training driving mission.
The performance of the dual-mode vehicle with the optimal layout has been investigated in detail over several, driving missions and compared with that of more traditional hybrid vehicles equipped with either a speed coupling device or with a torque coupling device, as well as with a conventional reference vehicle.
Moreover, several sensitivity analyses have been carried out in order to investigate the impact of the cost definition, of the objective function and of the training driving mission on the powertrain design and on its performance (fuel economy, pollutant emissions, battery management).
Finally, different market scenarios have been explored, in terms of fuel price, battery life and battery cost, and their effects on the identification of the optimal design, as well as on the performance of the resulting vehicles, have been analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The spatial system dynamics model (SSDM) of sugarcane industrial ecosystem presented in this paper is towards an integrated approach to simulate a bio refinery system suggesting directions for bagasse and trash-derived electricity generation. The model unpacks the complexity in bio-derived energy generation across the conversion pathways of the system from land use change, sugarcane production, and harvesting and electricity production amid a plethora of challenges in the system. Input data for land use and sugarcane production in the model were derived from remote sensing and spatial analysis. Simulated and validated results indicate that the alternative scenario of combined bagasse and trash with enhanced mechanisation and technology efficiency provides the highest efficiency in terms of electricity generation and emission avoidance compared to the business as usual or base case scenario. The applied SSDM demonstrates that modeling of feedback-based complex dynamic processes in time and space provide better insights crucial for decision making. This model provides a foundation for the broader study for cost benefit analysis of electricity production from a sugarcane industrial ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Understanding real-world driving conditions in the form of driving cycles is instrumental in the design of efficient powertrains and energy storage systems for electric vehicles. In addition, driving cycles serve as a standardised measurement procedure for the certification of a vehicle's fuel economy and driving range. They also facilitate the evaluation of the economic and lifecycle costs of emerging vehicular technologies. However, discrepancies between existing driving cycles and real-world driving conditions exist due to a number of factors such as insufficient data, inadequate driving cycle development methodologies and methods to assess the representativeness of developed driving cycles. The novel aspect of the work presented here is the use of real-world data from electric vehicles, over a six month period, to derive a driving cycle appropriate for their assessment. A stochastic and statistical methodology is used to develop and assess the representativeness of the driving cycle against a separate set of real world electric vehicle driving data and the developed cycle performs well in that comparison. Although direct comparisons with internal combustion engine driving cycles are not that informative or relevant due to the marked differences between how they and electric vehicles operate, some discussion around how the developed electric vehicle cycle relates to them is also included.

Abstract: Renovation of existing buildings is important in the work toward increased energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. The present paper treats energy renovation measures for a Swedish district heated multi-family house, evaluated through dynamic simulation. Insulation of roof and facade, better insulating windows and flow-reducing water taps, in combination with different HVAC systems for recovery of heat from exhaust air, were assessed in terms of life cycle cost, discounted payback period, primary energy consumption, CO2 emissions and non-renewable energy consumption. The HVAC systems were based on the existing district heating substation and included mechanical ventilation with heat recovery and different configurations of exhaust air heat pump.
Compared to a renovation without energy saving measures, the combination of new windows, insulation, flow-reducing taps and an exhaust air a heat pump gave up to 24% lower life cycle cost. Adding insulation on roof and facade, the primary energy consumption was reduced by up to 58%, CO2 emissions up to 65% and non-renewable energy consumption up to 56%. Ventilation with heat recovery also reduced the environmental impact but was not economically profitable in the studied cases. With a margin perspective on electricity consumption, the environmental impact of installing heat pumps or air heat recovery in district heated houses is increased. Low-temperature heating improved the seasonal performance factor of the heat pump by up to 11% and reduced the environmental impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized scheduling algorithm for electric vehicles charging. The charging control model follows the architecture of a Multi-Agent System (MAS). The MAS consists of an Electric Vehicle (EV)/Distributed Generation (DG) aggregator agent and "Responsive" or "Unresponsive" EV agents. The EV/DG aggregator agent is responsible to maximize the aggregator's profit by designing the appropriate virtual pricing policy according to accurate power demand and generation forecasts. "Responsive" EV agents are the ones that respond rationally to the virtual pricing signals, whereas "Unresponsive" EV agents define their charging schedule regardless the virtual cost. The performance of the control model is experimentally demonstrated through different case studies at the micro-grid laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) using Real Time Digital Simulator. The results highlighted the adaptive behaviour of "Responsive" EV agents and proved their ability to charge preferentially from renewable energy sources. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract: A building integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPVT) multifunctional roofing panel has been developed in this study to harvest solar energy in the form of PV electricity as well as heat energy through the collection of warm water. As a key component of the multifunctional building envelope, an aluminum/high-density polyethylene (HDPE) functionally graded material (FGM) panel embedded with aluminum water tubes has been fabricated through the vibration-sedimentation approach. The FGM layer gradually transits material phases from well-conductive side (with aluminum dominated) to another highly insulated side (with HDPE). The heat in the PV cells can be easily transferred into the conductive side of the FGM and then collected by the water flow in the embedded tubes. Therefore, the operational temperature of the PV cells can be significantly lowered down, which recovers the PV efficiency in hot weather. In this way, the developed BIPVT panel is able to efficiently harvest solar energy in the form of both PV electricity and heat. The performance of a prototype BIPVT panel has been evaluated in terms of its thermal efficiency via warm water collection and PV efficiency via the output electricity. The laboratory test results demonstrate that significant energy conversion efficiency improvement can be achieved for both electricity generation and heat collection by the presented BIPVT roofing system. Overall, the performance indicates a very promising prospective of the new BIPVT multifunctional roofing panel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents computational and experimental studies of a vanadium microfluidic fuel cell using a novel configuration of multi-layer flow-through porous carbon paper electrodes. A priori modeling, and simulation revealed that these porous substrates operated with non-uniform reaction rate and the reaction rate distribution is highly sensitive to the flow rate condition. Comparable cell performance was witnessed for electrodes partly modified in the high reaction rate region and electrodes modified in all parts. Therefore, multi-layer stacking of single-layer electrodes was proposed and implemented to facilitate selection of appropriate materials to accommodate the requirements of the different layers of the electrodes. Here, the electrode materials studied were pristine carbon paper and electrochemically superior platinum coated carbon paper. The results stemmed from modeling and experiments consistently revealed that the highest peak power densities were obtained in the case with electrode modification in the high reaction rate region. This study highlights the significance of the multi-layer electrode configuration associated with the balance between performance and cost of this energy-system. Moreover, the multi-layer electrode configuration offers flexibility in terms of changing layer arrangement to cope with the operating condition leading to superior cell performance.

Abstract: A mathematical model used to obtain the optimum pressure drop per unit length (PDPUL) and the minimum annual cost (MAC) of a district heating (DH) piping network based on operating strategies was established. A case study based on a DH system in Hebei Province, China, was carried out. Four operating strategies were used respectively. Sensitivity analysis method was used to investigate the impact of pump overall efficiency, electricity price, heat price and interest rate on the optimum PDPUL and the MAC of the DH piping network. Results showed that the optimum PDPUL and the MAC of the DH piping network could be obtained by using the mathematical model. The MAC of the DH piping network for variable mass flow rate (VMFR) operating strategies was lower than that for constant mass flow rate (CMFR) operating strategies. Also, the decrease of the design supply temperature in the primary side caused the reduction of the optimum PDPUL. But the MAC increased with the decrease of the design supply temperature in the primary side. Among all the parameters, the pump overall efficiency had the greatest impact on the optimum PDPUL and the MAC of the DH piping network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A battery pack is produced by connecting the cells in series and/or in parallel to provide the necessary power for electric vehicles (EVs). Those parameters affecting cost and reliability of the EVs, including cycle life, capacity, durability and warranty are highly dependent on the thermal management system. In this work, computational fluid dynamic analysis is performed to investigate the air cooling system for a 38,120 cell battery pack. The battery pack contained 24 pieces of 38,120 cells, copper bus bars, intake and exhaust plenum and holding plates with venting holes. Heat generated by the cell during charging is measured using an accelerating rate calorimeter. Thermal performances of the battery pack were analyzed with various mass flow rates of cooling air using steady state simulation. The correlation between Nu number and Re number were deduced from the numerical modeling results and compared with literature. Additionally, an experimental testing of the battery pack at different charging rates is conducted to validate the correlation. This method provides a simple way to estimate thermal performance of the battery pack when the battery pack is large and full transient simulation is not viable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Biological lipids derived from oleaginous microorganisms are promising precursors for renewable biofuel productions. Direct lipid extraction from wet cell-biomass is favored because it eliminates the need for costly dehydration. However, the development of a practical and scalable process for extracting lipids from wet cell-biomass is far from ready to be commercialized, instead, requiring intensive research and development to understand the lipid accessibility, mechanisms in mass transfer and establish robust lipid extraction approaches that are practical for industrial applications. This paper aims to present a critical review on lipid recovery in the context of biofuel productions with special attention to cell disruption and lipid mass transfer to support extraction from wet biomass.

Abstract: In this paper, the problem of the optimal rating of transformers in smart grids is properly discussed with respect to the specific load characteristics. The design is based on the accurate prediction of the lifetime degradation of mineral-oil-immersed transformers subject to highly intermittent loads. In fact, by investigating the nature of the loads in the smart grid scenario, it clearly appears that the intermittent nature of the power demand increases drastically. In this context, specific tools for the characterization of the lifetime duration are required, since severe reduction of the transformer's life can be observed due to overloads, even in the case of short-duration overloads. The classical approaches based on using the equivalent thermal current to predict the transformer's lifetime might result in incorrect estimates, thus requiring, advanced models that can deal with the time variability of the load. In this paper, the randomness of the load powers is addressed in terms of stochastic processes. In particular, the Wiener process is demonstrated to provide robust modeling of load variability. By starting from this assumption, it was demonstrated analytically that the hot-spot temperature, which is a major contributor to the degradation of the transformer's lifetime, also is a stochastic process. Then, in spite of the nonlinearity of the thermal model, the hot-spot temperature can be represented as a Wiener process, the robustness of which has been verified adequately. By taking into account the nonlinear relationship between the hot-spot temperature and the lifetime, the authors verified that the transformer's lifetime is modeled as a lognormal, stochastic process. Hence, a novel, closed-form relationship was derived between the transformer's lifetime and the distributional properties of the stochastic load. The usefulness of the closed-form expression is discussed for sake of design, even if a few of the considerations also are performed with respect to operating conditions. The aim of the numerical application was to demonstrate the feasibility and, the easy applicability of the analytical methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Past decade has seen numerous data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based energy efficiency studies, which usually treat the production process as a "black box" and ignore the internal production information. This paper takes into account the joint inputs and sub joint inputs to reveal the specific information on how inputs are allocated to outputs. To this end, we first propose an extended output-specific production technology based on which two novel energy efficiency measures are developed. We also present an empirical study on 32 countries to demonstrate the novelty and the usefulness of our method. We find that our output-specific energy efficiency measures provide a more straightforward way of dealing with undesirable output and are better capable of identifying inefficient production behavior.

Abstract: The efficient and economical design and operation of individual small-scale distributed generation (DG) units has received considerable attention. It is now plausible to envision a future scenario where a large number of such units, spanning capacities from the kW to the MW scale, are deployed in a region. As distributed electricity generation using natural gas becomes more widespread, the dependency of the electric grid on the natural gas grid will increase. This concerns multiple interaction points along the two networks, and reaches beyond the natural gas demand of large-scale load following or baseload gas fired powerplants. More specifically, a better understanding is required of the potential changes in the dynamic behavior and interaction of the electricity and natural gas grids at or close to residential use sites (neighborhoods), where the small-scale DG infrastructure is likely to be located. In this paper, an optimization-based framework is developed for analyzing the operation of an ensemble of small-scale natural gas fueled DG units, and quantify their ability to flatten the electric grid load (i.e., reduce the peak demand) of the neighborhood that they serve. Our analysis relies on realistic energy use data and takes into account capacity limitations of the current natural gas distribution infrastructure, centralized vs. decentralized control of the DG unit operation, equipment durability considerations, heating preferences of home users, and seasonal effects. There is a substantial increase in natural gas consumption near consumers for all scenarios considered, which has implications for the control of the natural gas grid. We demonstrate the importance of having a centralized decision-making scheme when multiple distributed generation resources are present, and make recommendations for the optimal sizing of generators.

Abstract: High-alkali empty, fruit bunch (EFB), a biomass residue from the Thai palm oil industry, was burned in a fluidized-bed combustor using alumina sand, limestone, and dolomite as the bed material to prevent bed agglomeration. During the experiments, EFB was fired as pre-dried fuel at fixed (40 kg/h) fuel feeding, whilst excess air varied from about 20% to 80%. Temperature, O-2, CO, CxHy (as CH4), and NO were recorded along the combustor height and at stack, to investigate the combustion and emission performance of the reactor. Physical and chemical conditions of the bed materials and those of particulate matter emitted from the combustor were examined at different operating times using SEM-EDS and XRF techniques, and a particle size analyzer. To achieve high (98.4-99.1%) combustion efficiency of the combustor, meeting the national CO and NO emission limits, excess air of about 40% is required when burning pre-dried EFB in a fluidized bed of alumina sand, whereas 60% excess air is suitable with limestone and dolomite. By using the selected bed materials, bed agglomeration can be prevented, thus ensuring safe and high efficient combustion of this biomass for a relatively long time. However, the bed materials are subject to substantial time-domain changes in their physical and chemical properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Increasing the performance of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), especially the energy efficiency and power density, is critically important to reduce the system cost to a level for widespread commercialization. Unlike conventional VRFBs with flow-through structure, in this work we create a VRFB featuring a flow-field structure with a carbon nanoparticle-decorated graphite felt electrode for the battery. This novel structure, exhibiting a significantly reduced ohmic loss through reducing electrode thickness, an increased surface area and improved electrocatalytic activity by coating carbon nanoparticles, allows the energy efficiency up to 84.8% at a current density of as high as 100 mA cm(-2) and the peak power density to reach a value of 508 mW cm(-2). In addition, it is demonstrated that the battery with this proposed structure exhibits a substantially improved rate capability and capacity retention as opposed to conventional flow-through structured battery with thick graphite felt electrodes.

Abstract: Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fueled by methane with low steam content is desirable from the energy efficiency and power density point of view. Improved understanding about the low steam methane fuel operation is required for advancing the technology. A rigorous and comprehensive multiphysics model for methane fueled SOFCs is described for the first time. The model considers explicitly the detailed balance of local electrical potentials for methane fueled SOFCs to ensure mathematical rigor. A commonly overlooked but important difference between the Nernst potential and the open circuit voltage (OCV) is critically analyzed. Numerical simulations with this multiphysics model show that OCV for low-steam methane fuel is sensitive to the methane steam reforming (MSR) kinetics. The steam reaction order and activation energy of MSR with low-steam methane are then determined accurately by a systematic comparison of the theoretical and experimental OCVs. Moreover, several literature MSR models are shown to be invalid for low steam methane. The multiphysics model and the deduced MSR kinetics are capable of producing the experimental I-V relations without any additional parameter adjustment, demonstrating the predictive power of the theoretical method.

Abstract: This study examines the GHG emissions associated with producing bio-hydrocarbons via fast pyrolysis of Miscanthus. The feedstock is then upgraded to bio-oil products via hydroprocessing and zeolite cracking. Inventory data for this study were obtained from current commercial cultivation practices of Miscanthus in the UK and state-of-the-art process models developed in Aspen Plus. The system boundary considered spans from the cultivation of Miscanthus to conversion of the pyrolysis-derived bio-oil into biohydrocarbons up to the refinery gate. The Miscanthus cultivation subsystem considers three scenarios for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates. These were assumed as follows: (i) excluding (SOC), (ii) low SOC and (iii) high (SOC) for best and worst cases. Overall, Miscanthus cultivation contributed moderate to negative values to GHG emissions, from analysis of excluding SOC to high SOC scenarios. Furthermore, the rate of SOC in the Miscanthus cultivation subsystem has significant effects on total GHG emissions. Where SOC is excluded, the fast pyrolysis subsystem shows the highest positive contribution to GHG emissions, while the credit for exported electricity was the main 'negative' GHG emission contributor for both upgrading pathways. Comparison between the bio-hydrocarbons produced from the two upgrading routes and fossil fuels indicates GHG emission savings between 68% and 87%. Sensitivity analysis reveals that bio-hydrocarbon yield and nitrogen gas feed to the fast pyrolysis reactor are the main parameters that influence the total GHG emissions for both pathways.

Abstract: As electric vehicles (EVs) have been popularized, research on battery management systems (BMSs) in their core technology has drawn considerable attention. Among the various functions of a BMS, estimating the state-of-health (SOH) of the battery is crucial; this estimation is used to determine the replacement time of the battery or to assess driving mileage. While most studies utilize capacity fading or resistance growth as SOH metrics, they all define SOH using fairly constrained assumptions, e.g., full cycling with constant current. Unfortunately, those assumptions cannot be applied to EV batteries that are, for the most part, cycled partially and dynamically. In clear contrast, this paper studies how SOH can be estimated in more practical environments where the batteries must support real-world driving patterns. In particular, this paper proposes a data-driven approach to trace SOH on the fly by using sensible BMS data such as current, voltage, and temperature while leveraging their historical distributions. We validated that our approach provides highly accurate results under actual EV driving conditions, with an average error less than 2.18%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the probabilistic energy forecasting literature, emphasis is mainly placed on deriving marginal predictive densities for which each random variable is dealt with individually. Such marginals description is sufficient for power systems related operational problems if and only if optimal decisions are to be made for each lead-time and each location independently of each other. However, many of these operational processes are temporally and spatially coupled, while uncertainty in photovoltaic (PV) generation is strongly dependent in time and in space. This issue is addressed here by analysing and capturing spatio-temporal dependencies in PV generation. Multivariate predictive distributions are modelled and space-time trajectories describing the potential evolution of forecast errors through successive lead-times and locations are generated. Discrimination ability of the relevant scoring rules on performance assessment of space-time trajectories of PV generation is also studied. Finally, the advantage of taking into account space-time correlations over probabilistic and point forecasts is investigated. The empirical investigation is based on the solar PV dataset of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom) 2014. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Phase change material (PCM)-based heat sinks have the potential to provide reliable thermal management for electronic devices. However, the low thermal conductivity of PCMs hampers their use in large-volume or high-power devices. Embedding a PCM in a porous matrix is an efficient method for enhancing heat dissipation in a passive cooling application. In this study, the copper fibers with ample antler microstructures on their surface were first introduced into the phase change heat transfer enhancement technology. The enhanced heat transfer performance of a PCM embedded in a porous metal fiber sintered felt (PMFSF) was experimentally investigated. Paraffin/PMFSF composite PCM (MF-PCM) was prepared, and three types of heat sinks (filled with MF-PCM, filled with paraffin, and empty) were tested under four power levels. The effect of the porosity was also investigated. It was found that the addition of PMFSF enhanced heat transfer to the PCM, leading to lower heat source temperature. The improvement of heat transfer by MF-PCM is more evident under larger heat flux. Before melting is completed, lower heat source temperature and temperature gradient is achieved for the heat sink with low porosity, while longer duration of temperature control region is achieved in the case of the heat sink with the higher porosity. The time-averaged effective thermal resistance of the heat sink with paraffin is higher than that of the heat sinks with MF-PCM. All these results show the enormous potential of using PMFSF to replace metal foams, thus offering a new porous metal matrix to enhance the thermal conduction of PCMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: MicroGrids (MGs) are one of the most useful and efficient ways to integrate renewable energy technologies in rural areas. In these areas, the biogas produced by transformation of organic waste can be electrically valorized in a MG using a Hybrid Power System (HPS) based on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a Gas microTurbine (GT), in order to obtain a high electrical efficiency. In this study, in order to keep the best efficiency while ensuring a safe operation, the HPS is controlled using a single Three-Level Neutral Point Clamped (3LNPC) inverter. After sizing the hybrid system, digital robust R-S-T type controllers are designed to regulate the SOFC power in the DC side of the inverter and the voltage and frequency in the AC side, in an islanded MG. Then, the feasibility and the performance of the 3LNPC inverter together with the associated controllers are evaluated in simulation and experimentally using a SOFC/GT emulator.

Abstract: This paper deals with the in-cylinder flow field analysis in a two-stroke engine under motoring conditions by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The main objective is to analyze the effect of engine parameters viz., engine speed, compression ratio (CR) and port orientation on the in-cylinder flows in a loop-scavenged two-stroke gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine, with an aim to help researchers to design fuel efficient and less polluting two-stroke engines. In this study, a single-cylinder 70 cm(3) two-stroke engine which is very commonly used for the two-wheeler application, is considered. The engine cylinder is modified to provide optical access into the in-cylinder region. The PIV experiments are conducted at various engine speeds viz., 500, 1000 and 1500 rev/min, and the plane averaged velocity vector fields obtained, are analyzed to understand the in-cylinder flow behavior. The CFD study is also carried out using the commercial CFD code, STARCD, to study and compare the in cylinder flow parameters at various engine operating conditions. The CFD results are compared with the experimental results to the extent possible. The CFD predictions are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, the CFD analysis has been extended further to understand the effect of various engine parameters on the in-cylinder flows. We found that the turbulent kinetic energy and tumble ratio increased by about 25% and 20% respectively, when the engine speed was increased from 1000 to 1500 rev/min. Also, we found that the turbulent kinetic energy and tumble ratio decreased by about 13% and 26% when the compression ratio was increased from 7 to 8. In addition, we found that the port orientation, rather than port areas had a greater influence on the in-cylinder flow parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the CO2 capture energy consumption via elevated-temperature pressure swing adsorption (ET-PSA) for CO2/H-2 separation. IGCC power plants with ET-PSA, with the conventional Selexol process and without CO2 capture are built in Aspen Plus. The CO2 capture energy consumption of ET-PSA is evaluated by the specific primary energy consumption for CO2 avoided (SPECCA), which is a function of the net electrical efficiency and the specific CO2 emission rate. The ET-PSA unit with different processes simulated in gPROMS is coupled into the IGCC model, the operation parameters of which are analyzed to achieve the lowest SPECCA. The results show that the CO2 capture energy consumption has a tendency to decrease by increasing the adsorption time, the residence time, and the purge-to-feed ratio; reducing the purge ratio; and adding the CO2 reflux. The SPECCA of ET-PSA with the 5-3-1 process is 2.79 MJ/kg(CO2) with a 90.5% CO2 capture ratio, which is 11.71% lower than that of the Selexol process. An effective way to further reduce the SPECCA of ET-PSA is to add rinse and purge steps, whose energy loss mainly comes from the consumption of high-temperature steam. The calculated SPECCA of ET-PSA with rinse and purge steps is 2.32-2.52 MJ/kg(CO2), which is 20.3-26.6% lower than that of the Selexol process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The steady-state coordinated operation of electricity networks and natural gas networks to maximize profits is investigated under market paradigm considering demand response. The components in its gas supply networks are modeled and linearized under steady-state operating conditions where combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) generators consume natural gas and offer to the electricity market. Interruptible-load based and coupon-based demand response virtual power plants are considered trading in the market like physical generators. A bi-level programming optimization model is formulated with its upper-level representing the coordinated operation to maximize profits and its lower-level simulating the day-ahead market clearing process. This bi-level problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, and is linearized as a mixed-integer programming problem. Case studies on a 6-bus power system with a 7-node natural gas system and an IEEE 118-bus power system with a 14-node gas system verify the effectiveness of the coordinated operation model. The impacts of demand response based virtual power plants on the interactions between the two networks are also analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In an electricity pool with significant share of wind power, all generators including conventional and wind power units are generally scheduled in a day-ahead market based on wind power forecasts. Then, a real-time market is cleared given the updated wind power forecast and fixed day-ahead decisions to adjust power imbalances. This sequential market-clearing process may cope with serious operational challenges such as severe power shortage in real-time due to erroneous wind power forecasts in day ahead market. To overcome such situations, several solutions can be considered such as adding flexible resources to the system. In this paper, we address another potential solution based on information sharing in which market players share their own wind power forecasts with others in day-ahead market. This solution may improve the functioning of sequential market-clearing process through making more informed day-ahead schedules, which reduces the need for balancing resources in real-time operation. This paper numerically evaluates the potential value of sharing forecasts for the whole system in terms of system cost reduction. Besides, its impact on each market player's profit is analyzed. The framework of this study is based on a stochastic two-stage market setup and complementarity modeling, which allows us to gain further insights into information sharing impacts.

Abstract: Downshift during regenerative braking helps to improve the energy efficiency of electric vehicles. Two main problems are involved in the downshift process. One is the determination of optimal downshift point, and the other is the cooperative control of regenerative braking and hydraulic braking. In order to achieve a systemic solution to these problems, a hierarchical control strategy is brought forward for an electric vehicle with a two-speed automated mechanical transmission. For the upper controller, an off-line calculation and on-line look-up table method is adopted to obtain the optimal downshift point, and a series regenerative braking distribution strategy is designed. For the medium controller, a nonlinear sliding mode observer is designed to obtain the actual hydraulic brake torque. For the lower controller, cooperative control of regenerative braking and hydraulic braking is given to ensure brake safety during downshift process, and a resembling pulse width modulation method is proposed to regulated the hydraulic brake torque. Simulation results and hardware-in-loop test show that the proposed algorithm is effective in improving the energy efficiency of electric vehicles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Optimal steady-state dispatch of a stand-alone hybrid power system determines a fuel-minimizing distribution strategy while meeting a forecasted demand over six months to a year. Corresponding optimization models that integrate hybrid technologies such as batteries, diesel generators, and photovoltaics with system interoperability requirements are often large, nonconvex, nonlinear, mixed integer programming problems that are difficult to solve even using the most state-of-the-art algorithms. The rate-capacity effect of a battery causes capacity to vary nonlinearly with discharge current; omitting this effect simplifies the model, but leads to over-estimation of discharge capabilities. We present a physics-based set of integer-linear constraints to model batteries in a hybrid system for a steady-state dispatch optimization problem that minimizes fuel use. Starting with a nonlinear set of constraints, we empirically derive linearizations and then compare them to a commonly used set of constraints that assumes a constant voltage and neglects rate-capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that assuming a fixed voltage and capacity may lead to over-estimating discharge quantities by up to 16% compared to our overestimations of less than 1%.

Abstract: CO2-based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) is a promising technology for the waste heat recovery of an engine considering its safety and environment friendly characteristics, which also matchs the high temperature of the exhaust gas and satisfies the miniaturization demand of recovery systems. But the traditional CTRC system with a basic configuration (B-CTRC) has a poor thermodynamic performance. This paper introduces an improved CTRC system containing both a preheater and regenerator (PR-CTRC), for recovering waste heat in exhaust gas and engine coolant of an engine, and compares its performance with that of the B-CTRC system and also with that of the traditional excellent Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems using R123 as a working fluid. The utilization rate of waste heat, total cooling load, net power output, thermal efficiency, exergy loss, exergy efficiency and component size have been investigated. Results show that, the net power output of the PR-CTRC could reach up to 9.0 kW for a 43.8 kW engine, which increases by 150% compared with that of the B-CTRC (3.6 kW). The PR-CTRC also improves the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of the B-CTRC, with increases of 184% and 227%, respectively. Compared with the ORC system, the PR-CTRC shows the significant advantage of highly recycling the exhaust gas and engine coolant simultaneously due to the special property of supercritical CO2's specific heat capacity. The supercritical property of CO2 also generates a better heat transfer and flowing performances. Meanwhile, the PR-CTRC possesses a smaller SP (0.010-0.020 m) than that of R123 systems (0.055-0.070 m). Therefore, the PR-CTRC system is suitable for the waste heat recovery of an engine, especially for recovering both high-grade and low-grade waste heat. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The absorption heat pump (AHP) heating system is an efficient alternative to the conventional fuel-based heating systems, with energy saving rate reaching 20-50%. However, the coefficient of performance (COP) and heating capacity of normal AHP decreased obviously as the available driving source temperature dropped. Compression-assisted AHP (CAHP) could operate efficiently under lower driving sources, and an experimental prototype was constructed for performance investigation. At an evaporator inlet of -10 degrees C, as the generator inlet decreases from 130 degrees C to 115 degrees C, the COP changes from 1.442 to 1.271, while the heating capacity drops from 68.21 kW to 31.28 kW. At an increased evaporator inlet of -5 degrees C, as the generator inlet decreases from 130 degrees C to 110 degrees C, the COP changes from 1.511 to 1.103, while the heating capacity drops from 78.72 kW to 21.71 kW. Comparisons between CARP and normal AHP indicated that CAHP can extend the lower limit of generator inlet temperature from 125-130 degrees C to 110-115 degrees C. Besides, CARP can enhance the heating capacity by 96.4% even when AHP can operate normally at a generator inlet of 130 degrees C. Moreover, performance improvement contributed by CARP is greater under lower-temperature driving sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Anaerobic digestion (AD) can play an important role in achieving the renewable energy goals set within the European Union. Within this article the focus is placed on reaching the Dutch local renewable production goal set for the year 2020 with locally available biomass waste flows, avoiding intensive farming and long transport distances of biomass and energy carriers. The bio-energy yields, efficiency and environmental sustainability are analyzed for five municipalities in the northern part of the Netherlands, using three utilization pathways: green gas production, combined heat and power, and waste management. Literature has indicated that there is sufficient bio-energy potential in local waste streams to reach the aforementioned goal. However, the average useful energy finally produced by the AD production pathway is significantly lower, often due to poor quality biomass and difficult harvesting conditions. Furthermore, of the potential bio-energy input in the three utilization pathways considered in this article, on average: 73% can be extracted as green gas; 57% as heat and power; and 44% as green gas in the waste management pathway. This demonstrates that the Dutch renewable production goal cannot be reached. The green gas utilization pathway is preferable for reaching production goals as it retains the highest amount of energy from the feedstock. However, environmental sustainability favors the waste management pathway as it has a higher overall efficiency, and lower emissions and environmental impacts. The main lessons drawn from the aforementioned are twofold: there is a substantial gap between bio-energy potential and net energy gain; there is also a gap between top-down regulation and actual emission reduction and sustainability. Therefore, a full life cycle-based understanding of the absolute energy and environmental impact of biogas production and utilization pathways is required to help governments to develop optimal policies serving a broad set of sustainable objectives. Well-founded ideas and decisions are needed on how best to utilize the limited biomass availability most effectively and sustainably in the near and far future, as biogas can play a supportive role for integrating other renewable sources into local decentralized energy systems as a flexible and storable energy source.

Abstract: Microgrids provide a new energy paradigm with the benefits of higher energy supply reliability, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a higher penetration of renewable sources, higher energy efficiencies through the use of local waste heat and the avoidance of losses in transmission and distribution. This study reports a life cycle assessment (LCA) of microgrids for an industry application of an ammonia plant in central Inner Mongolia, China. The life cycle energy use and GHG emissions of the microgrids are evaluated and compared to the existing fossil fuel-based energy system. The electricity, heat and hydrogen fuel loads of the ammonia plant are all modelled in the study. An optimization model is developed to estimate the minimum life cycle energy use and GHG emissions with the microgrids under three scenarios (natural gas (NG)-based, optimized, and maximum renewable energy microgrids). The results indicate that the use of wind and solar in the NG-based microgrid can only slightly reduce the energy use and GHG emissions. If there are no land area limitations on the deployment of solar and wind power, the maximum renewable energy microgrid offers significant reductions of fossil fuel energy of up to 56.9% and GHG emissions reductions of up to 66.3% compared to the existing energy system.

Abstract: This paper presents a parameter extraction technique for the five-parameter solar-cell model. It only requires the priori knowledge of three load points: the open circuit, the short circuit, and the maximum power points. An intrinsic property of solar cells helps to construct an extra equation. A cost function is formulated with another intrinsic property. A search algorithm for minimizing the cost function is proposed. The best set of parameters is revealed at the end of searching. Two load scanning experiments are performed on two different solar panels. The simulated I-V curves, produced with the obtained parameters, match the empirical measured results nicely. When compared to other existing techniques, our proposed method usually yields less mean absolute error. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Given the increasing share of wind energy in the portfolio of energy sources, there is the need for a more thorough understanding of its uncertainties due to changing weather conditions. To account for the uncertainty in predicting wind power production, this article examines the volatility forecasting abilities of different GARCH-type models for wind power production. Moreover, due to characteristic features of the wind power process, such as heteroscedasticity and nonlinearity, we also investigate the use of a Markov regime-switching GARCH (MRS-GARCH) model on forecasting volatility of wind power. Realized volatility, which is derived from lower-scale data, serves as a benchmark for latent volatility. We find that the MRS-GARCH model significantly outperforms traditional GARCH models in predicting the volatility of wind power, while the exponential GARCH model is superior among traditional GARCH models.

Abstract: Bio-hydrogen, obtained by fermentation of organic residues, is considered a promising source of renewable energy. However, the industrial scale H-2 production from organic waste is far to be realized as technical and economical limitations have still to be solved. Low H-2 yields and lack of industrially robust microbes are the major limiting factors.
To look for bacteria with both interesting hydrogen fermentative traits and proper robustness, granular sludge from a brewery full scale Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) digester was selected as trove of microbes processing complex substrates. One hundred and twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from heat-treated granular sludge and genetically identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, were screened for extracellular hydrolytic enzymes on cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, pectin, lipids, protein. The most interesting hydrolytic strains were assessed for their H-2 production from glucose and soluble starch. Two Bacillus sp. strains, namely F2.5 and F2.8, exhibited high H-2 yields and were used as pure culture to convert Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) into hydrogen. The strains produced up to 61 mL of H-2 per grams of volatile solids and could be considered as good candidates towards the development of industrially relevant H-2-producing inoculants. This is the first successful application of pure microbial cultures in bio-hydrogen production from OFMSW. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: While in the developed countries electrification is paving the way for progress and prosperity, nowadays electricity is still not accessible for about 18% of the world's population. Lack of power grids is the main reason that prevents millions in remote areas in developing countries from using electricity for the daily basic needs. PV systems provide an effective solution for these regions, but affordability remains an issue. This barrier can be widely overcome on the short term by limiting PV power supply to very high added value applications and by properly exploiting innovations, especially in energy efficiency and cost reductions. Additional to that, the long-term perspectives of off-grid PV are very favourable based on its ongoing technological improvements and cost reductions. This paper studies four off-grid PV cases of which each could cover a combination of basic energy needs regarding light, cooking, food conservation and electronic appliances. Case I considers a system that supplies power for LED lamps and electronic devices. Accordingly, Case II adds a fridge and Case III an electric rice cooker to Case I, while Case IV adds both. The paper elaborates on available technologies and future developments regarding all components in order to assess the long term evolution and potential of these applications, most specifically how their affordability would evolve over time. The modelling and optimization of the four cases are performed using the software iHOGA, which is an efficient tool to provide the lowest cost solution for off-grid PV systems. The use of iHOGA for the four cases and the installation years 2020, 2030 and 2040, taking thereby into account different developing regions, provide an evolutionary techno-economic assessment of these applications and a clear picture about the developments to be expected from off-grid PV in general.

Abstract: The hydrate dissociation and gas production behaviors are investigated in a pilot-scale hydrate simulator (PHS) using a novel two-spot horizontal well system through experimental and numerical simulations. There are two horizontal wells located in the same symmetrical plane of the cylindrical reactor. Gas and water are produced from the lower well under depressurization, while hot water with the temperature of 80.0 degrees C is injected into the PHS from the upper one at a constant rate of 50 mL/min. Both the experimental and numerical results show that nearly all the produced gas is originated from hydrate dissociation, and the initial free gas in the vessel contributes little to the final gas production. The injected hot water is more likely to flow downwards under the gravity effect and be produced from the lower well, and hydrate dissociation is mainly stimulated by the heat conduction in the reactor. Two irregular dissociation interfaces are observed to surround the hydrate undissociated areas. One interface expands from the upper well, while the other one shrinks from the boundaries. The results of the gas-to-water ratio and the obtained net energy indicate that it is commercially feasible for hydrate exploitation using this kind of well design. In addition, it is found that the production efficiency of the system is strongly dependent on the initial hydrate saturation and the hot water injection rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In order to simplify the system configuration and downsize the volume, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) needs to be operated in a self-humidified mode without any external humidifiers. However, in self-humidified PEMFCs, relatively low cell performance is a problem to be solved. In our previous study, a gas diffusion layer (GDL) containing double gas diffusion backing layer (GDBL) coated by single micro porous layer (MPL) was introduced and its effect on the cell performance was evaluated. In the present study, the effect of the double GDBL was investigated by measuring high frequency resistance (HFR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the experiments, the HFR value was remarkably reduced, while the diameter of semicircle of EIS was increased. It means that the membrane hydration was improved due to enhanced water retention capability of the GDL despite of interrupted gas diffusion. The result of numerical analysis also showed that the water retention capability of GDL can be improved with proper structure design of double GDBL. Based on the result, optimized design of double GDBL for water retention was obtained numerically. The result of this study provides useful information on the structural design of GDBL for self-humidified PEMFCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the offshore region the scarcity of in situ wind data in space proves to be a major setback for wind power potential assessments. Satellite data effectively overcomes this setback by providing continuous and total spatial coverage. The study intends to assess the offshore wind power resource of the Karnataka state, which is located on the west coast of India. Oceansat-2 scatterometer (OSCAT) wind data and GIS based methodology were adopted in the study.
The OSCAT data accuracy was assessed using INCOIS Realtime All Weather Station (IRAWS) data. Wind speed maps at 10 m, 90 m and wind power density maps using OSCAT data were developed to understand the spatial distribution of winds over the study area. Bathymetric map was developed based on the available foundation types and demarking various exclusion zones to help in minimizing conflicts. The wind power generation capacity estimation performed using REpower 5 MW turbine, based on the water depth classes was found to be 9,091 MW in Monopile (0-35 m), 11,709 MW in Jacket (35-50 m), 23,689 MW in Advanced Jacket (50-100 m) and 117,681 MW in Floating (100-1000 m) foundation technology. In Indian scenario major thrust for wind farm development in Monopile region is required. Therefore as first phase of development, if 10% of the estimated potential in the region can be developed then, 116% of energy deficit for FY 2011-12 could be met. Also, up to 79% of the anticipated energy deficit for the FY 2014-15 of the Karnataka state could be achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Efficient operation of thermoelectric devices strongly relies on the thermal integration into the energy conversion system in which they operate. Effective thermal integration reduces the temperature differences between the thermoelectric module and its thermal reservoirs, allowing the system to operate more efficiently. This work proposes and experimentally demonstrates a topology optimization approach as a design tool for efficient integration of thermoelectric modules into systems with specific design constraints. The approach allows thermal layout optimization of thermoelectric systems for different operating conditions and objective functions, such as temperature span, efficiency, and power recovery rate. As a specific application, the integration of a thermoelectric cooler into the electronics section of a downhole oil well intervention tool is investigated, with the objective of minimizing the temperature of the cooled electronics. Several challenges are addressed: ensuring effective heat transfer from the load, minimizing the thermal resistances within the integrated system, maximizing the thermal protection of the cooled zone, and enhancing the conduction of the rejected heat to the oil well. The design method incorporates temperature dependent properties of the thermoelectric device and other materials. The 3D topology optimization model developed in this work was used to design a thermoelectric system, complete with insulation and heat sink, that was produced and tested. Good agreement between experimental results and model forecasts was obtained and the system was able to maintain the load at more than 33 K below the oil well temperature. Results of this study support topology optimization as a powerful design tool for thermal design of thermoelectric systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, the combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) has been implemented for modeling and reducing CO and NOx emissions from a direct injection dual-fuel engine. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network is developed to predict the values of the emissions based on experimental data. The controllable variables such as engine speed, output power, intake temperature, mass flow rate of diesel fuel, and mass flow rate of the gaseous fuel are considered as input parameters. In order to identify the uncertainties due to the experiments and the ANN-based model, uncertainty analysis is carried out. Finally, optimum values of intake temperature, mass flow rate of diesel and gaseous fuels are obtained for a desired output power and engine speed via NSGA-II. The use of the developed evolutionary optimization algorithm allows the calculation of the Pareto-optimal set of designs under any combination of engine speed and output power, defined in the range of the experiments.

Abstract: It is really important for a closed oscillating heat pipe (COHP) system to achieve a higher heat dissipation capacity. In this work, a novel narrow -tube closed oscillating heat pipe model with two backward steps is proposed to enhance its heat transfer ability that is attributed to the oscillation cycle in a fixed direction. Volume of fluid (VOF) simulations and related experiments are performed to investigate the vapor, the temperature distribution and the thermal performance of the COHP. Compared with conventional heat pipe, the results indicate that the novel narrow -tube closed oscillating heat pipe has advantages in the vapor uniform, the heat transfer and the oscillation motion. Field Synergy Principle (FSP) is employed to investigate the reasons for the improvement of the heat transfer capability of the novel COHP, which provides a better guide for strengthening the heat dissipation capacity of the COHP system.

Abstract: The CaO/Ca(OH)(2) thermochemical heat storage system is a very promising method to realize solar thermal energy utilization and industrial waste heat recycling. In this study, a CaO/Ca(OH)(2) test-bed is setup to investigate the heat storage and release processes. In the heat storage process of pure Ca(OH)(2), a higher dehydration temperature results in a faster heat storage speed. In addition, the heat storage process of Li-doped Ca(OH)(2) can obtain a faster heat storage speed and produce more thermal energy than that of pure Ca(OH)(2). The results of the experiment show that the air can seriously affect the heat release process in a fixed-bed test. Therefore, the method of pumping out the air is used in this study to improve the heat release process. According to the results of the heat release experiment, a lower initial sample temperature can lead to a higher extent of the dehydration reaction. Furthermore, a higher vapor pressure obviously improves the heat release capacity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work, renewable ethylene glycol (EG) was developed as a potential fuel for direct liquid fuel cells (DLFCs) with Ag@C nanocables by immobilization of Palladium (Pd/Ag@C) anodes for sustainable electric power generation. The results confirm that the obtained nanocable is composed of a silver nanowire as a core and a carbonaceous layer as a shell. According to TEM, the resulting Pd nanoparticles are well distributed on the surface of the Ag@C, and the mean size of the Pd nanoparticles is 4.4 nm. Electrochemical behavior tests indicate that the Pd/Ag@C can achieve a maximum current density of 1027.4 mA mg(Pd)(-1) based on a half-cell reaction on EG fuel, suggesting that EG is a suitable fuel for DLFCs. It is concluded that the as-prepared Pd/Ag@C would be a potential candidate as an anode in energy conversion using DLFCs. Furthermore, the current study confirmed the practical applicability of EG as a direct fuel with Pd/Ag@C anode applied in DEGFCs may have a great effect on future energy systems.

Abstract: China's civil aviation industry has undergone a rapid expansion since the early 1980s, which has resulted in drastic increases in aviation fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The rapid increase in air transport is expected to continue, which poses critical challenges to this industry in terms of carbon emissions reduction. Despite its importance, an analysis of CO2 emissions with the future development of this industry and the impacts of crucial factors is missing from the literature. To bridge this gap, this study conducts scenario analysis of CO2 emissions from this sector through 2030 and assesses the influences from the key influential factors, including the adoption of low carbon jet fuel, the improvement of fuel intensity due to technological advancements of aircraft, and the increase of air traffic demand. The results show that the air traffic demand has the most significant influence on. emissions. The technological improvements in fuel intensity and the adoption of biomass-based fuel appear unlikely to reach the ambitious targets for this industry without a disruptive technological breakthrough. A more comprehensive policy framework, including a carbon tax on jet fuel, R&D support to promote fuel efficiency and a carbon offset scheme etc., is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Nowadays, the design and development of highly efficient and low-cost bifunctional electrodes for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are in urgent demand for energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water-splitting cells. Herein, to mitigate this challenge, a novel cost-effective flower-like Ni and N codoped hierarchical porous carbon microspheres (denoted as F-Ni/N-HPCMs) electrode has been fabricated by a simple two-step method. Benefiting from the unique structure property, the F-Ni/N-HPCMs show excellent ORR and OER performance. More importantly, H-2-O-2 alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cell (APEFC) fabricated with the F-Ni/N-HPCMs cathode shows an open circuit potential of 0.84 V and a high performance of 208 mW cm(-2). And, the performance is better than the reported APEFCs constructed with other non-precious metal electrodes. Hence, this work provides a new strategy to fabricate high performance electrodes for fuel cell storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Using condensation heat from cold storage refrigeration systems to provide heat for domestic hot water preparation and industrial hot water supply promotes energy conservation. However, few studies have investigated cold storage condensation heat recovery using phase change materials (PCMs). In this study, a cold storage condensation heat recovery system that uses PCMs has been designed and analysed. According to the principle of energy cascade recycling, different operation modes could be effectively switched to recycle condensation heat. Furthermore, a novel and suitable phase change composite material is developed for cold storage condensation heat recovery, which has a relatively large latent heat, high thermal conductivity, and an appropriate phase change temperature (i.e. 80 degrees C). With carnauba wax (CW) as the PCM and expanded graphite (EG) as the additive, a composite was developed with an optimal mass ratio of CW:EG = 10:1. The thermal and physical properties and the interior structure of the composite were then investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermal constants analyser (Hot Disk), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). Furthermore, experiments on the melting and solidification processes and accelerated thermal cycling were also conducted. It was found that at the optimal mass ratio of 10:1, the temperatures of the CW/EG composite in the melting and solidification processes were 81.98 degrees C and 80.43 degrees C, respectively, while the corresponding latent heats were 150.9 J/g and 142.6 J/g, respectivelli. During both processes, CW could retain its original worm-like structure after being completely adsorbed by EG. Compared to only CW, the melting and solidification time of the CW/EG composite were reduced by 81.7% and 55.3%, respectively, while its thermal conductivity was 16.4 times higher. After 1000 runs of accelerated thermal cycling, the endothermic/exothermic phase change temperatures of CW and the CW/EG composite increased by only 0.42%/0.42% and 0.23%/0.27%, respectively, while their endothermic/exothermic latent heats decreased by 4.96%/4.78% and 2.05%/3.44%, respectively. These results indicate that both CW and the CW/EG composite have excellent thermal reliability, while the CW/EG composite exhibits a slightly better performance. Finally, the experiments show that the CW/EG composite has desirable thermal and physical properties such as high thermal conductivity and reliability; Hence, it has good potential as a material for facilitating condensation heat recovery from cold storage refrigeration systems.

Abstract: In this research, the effect of phase change material (PCM) on energy consumption of a typical multistory office building located in five different cities (Shenyang, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Kunming and Hong Kong) representing different climate regions of China, was simulated for a whole year using EnergyPlus. Based on the simulation results, the energy savings resulting from PCM application were evaluated. For economic analysis, the static payback period (SPP) and dynamic payback period (DPP), considering different discount rates, were used to assess the application of PCM in a typical official building. Test results showed that the energy savings resulting from PCM application are more prominent for office building located in cold region such as Shenyang and Zhengzhou as well as in hot summer and cold winter (Changsha). From economic analysis, the application of PCM in Shenyang, Zhengzhou and Changsha showed high economic value and the investment appeared to be attractive. However, at current prices, the PCM investment in Kunming and Hong Kong cannot be recovered and do not offer economic benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This report examined the technical and economic feasibility of four process scenarios for the mineral carbonation of Victorian brown coal fly ash. The first two design scenarios aimed to compare the performance of two leaching agents, namely, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and a mixture of ammonium chloride and hydrochloric acid (NH4Cl + HCl), on product yields and cost, whereas the other two scenarios were designed to recycle the leaching residue via single or multi-stage leaching steps to co-produce a carbonate precipitate and cement additive-grade by-product. Detailed designs were developed in Aspen Plus to determine the technical and economic potential of the selected process configurations and identify the concept with the lowest overall costs relative to the product yields. As has been confirmed, the overall production costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) capture cost of the evaluated process scenarios range from similar to$61 to 333 per tonne of product and from $135 to 1091 per tonne of CO2, respectively. The process scenario that used NH4Cl + HCl as the leaching reagent had a significantly larger cost and a higher carbonation conversion compared to the other scenarios. The process configuration that recycled the leaching residue resulted in the lowest cost per tonne of fly ash and the lowest CO2 capture cost among the four proposed scenarios. The largest net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) as well as the shortest payback period for this scenario further confirmed its highest profitability. The NPV, IRR and payback period of $49 million, 53.4% and 2.3 years, respectively, could be achieved using Victorian brown coal fly ash in this scenario. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the change in the ammonium chloride price exerts the largest effect on the production cost. A 50% increase in the ammonium chloride cost could result in the production cost increasing by 29.5%. Additionally, the selling price of the carbon precipitate product and the production cost strongly affect the financial indices. However, the production of the cement-additive by-product exerts a marginal role on the process profit. The extra income created from the cement-additive by-product is counteracted by the larger cost related to the purchase and consumption of hydrochloric acid used in the final leaching stage.

Abstract: Energy conversion efficiency of a micro thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system strongly depends on wall temperature of micro combustors and its uniformity. In this work, a 3D numerical model is built to investigate effects of inlet pressure on premixed H-2/air combustion in a micro-cylindrical combustor with a step. The variation of velocity, temperature and specific entropy field are analyzed. Moreover, in order to characterize the uniformity of wall temperature, a nonuniformity coefficient R-T,R-w is introduced. Results suggest that the variation of velocity, temperature and specific entropy field is mainly existed at the reaction and outlet regions. And the highest mean wall temperature (1265.59 K) is arrived at p(in) = 0 MPa, while the lowest nonuniformity coefficient R-T,R-w (5.06) and the highest exergy efficiency (40.29%) is approached at p(in) = 0.1 MPa. In the viewpoint of energy usage, the micro combustion system has the best performance at p(in) = 0.1 MPa due to that it has the potentiality to obtain better energy conversion efficiency and higher exergy efficiency. This work provides us a direction to improve the performance of the micro combustor without changing the structure of the micro combustor, and can combine with other optimization methods.

Abstract: Nowadays, the safety issue has greatly hindered the development of large capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), especially in electric vehicles applications. TiO2 is a kind of potential anode candidate for improving the safety of LIBs. However, it still needs to understand how to improve the performance of TiO2 anode in the practical applications. Herein, we design a contrast experiment by using three sizes of TiO2 hierarchical hollow microspheres (TiO2-HSs). The research results indicated that the cycling performance of TiO2-HSs anode can be affected by the size of microspheres, and the nanoparticles size of microspheres and crystallinity of TiO2 can affect their initial discharge capacity and lithium ion diffusion. And, the influence of microspheres size is more significant. This may provide a new strategy for improving the lithium-ion storage property of TiO2 anode material in the practical applications.

To mitigate this challenge, in this study, amorphous SnO2/graphene aerogel nanocomposites are fabricated via a simple hydrothermal approach. The amorphous nature of SnO2 is clearly determined in detail by transmission electron microscopy, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurement. The as-prepared material shows satisfying reversible capacity and significant cyclic stability. For instance, it delivers an excellent discharge capacity of 700.1 mA h g(-1) in 80th cycle at a current density of 100 mA g-1, in accordance with a high retention capacity of 97.6% compared to that of the sixth cycles, which is much better than crystalline SnO2/graphene aerogel. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the intrinsic isotropic nature, smaller size, and high electrochemical reaction kinetics of amorphous SnO2, together with the graphene aerogels matrix. Therefore, this study may provide an effortless, economic, and environmental friendly strategy to fabricate high volume change electrode materials for lithiuln ion batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A new hybrid proton exchange membrane (PEM) has been prepared from hydroxyl functionalized imidazolium ionic liquid (IL-OH), Nafion and nano-SiO2. The IL-OH, with a hydroxyl group that acts as both a proton acceptor and donor, forms strong hydrogen bonds with both Nafion and nano-SiO2, resulting in an effective hydrogen bond network in the ternary membrane. Such an anhydrous hydrogen-bond network, which is unknown previously, endows the PEMs with higher proton conductivity, greater thermal stability and surprisingly a more robust mechanical performance than PEMs consisting of conventional ionic liquids. The resulting PEMs have a tensile strength that is more than twice as strong as recast Nafion and an anhydrous ionic conductivity of similar to 55 mS cm(-1) at temperatures above 160 degrees C, with a proton transfer number of similar to 0.9. A laboratory assembled H-2-O-2 fuel cell employing this new PEM delivered a power density of 340 and 420 mW cm(-2) at 160 and 180 degrees C, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Although microwave heating or processing is rapidly emerging as an effective and efficient tool in various technological and-scientific fields, the understanding of the interaction mechanisms between microwaves and various matters is still insufficient. For instance, in case of microwave-metal (MW-m) interaction, the phenomena and effects are far more complicated than the conventional microwave heating. Particularly, when metals with sharp edges, tips or submicroscopic irregularities are subjected to microwave irradiation, electrical discharges, including corona, spark or arc discharges, could occur and consequently trigger complicated effects like the appearance of hot spots, the plasma effect and the photo-catalytic effect. This paper focuses on this process and presents a critical review on the state-of-the-art theoretical background as well as the influencing factors of MW-m discharges, followed by a careful discussion of the special associated effects from the heating effect, plasma effect and potential photo-catalytic effect. An overview on the applications of MW-m discharges is provided and followed by the identification of the associated negative aspects and challenges. This work presents a format to better understand the MW-m discharge phenomena. It will be beneficial to extend the discharge phenomena and their featured effects into applications such as microwave-assisted pyrolysis, pollutants removal, material synthesis, and many other fields.

Abstract: Reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) is demonstrated as a promising combustion strategy to achieve high efficiency and clean combustion. In this work, an extensive experimental investigations are performed focusing on investigating the effect of operational parameters (intake pressure, exhaust gas recirculation rate, gasoline proportion, diesel injection timing, etc.) on the combustion performance and emission characteristics at various engine loads. Then, the key limiting factors for extension of the upper and lower limits of RCCI operations are analyzed. Results suggest that ultra-low NOx and soot emissions as well as high thermal efficiency can be achieved simultaneously with gasoline/diesel dual-fuel RCCI regime at Moderate-to-high loads, while diesel low temperature combustion (LTC) with single-shot fuel injection can be more suitable for low-load operations. Moreover, to extend the RCCI operating range to lower loads, the proportion of diesel injection should be raised to increase the global reactivity of the in-cylinder charge. While increasing EGR rate and gasoline proportion as well as advancing diesel injection timing can lower the global reactivity of the cylinder charge and avoid premature combustion, excessive pressure rise rate and high peak in-cylinder pressure, thereby in favor of extending RCCI operation to higher loads. However, ultra-high EGR rate or too early fuel injection can lead to unstable combustion, making combustion phasing control extremely difficult. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A 3D multi-physics, multi-component and not isothermal model is developed to analyze the effects of catalyst structures on the performance of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) cell toward the oxygen reduction reaction using dry oxygen as a reactant. The model includes Stokes-Brinkman, Maxwell-Stefan, and modified Butler-Volmer equations for simulating the performance of the GDE cell, solved by Comsol (R) Multiphysics v4.4a platform. The model is validated against experimental data, showing congruent and convergent responses for different electrodes based on noble and non-noble metals catalysts, confirming the accuracy of the model and the equations applied. The use of a 3D model incorporating porous materials can be used for evaluating mass transport and diffusivity parameters of the electrocatalyst, identifying the controlling variable in the process. The model can be used as an optimization tool for further improvement of catalyst synthesis, suggesting which properties can be tuned to improve the overall performance in the catalyst design.phase.

Abstract: In order to guarantee safe and proper use of Lithium-ion batteries during operation, an accurate estimate of the battery temperature is of paramount importance. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to estimate the battery temperature and several EIS-based temperature estimation methods have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we argue that all existing EIS-based methods implicitly distinguish two steps: experiment design and parameter estimation. The former step consists of choosing the excitation frequency and the latter step consists of estimating the battery temperature based on the measured impedance resulting from the chosen excitation. By distinguishing these steps and by performing Monte-Carlo simulations, all existing methods are compared in terms of accuracy (i.e., mean-square error) of the temperature estimate. The results of the comparison show that, due to different choices in the two steps, significant differences in accuracy of the estimate exist. More importantly, by jointly selecting the parameters of the experiment-design and parameter-estimation step, a more-accurate temperature estimate can be obtained. In case of an unknown State-of-Charge, this novel method estimates the temperature with an average absolute bias of 0.4 C and an average standard deviation of 0.7 degrees C using a single impedance measurement for the battery under consideration.

Abstract: The high power consumption of auxiliary equipment, particularly that of the primary air fan, in a coal-fired power plant provides ample scope for reducing power consumption. Therefore, a power-saving control strategy for the primary air fan is proposed that automatically calculates a primary air pressute offset value in real time, which, when combined with the existing primary air pressure setting, reduces the total pressure, and correspondingly decreases the power consumption of the primary air fan while maintaining the mill outlet temperature within the optimum range. The power-saving control strategy implements two models that are respectively applicable to normal conditions and mill outlet over-temperature conditions. Mechanistic modeling is implemented for the model applicable to normal conditions. The model evaluates the mill inlet hot air damper opening for determining the potential for reducing the power consumption, the mill inlet cold air damper opening is applied for adjust the mill outlet temperature, and the total pressure and corresponding power consumptiot are thereby reduced. The other model is controlled by a conventional proportional derivative controller, which employs the deviation of the mill outlet temperature as its input. The proposed power-saving control strategy is applied to a 1000 MW commercial power plant, and the power consumption of the primary fan is demonstrated to be reduced by as much as 465 kW for a 500 MW load, resulting in a power consumption reduction of 15%.

Abstract: Tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB) is applied to suppress the self-discharge of charged LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (LNCM) under high potential. The contribution of TMSB is understood via physical and electrochemical characterizations. It is found that the charged. LNCM under 4.5 V suffers serious self-discharge: potential drops to 0.5 V and crystal structure collapses, but this self-discharge is effectively suppressed by applying TMSB in a standard (STD) electrolyte. Different from the failure from cycling, which is caused mainly by the electrochemical oxidation decomposition of electrolyte, the self-discharge results from the interaction between charged LNCM and electrolyte. TMSB is preferentially oxidized in comparison with STD electrolyte, generating a solid electrolyte interphase film on LNCM, which avoids the direct contact between LNCM and electrolyte and thus suppresses the self-discharge of the charged LNCM.

Abstract: A mobile thermal battery is a new concept in renewable energy technologies and provides effective and innovative solutions for solar energy utilization in various applications. A thermal battery mimics a volumetric solar receiver, which uses phase change material and metallic meshes in the energy storing medium. In the present study, performance analysis of a mobile thermal battery is presented. LiNO3 is used as the phase change material and aluminum meshes are incorporated to enhance the heat diffusion inside the receiver. The concentrated solar heating is incorporated resembling the actual field data. In order to achieve uniform heating of the phase change material inside the receiver, the rotation of the receiver is introduced along its symmetry axis. It is found that the aluminum meshes improve the heat diffusion significantly and enhances the melting rate of the phase change material inside the receiver. This, in turn, minimizes the local excessive heating and early initiation of the phase change process inside the thermal battery. The rotation of the receiver reduces the maximum temperature of the working fluid through suppressing local excess heating. In addition, receiver rotation lowers the maximum and minimum temperature difference inside the receiver; however, with increasing rotational speed, a small delay is observed for the time completing the phase change process inside the receiver.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a planning approach for reducing the impact that failure events in the natural gas (NG) network impose on the electricity market operation. For this purpose, an efficient computational methodology based on the Monte Carlo sequential simulation approach is developed, in order to realistically simulate the annual operation of the NG network and deduce the failure events at the connection nodes of the NG-fired power plants. The failure events are then fed into a mid-term scheduling model based on the day -ahead electricity market clearing algorithm, in order to quantify their impact on electricity prices, unit commitment and dispatch, and the energy mix. An appropriate methodology on the location selection of new storage capacity in the NG network is also described, and a case study based on the combined Hellenic electric power system and NG network is used as a. test-bed for evaluating the alternative locations.

Abstract: The conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added fuel using electrical energy generated intermittently from renewable energy sources is very promising in terms of energy usage reconciliation. The process converts greenhouse carbon dioxide gas to produce diverse attractive chemicals and fuels like methanol, formate, and other hydrocarbons. In this paper, the electroreduction of CO2 to formate in aqueous solution is performed by using novel hierarchical tin oxide microsphere (HMS-SnO2) particles deposited over gas diffusion layer electrode (HMS-SnO2/GDE). The experiment is carried out in a divided H-type two compartment cell with a Nafion (R) membrane as the, diaphragm separating the cathodic and anodic compartments. The HMS-SnO2 catalysts are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal self-assembled process using different ratios of ethanol to distilled water in the synthetic solution. Due to the outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity toward CO2 electroreduction, SnO2-86/GDE exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of 62% toward formate formation at -1.7 V vs. SHE (Standard Hydrogen Electrode). The electrode durability is also observed with a stable current density over 12 h of continuous electrolysis operation. The superior performance is credited to the morphology- and size-controlled hierarchical structure, which may provide more active sites to accelerate the slow kinetics of CO2 reduction, leading to the improved energy efficiency. During electrolysis process, KHCO3 electrolyte is found to have some contribution to formate formation on the micro-structured tin oxide catalysts coated GDE electrode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The conductivity of pure molten KH2PO4 salt and four mixtures with more or less water (KH2PO4-H2O and KH2PO4-KPO3 systems, respectively) were measured at temperatures of 240-320 degrees C and under their own water vapor pressures. Molten KH2PO4 has been proven to be a promising electrolyte for an elevated temperature pressurized water electrolyzer demonstrating high conductivity of similar to 0.30 S cm(-1) at 300 degrees C. The conductivity data are given as polynomial functions of temperature and composition. The melting point of the pure salt under its own water vapor pressure was determined to be similar to 272 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, eight physical and chemical pretreatments were compared in terms of their enhancements on biomass enzymatic saccharification in reed. Despite 8% NaOH pretreatment could result in 100% biomass enzymatic digestion while co-supplied with 1% Tween-80, it only produced bioethanol at 10% (% dry matter). By comparison, 10% Cab pretreatment with Tween-80 is a relatively low-cost biomass conversion with ethanol yield at 12%. Notably, the steam-explosion pretreatment with 1% Tween-80 could cause a complete biomass enzymatic hydrolysis with bioethanol yield at 17%. The sequential 5% CaO pretreatment with the steam-exploded residues could lead to the highest ethanol yield at 19% with an almost complete sugar-ethanol conversion rate. Due to much low-DP cellulose and less noncellulosic polymers (lignin, hemicelluloses) that increase biomass surfaces, the steam-exploded residues were specifically effective for Tween-80 either to block lignin absorbing with cellulases or to disassociate hemicelluloses, leading to an efficient lignocellulose enzymatic digestion. Compared with previously reported pretreatments in other C4-grasses (Miscanthus, corn, sweet sorghum, switchgrass), to our knowledge, this study has therefore provided three more applicable approaches for high ethanol production with relatively low cost, less contaminate release and efficient biomass conversion rates in reed.

Abstract: In terms of energy supply, the vast majority of populated islands depends on fossil fuels. These are normally not locally available on the islands. Because of the increasing profitability of renewable energies and a growing environmental awareness, more and more islands are breaking away from the conventional energy supply and are reinforcing the use of renewable energies. An energy supply system proven successful on one island could also be successfully implemented on another island. For this, the second island has to have similar conditions for the use of renewable energies. This study classifies the global islands with the use of cluster analysis. Input variables of the performed cluster analysis are climatic as well as physical and socio-economic parameters. In total 1087 islands are classified. Finally, ten main clusters of islands could be pointed out. These clusters contain regional and global spread groups of islands. The result offers the possibility to identify similar islands concerning the implementation of RES. Therefore, it supports the transfer of proven, well-working concepts and the direct adoption of these concepts by suitable islands. Furthermore, islands which have especially high potentials for the use of a specific renewable energy source can be easily recognized. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The conceptual processes for biogas upgrading using three imidazolium-based ionic liquids ([hmim] [Tf2N], [bmim][Tf2N] and [bmim][PF6]) were simulated in Aspen Plus to study the effect of properties of ionic liquids (ILs) on the process performance. To conduct the process simulation, each IL was input into Aspen Plus as a pseudo component, their critical properties were estimated by group contribution method, and their thermo-physical properties were correlated from the available experimental data by semi-empirical equations. The gas solubility in ILs was modeled with the non-random two-liquid model and Redlich-Kwong equation of state. Among the studied ILs, the simulation results show that the amount of recirculated solvents and the total energy consumption for upgrading process using ILs follow: [bmim][Tf2N] < [bmim][PF6] < [hmim][Tf2N]. The effects of density and viscosity of ILs on pressure drop and diameter of the absorber as well as the effects of operational pressures and temperatures on the process efficiency were investigated. It is found that the energy consumption increases with increasing pressure and temperature in the absorber and decreases with increasing pressure in the first flash tank. The ILs-based technology was further compared with water scrubbing and aqueous choline chloride/urea scrubbing, and the comparison shows that the total energy consumptions follow: 50%ChCl/Urea-water < [bmim][Tf2N] scrubbing < water scrubbing.

Abstract: Buildings should be understood as a process that consumes energy in all their phases (design, construction, use and end-of-life) and, more specifically, the building envelope is clearly involved in all, of them. For this reason, the International Energy Agency defines in its latest publication the improvement of building envelopes as one of the key points to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. In the present study, two sustainable construction systems based on rammed earth walls are adapted to modern requirements to be thermally tested and compared against three Mediterranean conventional systems under summer conditions. The experimentation was done by performing several. experiments in free floating and controlled temperature conditions at real scale in five cubicle-shape buildings with inner dimensions 2.4 x 2.4 x 2.4 m. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that more sustainable construction systems can be used instead of conventional ones, with higher embodied energy, and achieve similar thermal response. Results show that the reduction of rammed earth wall thickness strongly penalizes its thermal behavior. However, similar thermal response than conventional systems is reached when 6 cm of wooden insulation panels are added in the outer face of the cubicle-shape building. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper provides a missing integrated guide to budding middle class rural sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) homesteads trying to photo-electrify. It first estimates bare minimum requirements for these homes to start emerging from energy poverty. Guidance is given on optimal selection of the most important device for such homes: the light bulb. Along with other essential devices, this gives a daily electrical load of 500 W h, 42 A h at 12 V DC. Building on earlier experimental work on validating TRNSYS in Cape Town, it extends usage of the software to the rest of SSA, aiming to recommend panel and balance of system component sizes to meet the above load all year round. Use is made of panel slopes derived in a related piece of work to formulate an optimisation model for selecting panel-battery-charge controller combinations. A survey of South Africa-made panels and components is done. Then, a method of solving the model is demonstrated by an example in Uganda which selects from the surveyed components to satisfy two alternative technical objectives of 'least battery storage' and 'smallestpanel size'. At each of the other 151 stations in SSA, the model is solved only for the first objective. The overall results are then mapped using MATLAB (R). It is concluded that from a 'smallest battery storage' perspective, usable battery storage capacities in the region range between 70 and 360 A h, with the biggest being in equatorial/tropical rain forest areas of Congo basin and along the mid-western coastal areas. Panel sizes range between 160 and 275 Wp. The dominant recommendation on charge controllers is 15 A. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We report the energy performance of a new platinum-free alkaline direct formate fuel cell, equipped with a commercial anion exchange membrane, a nanostructured Pd/C anode and a Fe-Co/C cathode. The cell was investigated both at room temperature and at 60 degrees C for the determination of the following parameters: (i) maximum power density, (ii) delivered energy, (iii) faradic (fuel conversion) and energy efficiency. These parameters show a dramatic dependence on fuel composition. The highest energy efficiency is obtained using high energy density fuel (4 M KCOOH and 4 M KOH) and with a maximum operating temperature of 60 degrees C. This represents a key step in the progress of alkaline platinum-free DFFC technology, demonstrating their potential as power sources for portable electronic devices and remote power generation systems. For example, a fuel load of 750 ml in a DFFC device operating at 60 degrees C would be able to produce 90 W h of energy, that required to fully charge the battery of a laptop computer.

Abstract: In this paper, both primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries are constructed using La2O3/Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs hybrid nanocomposites as air electrodes for high-performance energy storage and conversion. The air electrode hybrid catalysts with controlled morphology are prepared by a facile hydrothermal self assembly process, which exhibits highly bi-functional catalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during discharge and charge processes in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. When these catalysts are integrated into a practical primary Zn-air battery, a high open circuit voltage of 1.5 V is achieved along with a high discharge peak power density of 295 mW cm(-2). The specific capacity normalized to the mass of consumed Zn is 821 mA h g(-1), corresponding to a high energy density of 970 W h kg(-1), which shows this zinc-air battery's performance is higher than any battery currently commercially available to meet the requirements of high-power electric equipment. More specifically, the electrochemically rechargeable Zn-air battery incorporating by this bifunctional catalyst exhibits an unprecedented small charge-discharge voltage polarization, high reversibility and high stability, suggesting this battery can be used as a power source for portable electronics, armamentarium and electrical vehicles. Furthermore, a flexible, rechargeable Zn-air battery as a wholly solid-state energy storage device, and exhibiting good peak power density and decent stability, should be viable in other practical applications such as smart electronics and wearable electronic devices.

Abstract: Three-dimensional nanoporous nitrogen-doped graphene (3D-PNG) has been synthesized through a facial one-step synthesis method without additional silica template. The as-prepared 3D-PNGwas used as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which shows excellent electrochemistry performance, demonstrated by half-cell electrochemical evaluation in 0.1 M KOH including prominent ORR activity, four electron-selectivity and remarkable methanol poisoning stability compared to commercial 20%Pt/C catalyst. The physical and surface properties of 3D-PNG catalyst were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and BET surface area analysis. The experiments show that 3D-PNG catalyst possesses super-large specific surface area reaching 920 m(2) g(-1), which is superior to our most recently reported 3D-PNG synthesized by silica template (670 m(2) g(-1)) and other doped graphene catalysts in literature. When used for constructing a zinc-air battery cathode, such an 3D-PNG catalyst can give a discharge peak power density of 275 mW cm(-2). All the results announce a unique procedure to product high-efficiency graphene-based non-noble metal catalyst materials for electrochemical energy devices including both fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

Abstract: In a practical SOFC power generator device, stack stability and durability are the basis of the system's efficiency. A typical stack contains fuel cells and interconnects which are connected serially and the fuel and air are fed onto the different sides of the electrodes. When degradants happen at the electrodes and interfaces, the stack performance starts to decay and thus affects the system's efficiency. In this study, a planar SOFC 1-cell stack was assembled and placed in a test bench to evaluate its durability under a constant working environment. Post test was carried out to determine the source of the performance degradation. A low-cost and rapid test method was introduced to quantify morphology information of the microstructure, which could have a potential application in future use. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Battery cost is one of the crucial parameters affecting high deployment of Electric Vehicles (EVs) negatively. Accurate State of Health (SoH) estimation plays an important role in reducing the total ownership cost, availability, and safety of the battery avoiding early disposal of the batteries and decreasing unexpected failures. A circuit design for SoH estimation in a battery system that bases on selected battery cells and its integration to EVs are presented in this paper. A prototype microcontroller has been developed and used for accelerated aging tests for a battery system. The data collected in the lab tests have been utilized to simulate a real EV battery system. Results of accelerated aging tests and simulation have been presented in the paper. The paper also discusses identification of the best number of battery cells to be selected for SoH estimation test. In addition, different application options of the presented approach for EV batteries have been discussed in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Six EU gas grids have a target of 100% substitution of natural gas with renewable gas by 2050. This industry will start with biogas upgraded to biomethane. The biomethane resource and location of waste substrates (such as agricultural slurries, slaughterhouse waste, milk processing waste, and source separated household organic waste) were determined using the most recent spatially explicit data for Ireland. The total biomethane resource was estimated equivalent to: 7.6% of natural gas usage, 7% of energy in transport; 52% of the fuel usage in heavy goods vehicles in 2013. In terms of natural gas usage it corresponded to 26.5% of industrial gas use, and 52% of residential natural gas use. The resource as a source of thermal energy is equivalent to wood chips from 16.5% of arable land under short rotation coppice willow. Thematic maps illustrating the location of each resource were developed to highlight regions of significant biomethane production potential. The regions with the greatest resource of cattle slurry are located in the south and east of the country; sheep manure resources are concentrated on the western seaboard, while the largest biomethane resource from household organic waste is found in urban and city areas (63% of household organic waste biomethane resource).

Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate improved energy efficiency for domestic hot water (DHW) production in residential buildings. This is done by deriving data-driven optimal heating schedules (used interchangeably with policies) automatically. The optimization leverages actively learnt occupant behaviour and models for thermodynamics of the storage vessel to operate the heating mechanism - an air-source heat pump (ASHP) in this case - at the highest possible efficiency. The proposed algorithm, while tested on an ASHP, is essentially decoupled from the heating mechanism making it sufficiently robust to generalize to other types of heating mechanisms as well. Simulation results for this optimization based on data from 46 Net-Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) in the Netherlands are presented. These show a reduction of energy consumption for DHW by 20% using a computationally inexpensive heuristic approach, and 27% when using a more intensive hybrid ant colony optimization based method. The energy savings are strongly dependent on occupant comfort level. This is demonstrated in real-world settings for a low-consumption house where active control was performed using heuristics for 3.5 months and resulted in energy savings of 27% (61 kW h). It is straightforward to extend the same models to perform automatic demand side management (ADSM) by treating the DHW vessel as a flexibility bearing device. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The effects of different process configurations, including the operation of a single rotating packed bed (RPB), a single packed bed (PB), and RPB + RPB, RPB + PB, and PB + RPB in series or in parallel, on the CO2 rich loading, amount of treated gas, amount of captured CO2 and regeneration energy using "11 m" monoethanolamine (MEA) as the model absorbent were studied. When the same volume of absorber was used to achieve the same CO2 capture efficiency, an RPB was identified to" be superior to a PB, and RPB + RPB in series showed the greatest performance on the amount of treated gas and regeneration energy among the discussed configurations. Compared with the operation of a single RPB, the amount of treated gas of RPB + RPB in series with the same volume of the single RPB increased by 20.6% due to an increase of mass transfer driving force, whereas the regeneration energy decreased by 9.5% due to an increase of rich loading. Although the CO2 capture efficiency decreased with increasing gas flow rate, the total amount of captured CO2 was found to increase. The treated gas amount could further be increased 80-140% compared with "11 m" MEA when the "4 m" diethylenetriamine (DETA) + "4 m" piperazine (PZ) was used, suggesting this was a superior absorbent for CO2 capture, and thus, the development of absorbent is as important as the development of process.

Abstract: Performance of an adsorption cooling system driven by solar thermal energy was studied under different climatic conditions. The effects of solar collector area, collector slope, hot water temperature and flow rate on the system performance were investigated using the real-time weather data of two cities: Perth, Australia (a representative city in the southern hemisphere) and Amman, Jordan (a representative city in the northern hemisphere). The simulation results showed that the two cities had similar solar radiation during the summer period and that the solar adsorption chiller could reliably provide cooling at a reasonably high system COP. For residential cooling with a total CPC (Compound Parabolic Collector) solar collector area of 36.22 m(2), the average system COP was 0.491 for Perth weather conditions and 0.467 for Amman weather conditions, respectively while the cooling capacity was 10.3 kW for Perth and 8.46 kW for Amman, respectively at peak times. Optimum performance occurred when the system run with the CPC collector slope of around 30, the solar water storage tank volume of 1.4 m(3), inlet hot water temperature of 80 degrees C, and a hot water flow rate of 0.33 kg/s. An economic analysis was further investigated and the results showed that the solar driven adsorption cooling system could reduce the electricity consumption for Perth and Amman cities by 34% and 28%, respectively in comparison to a conventional vapour compression cooling system.

Abstract: Establishing a game theory model, this paper captures the effects of output subsidy on energy efficiency under Cournot competition and Stackelberg competition. Three types of subsidies are considered in the model, namely without subsidy, unilateral subsidy and bilateral subsidy. The findings indicate that firms without subsidy are not willing to improve energy efficiency. Also, subsidy stimulates the subsidized firms' outputs while deters the outputs of other firms. Meanwhile, the equilibrium subsidy intensity depends on firms' position. Furthermore, the minimal subsidy budgets under different situations are presented. Especially, given the fixed subsidy budget, the output of the subsidized firm is the highest if this firm plays the leading position. In addition, certain subsidy can reduce the total emission, while overdue subsidy cannot reach the environmental object. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Critical peak pricing (CPP) is an electricity demand response technology that has great potential to lower the electricity cost and eliminate the need for more GHG emitting power plants. Many utilities start to offer CPP as the default electric service for industrial customers in their market design. When a manufacturing customer defaults to CPP, it is vital to understand what it is and how it will influence their energy budget and facility operations. In addition, given the option to opt-out to a time-of-use (TOU) rate, it is not always easy to tell whether the switch will result in higher bills or more GHG emissions. These questions will be answered in this paper. Specifically, we will model and compare both CPP and TOU rates to gain more accurate knowledge regarding annual electric costs and GHG emissions. With these results, manufacturing enterprises will be able to make more informed decisions on which service to choose and how to use electricity while fulfilling their role for sustainability by enrolling. The case study results show that for industrial customers with production flexibility, with proper rescheduling of electric use, they can save money by adopting CPP, while contributing to reducing GHG emissions. The savings on the annual electric bill can be 30.45% with a simultaneous GHG emissions reduction of 5.63% for an average industrial customer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The directed weighted networks of international crude oil and gasoline price were built in the different fluctuation periods. And then the evolution law of the new nodes in the prices networks was analyzed. The results indicated that the cumulative times of the new nodes that appeared in the crude oil and gasoline prices networks were not random but exhibited a high linear growth trend, which revealed the linear characteristics of the accumulation time of abnormal points that appeared in the process of oil price fluctuations. Based on the node strength, the calculation formula of the network similarity between the crude oil and gasoline price networks was designed, and the interdependence between the crude oil and gasoline price fluctuations was calculated, the results indicated that there was a strong interdependence between crude oil and gasoline prices in stable fluctuation periods, but the degree of dependence was significantly reduced in sharp fluctuation periods. The strength of nodes and their strength distribution, weighted clustering coefficient, and average shortest paths of the price network in different periods were calculated. The fluctuation characteristics in different periods were comparatively analyzed. The core fluctuation status and the conversion relationship between them in different periods were revealed. Finally, the important modes of price fluctuations of crude oil and gasoline were identified and the distribution characteristics of the time these modes appeared were studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this work, a new design concept which combines two-stage design with transient supercooling effect is proposed to enhance the maximum temperature drop across thermoelectric coolers (TECs). A three-dimensional, multiphysics, and transient model is used to examine the design effectiveness. Step current pulses with various amplitudes (P) and widths (tau) are supplied to the two stages of a two-stage TEC in series. The results show that, as compared with the single-stage counterpart, a significant improvement in the maximum cold-end temperature drop (Delta T-c,T-max) is observed for the two-stage TEC. Meanwhile, the new design also greatly reduces the temperature overshoot (T-c,T-max) and increases the holding time of supercooling state (Delta t(hold)). Subsequently, effects of the pulse amplitude, width, and shape are discussed and two important geometry parameters: the cross-sectional area ratio of p-type leg to n-type leg and the leg length ratio of cold stage to hot stage are investigated. These results confirm that Delta T-c,T-max, T-c,T-max, and Delta t(hold) can be further improved by optimizing the pulse and the geometry parameters. This work provides a feasible cooling approach for some specific cooling targets, such as mid-infrared laser gas sensors or any other semiconductor devices which require a temporary but large temperature drop.

Abstract: Owing to low efficiency of traditional ships and the serious environmental pollution that they cause, the use of solar energy and an energy storage system (ESS) in a ship's power system is increasingly attracting attention. However, the swinging of a ship raises crucial challenges in designing an optimal system for a large oil tanker ship, which are associated with uncertainties in solar energy. In this study, a series of experiments are performed to investigate the characteristics of a photovoltaic (PV) system on a moving ship. Based on the experimental results, an interval uncertainty model of on-board PV generation is established, which considers the effect of the swinging of the ship. Due to the power balance equations, the outputs of the diesel generator and the ESS on a large oil tanker are also modeled using interval variables. An interval optimization method is developed to determine the optimal size of the ESS in this hybrid ship power system to reduce the fuel cost, capital cost of the ESS, and emissions of greenhouse gases. Variations of the ship load are analyzed using a new method, taking five operating conditions into account. Several cases are compared in detail to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: n-Butanol is a very competitive alternative biofuel for spark ignition (SI) engines given its many advantages. Current researches are mainly concentrated on the overall combustion and emissions performance concerning the feasibility of n-butanol gasoline blends in SI engines. In this work, focus was given on the knocking combustion characteristics of operation with pure n-butanol as well as a blend fuel with 20% volume content of n-butanol (Bu20), which was investigated experimentally in a direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) single cylinder engine. Operation condition is fixed at a constant engine speed of 1500 r/min, using three throttle openings with stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. Spark timing was swept to achieve different knocking levels. The results of n-butanol and Bu20 were benchmarked against those obtained by the research octane number (RON) 92 commercial gasoline. Compared with the baseline fuel gasoline, neat n-butanol shows better anti-knock ability with more advanced knock limited spark timing, whereas slightly deteriorative knock resistance can be found for Bu20. It is hypothesized Bu20 has higher end gas temperature due to its higher brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and faster burning rate compared with gasoline, which indicates the knock tendency depends not only on the fuel octane number, but also on the factors that affect the end gas thermodynamic state. The heavier knock propensity of Bu20 is furthermore confirmed by its more advanced knock onset and higher peak oscillation pressure. Results of fast fourier transform (FFT) indicate the knocking oscillation frequencies are mainly determined by the combustion chamber resonance modes. Statistics probability distribution and cumulative distribution are applied to evaluate the knock intensity variation for each fuel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a feed-in tariff policy which can contribute to both energy and economic performance of a CCHP-system is proposed. By applying this feed-in tariff policy, the impact on design optimization (power generation unit capacity and operation strategy) and system performance (economic, energy, and matching performance) of a hospital CCHP system used in different climate zones are evaluated and analyzed. In policy one (Pol(1)), no electricity is allowed to be sold. In policy two (Pol(2)), the electricity selling price is constant. In policy three (Pol(3)), the selling price of electricity is proportional to the PER (Primary Energy consumption Ratio) of the system when the PER is not lower than a critical value. Otherwise, the selling price is zero. The results show that Pol(3) can ensure both energy and economic performances of CCHP system. The effect of feed-in tariff policy to improve the. performance of CCHP system reduces gradually from the cold zone to the hot zone. Multi-criteria decision making results show that Pol(3) with reasonable parameters is the best choice-in all climate zones except for-the hottest zone in this study. When improving PER is attractive, following thermal load operation strategy is the best choice under Pol(3). In the hottest zone of this study, little excess electricity would be produced and sold to the grid. Feed-in tariff policy has little help to improve the economic and energy performance in this zone.

Abstract: It is highly desirable to develop high-performance and cost-effective cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, functionalized graphene nanosheets (FGNS) were facilely synthesized utilizing ethylene glycol as both reducing agent and solvent. When employed as cathode materials for LIBs, FGNS were demonstrated to exhibit superior electrochemical performance when compared with traditional metal oxide-based cathodes. For instance, FGNS deliver outstanding cycle stability and high specific discharge capacity of 280 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1) without obvious capacity fading after 300 cycles. Furthermore, FGNS reveal high rate capacity of 152 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 0.4 A g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the oxygen-containing functional groups and specific poriferous structure of FGNS. The proposed FGNS are expected to be a simple, low-cost, efficient, and large-scale production of cathode materials for LIBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Electrical energy storage could play an important role in decarbonizing the electricity sector by offering a new, carbon-free source of operational flexibility, improving the utilization of generation assets, and facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the System depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments In nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power.

Abstract: The concept of eco-industrial park (EIP) has recently become the subject of a great deal of attention from industry and academic research groups. This paper proposes a series of systematic approaches for multi-level modelling and optimisation in EIPs. The novelties of this work include, (1) building a four-level modelling framework (from unit level to process level, plant level and industrial network level) for EIP research, (2) applying advanced mathematical modelling methods to describe each level operation, (3) developing efficient methodologies for solving optimisation problems at different EIP levels, (4) considering symbiotic relations amongst the three networks (material, water and energy networks) at the top EIP level with the boundary conditions of economic, social and legal requirements. For methodology demonstration, two cases at process level and industrial network level respectively are tested and solved with the developed modelling and optimisation strategies. Finally, the challenges and applications in future ELF research are also discussed, including data collection, the extension of the current networks to EIPs, and the feasibility of the proposed methodologies for complex EIP problems. The extended EIPs include the combination of material exchanges, energy systems and waste-water treatment networks. The aspects considered for future industrial ecology are carbon emission, by-product reuse, water consumption, and energy consumption. The main object of this paper is to explain the detailed model construction process and the development of optimisation approaches for a complex ELF system. In future work, this system is expected to share services, utility, and product resources amongst industrial plants to add value, reduce costs, improve environment, and consequently achieve sustainable development in a symbiosis community.

Abstract: This study designs a circulating inclined fluidized bed (CIFB) dehumidification system with the goal of high dehumidification performance and continuous operation by circulating desiccant particles without a motor. The system includes two fluidized beds that use process air to make desiccant particles fly, one funnel in each fluidized bed to catch the falling desiccant particles, and one connecting pipe under each funnel to transport the desiccant particles to another fluidized bed. The inclined fluidized beds, compared to the erect fluidized beds, have a lower pressure drop and abetter circulating effect, and the vertical connecting pipes maximize the transport rate of the particles and avoid blockage. Both designs make the CIFB system operate with high efficiency. Under the same operation status, the CIFB system, compared to the circulating erect fluidized bed system (CEFB), increases the increment of the packed bed (PB) system's dehumidification performance from 21.1% to 27.2% and magnifies the decrement of the PB system's pressure drop from 64.2% to 71.4%. The energy factor can reach up to 0.6 kg/kW per hr. The polymer desiccant polyacrylic acid has a viscoelastic feature and, when mixed with silica gel at a ratio of 3:7, can solve the dust problem of the fluidized beds. This low power consumption, high dehumidification ability, and dust free CIFB system has a great potential for residential air-conditioning systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The effect of the clamping pressure and the relative humidity on gas crossover is studied in this research. It is central to this paper that the effect of the operating parameters on the hydrogen crossover is analyzed for various current densities. The performance and the hydrogen crossover rate are measured simultaneously according to the different clamping pressure and relative humidity at each current density. The effect of both parameters on the system performance coincides well with other researches. The higher hydrogen concentration and crossover rate are detected for the elevated clamping pressure and relative humidity. Interesting result from this experiment is that almost even hydrogen concentration at the cathode is detected with respect to current densities for all cases. When transforming this data with the flow rate of air supplied, the hydrogen crossover rate is gradually increased as the current density is increased. It means that the mass of the hydrogen gas transferred is increased for higher current densities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this context, we report a novel one-pot synthesis of S@Polypyrrole core-shell spheres as the cathode material in lithium-sulfur battery, designed by polypyrrole (PPy) wrapping on the formed nano-sulfur via the facile wet chemical strategy. The in-situ polymerized PPy layer in this special structure is helpful to inhibit aggregation of sulfur particles with small size, the polysulfide dissolution and shuttling, and offer fast and efficient transport of electron/lithium ion within the electrode. Besides, the flexible PPy layer effectively accommodates the volume expansion. PPy with partial PO43- doping was also employed to improve cycling stability and C-rate performance of S@PPy composite by exchanging a with PO43-. Thus, the sulfur electrode with a high sulfur loading of 80% delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1142 mA h g(-1) and maintained a high capacity of 805 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. The corresponding capacity retention over 100 cycles was about 65%, with a limited decay of 0.3% per cycle. Even at a high current density of 1.5 C, the composite still exhibited a high discharge capacity of about 700 mA h g(-1). This results mean that the designed electrode can achieve a high practical specific energy density of more than 400 W h/kg, far beyond the commercial LiCoO2 batteries. Due to low cost, facile large-scale synthesis and superior electrochemical performance of S@PPy cathode with high sulfur loading, this work will provide a very promising method to further promote the Li-S batteries in the practical application of portable electronic devices, electric devices and energy storage system.

Abstract: Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is one of the most important processes in energy conversion and conservation such as in fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water-splitting devices. In this work, hierarchical porous N-doped graphene foams (HPGFs) functioned by a transition metal were successfully prepared using silica nanoparticles as a template. The introduction of a silica template and a transition metal provided HPGFs with a large specific surface area (918.7 m(2)/g) and abundant active sites. By selecting proper nitrogen precursors (cyanamide, melamine and urea), HPGFs exhibit excellent ORR catalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH with a high onset potential of 1.03 V and a limiting current of similar to 9 mA cm(-2), even better than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts at the same loading. Surprisingly, they show superior catalytic activity in an acidic medium with an onset potential of 0.81 V and a limiting current reaching 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the catalysts deliver good methanol tolerance and excellent long term durability after 5000 cycles of accelerated durability tests in both acidic and alkaline solutions, much better than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Very inspiring cell performance was observed with HPGF-1 catalyst upon integration into a zinc-air battery. Our study presents an experimental realization of rationally designing a highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst for electrochemical energy conversion systems particular to fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

Abstract: A series of novel and high-performing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts based on N/S-Me-doped (Me = Fe, Co, Ni) hierarchical porous carbons (N/S-Fe-HPC, N/S-Co-HPC and N/S-Ni-HPC) have been synthesized by a green and cost-effective method combining a simple silicate templated two-step graphitization of the impregnated carbon. After optimization of the porous structures and enlargement of the BET specific surface area by combining the silicate template and the Fe-, Co- and Ni-metal sulfates, the obtained N/S-Me-HPC catalysts exhibit excellent ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic media. In particular, N/S-Fe-HPC shows superior catalytic ORR performance compared to commercially available 20% Pt/C in alkaline medium reflected by the onset potential of 0.98 V and half-wave potential of 0.86 V, and comparable ORR activity in acidic media with the onset potential of 0.84 V and half-wave potential of 0.73 V. In addition, the N/S-Fe-HPC catalyst exhibits excellent long-term stability and a high methanol tolerance. The outstanding electrochemical performance of such catalysts thereby makes it possible for these non-noble catalysts to replace the commercial Pt/C in both fuel cell and metal-air battery applications.

Abstract: To cope with global warming, China has promulgated Enhanced actions on climate change: China's intended nationally determined contributions and will start the national carbon emissions trading market in 2017. Carbon emissions are distributed by the form of free quota and paid quota. However, few literatures have focused on how the economy and the environment would be changed by the change of free quota ratio. This paper establishes the 10 scenarios of different free quota ratio of carbon emissions rights and uses a dynamic, recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the carbon emissions trading market, to explore the relationship between free quota ratio and carbon trading price, and the impact of carbon trading scheme (ETS) on China's economy and environment. The results show that free quota ratio will not have a direct impact on gross domestic product (GDP) and other economic and environment indicators but carbon trading prices. The prices and the rate of free payment in the current pilot cities in China are still relatively conservative. It is possible to reach emission peak, 8.21 billion ton, in 2025 and accumulative CO2 reduction from 2017 to 2030 is 20.02 billion tons, or 59.60% of 2010 world's total CO2 emission. Cement, minerals, electricity and nonferrous metals under ETS will suffer great losses, so subsidy should be considered. Finally, we suggested that China should reduce the total carbon rights to increase the carbon price in 2017, and gradually reducing the proportion of free quota, from 90% in 2017 to 50% or less in 2030, by which the peak year of CO2 emission can meet in 2025. We also suggest that ETS is an effective strategy for CO2 reduction and the ratio should be gradually reduced in ETS to prevent violent fluctuation of carbon price in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The Chinese government identifies the renewable energy sector as a core strategic industry. Since 2009, China is the country with the highest annual investment into renewable energy, predominantly wind and solar photovoltaic projects. Due to rapid cost decline, industrial transformation, and policy support, the relative share of solar project investment is growing at a disproportionate rate. However, there is no systematic analysis of how efficiently these investments are allocated; or the underlying risk and return characteristics. Based on structured interviews with 69 market participants, this paper identifies severe cash-flow uncertainty, unreliable supply chains and a weak regulatory environment as most prominent risk factors that currently inhibit sustainable and demand-driven market development. Expanding on the interview results, this study discusses the origins of risk in China and how the institutional response to investment risk currently fails to address the core problems.

Abstract: Selective catalyst reduction (SCR) has been demonstrated as an efficient technology for the abatement of NOx emissions from diesel vehicles. However, it has become more and more challenging to meet stringent vehicle emissions standards due to fluctuating exhaust temperatures and high temperature exhaust gas caused by the regeneration of diesel particulate filters (DPFs). Therefore, a novel design for exhaust temperature control, based on controllable heat pipes and latent thermal energy storage, is proposed to realize more durable and efficient NOx emissions reduction. By adopting the concept of peak load shifting, the excess thermal energy of exhaust gas can be stored in phase change materials (PCMs), and released to maintain a relatively stable temperature if a temperature difference exists between the working fluid inside the heat pipes and the PCMs. In order to investigate the feasibility of our novel design, theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are combined to fully describe the dynamic behavior of temperature control. The exhaust temperature effects on NOx emissions reduction is evaluated by an accurate SCR model which is validated by the relevant experiments. The results indicate that the fluctuation of exhaust temperature is limited to 30 K after finishing the preheating process during the European transient cycle (ETC) test with an objective temperature of 563 K. However, stable exhaust temperatures require an additional 400 s for the PCMs to be prepared for an adequate supply of thermal energy. Compared with bare emissions, the improved elimination efficiency of NOx emissions can reach more than 90% in ETC testing, which satisfies the severe emission regulations with more sustainable and environmentally friendly practical application.

Abstract: Community energy storage (CES) is becoming an attractive technological option to facilitate the use of distributed renewable energy generation, manage demand loads and decarbonise the residential sector. There is strong interest in understanding the techno-economic benefits of using CES systems, which energy storage technology is more suitable and the optimum CES size. In this study, the performance including equivalent full cycles and round trip efficiency of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries performing demand load shifting are quantified as a function of the size of the community using simulation-based optimisation. Two different retail tariffs are compared: a time-of-use tariff (Economy 7) and a real-time-pricing tariff including four periods "based on the electricity prices on the wholesale market. Additionally, the economic benefits are quantified when projected to two different years: 2020 and a hypothetical zero carbon year.
The findings indicate that the optimum PbA capacity was approximately twice the optimum Li-ion capacity in the case of the real-time-pricing tariff and around 1.6 times for Economy 7 for any community size except a single home. The levelised cost followed a negative logarithmic trend while the internal rate of return followed a positive logarithmic trend as a function of the size of the community. PbA technology reduced the levelised cost down to 0.14/kW h when projected to the year 2020 for the retail tariff Economy 7. CES systems were sized according to the demand load and this approximated the performance of PbA and Li-ion batteries, the capital cost per unit energy storage (kW h) of the latter assumed to be the double.

Abstract: This work addresses the potential for waste energy recovery from exhaust gases in a diesel passenger car mounted in a chassis dynamometer. The New European Driving Cycle was followed, while recording relevant operating variables. Tests were performed under three temperature conditions, and exergy analysis was included to find the potential of exhaust gases to produce useful work at six points in the exhaust system. Results include mean temperature at each point, as well as the energy quality index, which was lower than 33%, meaning that less than one-third of the energy of exhaust gases can be converted into useful work in a recovery system. In general, the highest exergy losses were found in the muffler. Although the greatest recovery potential corresponds to the highest temperature of gases, environmental regulations for vehicles restrict waste energy recovery to be performed downstream after-treatment devices, which, in the present work, was the outlet of the diesel particle filter. Temperature of gases at this location varied in the range 115-320 degrees C, and potential fuel saving varied between 8% and 19% for the complete driving cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: To achieve a maximum heat transfer capability and a minimum pumping power for corrugated undulated (CU) heat transfer surfaces, a multi-objectives genetic algorithm was used to obtain the optimal values of the pitch and height of undulated plate (U-plate) and the height of the corrugated plate (C-plate) by using the Pareto optimal strategy. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, support vector machine (SVM) and the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm were combined together and used for the optimization process. Three dimensional numerical simulations were performed to investigate the effect of geometrical parameters on the thermos-hydraulic performance of CU heat transfer surface. The maximum deviation for the Nusselt number and friction factor between the simulation and the published data were 8.81% and 13.1% respectively when the Reynolds number ranged from 1500 to 10,000. The flow and temperature profile in the CU passage were analyzed. Intensive secondary flows occurred in the C-plate channel and the U-plate channel due to the drag effect between the main flows in the two channels. And the effects of Reynolds number and structure parameters were studied. The change of U-plate height rather than that of U-plate pitch would have a dominant effect on the disturbance influence of U-plate. Besides, two SVM models were trained by the CFD results to predict the Nusselt number and friction factor of flow in CU passages with different geometrical and operational parameters. The comparison between the SVM predictions and the CFD results showed that the SVM models could predict the numerical data with a good accuracy. In addition, two evaluation criteria were proposed from perspectives of the manufacturers and the users, respectively. Finally, a set of optimized solutions were obtained. The optimal values of pumping power ratio and heat transfer area ratio between different CU passages and the standard one were in the range of 0.8-3.1 and 0.5-1.2, respectively. The manufacturers and the users can select the best design points according to their considerations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study aims to define a cost-optimal solution based on demand response (DR) actions for a thermal energy storage system with a ground source heat pump in detached residential houses in a cold climate. This study finds out the minimum life cycle cost (LCC) of thermal energy storage over the period of 20 years by observing different temperature set points (55-95 degrees C) and sizes (0.3-1.5 m(3)) of a hot water storage tank with developed DR control algorithms. Three different control algorithms were studied: (A) a momentary DR control algorithm based on real-time hourly electricity price (HEP), (B) a backwards-looking DR control algorithm based on previous HEPs and (C) a predictive DR control algorithm based on future HEPs. This research was carried out with the validated dynamic building simulation tool IDA Indoor Climate and Energy. The results show that by using the predictive DR control algorithm the maximum annual savings in total delivered energy and cost are about 12% and 10%, respectively. The minimum LCC can be achieved by the smallest studied storage tank size of 0.3 m(3) with 60 degrees C as the temperature set point, but the effect of storage tank size on LCC is relatively small.

Abstract: This work develops guidance and tools to understand the performance, improve the design, and simplify the evaluation of naturally ventilated low-rise commercial buildings in warm and hot climates. We conducted 50,000 detailed energy and airflow simulations in 427 locations across Brazil, varying 55 parameters representing building morphology, fenestration, construction properties, internal gains, operating times, wind modifiers, flowpaths, window control, and soil traits. Comfort performance was quantified by the average annual fraction of occupied hours that exceeded the upper limit of an adaptive comfort zone, and investigated with sensitivity analysis and machine learning methods. Results indicated that, after climate, building size (both footprint area and number of stories) and internal gains were most influential and were positively associated with discomfort. Adding air movement with ceiling fans and providing for night ventilation both proved highly effective comfort interventions. Except for roof solar absorptance, opaque envelope changes, including increasing insulation or thermal mass, had only marginal impacts. A support vector regression metamodel, requiring 29 easily obtainable inputs plus a weather file, was fit to the simulation results and successfully validated (R-2 = 0.97). The metamodel was developed as a simplified compliance path for naturally ventilated buildings to enhance Brazil's commercial building performance labeling program, which, because it currently provides such a path only for air conditioned buildings, may discouraging decision-makers from considering even more efficient passive solutions. We use a case study to show how the metamodel, which we will distribute publicly, can also serve as a design tool, and demonstrate that modifying a small set of parameters can drastically improve thermal performance and achieve sustainable comfort in hot and warm climates.

Abstract: In this paper, we present energy-aware production planning using a two-dimensional "Energy-Perform ance" measure. With this measure, the production plan explicitly takes into account machine-level requirements, process control strategies, product types and demand patterns. The "Energy-Performanc e" measure is developed based on an existing concept, namely, "Specific Energy" at machine level. It is further expanded to an "Energy-Performance" profile for a production line. A production planning problem is formulated as a stochastic MILP with risk-averse constraints to account for manufacturer's risk averseness. The objective is to attain an optimal production plan that minimizes the total loss distribution subject to system throughput targets, probabilistic risk constraints and constraints imposed by the underlying "Energy-Performance" pattern. Electricity price and demand per unit time are assumed to be stochastic. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of loss distributions is used as the manufacturer's risk measure. Both single-machine and production lines are studied for different profiles and electricity pricing schemes. It is shown that the shape of "Energy-Performance" profile can change optimal plans.

Abstract: According to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, several mitigation strategies for the industrial sector are needed to achieve global mitigation scenarios that include: carbon intensity, energy intensity, material intensity, product-service intensity, and the global demand for services. Under this contextual, this paper presents a decomposition analysis of energy related carbon dioxide emissions from the steel produced to manufacture new automobiles. The novelty of this analysis is that it links energy related carbon dioxide emissions from service demand to material production, breaking changes in demand for services measured as passenger-kilometers driven by new automobiles either for replacement or for new demand; steel content in new automobiles (material intensity); production process (structure); final energy intensity; and carbon intensity. The study boundaries include direct and indirect steel imports (contained in automobile imports). This analysis is applied to the Mexican case from 1993 to 2011. The results show that an increase in the pass-km followed by the growth in the vehicle size is the most important factors influencing carbon dioxide emissions. The rise of fuels with higher carbon contents in countries that export vehicles and steel to Mexico is also an important variable that had increased emissions. A projection for CO2 emissions for 2025 was developed to understand the significance of the different variables in the reduction of CO2 emissions related to the steel production for new automobiles.

Abstract: Operated under a cyclic redox mode in the presence of an oxygen carrier, the chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) process has the potential to effectively combust solid carbonaceous fuels while capturing CO2. The overall process is enabled by an oxygen carrier that is capable of reversibly exchanging its lattice oxygen (O2-) with gaseous oxygen (O-2) under varying external oxygen partial pressures (PO2). As such, further improvements of the CLOU process relies largely on the identification of oxygen carriers with higher activity, better recyclability, and improved resistance toward physical degradation. This article investigates dopant effects on CLOU properties of oxygen carriers with a CaMnO3 parent structure. Various B-site compatible metal cations including Fe, Ni, Co, V, and Al are incorporated into the perovskite. While CaMnO3 suffers from stability issues resulting from irreversible transitions to spinel (CaMn2O4) and Ruddlesden-Popper (Ca2MnO4) structures under typical CLOU redox conditions, a number of B-site doped perovskites exhibited promising phase stability and redox activity. Of the oxygen carriers investigated, Fe-doped CaMnO3 exhibits the most promising CLOU properties while showing high compatibility with the CaMnO3 parent structure. In terms of redox performance, CaMn1-xFexO3-delta exhibit notable redox activity at temperatures as low as 600 degrees C. No deactivation was observed over 100 redox cycles. The doped perovskite structure was also significantly more stable than undoped CaMnO3, showing no signs of decomposition at 1200 degrees C. When operated under identical conditions, the Fe-doped oxygen carrier is obseived to achieve significantly higher conversion of Pittsburgh #8 coal char compared to undoped CaMnO3 oxygen carrier, when operated at 850 degrees C.

Abstract: A novel intra-cycle waste heat recovery (ICWHR) methodology, applied to an internal combustion engine is presented in this study. Through a split type thermodynamic cycle design, quasi-isothermal compression of the charge air and isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture can be performed separately in two chambers. Within such a design, the exhaust heat can be recovered to the intake air flow between the compression chamber and combustion chamber. Consequently, the recovered energy can be re-utilized in the combustor directly, and an intra-cycle waste heat recovery process can be achieved. To investigate the fundamental aspects of this new methodology, a comparative study between the conventional Rankine based WHR and the new ICWHR was undertaken. Both theoretical and numerical analysis were applied to evaluate the performance characteristics of these two technologies. The ICWHR cycle differs from the Rankine cycle in that an energy conversion subsystem is not necessary since the recovered energy is sent back to the combustion chamber directly, and then the system efficiency is improved significantly. Furthermore, the theoretical results indicate that the full cycle efficiency of ICWHR system is determined by the regeneration effectiveness, the compression ratio and the fuel equivalence ratio, then the limitations of Rankine cycle, such as working fluid selection and system parameter calibration can be avoided mechanically. Finally, through a one dimensional system model, analysis of optimal operation range, system efficiency and the heat transfer behaviours of ICWHR system are discussed in this paper and comparisons made with a Rankine cycle WHR system.

Abstract: To study the effect of salt concentration of brine injection on hydrate dissociation, hydrate dissociation experiments induced by depressurization in conjunction with warm brine stimulation have been carried out in a Cubic Hydrate Simulator (CHS). The dual horizontal wells were set as the well configuration. The results indicate that the salinity in the reservoir decreases continuously during the depressurizing stage under the mixture of fresh water from hydrate dissociation. However, the salinity increases overtime during the constant-pressure stage (the injection stage) by the mass transfer with the injected brine. The gas production rate and heat-transfer rate for pure water injection are lower than those for brine injection. In addition, raising the injected salinity can enhance the rates of heat transfer and gas production when the salinity is lower than 10.0%. However, the promotion effect of brine injection on hydrate dissociation is limited when the injected salinity is beyond 10.0%. This is because the specific heat of the brine declines with the increase of the salinity, which causes the decrease of heat injection rate. The water production rate equals to the water injection rate in the process of brine injection. The energy analysis and the evaluation of energy ratio indicate that the optimal injected salinity in this work is 10.0%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a novel piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) to harness the great amount of energy wasted by the vehicles on public roadways was described. The PEH is designed to convert the deformation energy induced by moving vehicle from pavement into electrical energy. The prototype harvester consists of PZT piezoceramic disks sealed in a protective package is developed. Six prototype PEHs were fabricated and installed in real pavement to evaluate the feasibility of this application. The electric productivity of the installed harvesters was evaluated by measuring the output voltage and current generated under real traffic. Instant and average power outputs are calculated from the measured waveforms of output voltage and current. The analysis of the testing results shows that the electrical productivity of the energy harvesters are highly relevant to the axle configuration and magnitude of passing vehicles.

Abstract: This paper aims to present a novel smart grid adaptive energy conservation and optimization engine for smart distribution networks. The optimization engine presented in this paper tries to minimize distribution network loss, improve voltage profile of the system and minimize the operating cost of reactive power injection by switchable shunt Capacitor Banks using Advanced Metering Infrastructure data. Moreover, it performs Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) and minimizes transformer loss. To accurately weight the optimization engine objective function sub-parts, Fuzzification technique is employed in this paper. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied as Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) algorithm. Substantial benefits of the proposed energy conservation and optimization engine include but not limited to: adequate accuracy and speed, comprehensive objective function, capability of using AMI data as inputs, and ability to determine weighting factors according to the cost of each objective sub-part. To precisely test the applicability of proposed engine, 33-node distribution feeder is used as case study. The result analysis shows that the proposed approach could lead distribution grids to achieve higher levels of optimization and efficiency compared with conventional techniques.

Abstract: The 'Energy Performance of Buildings Directive' Recast (i.e., 2010/31/EU) establishes that building energy retrofit should pursue "cost-optimal levels". However, a reliable and rigorous cost-optimal analysis is an arduous and computationally-expensive issue, especially for complex buildings such as hospitals. The paper tackles this issue by providing a novel methodology to identify robust cost-optimal energy retrofit solutions. Multi-stage and multi-objective (Pareto) optimization is performed with the aim of minimizing the computational burden required to achieve reliable outcomes. The methodology combines EnergyPlus and MATLAB (R) and includes two optimization stages, preceded by a preliminary energy investigation that performs Latin hypercube sampling and sensitivity analysis. The preliminary investigation and the first optimization stage, which runs a genetic algorithm, aim at detecting efficient energy retrofit measures (ERMs) to reduce thermal energy demand for space heating and cooling. In the second optimization stage, these ERMs are combined with further ERMs, addressed to improve the efficiency of energy systems and to exploit renewable energy sources. Investment cost, primary energy consumption and global cost related to the resulting retrofit packages are investigated by means of smart exhaustive sampling. Finally, the cost -optimal solution is identified both in presence of a limitless economic availability and of limited budgets. The methodology is applied to a hospital reference building (RB), which represents hospitals built in South Italy between 1991 and 2005. The RB is defined by using an original approach, as required by the complexity of the examined building category. The achieved cost-optimal retrofit packages imply a reduction of primary energy consumption up to 67.9 kW h/m(2) a (12.2%) and of global cost up to 29321(6 (24.5%) with a maximum investment of 1236 k(sic).

Abstract: Given the key role of industrial sectors in energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction in China, this paper evaluates the industrial CO2 emission efficiency, emission reduction potential and profits brought by emission reduction for the 30 provinces in China during 2005-2012. Moreover, the spatial clustering among those provinces is detected in terms of industrial CO2 emission efficiency. The results indicate that, first, the 30 provinces are not completely efficient regarding their industrial CO2 emission efficiency, and they can be categorized into three groups, i.e., the high, middle and low efficiency regions. Second, the northwest region has the hugest industrial CO2 emission reduction potential among the eight regions in China, which shows the biggest opportunity for CO2 emission reduction. Therefore, the central government should provide more policy support for this region. Finally, the industrial sectors of the 30 provinces exist significant spatial clustering in light of CO2 emission efficiency, which provides important implications for government to formulate regional industrial policies.

Abstract: In the present paper design, realization and testing of a novel small scale adsorption refrigerator prototype based on activated carbon/ethanol working pair is described. Firstly, experimental activity has been carried out for identification of the best performing activated carbon available on the market, through the evaluation of the achievable thermodynamic performance both under air conditioning and refrigeration conditions. Once identified the best performing activated carbon, the design of the adsorber was developed by experimental dynamic performance analysis, carried out by means of the Gravimetric-Large Temperature Jump (G-LTJ) apparatus available at CNR ITAE lab. Finally, the whole 0.5 kW refrigerator prototype was designed and built. First experimental results both under reference air conditioning and refrigeration cycles have been reported, to check the achievable performance. High Specific Cooling Powers (SCPs), 95 W/kg and 50 W/kg, for air conditioning and refrigeration respectively, were obtained, while the COP ranged between 0.09 and 0.11, thus showing an improvement of the current state of the art.

Abstract: Occupants interact with buildings in various ways via their presence (passive effects) and control actions (active effects). Therefore, understanding the influence of occupants is essential if we are to evaluate the performance of a building. In this paper, we model the mean profiles and variability of occupancy variables (presence and actions) separately. We will use a multi-variate Gaussian distribution to generate mean profiles of occupancy variables, while the variability will be represented by a multi-dimensional time series model, within a framework for a meta-analysis that synthesizes occupancy data gathered from a pool of buildings. We then discuss variants of occupancy models with respect to various outcomes of interest such as HVAC energy consumption and peak demand behavior via a sensitivity analysis. Results show that our approach is able to generate stochastic occupancy profiles, requiring minimum additional input from the energy modeler other than standard diversity profiles. Along with the meta analysis, we enable the generalization of previous research results and statistical inferences to choose occupancy variables for future buildings. The sensitivity analysis shows that for aggregated building energy consumption, occupant presence has a smaller impact compared to lighting and appliance usage. Specifically, being accumulatively 55% wrong with regard to presence, only translates to 2% error in aggregated cooling energy in July and 3.6% error in heating energy in January. Such a finding redirects focus to the accurate estimation of lighting and appliance usage for a better prediction of aggregated energy consumption. Furthermore, it proves that accurate knowledge of the mean profiles is sufficient, that is, stochastic occupancy models do not play a significant role in the prediction of aggregated consumption in a conventional office building where the interaction between the operation of building systems and the spatial and temporal variability of occupancy is weak. When it comes to peak demand behavior, occupancy variability should be taken into account, as static profiles are not able to produce adequate estimates of power duration probabilities close to the power peak.

Abstract: Vertical borehole heat exchangers are used to couple heat pumps to the ground, which serves as a source or sink of heat. These ground source heat pump systems heat and cool buildings efficiently with low maintenance costs. Many heat transfer models use the mean of the inlet and outlet circulating fluid temperatures as an average temperature along the entire borehole length. In this paper a weighting factor for the inlet and outlet temperatures has been developed that can be combined with 1D radial models in order to account for the variations in temperature with depth. The proposed method gives more accurate results than the mean temperature approximation without requiring computationally intensive 3D models. The method has been verified with measured data from thermal response tests on boreholes with single and double U-tubes, as well pipe-in-pipe (coaxial) boreholes. On the other hand, the usual mean temperature approximation sometimes leads to significant errors and unphysical temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The development and validation of a 2D analytical wind turbine wake model based on Jensen's wake model using Gaussian function is presented in this paper. The velocity deficit predicted by the newly developed Jensen-Gaussian wake model is compared with wind tunnel experimental measured data in literatures and results show that, the velocity deficit predicted by the model fits well with the measured data at different downwind distances of X=2.5D, X=5D, X=7.5D and X=10D. Considering the turbulence inside the turbine wake, a new turbulence model is developed and based on this, the Jensen Gaussian wake model was improved and validated. The 2D Jensen-Gaussian wake model is then applied in the wind turbine layout optimizing process within a wind farm based on the multiple populations genetic algorithm (MPGA). The performance of this newly 2D model in the optimization process is validated and compared with the results presented in some typical studies on the turbine layout optimization. The comparison is performed for 'constant wind speed of 12 m/s with variable wind directions'. Using the 2D Jensen-Gaussian wake model instead of Jensen's wake model in the MPGA turbine layout optimization program, both the total power generation and wind farm efficiency decreased. The wind farm efficiency drop to 77.83%, 78.47% and 81.84% from 96.83%, 96.34% and 96.23% for 38, 39 and 40 wind turbines, respectively which is in accordance with the literatures on the power losses caused by wake effect in large wind farm. The development and application of the 2D Jensen-Gaussian wake model means more theory significance and practical values in wind energy utilization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The paper presents a numerical study of a medium size model of industrial gas turbine combustor. The research was conducted using the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) approach with k-epsilon model and LES (Large Eddy Simulation) with WALE (Wall Adapting Local Eddy viscosity) subgrid model. The simulations were performed in cold and reacting flow conditions. In the latter case, the combustion process was modelled using a steady flamelet model with chemical mechanisms of Smooke with 16 species and 25 elementary reactions, and the GRI-2.11 with 49 species and 277 elementary reactions including NO chemistry. In the first part of the paper, the numerical results were validated against experimental data including velocity field, temperature and species concentrations. The velocity components predicted for the cold flow agree very well with measurements. In the case of the simulations of the reacting flow, some discrepancies were observed in both the temperature field and species concentrations. However, the main flame characteristics were captured correctly. It turned out that the chemical kinetics had a larger impact on the results than the turbulence model. In the second part of the paper, we modified the fuel and air injection method and analysed how the changes introduced affect the flame dynamics. It was shown that: (i) depending on the distribution of air, the velocity, temperature and species composition in the upper part of the combustion chamber can be significantly altered; (ii) more substantial changes can be achieved by shifting the fuel injection points; their location outside the main recirculation zone leads to a dangerous situation resulting in overheating of the walls; (iii) it turns out that substantial differences in the flame characteristics in the upper part of the combustion chamber vanish approaching the outlet plane and the resulting mixture compositions are very similar.

Abstract: Carbon trading scheme is easily subject to the shocks from vital information announcements or regulations modification due to its vulnerability as a man-made market. This paper investigates the impact of verified emissions announcements, which are released annually by the European Commission and span three phases (2006-2013), on carbon price returns and volatility in the European Union emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), by constructing econometric model with bilaterally modified dummy variables of high adaptability. The results show that on average, verified emissions announcements have significant impact on carbon expected returns but show a week effect on price volatility; the separate examination for each announcement event indicates heterogeneous ex-ante and ex-post impacts over time in different market contexts, but the ex-post impact dominates obviously. The verified emissions announcement remarkably causes shocks to the market and the risk of prior information leakage although it facilitates the price discovery. Meanwhile, there is an obvious asymmetry between ex-ante and ex-post impacts that is triggered by market characteristics, and it generally takes more than seven days to absorb the ex-post impacts due to the intrinsic characteristics of the EU ETS. These findings could provide reference for market traders and regulators to make robust allowance management strategy and system design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Demand Response (DR) applications along with strategically deployed solar photovoltaic (PV) and ice storage systems at the building level can help reduce building peak demand and energy consumption. Research shows that no work has been carried out to study the impact of integrated control of PV and ice storage on improving building operation and energy savings in demand responsive buildings. This can enable building operators to take advantage of different electricity prices and enable utilities to spread the demand over whole day. This research presents a model to study coordinated control of building end-use loads including cooling, lighting and plug loads, together with PV and ice storage integrated with packaged air conditioning (AC) units. This is used to study their impacts on peak demand and energy consumption in a simulated medium-sized office building located in Virginia/Maryland, U.S. area. Research findings provide an improved understanding of the contribution of DR, solar PV and ice storage systems towards reducing building peak electricity demand and energy consumption while being sensitive to occupant thermal and lighting needs.

Abstract: Standard monitoring within a gas-turbine based cogeneration system includes key flow rates, temperatures, pressures and turbine vibration. These standard measurements can be enhanced with continuous emissions monitoring to help pinpoint system problems. A combination of these measurements, a fast NOx prediction model and data reconciliation constitute an improved monitoring and diagnostic tool that can quantitatively predict the existence of turbine problems (for example, damaged combustor nozzles) even when standard turbine monitoring indicates no problems exist.

Abstract: The interest in self-consumption of electricity generated by rooftop photovoltaic systems has grown in recent years, fueled by decreasing levelized costs of electricity and feed-in tariffs as well as increasing end customer electricity prices in the residential sector. This also fostered research on grid-connected PV-battery storage systems, which are a promising technology to increase self-consumption. In this paper a mixed-integer linear optimization model of a PV-battery system that minimizes the total discounted operating and investment costs is developed. The model is employed to study the effect of the temporal resolution of electrical load and PV generation profiles on the rate of self-consumption and the optimal sizing of PV and PV-battery systems. In contrast to previous studies high resolution (10 s) measured input data for both PV generation and electrical load profiles is used for the analysis. The data was obtained by smart meter measurements in 25 different households in Germany. It is shown that the temporal resolution of load profiles is more critical for the accuracy of the determination of self-consumption rates than the resolution of the PV generation. For PV-systems without additional storage accurate results can be obtained by using 15 min solar irradiation data. The required accuracy for the electrical load profiles depends strongly on the load profile characteristics. While good results can be obtained with 60 s for all electrical load profiles, 15 min data can still be sufficient for load profiles that do not exhibit most of their electricity consumption at power levels above 2 kW. For PV-battery systems the influence of the temporal resolution on the rate of self-consumption becomes less distinct. Depending on the load profile, temporal resolutions between 5 min and 60 min yield good results. For optimal sizing of the PV power and the storage capacity a resolution of 60 min is found to be sufficient. For the sizing of the battery inverter power of the storage system, a finer temporal resolution of at least 300 s is necessary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study designed an efficient, easily implementable online optimal control strategy for three power-source hybrid electric powertrains. The energy improvement of optimal energy management and integrated optimal energy management/mode switch timing relative to the energy consumption in rule-based control was evaluated. First, a control-oriented vehicle model with seven subsystems was developed. For achieving rule-based control, the torque distribution among the engine, motor, and generator was designed according to performance maps of power sources. To conduct power allocation of three sources, two power-split ratios were obtained. Furthermore, for switching between three operation modes (hybrid, electric vehicle, and range extension modes), two hysteresis zones based on the required power and battery state-of-charge were used with four designed variables (boundaries). A global search method was used for the optimization. A cost function with a physical-constraint penalty was used to maximize the travel distance. A simulation performed using nested-structure for-loop programs showed that the mileage extension (energy improvement) for the optimal energy management and integrated optimal energy management/mode switch timing relative to the mileage in rule-based control for two driving cycles, NEDC and FFP-75, were [26.32%, 30.52%] and [17.22%, 20.68%], respectively. The improvements of CO2 reduction were [26.34%, 27.10%] and [23.47%, 24.12%], respectively, thus proving that this study significantly reduced energy consumption and pollutant emission by employing an easily designed control strategy. Online parameter tuning and implementation of optimal energy management in a real vehicle will be conducted in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, a novel high accurate sensorless dual-axis solar tracker controlled by the maximum power point tracking unit available in almost all photovoltaic systems is proposed. The maximum power point tracking controller continuously calculates the maximum output power of the photovoltaic module/panel/array, and uses the altitude and azimuth angles deviations to track the sun direction where the greatest value of the maximum output power is extracted. Unlike all other sensorless solar trackers, the proposed solar tracking system is a closed loop system which means it uses the actual direction of the sun at any time to track the sun direction, and this is the contribution of this work. The proposed solar tracker has the advantages of both sensor based and sensorless dual-axis solar trackers, but it does not have their disadvantages. Other sensorless solar trackers all are open loop, i.e., they use offline estimated data about the sun path in the sky obtained from solar map equations, so low exactness, cloudy sky, and requiring new data for new location are their problems. A photovoltaic system has been built, and it is experimentally verified that the proposed solar tracking system tracks the sun direction with the tracking error of 0.11 degrees which is less than the tracking errors of other both sensor based and sensorless solar trackers. An increase of 28.8-43.6% depending on the seasons in the energy efficiency is the main advantage of utilizing the proposed solar tracking system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Delft University of Technology, under its "Green Village" programme, has, an initiative to build a power plant (car parking lot) based on the fuel cells used in vehicles for motive power. It is a trigeneration system capable of producing electricity, heat, and hydrogen. It comprises three main zones: a hydrogen production zone, a parking zone, and a pump station zone. This study focuses mainly on the hydrogen production zone which assesses four different system designs in two different operation modes of the facility: Car as Power Plant (CaPP) mode, corresponding to the open period of the facility which uses fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) as energy and water producers while parked; and Pump mode, corresponding to the closed period which compresses the hydrogen and pumps to the vehicle's fuel tank. These system designs differ by the reforming technology: the existing catalytic reformer (CR) and a solid oxide fuel cell operating as reformer (SOFCR); and the option of integrating a carbon capture and storage (CCS).
Results reveal that the SOFCR unit significantly reduces the exergy destruction resulting in an improvement of efficiency over 20% in SOFCR-based system designs compared to CR-based system designs in both operation modes. It also mitigates the reduction in system efficiency by integration of a CCS unit, achieving a value of 2% whereas, in CR-based systems, is 7-8%. The SOFCR-based system running in Pump mode achieves a trigeneration efficiency of 60%. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, many countries have used aggressive policies such as feed-in tariffs and power purchase agreements to promote renewable energy. These policies have been very successful in several countries, initiating large changes in the structure of energy sectors, and conferring large environmental, economic, and social impacts. In this paper, we quantify these impacts over the period 2000-2010 for Portugal; a country that witnessed a substantial increase in renewable energy penetration rates, with the share of wind power in electricity production jumping from 0.4% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2010. We use a novel, hybrid energy-economic input-output model to compare the historical energy policy against a counterfactual scenario in which the surge in energy subsidies and concurrent expansion of renewable energies did not take place. We consider the impact of renewable energy policy stemming from three propagation modes-operational, investment, and opportunity costs-in both the energy sector and the rest of the economy. This is the first time such a comprehensive analysis has been undertaken. Our findings show that, in the period under consideration, the combined historical renewable energy policy and renewable energy developments yielded a clear reduction in emissions, in excess of 7.2 MtCO(2)eq, an increase in GDP of 1557 MC, and a creation of 160 thousand job-years. These estimates do not include opportunity costs from future FIT payments that projects built in this period may be entitled to. Therefore, this work will be of critical interest to RES-E and climate change policy makers, other scientists, and the public. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Nanotechnology has proved to be a promising candidate for thermal insulation of buildings. Nano aerogel and nano vacuum insulation panel (VIP) have been widely explored in the recent past, and their viability in buildings remains an ongoing research challenge. Even though a lot of works have been reported from around the globe, the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) region, particularly the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) - a leading building construction market in the world, has a wide scope of research in this area. This article presents a simulation study on the energy performance of a prototype office building in KSA, by replacing the conventional polystyrene insulation and double-glazing with nano VIP and nano aerogel (nanogel) glazing. The building model was built in Autodesk Revit (version 2015), and the energy simulation was performed by ECOTECT software (version 2011) by using the weather data of Dhahran. Considering polystyrene insulation in walls and roof and double-glazed windows as the base case, nano gel and nano VIP were employed individually, and in combinations of window, wall and roof. The results show that, compared to the base case, the nano VIP in walls and roof and nanogel glazing in windows could jointly save about 18% of annual energy consumption of the building, wherein the contribution of nanogel glazing alone is 16% for the setpoint temperature (ST) band of 19-27 degrees C. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the energy saving potential of the nanogel glazing is sensitive to the ST band. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: After 2020, all new buildings in Europe must be built as "nearly zero-energy buildings" (NZEB). For residential and certain commercial building types, significant experience in both research and practice is already available for such ambitious building standards. However, for industrial buildings, such as warehouses and production buildings, NZEB is still a new field. To date findings for residential and office buildings are often used to define standards for the entire building sector. However, industrial buildings have completely different thermal behavior due to their different building shapes, materials, interior temperatures, usage times and internal gains from processes and machines. Therefore, new concepts are required for nearly zero-energy industrial buildings.
In this research, such concepts were developed based on large parametric studies simulating more than 1800 different variations in a building simulation model coupled with a 3D transient finite difference ground model and an air-flow network simulation. To gain the required input data for the air infiltration simulation, extensive leakage measurements in a therefore built air-tightness test stand were conducted.
According to the EU directive stipulating the NZEB standard, NZEBs have to be cost-optimal. Thus, the focus of this work was on developing cost-optimal solutions to meet the NZEB standard. The results are building concepts for warehouses and production buildings that have 50-75% lower heat energy demand than current (2015) building standards in Germany. These heat energy savings are primarily achieved by increased air tightness, decreased thermal bridges, optimized floor slab insulation and solar optimization. Significantly increased insulation thicknesses are only cost-effective for industrial buildings with low internal gains but relatively high interior temperatures. Previous standards almost exclusively concentrated on increasing the thermal insulation, while the other parameters were often neglected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper studies the provision of secondary frequency control in electric power systems based on demand response (DR) activation on thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) and quantifies the computation resource constraints for the control of large TCL population. Since TCLs are fast responsive loads, they represent a suitable alternative to conventional sources for providing such control. An experimental investigation with domestic fridges representing the TCLs was conducted in an islanded power system to evaluate the secondary frequency control. The investigation quantifies the flexibility of household fridge performance in terms of response time and ramp-up rate, as well as the impact on fridge temperature and behaviour after the control period. The experimental results show that TCLs are fast responsive loads for DR activation, with the average control signal response time of 24 s and an equivalent ramping rate of 63% per minute, which could also comply with the requirements for primary frequency control.

Abstract: Parametric numerical analysis that explores the relation between the non-uniformity of air temperature distribution upstream of a heat exchanger and its thermal performance is performed. The obtained numerical results are employed toward the optimization of water-air heat exchanger thermal performance. Furthermore, the numerical results lay out the foundation to develop an innovative control approach for monitoring the airflow upstream of a cross-flow water-air heat exchanger that lead to the optimization of its thermal performance and energy consumption. Consequently, an in-house computational code is established to evaluate the aforementioned thermal performance based on known parameters; namely, distribution of upstream velocity and temperature of an air-liquid heat exchanger, the flow rate of heat exchanger liquid, in addition to the inlet liquid temperature. It was observed that non-uniformities in air temperature can, depending on the configuration, increase or decrease the thermal performance of a heat exchanger up to 5%. Additionally, controlling air temperature non-uniformities, the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission can be reduced by up to 0.97 kg (1.34 L) and 3.17 kg respectively for a vehicle running three hours per day.

Abstract: Reducing platinum usage and increasing its electrocatalytic durability are the key issues for the successful application of PEMFC. Fabricating platinum into specific morphologic structure and combining with the superior support is one of effective resolutions. In this paper, porous carbon nanofibers supported platinum nanowires (PtNW/PCNF) were synthesized via a simple and inexpensive template-free methodology and used oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. As a comparison, Pt nanowires supported on commercial carbon black (PtNW/Vulcan) was also prepared in the same condition. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the single-crystal Pt nanowires were successfully grown on the support. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the resultant catalysts along with the commercial one (JM20) were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and liner sweep voltammetry (ISV) with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). As a result, the PtNW/PCNF exhibited much enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability compared with the PtNW/Vulcan and JM20. The mass activity (at 0.80 V vs. RHE) of the PtNW/PCNF is about 1.7 and 2.3 times higher than that of PtNW/Vulcan and JM20, respectively. The remnant ECSA of the PtNW/PCNF after 1000 cycles was about 32% compared with the initial one whereas JM20 and PtNW/Vulcan retained only 10% and 23%. Furthermore, after ADT test for the three electrocatalysts, PtNW/PCNF lost 51 mV in half-wave potential, significantly better than the 150 mV half-wave potential loss for PtNW/Vulcan and almost complete loss of performance for commercial JM20. These results indicate controlled growth of Pt nanowires as a potential choice for conventional Pt nanoparticles and PCNFs a promising candidate as catalyst supports for the enhancement of PEMFC performance.

Abstract: The application of superadiabatic combustion (SAC) technology for hydrogen and syngas production has been a focus of intensive research in the recent past. A lot of researches have been reported on the conversion of various gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen sulfide and biomass into hydrogen or syngas, by using SAC. The porous medium combustion has been recognized as the most feasible technique to realize SAC, and few recent studies reported to have achieved SAC even without a porous medium (PM). This article compiles the works done so far in this area and suggests future directions. Following the general background, the history of hydrogen/syngas production by SAC is provided. Further developments are organized in the subsequent sections, which include all the published works on SAC-based hydrogen production from hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen sulfide and biomass. The works on hybrid PM-catalyst filtration combustion and numerical modeling of SAC-based hydrogen/syngas production are discussed in separate sections. Subsequently, the development of SAC reactor without PM is presented, followed by summary and conclusion. This review reveals that there is a wide scope for future research particularly on hybrid-filtration combustion, biomass gasification, hybrid PM-Catalyst reactors, SAC reactors without PM, and on development of efficient reformers for practical stationary and portable applications. Scope is also open for detailed characterizations, both experimental and numerical, with various PM materials and structures and with variety of fuels under realistic operating conditions.

Abstract: An accurate battery remaining useful life (RUL) estimation can facilitate the design of a reliable battery system as well as the safety and reliability of actual operation. A reasonable definition and an effective prediction algorithm are indispensable for the achievement of an accurate RUL estimation result. In this paper, the analysis of battery terminal voltage curves under different cycle numbers during charge process is utilized for RUL definition. Moreover, the relationship between RUL and charge curve is simulated by feed forward neural network (FFNN) for its simplicity and effectiveness. Considering the nonlinearity of lithium-ion charge curve, importance sampling (IS) is employed for FFNN input selection. Based on these results, an online approach using FFNN and IS is presented to estimate lithium-ion battery RUL in this paper. Experiments and numerical comparisons are conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show that the FFNN with IS is an accurate estimation method for actual operation.

Abstract: With the penetration of wind energy increasing, uncertainty has become a major challenge in power system dispatch. Hydro power can change rapidly and is regarded as one promising complementary energy resource to mitigate wind power fluctuation. Joint scheduling of hydro, thermal, and wind energy is attracting more and more attention nowadays. This paper proposes a distributionally robust hydro-thermal-wind economic dispatch (DR-HTW-ED) method to enhance the flexibility and reliability of power system operation. In contrast to the traditional stochastic optimization (SO) and adjustable robust optimization (ARO) method, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method describes the uncertain wind power output by all possible probability distribution functions (PDFs) with the same mean and variance recovered from the forecast data, and optimizes the expected operation cost in the worst distribution. Traditional DRO optimized the random parameter in entire space, which is sometimes contradict to the actual situation. In this paper, we restrict the wind power uncertainty in a bounded set, and derive an equivalent semi-definite programming (SDP) for the DR-HTW-ED using S-lemma. A delayed constraint generation algorithm is suggested to solve it in a tractable manner. The proposed DR-HTW-ED is compared with the existing ARO based hydro-thermal-wind economic dispatch (AR-HTW-ED). Their respective features are shown from the perspective of computational efficiency and conservativeness of dispatch strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy storage is the main challenge for a deep penetration of renewable energies into the grid to overcome their intrinsic variability. Thus, the commercial expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, at large scale depends crucially on the development of cheap, efficient and non-toxic energy storage systems enabling to supply more flexibility to the grid. The Ca-Looping (CaL) process, based upon the reversible carbonation/calcination of CaO, is one of the most promising technologies for thermochemical energy storage (TCES), which offers a high potential for the long-term storage of energy with relatively small storage volume. This manuscript explores the use of the CaL process to store Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). A CSP-CaL integration scheme is proposed mainly characterized by the use of a CO2 closed loop for the CaL cycle and power production, which provides heat decoupled from the solar source and temperatures well above the 550 degrees C limit that poses the use of molten salts currently used to store energy as sensible heat. The proposed CSP-CaL integration leads to high values of plant global efficiency (of around 45-46%) with a storage capacity that allows for long time gaps between load and discharge. Moreover, the use of environmentally benign, abundantly available and cheap raw materials such as natural limestone would mark a milestone on the road towards the industrial competitiveness of CSP.

Abstract: Implementation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in various applications can reduce material and energy requirements of products, resulting in energy savings. However, processes for the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are energy-intensive and can require extensive purification. In this study, we investigate the net energy benefits of three CNT-enabled technologies: multi-walled CNT (MWCNT) reinforced cement used as highway construction material, single-walled CNT (SWCNT) flash memory switches used in cell phones and CNT anodes and cathodes used in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. We explore the avoided or additional energy requirement in the manufacturing and use phases and estimate the life cycle net energy benefits for each application. Additional scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation of parameter uncertainties resulted in probability distributions of net energy benefits, indicating that net energy benefits are dependent on the application with confidence intervals straddling the breakeven line in some cases. Analysis of simulation results reveals that SWCNT switch flash memory and MWCNT Li-ion battery cathodes have statistically significant positive net energy benefits (alpha = 0.05) and SWCNT Li-ion battery anodes tend to have negative net energy benefits, while positive results for MWCNT-reinforced cement were significant only under an efficient CNT production scenario and a lower confidence level (alpha = 0.1).

Abstract: Air cathode microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were used in a cascade-system, to treat neat human urine as the fuel. Their long-term operation caused biodeterioration and biofouling of the cathodes. The cathodes were made from two graphite-painted layers, separated by a current collector. The initial performance of the MFCs was reaching average values of 105.5 +/- 32.2 mu W and current of 1164.5 +/- 120.2 mu A. After 3 months of operation the power performance decreased to 9.8 +/- 3.5 mu W, whilst current decreased to 461.2 +/- 137.5 mu A. Polarisation studies revealed significant transport losses accompanied by a biofilm formation on the cathodes. The alkaline lysis procedure was established to remove the biomass and chemical compounds adsorbed on the cathode's surface. As a result, the current increased from 378.6 +/- 108.3 mu A to 503.8 +/- 95.6 mu A. The additional step of replacing the outer layer of the cathode resulted in a further increase of current to 698.1 +/- 130 mu A. Similarly, the power performance of the MFCs was recovered to the original level reaching 105.3 +/- 16.3 mu W, which corresponds to 100% recovery. Monitoring bacterial cell number on the cathode's surface showed that biofilm formed during operation was successfully removed and composed mainly of dead bacterial cells after treatment. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the performance of deteriorating cathodes, has been successfully recovered for MFCs in-situ. Through this easy, fast and inexpensive procedure, designing multilayer cathodes may help enhance the range of operating conditions, if a biofilm forms on their surface. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract: The real-time battery monitoring often involves two contradicting requirements, i.e., high accurate modeling and low computational time. The main contribution of this study is developing a reduced order model to accurately simulate a lead-acid battery without any simplification which can be used for real-time monitoring, optimization and control purposes. In this paper, the governing equations of lead-acid battery including conservation of charge in solid and liquid phases and conservation of species are solved simultaneously during discharge, rest and charge processes using an efficient reduced order model based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). A comprehensive description of numerical difficulties of lead-acid battery transport equations is also discussed both mathematically and graphically. Effect of different operating conditions such as applied current density and the dependency of open circuit potential to the acid concentration on dynamic behavior of lead-acid cell are investigated to show the capability of present method. Moreover, an extensive analysis of eigenvalues, spatial patterns and temporal trends of lead-acid battery model is presented to comprehensively determine the basic dynamic characteristics. The obtained numerical results show that not only the POD-based ROM of lead-acid battery significantly decreases the computational time (speed-up factor of 15) but also there is an excellent agreement with the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel energy conversion method based on hydrogel material for self-powered sensor system applications is proposed, which can harvest energy from environment vibrations and supply power to sensors without any external power source. In this approach, hemispherical hydrogel arrays are positioned between two parallel-arranged conductive plates. The deformation of hydrogel arrays caused by ambient vibrations will result in non-equilibrium charge distribution in the conductive plates. The charge redistribution leads to electrons transfer, thereby converting mechanical vibration energy into electricity. Based on this energy conversion principle, a hydrogel-based energy harvester is fabricated and experimentally characterized. The fabricated device exhibits a superwide working bandwidth (0-80 Hz) and high reliability in power generation. Moreover, favorable adaptability of the tilt angle during installation is achieved. In the feasibility experiment, an LCD screen is operated to verify the potential of the hydrogel-based energy conversion method to self-powered sensor applications under vibration environment. Finally, a visualized self-powered force sensor is also demonstrated with the fabricated hydrogel-based energy harvester, which proves its great potential in various application fields.

Abstract: Researchers have begun developing simulation models as a cost-effective and expeditious means to explore and enhance our understanding of energy use behavior interventions. These models have provided unique insights into potential energy savings as a result of improved occupant behavior, but have not yet reached the capability to be used for predictive modeling purposes. Therefore, this paper attempts to build on previous modeling efforts and develops an empirically and conceptually grounded occupant behavior model for simulating normative feedback interventions based on literature from the social science and field data. This model is then used to conduct "what if" analyses testing three novel normative feedback intervention strategies and the effect of social network structure on intervention outcomes. The most successful and immediately applicable strategy consists of sending normative feedback only to individuals who use more energy than the group norm. This strategy resulted in a mean energy use reduction of 1.4 kW h per week per occupant, 2.2%, relative to traditional individual and normative feedback strategies used today. Lastly, it was found that the social network structure in which the interventions took place affected the absolute outcomes (i.e., net change) of the simulations but not the relative outcomes (i.e., strategy ranking).

Abstract: A solar thermal and heat pump combisystem is one of many system alternatives on the market for supplying domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH) in dwellings. In this study a reference solar thermal and air source heat pump combisystem was defined and modelled based on products available on the market. Based on the results of an extensive literature survey, several system variations were investigated to show the influence of heat pump cycle, thermal storage and system integration on the use of electricity for two houses in the climates of Zurich and Carcassonne. A singular economic cash flow analysis was carried out and the "additional investment limit" of each system variation was determined for a range of economic boundary conditions. This is the maximum extra investment cost for the system variant compared to the reference system that will give a break even result for a 10 year period. The results show that variations in electricity price affects the additional investment limit far more than the other economic parameters. Several of the variants show potential for achieving a cost benefit, but the potential varies a lot depending on load and climate boundary conditions. For all variants, the biggest difference in electricity savings was found for Zurich rather than in Carcassonne, which is explained by the larger heating load. However, in three cases the largest savings were for the SFH45 house despite the fact that the annual electricity use of the system is much lower than that for the SFH100 house, 3581 kW h/year compared to 8340 kW h/year. This was attributed to the fact that, in these cases, the operating level of the space heating circuit played a significant role, the SFH45 house being supplied with a 35/30 degrees C heating system while the SFH100 was supplied with a 55/45 degrees C heating system.

Abstract: The pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the reactant in fuel cells is called the pressure drop, which is related to the water amount inside the fuel cells. In recent years there have been many studies that used the pressure drop to detect the water content and diagnose water fault of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). To our knowledge, there has not been a systematic review of these studies. In this paper, the effect variables of pressure drop are reviewed firstly. Then estimations of the theoretical pressure drop are reviewed mainly based on the following four aspects: Bernoulli's equation, two-phase flow multiplier, Darcy's law and artificial intelligence. Afterward, the water fault diagnosis based on the pressure drop using the following six indicators are reviewed: indicator of direct pressure drop, its deviation, frequency, multiplier, the ratio of pressure drop to flow rate and the flooding degree. In addition, the strategies of water fault recovery are also summarized. Finally the merits, demerits and application prospects of pressure drop-based water fault diagnosis are presented.

Abstract: This paper concerns energy performance of ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) cushion roof integrated photovoltaic/thermal system (CIPV/T system). An experimental set-up composed of a three-layer ETFE cushion roof and amorphous silicon photovoltaic panels (a-Si PV) has been developed to investigate system energy performance. A series of tests from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. were successfully carried out within ambient temperature of around 9 degrees C and 39 degrees C in December 2014 and August 2015, respectively. On the whole, experimental results show that this system operated smoothly and steadily. In this study, typical weather conditions ranging from low solar irradiance in winter to strong solar irradiance in summer were selected to investigate system energy performance, including solar energy utilization and structural parameters of ETFE cushion roof.
Solar energy utilization could be evaluated by electricity and temperature which represent photovoltaic and thermal performance, respectively. It is found that average total and net electricity were 54.5 W h and 42.9 W h, indicating that this integration ensures the CIPVT system to be independent on external electricity. Meanwhile, measured air temperature inside ETFE cushion roof was 31.2-67.8 degrees C and it was 16.8-31.0 degrees C higher than ambient air temperature, showing an attractive potential in collecting thermal energy. Moreover, virtual system efficiency in terms of electricity and thermal energy was 25.5% based on average experimental results and an approximate method. This reasonable system efficiency is due to annealing effects of a-Si PV under high temperature conditions. For temperature distribution of ETFE cushion roof, temperatures on top-layer and bottom-layer ETFE foils were significantly lower than that on middle-layer ETFE foil, resulting in less temperature effects on structural behavior of ETFE cushion roof. This study could provide useful observations and explanations for evaluating energy performance of the CIPVT system concerning solar energy utilization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The first multi-day performance analysis of the feasibility of integrating a packed bed, indirectly irradiated solar gasification reactor with a downstream FT liquids production facility is reported. Two fuel-loading scenarios were assessed. In one, the residual unconverted fuel at the end of a day is reused, while in the second, the residual fuel is discarded. To estimate a full year time-series of operation, a simplified statistical model was developed from short-period simulations of the 1-D heat transfer, devolatilisation and gasification chemistry model of a 150 kW(th) packed bed reactor (based on the authors' earlier work). The short time-series cover a variety of solar conditions to represent seasonal, diurnal and cloud-induced solar transience. Also assessed was the influence of increasing the solar flux incident at the emitter plate of the packed bed reactor on syngas production. The combination of the annual time-series and daily model of syngas production was found to represent reasonably the seasonal transience in syngas production. It was then used to estimate the minimum syngas storage volume required to maintain a stable flow-rate and composition of syngas to a FT reactor over a full year of operation. This found that, for an assumed heliostat field collection area of 1000 m(2), at least 64 days of storage is required, under both the Residual Fuel Re-Use and Discard scenarios. This figure was not sensitive to the two solar sites assessed, Farmington, New Mexico or Tonopah Airport, Nevada. Increasing the heliostat field collection area from 1000 to 1500 m(2), led to an increase in the calculated daily rate of syngas throughput that could be maintained over a full year by 74%, to 5.9 kmol/day. Importantly, a larger heliostat field collection area was calculated to reduce the required storage capacity to approximately halve 35 days, which in absolute terms corresponds to 3.0 tons of syngas. Nevertheless, a requirement for this capacity of storage suggests that the use of the packed bed solar gasification reactor for FT liquids production is unlikely to be viable without substantial changes to the design and operation of the reactor and/or downstream processing plant.

Abstract: The pressurized hydrogasification of different rank coals was carried out using a laboratory two-stage reactor to investigate the influences of volatile matter hydrocracking on the formations of gaseous products (CO2, CO, CH4 and C2-C3) and liquid products (water and light aromatics). Experiments were conducted by way of comparison under the N-2 atmosphere. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance technique (C-13 NMR) and chemical titration analysis were used to semi-quantitatively or quantitatively determine the main functional groups in the coals. It was found that through the hydrocracking at 700 degrees C, the summed yields of CH4 and C2H6 from two lignite coals reached as high as 21.2-22.9% (daf. coal), higher than those even from two subbituminous coals. This result was associated with the abundance of longer alkyl groups in two lignite coals. Two lignite coals were the most enriched with carboxyl groups, which was proved to be the principal precursor of CO2. The hydrocracking at 700 degrees C allowed a distinct part of CO2 to convert into CO by the reversal gas water shift reaction, while the changes in the yields of H2O were indistinct. The hydrocracking at 700 degrees C was also favorable for the production of BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene) and naphthalene. The simple linear regression was used to assess the correlations of the yields of main gaseous products (CH4, C2H6, CO2 and CO) and liquid products (H2O and BTX) obtained under varying conditions to some relevant coal properties such as volatile matter content and total oxygen content as well as to some structural parameters such as aliphatic ratio and carboxyl group content.

Abstract: A methodology to model two types of random perturbation that affect the operation of electric power systems (EPS) are presented. The first uncertainty is wind power generation and is represented by a one-dimensional and by a multidimensional continuous stochastic process. The second one is power demand, and is modeled by using an hybrid structure based on harmonic regression and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process. The stochastic models are applied to a real Chilean case, using real data for parametric estimation and validation models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High temperature CO2 and H2O co-electrolysis is a promising way to produce syngas for the storage of electrical energy harvested from renewable energy sources. However, a significant portion of electricity input is consumed to overcome a large oxygen potential gradient between the electrodes in conventional solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). In this study, we present a novel and efficient syngas generator integrating carbon gasification and solid oxide co-electrolysis to improve the system efficiency. The feasibility of this new system is demonstrated in La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) electrolyte-supported SOECs. Both thermodynamic calculation and experimental results show that the potential barrier for co-electrolysis can be reduced by about 1 V and the electricity input can be saved by more than 90% upon integration of SOECs with carbon gasification. On the anode side, "CO shuttle" between the electrochemical reaction sites and solid carbon is realized through the Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 = 2CO). Simultaneous production of CO on the anode side and CO/H-2 on the cathode side generates syngas that can serve as fuel for power generation or feedstock for chemical plants. The integration of carbon gasification and SOECs provides a potential pathway for efficient utilization of electricity, coal/biomass, and CO2 to store electrical energy, produce clean fuel, and achieve a carbon neutral sustainable energy supply.

Abstract: This paper compares the vapour ejector and electric vacuum pump power consumptions with machine learning algorithms by using real process data and presents some novelty guideline for the selection of an appropriate condenser vacuum pump system of a steam turbine power plant. The machine learning algorithms are made by using the supervised machine learning methods such as artificial neural network model and local linear neuro-fuzzy models. The proposed non-linear models are designed by using a wide range of real process operation data sets from the CHP system in the thermal power plant. The novelty guideline for the selection of an appropriate condenser vacuum pumps system is expressed in the comparative analysis of the energy consumption and use of specific energy capable of work. Furthermore, the novelty is expressed in the economic efficiency analysis of the investment taking into consideration the operating costs of the vacuum pump systems and may serve as basic guidelines for the selection of an appropriate condenser vacuum pump system of a steam turbine.

Abstract: This paper details the development of a first-principles hybrid model capable of simulating transient thermal performances of a large scale reheating furnace. In particular, the new modelling approach combines the advantages of the classical zone method of radiation analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in a robust manner, and overcomes the difficulties of incorporating three-dimensional flow field within a zone method based model. The developed model has been validated with comprehensive experimental data collected during an instrumented bloom trial period that includes a long production delay. The results suggest that the model predictions were in good agreement with the actual measurements, and that the model was able to respond correctly with respect to the encountered production delay during the trial.

Abstract: Trustworthy savings calculations are critical to convincing investors in energy efficiency projects of the benefit and cost-effectiveness of such investments and their ability to replace or defer supply-side capital investments. However, today's methods for measurement and verification (M&V) of energy savings constitute a significant portion of the total costs of efficiency projects. They also require time-consuming manual data acquisition and often do not deliver results until years after the program period has ended. The rising availability of "smart" meters, combined with new analytical approaches to quantifying savings, has opened the door to conducting M&V more quickly and at lower cost, with comparable or improved accuracy. These meter- and software-based approaches, increasingly referred to as "M&V 2.0", are the subject of surging industry interest, particularly in the context of utility energy efficiency programs. Program administrators, evaluators, and regulators are asking how M&V 2.0 compares with more traditional methods, how proprietary software can be transparently performance tested, how these techniques can be integrated into the next generation of whole-building focused efficiency programs.
This paper expands recent analyses of public-domain whole-building M&V methods, focusing on more novel M&V 2.0 modeling approaches that are used in commercial technologies, as well as approaches that are documented in the literature, and/or developed by the academic building research community. We present a testing procedure and metrics to assess the performance of whole-building M&V methods. We then illustrate the test procedure by evaluating the accuracy of ten baseline energy use models, against measured data from a large dataset of 537 buildings. The results of this study show that the already available advanced interval data baseline models hold great promise for scaling the adoption of building measured savings calculations using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data. Median coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CV(RMSE)) was less than 25% for every model tested when twelve months of training data were used. With even six months of training data, median CV(RMSE) for daily energy total was under 25% for all models tested. These findings can be used to build confidence in model robustness, and the readiness of these approaches for industry uptake and adoption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Safety is the first priority in lithium ion (Li-ion) battery applications. A large portion of electrical and thermal hazards caused by Li-ion battery is associated with short circuit. In this paper, both external and internal short circuit tests are conducted. Li-ion batteries and battery packs of different capacities are used. The results indicate that external short circuit is worse for smaller size batteries due to their higher internal resistances, and this type of short can be well managed by assembling fuses. In internal short circuit tests, higher chance of failure is found on larger capacity batteries. A modified electrochemical-thermal model is proposed, which incorporates an additional heat source from nail site and proves to be successful in depicting temperature changes in batteries. Specifically, the model is able to estimate the occurrence and approximate start time of thermal runaway. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a hydrogel based thermal management system in suppressing thermal abuse and preventing thermal runaway propagation is verified through the external and internal short tests on batteries and battery packs.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a demonstrative Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) installation in Lugano where five BiPV modules with different integration solutions (fully integrated as Double Glaze Units (DGUs) and ventilated), different inclinations (30 degrees and 90 degrees) and different technologies (double junction amorphous silicon (a-Si/a-Si) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)) were investigated. The paper aims at evaluating the impact of the operating cell temperature on the modules' performance for different investigating cases. Two models were used to calculate the junctions' temperatures of the modules under operation: the simplified Nominal Operating Temperature (NOCT) model and the Equivalent Cell Temperature (ECT). The first was used in a simplified version and the second was used for all modules, regardless of its limitations for thin film technologies. The two models agree well and give satisfactory results regardless of the inclination, integration solution or technology. The difference between the NOCT and ECT calculated average daily temperatures of the modules was found to be less than 5-6 degrees C, with only one exception. As expected, fully integrated modules exhibit higher temperatures. In terms of performance, the integrated c-Si modules, regardless of their inclination, ranked lower - in terms of energy yield - than the integrated and ventilated a-Si/a-Si modules, for which the high operating temperatures proved to be beneficial. The inclination of 90 degrees was found to be ideal for Lugano for both c-Si and a-Si/a-Si modules. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A new hierarchical distributed architecture for control and scheduling of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) operations in multi-zone commercial buildings is proposed. Each zone has an associated Zone Module responsible for determining its cooling needs which are specified in terms of tokens. Tokens are a surrogate for the amount of chilled air supplied to each zone in a service interval. Token requests are computed by Zone Modules using occupancy forecasts, thermostat information, all available sensor data, and weather forecasts to capture the cooling energy necessary to meet user-specified temperature constraints. A Central Scheduler gathers token requests from all Zone Modules and allocates tokens to minimize the energy consumption of the chiller and fans. Zone Modules maintain and update local thermal models based on new measurements and recompute token requests in a model predictive control framework. This distributed control/scheduling approach is robust to varying environmental conditions and user constraints. It is scalable to realistic buildings with a large number of zones, and has low deployment cost. The proposed architecture can readily accommodate chiller efficiency through Coefficient of Performance (COP) specifications, as well as constraints on cooling air mass flow rates, fan capacities, duct pressure distribution, and damper opening constraints. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed approach suffers modest performance loss as compared with centralized non-linear scheduling strategies. These centralized strategies, however, are not scalable to buildings with 300+ zones and suffer prohibitive deployment costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ultrafine lauric-myristic acid binary eutectic/poly (meta-phenylene isophthalamide) (i.e. LA-MA/PMIA) phase change fibers are successfully fabricated by electrospinning. The effects of fatty acid content and applied voltage on fiber morphology are discussed. SEM analysis indicates that the composite fiber morphology varies with different experimental conditions. The flying fiber jets influenced by these parameters are particularly important for fabricating ultrafine fibers with desired morphology. The structure of the prepared fibers is also characterized by cross-section and TEM observations. Spatial networks with multi-channel reservoirs inside are considered to be effective in preventing the leakage and volatilization of fatty acids during thermal exchange processes. Besides, the heat capacities and pyrolysis properties of the composite fibers are also investigated. A first fronted and later returned melting temperature is observed. Experimental results show that the enthalpy of the composite fibers increases gradually with increasing fatty acid content. Although the prepared fibers suffer an obvious decline in heat capacity after water treatment, good thermal stability and heat storage performance still remain. By intelligent combination of fatty acids and PMIA with high thermal resistance, the prepared composite fibers are expected to have superior integrated performance and broad range of applications.

Abstract: Artificial turf can develop unusually high surface temperature on hot sunny days. Solar and terrestrial radiant energy regimes as key determinants of thermal performance deserve detailed investigation. This study evaluated six components of the radiant-energy environment of a natural turf (NT) and a contiguous artificial turf (AT) sports fields in Hong Kong: direct solar, reflected solar, net solar, sky thermal, ground thermal, and net thermal. Temperature was monitored at five positions: air at 150 cm, 50 cm and 15 cm height, turf surface, and substrate. The experiment included four replications, namely two summer sunny days, and two duplicated instrument sets at each turf site. The two sites reacted very differently to the same intense daily sum of solar radiation input of 23.70 MW m(-2) with 9 h of bright sunshine (>120 W m(-2)), and daily sum of sky thermal radiation input of 38.59 MW m(-2). The maximum direct solar radiation reached 976.1 W m(-2) at 1245 h. NT albedo of 0.23 vis-a-vis AT of merely 0.073, and higher moisture content and specific heat of NT materials, presented critical differences. The hydrophobic and generally dry plastic (polyethylene) pile-fibers and black rubber-granule infill materials have low specific heat. Intense incoming shortwave and longwave radiation absorbed readily by AT materials raised turf surface temperature to 70.2 degrees C and substrate 69.3 degrees C, in comparison with <40 degrees C at NT. A cascading warming effect was triggered, beginning with low albedo, high net solar irradiance and low material specific heat, leading to heated AT materials, high ground-thermal radiation, and heat flux to near-ground air by conduction and convection. The ephemeral rainfall cooling confirmed ineffective cooling by irrigation. Athletes are immersed in an anomalously intense and omnidirectional radiant-energy and sensible-heat ambience. The heat-stress health implications of AT for athletes in hot summer afternoon call for preventive-precautionary measures and re-assessment of NT-to-AT decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The liberalization of electricity markets gave rise to new patterns of futures prices and the need of models that could efficiently describe price dynamics grew exponentially, in order to improve decision making for all of the agents involved in energy issues. Although there are papers focused on modelling electricity as a flow commodity by using Heath et al. (1992) approach in order to price futures contracts, the literature is scarce on attempts to consider a seasonal volatility as input to models. In this paper, we propose a futures price model that allows looking into observed stylized facts in the electricity market, in particular stochastic price variability, and periodic behavior. We consider a seasonal path-dependent volatility for futures returns that are modelled in Heath et al. (1992) framework and we obtain the dynamics of futures prices. We use these series to price the underlying asset of a call option in a risk management perspective. We test the model on the German electricity market, and we find that it is accurate in futures and option value estimates. In addition, the obtained results and the proposed methodology can be useful as a starting point for risk management or portfolio optimization under uncertainty in the current context of energy markets.

Abstract: The prospects of incorporating a consumer side load-scheduling algorithm that works in conjunction with the unit commitment problem, which in turn coordinates with real-time load balancer, are discussed in this paper. An integrated framework for an autonomous microgrid with objectives of increasing stability, reliability and economy is proposed. From the microgrid operators' point of view, the load side scheduling helps reduce the stress on the system especially during peak hours thereby ensuring system stability and security. From the consumers' point of view, the dynamic electricity prices within a day, which are a reflection of this time varying stress on the system, encourage them to endorse such a scheme and reduce their bills incurred. The unit commitment problem is run a day in advance to determine generator outputs for the following day. Owing to unpredictable weather conditions, running unit commitment problem in advance does not guarantee planned real-time generation in the microgrid scenario. Such variability in forecasted generation must be handled in any microgrid, while accounting for load demand uncertainties. To address this issue a load side energy management system. and power balance scheme is proposed in this paper. The objective is to ascertain uninterrupted power to critical loads while managing other non-critical loads based on their priorities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The building sector is responsible for consuming approximately 40% of the final energy in Europe. However, more than 50% of this consumption can be reduced through energy-efficient measures. Our society is facing not only a severe and unprecedented environmental crisis but also an economic crisis of similar magnitude. In light of this, EU has developed legislation promoting the use of the Cost Optimal (CO) method in order to improve building energy efficiency, in which selection criteria is based on life cycle costs. Nevertheless, studies show that the implementation of energy-efficient solutions is far from ideal. Therefore, it is very important to analyse the reasons for this gap between theory and implementation as well as improve selection methods. This study aims to develop a methodology based on a cost-effectiveness analysis, which can be seen as an improvement to the CO method as it considers the investment willingness of stakeholders in the selection process of energy-efficient solutions. The method uses a simple graphical display in which the stakeholders' investment willingness is identified as the slope of a reference line, allowing easy selection between building solutions. This method will lead to the selection of more desired -from stakeholders' point of view-and more energy-efficient solutions than those selected through the CO method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of the combined steam and carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CSCRM) and side reactions was performed using total Gibbs free energy minimization. The effects of (CO2 + H2O)/CH4 ratio (0.9-2.9), CO2:H2O ratio (3:1-1:3), and temperature (500-1000 degrees C) on the equilibrium conversions, yields, coke yield, and H-2/CO ratio were investigated. A (CO2 + H2O)/CH4 ratio greater than 1.2, a CO2:H2O ratio of 1:2.1, and a temperature of at least 850 degrees C are preferable reaction conditions for the synthesis gas preparation in the gas to liquid process. Simulated conditions were applied to the CSCRM reaction and the experimental data were compared with the thermodynamic equilibrium results. The thermodynamic equilibrium results were mostly consistent with the experimental data, but the reverse water gas shift reaction rapidly occurred in the real chemical reaction and under excess oxidizing agent conditions. In addition, a long-term stability test (under simulated conditions) showed that the equilibrium conversion was maintained for 500 h and that the coke formation on the used catalyst was not observed.

Abstract: Enhanced carbon yields of jet fuel range alkanes were manufactured from co-feeding of lignocellulosic biomass with plastics. The consecutive processes proceeded via the co-feed catalytic microwave induced pyrolysis and hydrogenation process. In the co-feed catalytic microwave pyrolysis by using ZSM-5 as the catalyst, parent ZSM-5 fabricated by hydrothermal and calcined treatments contributed to the increase of surface area as well as the formation of more mesopores. Liquid organics with enhanced carbon yield (40.54%) were more principally lumped in the jet fuel range from the co-feed catalytic microwave pyrolysis performed at the catalytic temperature of 375 degrees C with the plastics to biomass ratio of 0.75. To manufacture home-made Raney Ni catalyst, the BET surface area, pore surface area, and pore volume of the home-made Raney Ni catalyst were considerably improved when the Ni-Al alloy was dissolved by the NaOH solution. In the hydrogenation process, we observed the three species of raw organic derived from the co-feed catalytic microwave pyrolysis were almost completely converted into saturated hydrocarbons under a low-severity condition. The improved carbon yield (38.51%) of hydrogenated organics regarding co-reactants of biomass and plastics predominantly match jet fuels. In the hydrogenated organics, over 90% selectivity toward alkanes with the carbon number in the jet fuel range was attained. In this respect, these hydrogenated organics with high amounts of renewable cycloalkanes can be potentially served as high-density jet fuels or additives for blending with civilian jet fuels.

Abstract: As improving energy efficiency in buildings has become a global issue today, many countries have adopted the operational rating system to evaluate the energy performance of a building based on the actual energy consumption. A rational and reasonable energy benchmark can be used in the operational rating system to evaluate the energy performance of a building accurately and effectively. This study aims to develop a new energy benchmark for improving the operational rating system of office buildings. Toward this end, this study used various data-mining techniques such as correlation analysis, decision tree (DT) analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on data from 1072 office buildings in South Korea, this study was conducted in three steps: (i) Step 1: establishment of the database; (ii) Step 2: development of the new energy benchmark; and (iii) Step 3: application of the new energy benchmark for improving the operational rating system. As a result, six types of energy benchmarks for office buildings were developed using DT analysis based on the gross floor area (GFA) and the building use ratio (BUR) of offices, and these new energy benchmarks were validated using ANOVA. To ensure the effectiveness of the new energy benchmark, it was applied to three operational rating systems for comparison: (i) the baseline system (the same energy benchmark is used for all office buildings); (ii) the conventional system (different energy benchmarks are used depending on the GFA, currently used in South Korea); and (iii) the proposed system (different energy benchmarks are used depending on the GFA and the BUR of offices). The results of this study showed that the baseline and conventional operational rating system can be improved by using the new energy benchmark of the office building proposed in this study.

Abstract: The electrification of the transportation sector through the introduction of electric vehicles (EV) has recently emerged as a remedy to environmental and economic concerns. For this reason, governments around the world have been offering subsidies and other benefits to drivers that replace their conventional vehicle with an EV in order to facilitate the commercialization of the latter. However, when compared to conventional vehicles, EVs present a key disadvantage that could hinder their widespread uptake: the time that is needed to charge an EV is in the range of hours. For this purpose, EV parking lots have been proposed in order to recharge vehicles at a higher rate. Recent studies indicate that vehicles remain parked for most of the day, implying that different operational strategies may be used in order to achieve operational or economic benefits from the perspective of the EV parking lot owner. The aim of this study is to derive representative load profiles of parking lots under different operational strategies. To perform so, the parameters of the EV fleet are modeled by estimating kernel distributions from available traffic data, while a time series transformation in combination with a clustering approach is used in order to obtain representative price patterns. The examined case studies demonstrate that by performing a reduced number of simulations regarding expected charging profiles of EV fleets, generalized results may be obtained using the proposed methodology.

Abstract: In the present study, a shell-and-tube latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) system is built using the eutectic molten salt as the phase change material (PCM) to make an efficient use of solar energy at medium-temperature of around 200.0 degrees C. The nickel foam is embedded in pure PCM (molten salt) to form composite PCM to improve the performance of the LHTES system through enhancing the effective thermal conductivity of the PCM. The performances of the systems using pure molten salt and composite PCM are investigated both experimentally and numerically. The oil is used as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and the influence of mass flow rate of the HTF on the thermal energy storage and retrieval is investigated in the experiments. The charging and discharging time durations, mean power and energy efficiency are estimated to evaluate the performance of the LHTES system. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model is developed based on the enthalpy-porosity model and two-temperature energy equations to investigate the thermal energy storage and retrieval of the LHTES system, and the detailed heat transfer characteristics during the melting/solidification of the PCM are understood. The results indicate that encapsulating molten salt with nickel foam to enhance the effective thermal conductivity of the PCM can improve the performance of the LHTES system. The information provided in the present study will be helpful for the LHTES system design, construction and application using molten salt for solar energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: With the improvement in people's living standards, emission reductions in consumption have become more significant. Accordingly, we defined the concept of the carbon capability of urban residents. We analyzed in depth the generation mechanism and evolution process of capability and further constructed an advanced five-dimensional model of carbon capability that embodies carbon values, carbon identification capability, carbon choice capability, carbon action capability, and carbon influence capability. We also proposed and gave a clear explanation of the connotations of the multi-layered levels of carbon capability, which include the threshold level, shaping level, effective level, maturity level, and leadership level. Based on our survey of 890 urban residents in Jiangsu Province, we statistically analyzed the current situation of urban residents' carbon capability and the differences in the social demographic variables. The results indicate that carbon identification capability and carbon influence capability are the main segments hindering carbon capability, the detection rate of inferior value is almost 50%, and there is an obvious "multi-layered gap" phenomenon that is evident from carbon values to carbon influence capability. With the upgrading of education that has occurred, carbon values, carbon identification capability, and carbon selection capability have all been strengthened gradually and the gap between carbon identification capability and carbon values is getting larger, but the gap between carbon action capability and carbon identification capability shows a U-shaped variation trend. With the increase in income levels, the gap between carbon action capability and carbon choice capability shows an inverted U-shaped variation trend. Except for carbon identification capability, the mean values of the capability of men are all lower than those of women as well as the gap between carbon action capability and carbon choice capability. This study provided a guide for policy from the viewpoint of achieving a sustainable improvement in urban residents' carbon capability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The expansion of the ethanol industry in Brazil faces two important challenges: to reduce total ethanol production costs and to limit the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of the ethanol produced. The objective of this study is to economically optimize the scale and location of ethanol production plants given the expected expansion of biomass supply regions. A linear optimization model is utilized to determine the optimal location and scale of sugarcane and eucalyptus industrial processing plants given the projected spatial distribution of the expansion of biomass production in the state of Goias between 2012 and 2030. Three expansion approaches evaluated the impact on ethanol production costs of expanding an existing industry in one time step (one-step), or multiple time steps (multi-step), or constructing a newly emerging ethanol industry in Goias (greenfield). In addition, the GHG emission intensity of the optimized ethanol supply chains are calculated. Under the three expansion approaches, the total ethanol production costs of sugarcane ethanol decrease from 894 US$/m(3) ethanol in 2015 to 752, 715, and 710 US$/m(3) ethanol in 2030 for the multi-step, one step and greenfield expansion respectively. For eucalyptus, ethanol production costs decrease from 635 US$/m(3) in 2015 to 560 and 543 US$/m(3) in 2030 for the multi-step and one-step approach. A general trend is the use of large scale industrial processing plants, especially towards 2030 due to increased biomass supply. We conclude that a system-wide optimization as a marginal impact on overall production costs. Utilizing all the predefined sugarcane and eucalyptus supply regions up to 2030, the results showed that on average the GHG emission intensity of sugarcane cultivation and processing is 80 kg CO2/m(3), while eucalyptus GHG emission intensity is 1290 kg CO2/m(3). This is due to the high proportion of forest land that is expected to be converted to eucalyptus plantations. Future optimization studies may address further economic or GHG emission improvement potential by optimizing the GHG emission intensity or perform a multi-objective optimization procedure.

Abstract: The electrification of the non-interconnected Greek islands is mainly based on Autonomous Power Stations (APS), which consume conventional fossil fuels at high energy production cost, while in most cases the contribution of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) (mainly wind) accounts for a small percentage of total electricity generation in these regions. On the basis of comparative analysis of alternative "development scenarios" for electricity generation, the main objective of the present study is to investigate the techno-economic viability of high Wind Energy (WE) share at local (island) level, in accordance to the energy and climate change commitments undertaken by the country, having as central feature large-scale penetration of RES. In this context, the possibilities of increasing WE contribution are examined through the use of an integrated theoretical model developed from first principles, assuming two main possible scenarios for covering future electrification needs of a medium-sized Greek island, i.e. Lesbos. The first scenario (S1) is based on autonomous development of the island keep using as main source for electricity generation oil products. The second scenario (S2) involves the interconnection (IC) of the island with the mainland grid for satisfying part of electricity demand by establishing two alternative solutions, i.e. S2a: without the contribution of local Thermal Power Plant (TPP) and S2b: TPP are maintained to ensure electrification of the island. Subsequently, the economic feasibility of the above options is investigated in terms of their Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), calculated for the time-period 20202045, including also a sensitivity analysis on worst/reference/best Cases for future electricity demand and production cost. According to the obtained results, IC of Lesbos island with the mainland grid presents considerable economic interest in comparison to autonomous development, with WE having a dominant and an essential role towards that direction.

Abstract: A 50 NL-H-2/h hydrogen production scale sulfur-iodine (SI) thermochemical process test facility to be operated under a pressurized environment has been constructed in Korea. This study focused on the catalyst-packed type HI thermal decomposer and bayonet type H2SO4 thermal decomposer, which are the key components for the 50 NL-H-2/h SI test facility. To sustain a closed loop operation of the SI process, the catalyst particles packed in the top of the H2SO4 thermal decomposer are protected from coming into contact with the inlet sulfuric acid aqueous solution, and the production molar ratio of oxygen discharged from the H2SO4 thermal decomposer to hydrogen discharged from the HI thermal decomposer always satisfies 0.5/1. Based on the design specifications and mass balance of the SI integrated process of 50 NL-H-2/h, numerical calculations for the two decomposers were done to evaluate their start-up and static behaviors. Based on the results of these calculations, it is predicted that the boiling interface of the sulfuric acid solution is located around 280 mm from the bottom of the electric furnace to heat the bayonet type H2SO4 thermal decomposer, which is far from the catalyst-packed region. It is also proposed that the proper operating temperature of the HI thermal decomposer to satisfy the hydrogen production rate of 50 NL-H-2/h and sustain the closed loop operation of the SI process is 587 degrees C.

Abstract: Oxy-fuel circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion combining the advantages of oxy-fuel combustion and CFB technology is one of the most promising technologies for capturing CO2. However, the emission of N2O in oxy-fuel CFB combustion can be high enough to raise some related environmental issues. This study investigated N2O emission in O-2/CO2 CFB combustion with a high oxygen concentration based on the experimental results using a the 0.1 MWth oxy-fuel CFB. This study focused on the operating parameters. It was found that increasing the combustion temperature and overall oxygen concentration can lead to lower N2O emission, while increasing the excess oxygen ratio can lead to higher N2O emission levels. Both gas staging and oxygen staging have slight adverse influences on controlling N2O owing to the higher oxygen concentration in the secondary gas. Finally, the excess oxygen ratio in the primary zone was determined in order to assess the actual effects of gas and oxygen staging on both N2O and NO emissions. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This work investigates different scenarios for electric vehicle (EV) deployment in China and explores the implications thereof with regard to energy portfolio, economics and the environment. Specifically, we investigate how to better deliver the value of EVs by improving designs in the power system and charging strategies, given expected developments by 2030 in both the power system and EV penetration levels.
The impact of EV charging is quantified by applying an integrated transportation-power system model on a set of scenarios which represent uncertainties in charging strategies. We find that deploying EVs essentially shifts the use of gasoline to coal-fired power generation in China, thus leading to more coal consumption and CO2 emissions of the power system. Economically, EVs outperform gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of average fueling costs. However, the impact of EVs in terms of CO2 emissions at the national level largely depends on the charging strategy. Specifically, controlled charging results in more CO2 emissions associated with EVs than uncontrolled charging, as it tends to feed EVs with electricity produced by cheap yet low-efficiency coal power plants located in regions where coal prices are low. Still, compared with uncontrolled charging, controlled charging shows absolute advantages in: (1) mitigating the peak load arising from EV charging; (2) facilitating RES generation; and (3) reducing generation costs and EV charging costs. Hence, in light of this trade-off of controlled charging with the goals of energy security, economic efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, policy interventions in the Chinese power system should opt for controlled charging strategies in order to best realize the benefits of EVs. Accordingly, this paper proposes that increasing the use of cleaner forms of electricity generation, such as RES power and gas power, and establishing energy efficiency and CO2 emission regulations in power dispatch are critical for China. Lastly, this work illustrates what the optimized charging profiles from the power system perspective look like for different regions. These results can inform Chinese policy makers in creating a better integration of the transportation and the power system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hydrothermal treatment of sludge within the pulp and paper industry can have a wide range of possible reactor solid loads for different sludge types. The objectives of this work were to determine the effect of reactor temperature and solid load on the properties of sludge hydrochar and to simulate hydrothermal treatment of sludge within a pulp and paper mill. Laboratory experiments were first performed within reactor temperature and solid load ranges of 180-260 degrees C and 10-50%, respectively, and the effects of sludge treatment were determined by comparing parallel mill-scale simulations. Based on the results, both reactor temperature and solid load had a statistically significant effect on the solid, ash, carbon and energy yields of sludge hydrochar. Increasing solid load minimized carbon dissolution to the liquid phase and increased the solid and energy yield of the attained hydrochar. According to mill-scale simulations in a 9 m(3) batch reactor, treating primary sludge alone produced an energy surplus of 22-36 GJ through char incineration, decreasing to 12-22 GJ and 3.4-9.1 GJ for mixed and secondary sludge, respectively. Mixing primary and secondary sludge reduced the overall energy surplus by 2-8% compared with treating the sludge streams separately in two reactors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We consider the problem of electricity demand shifting for the cooling needs of a large institution, using a thermal energy storage (TES) tank. The system is comprised of a number electric chillers with varying capacity and performance, as well as a tank that can store significant amount of chilled water but not enough for the whole day. The approach outlined here selects the number of chillers, and their time of operation, to minimize the costs, primarily by shifting the demand to the overnight period for which the electricity costs are lower and, due to lower ambient temperatures, the chillers are more efficient. The main goal is to develop a reliable and fast algorithm, through solving a linear or convex optimization problem, that operates the chillers at their peak efficiency and avoids excessive start-up and shut-down of chillers.

Abstract: Due to enhanced economic production as well as incentivized demanding supply management (DSM) strategies, solar photovoltaics (SPV) have experienced a phenomenal global annual growth rate but with a very limited contribution from the personal consumption sector, especially that of on-grid decentralized SPV. One of the reasons for this lies in the difficulties involved in unlocking the traditional production paradigm and lifestyle, based on centuries of conventional fossil-energy consumption. In response, this paper examines the case of Nine Dream Island in Nanjing, China, a pioneer of post-fossil emerging power supply communities providing on-grid SPV, to reveal the obstacles that lie beyond technological and economic factors involved. Empirical data including in-depth interviews illustrate the politico economic strategies of these communities in creating a new post-fossil production and consumption paradigm. In particular, it is suggested that, despite the National Development and Reform Commission's economic driving force in the form of 0.42 (sic)/kW h state subsidies in Nanjing, the complex pattern of governance structures and institutional arrangement characteristics overwhelmingly impedes public acceptance of a low-carbon model of production and consumption. Overall, the paper helps to shed light on the development and adoption of SPV as a post-fossil consumption and production technology in new market countries where administration forces provide a more important role in creating a new path-dependence for the adaptation of innovation technologies.

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage technologies are seen as crucial for decarbonisation of the power sector because large-scale deployment of these technologies is expected to reduce wholesale electricity prices and decarbonisation costs significantly. An emerging calcium looping process (CaL) was found to be a promising alternative to the amine scrubbing process, as its retrofit has the potential to reduce the efficiency penalty and increase the net power output of the integrated system. Process modelling is often utilised in the development of novel low-carbon power generation systems, but the deterministic nature of the process models does not provide a definitive representation of the actual system's performance. This study provides a framework for comparison of the probabilistic performance of a coal-fired power plant (CFPP) in CO2 capture retrofit scenarios. Having compared the probabilistic performance of the CFPP retrofitted with the mature MEA scrubbing process and emerging CaL process, it was found that the most probable values for the efficiency penalties are 9.5% and 11.5% points in the CaL and MEA retrofit scenarios, respectively. Also, the net power output in the CaL retrofit scenario was found to be 40% higher than that of the reference CFPP and two times higher than that in the case of the MEA retrofit scenario, even considering higher uncertainty in the operating conditions of the CaL process. Finally, the probabilistic approach was found to be capable of producing valuable information on the equipment operating envelope that would help designers assessing the number of equipment trains and their operating limits. Therefore, the probabilistic framework for comparison of CO2 capture retrofit scenarios would provide valuable input to the investment decision-making process, as by considering the impact of uncertainty on the process performance, it generates information that could serve as valuable input to the probabilistic economic analysis and process design.

Abstract: Traditionally, short-term electricity price forecasting has been essential for utilities and generation companies. However, the deregulation of electricity markets created a competitive environment and the introduction of new market participants, such as the retailers and aggregators, whose economic viability and profitability highly depends on the spot market price patterns. The aim of this study is to examine artificial neural network (ANN) based models for Day-ahead price forecasting. Specifically, the models refer to the sole application of ANNs or to hybrid models, where the ANN is combined with clustering algorithm. The training data are clustered in homogenous groups and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster is employed. The proposed models are characterized by comprehensive operation and by high level of flexibility; different inputs can be taken under consideration and different ANN topologies can be examined. The models are tested on a data set that consists of atypical price patterns and many outliers. This approach makes the price forecasting problem a more challenging task, providing evidence that the proposed models can be considered as useful and robust forecasting tools to the actual needs of market participants, including the traditional generation companies and self-producers, but also the retailers/suppliers and aggregators.

Abstract: Bioinspired materials (BMs) are one of the most attractive candidates for various environmental applications. BMs are synthesized like as natural materials with many excellent properties. These BMs can be crystalline, flexible, and tunable porous, while maintaining chemical and thermal stability. BMs are used in high-pressure adsorption and catalytic applications (with possible key-lock bonding mechanisms). Through surface functionalization, they can also be employed in diverse areas such as drug delivery, diagnosis, and sensing. Likewise, recent progress in BMs, especially for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and energy applications, has been attributed to their superior function (e.g., artificial photosynthesis and cycloaddition) and their ability to provide useful final products (e.g., renewable energy). In this review, we evaluated the different types of BMs and their roles in CCS and energy applications. The discussion is extended further to cover diverse research interests in this emerging field.

Abstract: Biodiesel was synthesized from waste frying oil (WFO) using beta-potassium dizirconate (beta-K2Zr2O5) as a novel heterogeneous catalyst. Synthesized catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), particle size analyser, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET surface area and basicity. Various reaction conditions such as molar ratio of methanol: oil, catalyst amount (wt%), reaction temperature, time and reusability of catalyst were studied for transesterification reaction with the catalyst, beta-K2Zr2O5. High biodiesel conversion of 96.85% was observed at a 10:1 M ratio (alcohol: oil), 4 wt% catalyst at 65 degrees C for 2 h. WFO was characterized by GCMS and biodiesel conversion was ascertained by Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 and C-13 FTNMR) spectroscopy. It was first time that beta-potassium dizirconate was used as a catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. The catalyst was reused up to five times without significant loss in its activity. Physical and chemical properties of FAME such as flash point, fire point, cloud point, density, and kinematic viscosity were deliberated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper an empirical capacity fade model for Li-ion batteries has been developed, calibrated and validated for a NCA/C and a LFP/C Li-ion cell. Based on extensive experimental work, this original, generic model is well suited for system simulation approaches, and is able to describe both cycle and calendar effects on aging. The stress factors taken into account for each aging mode are the state of charge and the temperature for calendar aging, and the temperature and the current for cycle aging. A simple approach has been adopted in order to instantaneously apply either cycle aging or calendar aging according to operating conditions and thus accurately model aging effects due to dynamic operating conditions. This model has then been coupled to an electrothermal model and integrated in a system simulation software application in order to assess the effect of charging rates, charging strategies and V2G on battery lifetime. When compared, the two battery chemistries exhibited different behaviors when submitted to V2G scenarios. Light V2G scenarios caused relatively low aging for the LFP/C based battery but tended to slightly increase the aging of the NCA/C based battery according to simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This work introduces a new heat integrated distillation column (HIDiC) for batch processing. Under this scheme, the entire cylindrical shell is proposed to divide vertically by a metal wall into two closed semi cylinders. Aiming to generate an internal heat source, a heat pump system is employed over the left hand division to elevate the pressure of the right hand part with the application of HIDiC concept. This new divided-wall HIDiC column utilizes its own energy source by transferring heat from the high pressure (HP) to low pressure (LP) side, thereby reducing the utility consumption in both the still and condenser. To make this thermal integration technology more effective, a typical tray configuration is proposed in both sides of the divided-wall. Unlike the continuous flow distillation, the batch column shows unsteady state process characteristics that make its operation more challenging. With this, an open-loop variable manipulation policy is formulated so that the dynamics of the heat integrated column remain close, if not same, with its conventional counterpart. This is a necessary condition required for a fair comparison between them. Finally, the proposed configuration is illustrated by a binary column, showing an improvement in energy savings, entropy generation and cost over its conventional analogous. This thermally integrated configuration is relatively simple than the traditional HIDiC in terms of design and operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High-fidelity and computationally efficient energy forecasting models for building systems are needed to ensure optimal automatic operation, reduce energy consumption, and improve the building's resilience capability to power disturbances. Various models have been developed to forecast building energy consumption. However, given buildings have different characteristics and operating conditions, model performance varies. Existing research has mainly taken a trial-and-error approach by developing multiple models and identifying the best performer for a specific building, or presumed one universal model form which is applied on different building cases. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a generalized system framework which can recommend appropriate models to forecast the building energy profiles based on building characteristics. To bridge this research gap, we propose a meta-learning based framework, termed Building Energy Model Recommendation System (BEMR). Based on the building's physical features as well as statistical and time series meta-features extracted from the operational data and energy consumption data, BEMR is able to identify the most appropriate load forecasting model for each unique building. Three sets of experiments on 48 test buildings and one real building were conducted. The first experiment was to test the accuracy of BEMR when the training data and testing data cover the same condition. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 90% of the buildings. The second experiment was to test the robustness of the BEMR when the testing data is only partially covered by the training data. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 83% of the buildings. The third experiment uses a real building case to validate the proposed framework and the result shows promising applicability and extensibility. The experimental results show that BEMR is capable of adapting to a wide variety of building types ranging from a restaurant to a large office, and gives excellent performance in terms of both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Global electricity consumption has increased rapidly in recent years. Improving the efficiency of electricity use as an alternative and/or complement to the construction of new power plants has received recent attention because of the potential environmental harm and high cost of constructing new power facilities. The objective of our research is to determine the effects of electricity price on electricity intensity in the manufacturing sector with particular focus on how this relationship changes over space and time. As a case study, we developed a simultaneous-equations system for a three-input production function using 108 months of panel data (January 2004- DeceMber 2012) over 16 regions in South Korea. We found that increases in electricity price improved electricity intensity in South Korea's manufacturing sector in the long run, but not in the short run. The effects of electricity-price increases on electricity intensity varied over time and space. The differences may have resulted from different degrees of (1) substitutability of electricity consuming equipment between the short and long runs, (2) price impact on electricity demand and manufacturing output in the regions' manufacturing sectors, and (3) technology improvement in manufacturing that allows substituting or replacing electricity-consuming equipment with high efficiency and less power consumption. Our findings imply that electricity-price management can be a potential policy tool to improve electricity intensity in the manufacturing sectors of countries with government-controlled electricity prices, with the following caveats. First, electricity price increases are likely to be effective as a long-term tool, but may not be as effective in the short run with some regional exceptions. Second, electricity price increases may hinder electricity-use efficiency in regions characterized by manufacturing sectors where price increases reduce manufacturing output more than they reduce electricity demand.

Abstract: Anaerobic digestion of manure fibers presents challenges due to their low biodegradability. Aqueous ammonia soaking (AAS) has been tested as a simple method to disrupt the lignocellulose and increase the methane yield of manure fibers. In the present study, mesophilic anaerobic digestion of AAS pretreated manure fibers was performed in CSTR-type digesters, fed with swine manure and/or a mixture of swine manure and MS pretreated manure fibers (at a total solids based ratio of 0.52 manure per 0.48 fibers). Two different simulations were performed. In the first place, the Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 (ADM1) was fitted to a manure-fed, CSTR-type digester and validated by simulating the performance of a second reactor digesting manure. It was shown that disintegration and hydrolysis of the solid matter of manure was such a slow process that the organic particulate matter did not significantly contribute to the methane production. In the second place, ADM1 was used to describe biogas production from the codigestion of manure and MS pretreated manure fibers. The model predictions regarding biogas production and methane content were in good agreement with the experimental data. It was shown that, MS treatment significantly increased the disintegration and hydrolysis rate of the carbohydrate compounds of the fibers. The effect of the addition of MS treated fibers on the kinetics of the conversion of other key compounds such as volatile fatty acids was negligible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, the anti-agglomeration abilities of Ca- and Mg-containing bed materials, including dolomite and magnesite, in a pressurized bubbling fluidized bed gasifier using pine pellets and birch chips as feedstock, is investigated. The most typical bed material-silica sand-was also included as a reference for comparison. The sustainability of the operation was evaluated via analyzing the temperatures at different levels along the bed height. During the performances, the aim was to keep the temperature at the bottom zone of the reactor at around 870 degrees C. However, the success highly depends on the bed materials used in the bed and the temperature can vary significantly in case of agglomeration or bad mixing of bed materials and char particles. Both Glanshammar and Sala dolomites performed well with no observed agglomeration tendencies. In case of magnesite, the bed exhibited a high agglomeration tendency. Silica sand displayed the most severe agglomeration among all bed materials, even when birch chips with a low silica content was fed at a relatively low temperature. The solid samples of all the bed materials were inspected by light microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) detector was used to detect the elemental distribution in the surface. The crystal chemical structure was analyzed using X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Magnesite agglomerates glued together by big molten ash particles. There was no coating layer detected on magnesite particles at bed temperatures - below 870 degrees C. But when the temperature was above 1000 degrees C, a significant amount of small molten ash particles was deposited on the magnesite particles, indicating a pronounced tendency for formation of a coating layer in case of long-term operation. An increasing trend of Si on the surface of dolomite particles was observed. Simultaneously, potassium deposition on the surface is not obvious. The analyses, based on the XRD diffraction and the K2O-SiO2-MgO and K2O-SiO2-CaO ternary diagrams, suggest that the observed decreases in the risks for agglomeration using dolomite, cannot be attributed to formation of alkali-containing compounds with higher melting points, but to the reaction between dolomite and silica, consuming a considerable portion of silicon and thus hinder the formation of low-melting potassium silicate, as well as its ability to stabilize the temperatures under pressurized conditions.

Abstract: Switzerland and Europe are currently at a crossroads with respect to its electricity policy. Several existing nuclear and fossil fuel power plants are to be retired in the coming years. Meanwhile, ambitious carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions are envisaged, which could penalise fossil power plants and encourage investments in renewable-based electricity generation. Switzerland and a few other countries in Europe have decided to phase-out their nuclear capacity, thereby removing a low-carbon source of electricity in the medium-to long-term future. In order to understand possible electricity transition pathways for Switzerland, electricity supply options for Switzerland and its four neighbouring countries namely Austria, France, Germany and Italy are analysed to assess non-nuclear alternatives under a stringent climate mitigation policy. The cross border Swiss TIMES electricity model (CROSSTEM), a cost optimisation framework with a long time horizon and an hourly temporal resolution, is used for this analysis. In the absence of any CO2 emission reduction targets, gas-based generation supplemented by electricity imports is the cost-effective alternative to nuclear for Switzerland. For a low carbon electricity system, natural gas based generation with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), complemented by an accelerated investment in renewable generation is required. Traditional electricity trade patterns have to be revised, with significant increases in cross-border interconnector capacities necessary to transfer electricity to Switzerland from countries with abundant renewable resources such as Germany and Italy. The average cost of electricity in a decarbonised electricity sector would increase in the range of 30-120% by 2050 compared to today, depending on the scenario assumptions. The availability of CCS technology and the requirement for electricity storage are particularly important to achieve a complete decarbonisation of the electricity sector with a nuclear phase-out.

Abstract: Fast pyrolysis bio-oil derived from empty palm fruit bunch was upgraded in supercritical ethanol (scEtOH) without using external catalysts and molecular hydrogen. The effects of the reaction temperature and time on the product yield and the quality of the upgraded oil based on parameters like the elemental content, total acid number (TAN), water content, high heating value (HHV), and viscosity were examined. At 400 degrees C, almost all of the organic species in the fast pyrolysis bio-oil were converted to the liquid and gas phase in 30 min, resulting in a high yield of the upgraded oil (83.0 wt%) with an enhanced HHV of 34.1 MJ kg(-1) and very low values of TAN (4.8 mg KOH g(-1)) and water (1.6 wt%) when compared to the fast pyrolysis bio-oil (HHV, 24.3 MJ kg(-1); TAN, 69.4 mg KOH g(-1); water, 14.0 wt%). The major chemical species in the upgraded oil were alcohols, esters, phenols, hydrocarbons, and aromatics. After aging at 80 degrees C for one week, a marginal increase in the viscosity of the upgraded bio-oil was observed, indicating a significant improvement in the stability of the bio-oil. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the process performed in a commercial boiler demonstrated that the upgraded oil firing exhibited high gas temperature profiles, a high firing peak of 1599 degrees C, and a high total heat transfer rate of 121.81 MWth. These results are comparable to the performance parameters of conventional heavy oil-firing processes. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Due to the growth in demand for shallow geothermal energy, the development of an integrated management system to organize the exploitation of this resource is mandatory to protect both groundwater and the users' rights. This paper proposes a methodology to establish a market of shallow geothermal energy use rights which will represent an advance in the management of this resource. The new concept developed to define the basic unit of management is the thermal plot. It is related to the shallow geothermal potential of a registered plot of land. This methodology is based on a GIS framework (ArcGIS, ESRI) and is composed of a geospatial database (Personal Geodatabase, ESRI) to store the main information required to manage the SGE systems, such as groundwater velocity, thermal conductivity or thermal heat capacity, and a set of GIS tools used to define, implement and control this use rights market. The exchanged heat rate and thermal disturbance are calculated on the basis of analytical solutions of heat transport equation in porous media. Thermal impacts derived from the exploitation of this resource can also be registered geographically, by taking into account the groundwater flow direction and adjusting the thermal impact to the available plot. A synthetic application of this methodology is presented for the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Rebound effect studies of road vehicle travel focus mostly on increases in distance traveled after increases in energy efficiency. Average journeying speed also increases with energy efficiency, but rebound studies avoid quantifying speed-related rebound effects. This may underestimate rebound effects by around 60%. This study offers a first attempt to show how increases in speed and acceleration contribute to rebound effects, and how these can be quantified. Its empirical data is dynamometer test results for a plug-in electric car and an internal combustion engine (ICE) pick-up van with automatic transmission, each on the WLTP and NEDC drive cycles, representing driving styles from today and 1975 respectively. Rebound effects are estimated by comparing the WLTP and NEDC results, using typical 1975 energy efficiencies for the NEDC. The electric car shows a 20.5% speed rebound effect, and a mathematical development sets out how speed rebound effects can be included in traditional rebound effect analyses. Results for the ICE vehicle do not allow a direct rebound effect estimate due to wasteful engine revving on the NEDC and wrong gear ratios for sedate travel. However, this can be seen as a form of 'transformational' rebound effect, where vehicle design locks drivers into fast driving styles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Recently promulgated regulations of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) aggressively limit CO2 emissions from the US power industry. Carbon capture and increased utilization of renewable energy sources are viable approaches to reduce CO2 emissions from the power industry. Cryogenic carbon capture considered in this study is a post-combustion CO2 removal system that separates CO2 from the flue gas by desublimation. In this investigation, a hybrid system of cryogenic carbon capture and a baseline fossil-fueled power generation unit are optimized with a framework to mathematically represent this hybrid system. Optimization of this hybrid system results in meeting the electricity demand through a combination of coal, gas, and wind power sources with a priority given to wind power for utilization. A comparison of the cost associated with operating the steam turbine as a baseline or load-following unit is also made. A significant decrease in the cycling cost associated with load-following of the coal-fired power plant is observed when it operates as a baseline unit. The decrease in the cycling costs is 82% and 85%, respectively, for when wind power is utilized in meeting the electricity demand and when it is not. The saving in the cycling costs is attributed to the energy storage of cryogenic carbon capture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We propose a robust route to prepare novel supercooling microstructured phase change materials (PCMs) suitable for seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) or heat protection applications. Two supercooling polyols, erythritol and xylitol, are successfully prepared as novel microencapsulated PCM-polystyrene composites with polyol mass fractions of 62 wt% and 67 wt%, respectively, and average void diameter of similar to 50 gm. Thermal properties of the composites and bulk polyols are studied thoroughly with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal conductivity analyzer. Significant differences in heat storage properties of microstructured and bulk PCM are observed. The heat release of microstructured erythritol is more controlled than that of bulk PCM, making the novel microengineered PCMs particularly interesting for STES. In the case of bulk PCM, the heat release may occur spontaneously due to crystallization by surface roughnesses or impurities, whereas these factors have only little,impact on the crystallization of microstructured erythritol, making the novel composite more reliable for long-term heat storage purposes. In addition, microstructured polyol-polystyrene composites show anomalous enhancement in the specific heat as compared to bulk polyols. This enhancement may originate from strong polyol-surfactant interactions in the composites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Natural gas hydrates (NGHs), which extensively exist in sea-floor and permafrost regions, are considered as an alternative energy in the future for the fossil fuels approaching depletion with the gradually increasing energy consumption. Because of the particularity of NGH stabilizing only in the conditions of the high pressure and the low temperature, the exploitation of NGH is distinguished from those of petroleum and natural gas. Researchers over the world are devoting themselves to developing the technologies of NGH exploitation. However, till now, few NGH exploitation technology is identified and employed to exploit commercially NGH. Although there do be two cases of short-term NGH exploitation in Mackenzie Delta (CAN), Alaska North Slope (USA) and Nankai Trough (JAP) in the past 10 years. It is mainly because some characteristics of the flow (gas, water, gas-hydrate slurry, quicksand, etc.), the issues of heat and mass transfer, the risk assessment and the economic evaluation are still not comprehensively recognized. Presently, the researches of NGH exploitation are mainly carried out from three aspects, numerical simulation and analysis, experimental simulation and field trial exploitation for the different technologies. In this paper, we comprehensively review the relevant studies of NGHs and propose our comments. We not only represent the achievements for the NGH exploitation researches, but also discuss the limitations and challenges, raise some questions and put forward some suggestions from our points of view.

Abstract: Bioenergy is a significant source of renewable energy in the U.S. and internationally. We explore whether creation of localized bioenergy markets near existing military installations in the southeastern U.S. could simultaneously address military renewable energy generation objectives while reducing urban encroachment. We model the use of public-private partnerships to stimulate the creation of these markets, in which stable installation demand is paired with stable supply from surrounding landowners. We employ two economic models - the SubRegional Timber Supply (SRTS) model and the Forest and Agricultural Sector Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOMGHG) - to assess how markets influence forest and agriculture land use, renewable energy production, and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation at the regional and national levels. When all selected installations increase bioenergy capacity simultaneously, we find increased preservation of forest land area, increased forest carbon storage in the region, and increased renewable energy generation at military installations. Nationally, however, carbon stocks are depleted as harvests increase, increasing GHG emissions even after accounting for potential displaced emissions from coal- or natural gas-fired generation. Increasing bioenergy generation on a single installation within the southeast has very different effects on forest area and composition, yielding greater standing timber volume and higher forest carbon stock. In addition to demonstrating the benefits of linking two partial equilibrium models of varying solution technique, sectoral scope, and resource detail, results suggest that a tailored policy approach may be more effective in meeting local encroachment reduction and renewable energy generation objectives while avoiding negative GHG mitigation consequences.

Abstract: When evaluating the energy demand of buildings using stratified hot water storage tanks in an active demand response context, an accurate but low order storage tank model is required. Accurate modelling of buoyancy effects and mixing inside the storage tank as a result of direct inflows is key to obtain valid results. The use of one-dimensional storage tank models is common practice in building simulations, but as buoyancy and mixing are three-dimensional phenomena they cannot be incorporated directly in such a model and special formulations must be used. This paper presents a novel method for incorporating buoyancy and mixing in one-dimensional stratified storage tank models. The model parameters are derived from a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations and correlated with the appropriate non-dimensional parameters. The model is validated against an independent set of charging and discharging experiments. The model is found to represent buoyancy and mixing in the storage tank in a realistic way and to correspond well to experimental results. To allow researchers to assess the uncertainty on performance indicators in building energy simulations, an effective storage capacity ratio is defined and its variation within the model parameter uncertainty range is calculated and compared to other models. The results show a discrepancy between models commonly used in the literature and the presented validated model. When the influence of storage capacity on parameters of interest is known, the effective storage capacity ratio can also be used to estimate the uncertainty on these parameters caused by the storage tank model.

Abstract: Reversible solid oxide cell (ReSOC) systems are conceptualized and analyzed to assess technical performance in distributed energy storage applications (100 kW/800 kWh). The ReSOC systems operate sequentially between fuel-producing electrolysis and power-producing fuel-cell modes with intermediate tanking of reactants and products. Maintaining the high conversion efficiencies seen in laboratory scale cell tests at the system-level requires careful system design to integrate storage and electrochemical conversion functions. By leveraging C-O-H reaction chemistry and operating at intermediate temperature, the ReSOC is mildly exothermic in both operating modes, which simplifies balance-of-plant integration and thermal management. System configurations explored herein range from a simple system with minimal balance-of-plant components to more complex systems including turbine expansion for increased electrical efficiency, and separating water for higher energy density storage. The efficiency, energy density, and capital cost tradeoffs of these configurations are quantified through computational modeling. Results indicate that a roundtrip efficiency of nearly 74% is achieved with relatively low tanked energy density (similar to 20 kWh/m(3)) for systems configured to store water-vapor containing gases. Separately storing condensed water increases energy density of storage, but limits efficiency to 68% based on the energetic cost of evaporating reactant water during electrolysis operation. Further increases in energy density (to 90 kWh/m(3)) require higher storage pressures (e.g., 50-bar nominal) which lower roundtrip efficiency to about 65%. Cost of energy storage is strongly influenced by stack power and system energy densities because the storage tanks and stack comprise a majority of the system capital cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The use of algal biomass for the production of sustainable biofuels has attracted significant interest due to the fast reproduction rates and high lipid content of many microalgal species. However, existing methods of extracting algal cellular lipids are complex and expensive, with regards to both energy input and economic costs. This work explores an alternative method of utilizing the energy content of microalgae through the preparation of wet algal biomass slurry/fossil diesel emulsions containing up to 6.6% wt/wt algae biomass, using a specific surfactant combination, for direct injection diesel engine combustion of microalgae without prior biomass drying or lipid extraction.
A high lipid containing green microalgae, Chlorella sorokiniana, was used to produce algal biomass for the study. The preparation of wet algal slurry/diesel emulsions from algae grown under standard conditions, and also those under conditions intended to increase cellular lipid content or growth rates was investigated, and in all cases a surfactant pack of Span80, CTAB and butanol was found to produce a stable emulsion. A correlation between the engine work produced during combustion of the emulsions in a modern direct injection compression ignition and the lower heating value of the wet slurry emulsions was found, with no evidence of individual algae cells persisting to the engine exhaust. Engine exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter were lower for all of the wet algal slurry/diesel emulsions relative to a reference fossil diesel tested under similar conditions, while in the case of the emulsion prepared from algal biomass to which a flocculating agent had been added, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) were found to increase significantly.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid structure containing photonic crystal surface with inverted-pyramid arrays on the top, two-dimensional (2D) patterned metallic reflector with random pyramids' sizes at the bottom, and a Si film between the two layers, to achieve high-efficiency, broad-band and wide-angle energy absorption. Due to the scattering effect and waveguide mode resonance effect of the structure, the enhanced absorption is close to or even surpasses the Yablonovitch limit in a broad wavelength range (0.3-9.9 mu m). What's more, the high absorption efficiencies are insensitive to the variation of incidence angle (from 0 degrees to 80 degrees) and substantial electric field modes concentrate in the inverted-pyramid arrays and Si film. Comparing to un-patterned film and one-dimensional (1D) patterned film, 2D-patterned film obtains higher absorption efficiency for both s polarization and p polarization. Furthermore, we find that the high absorption band expands to a broader wavelength range with the size of structure increasing. Our multifunctional structure is experimentally feasible and is expected to have a wide application in the areas of energy harvesting, energy conversion, energy conservation and sustainable energy utilization.

Abstract: e-harbours is a unique European project that was set out to identify viable energy business cases on the exploitation of energy flexibility, which optimise their operations to match energy demand and supply while taking account of the additional volatility in supply caused by renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency, and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper, we propose an integrated multi criteria decision analysis based framework to assess the relative performance of 21 energy business cases, which implemented different demand-side management strategies. Our proposed methodology has the ability to address complex problems involving multiple conflicting interests from various stakeholders, different forms of data, and different fuzzy and crisp relations. We find that business cases based on contract optimisation and offering reserve capacity were ranked relatively high, while those based on trading on the wholesale market or hybrid approaches fared less well. Despite finding viable pilot business cases, e-harbours found that there was little enthusiasm among industrial partners to scale up the pilots. Consequently, EU governments should consider offering attractive incentive programmes for industry engagement in achieving their objectives in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy supply security, diversifying energy supplies, and improving Europe's industrial competitiveness.

Abstract: Flue gas waste heat recovery and utilization is an efficient means to improve the energy efficiency of coal-fired power plants. At present, the surface corrosion and fouling problems of heat exchanger hinder the development of flue gas deep cooling. In this study, a novel flue gas deep cooling method that can reduce flue gas temperature below the dew point of vapor to recover latent heat and obtain clean water simultaneously is proposed to achieve improved energy efficiency. The heat transfer mode of this method is the direct contact mode, which takes the scrubber, e.g. the flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber, as the deep cooling exchanger. The flash evaporation and condensation (FEC) device and heat pump (HP) are utilized to provide low temperature medium, such as FGD slurry or water, for washing and deep cooling flue gas, to collect recovered water, and to absorb recovered waste heat. This method is called as the FEC-HP method. This paper elaborated on two optional models of the proposed method. The mechanism for recovering heat and water was also analyzed using the customized flue gas humidity chart, and the method to quantitate recovered heat and water, as well as the results of the case of a 300 MW coal-fired generator set were provided. Net present value calculations showed that this method is profitable in the scenario of burning high-water-content coals. Several potential advantages of this method and suggestions for practical application were also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, batch tests were performed to evaluate the effects of different thermal pretreatment temperatures (55-160 degrees C) and durations (15-120 min) on the anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste (KW). Two commonly used approaches, namely the modified Gompertz model and the approach developed by Koch and Drewes, were applied to assess the effects of the different pretreatment parameters on the biomethane yield, lag time and hydrolysis rate constant via data fitting. The subsequent anaerobic digestion of KW pretreated at 55-120 degrees C presented greater efficiency, and longer treatment durations resulted in increased methane production and higher hydrolysis rate constants. These findings were obtained due to the lower nutrient loss observed in KW treated at lower temperature treatments compared with that found with higher temperature treatments. In general, the effects of thermal pretreatment on the lag phase and hydrolysis rate differed depending on the treatment parameters leading to the variations in the KW compositions. The soundness of the two model results was evaluated, and higher statistical indicators (R-2) were found with the modified Gompertz model than with the approach developed by Koch and Drewes.

Abstract: Highly nonlinear structures and constituent materials and hazardous experiment situations have resulted in a pressing need for a numerical mechanical model for lithium-ion battery (LIB). However, such a model is still not well established. In this paper, an anisotropic homogeneous model describing the jellyroll and the battery shell is established and validated through compression, indentation, and bending tests at quasi-static loadings. In this model, state-of-charge (SOC) dependency of the LIB is further included through an analogy with the strain-rate effect. Moreover, with consideration of the inertia and strain rate effects, the anisotropic homogeneous model is extended into the dynamic regime and proven capable of predicting the dynamic response of the LIB using the drop-weight test. The established model may help to predict extreme cases with high SOCs and crashing speeds with an over 135% improved accuracy compared to traditional models. The established coupled strain rate and SOC dependencies of the numerical mechanical model for the LIB aims to provide a solid step toward unraveling and quantifying the complicated problems for research on LIB mechanical integrity.

Abstract: A key function of battery management system (BMS) is to provide accurate information of the state of charge (SOC) in real time, and this depends directly on the precise model parameterization. In this paper, a novel multi-timescale estimator is proposed to estimate the model parameters and SOC for vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) in real time. The model parameters and OCV are decoupled and estimated independently, effectively avoiding the possibility of cross interference between them. The analysis of model sensitivity, stability, and precision suggests the necessity of adopting different timescales for each estimator independently. Experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. Results reveal that the model parameters are online adapted accurately thus the periodical calibration on them can be avoided. The online estimated terminal voltage and SOC are both benchmarked with the reference values. The proposed multi-timescale estimator has the merits of fast convergence, high precision, and good robustness against the initialization uncertainty, aging states, flow rates, and also battery chemistries.

Abstract: Sensitivity analysis based on Leontief model is applied for identifying the key factors leading to the change of CO2 emission or energy consumption in the competitive market from demand perspective. On the other hand, this kind of research from supply-side is also valuable for the economy with characteristics of rationing. Based on previous research achievements, this paper developed out sensitivity analysis based on the Ghosh model. In addition, we implemented sensitivity analysis based on the Leontief and Ghosh model respectively to study the most sensitive factors leading to the change of CO2 emission intensities of the six energy-intensive industries. In terms of 2010 Chinese symmetrical input-output table, the results obtained from the two sensitivity analyses are different. From the demand perspective, the level of production technology in the construction industry plays very important role in the CO2 emission intensity of energy-intensive industries. While, from the supply side, the adjustment of rationing in extraction of petroleurri and nature gas should be paid more attention. At last, comparative analysis was carried out and corresponding policy suggestions were put forward. Emphatically, the method used in this paper could be applied to other industries within supply chains of a country, even in the world wide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Various process utilities are used in the petrochemical industry as auxiliary variables to facilitate the addition/removal of energy to/from the process, power process equipment and inhibit unwanted reaction. Optimisation activities usually focus on the process itself or on the utility consumption though the generation and distribution of these utilities are often overlooked in this regard. Many utilities are prepared or generated far from the process plant and have to be transported or transmitted, giving rise to more losses and potential inefficiencies. To illustrate the potential benefit of utility optimisation, this paper explores the control of a dual circuit cooling water system with focus on energy reduction subject process constraints. This is accomplished through the development of an advanced regulatory control (ARC) and switching strategy which does not require the development of a system model, only rudimentary knowledge of the behaviour of the process and system constraints. The novelty of this manuscript lies in the fact that it demonstrates that significant energy savings can be obtained by applying ARC to a process utility containing both discrete and continuous dynamics. Furthermore, the proposed ARC strategy does not require a plant model, uses only existing plant equipment, and can be implemented on control system hardware commonly used in industry. The simulation results indicate energy saving potential in the region of 30% on the system under investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A hybrid solar water disinfection and energy generation system for meeting the needs of safe drinking water and electricity was designed and tested in Alcala de Henares (Spain) under summer climatic conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. Natural water sources with wild strains of Escherichia coli, total coliforms, Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens (including spores) were studied. Results showed that SOLWAT disinfection efficiency was higher than conventional PET bottles and that the water disinfection reactor located above the PV module did not affect the total energy output produced by the hybrid system in comparison to the single PV module, achieving the same power losses over the 6 h of sun exposure in relation to their power at standard test conditions (STC).

Abstract: This paper explores the conditions under which renewable energy sources (RES) penetration could jeopardize power system reliability, as well as which flexibility options could help integrate high levels of RES. For this purpose, we used an energy-planning model from the TIMES family, which provides a realistic representation of power systems and plausible options for their long-term development, completed by a thermodynamic description of power systems to assess their reliability. We applied this model to the case of France and built contrasted scenarios, from 0% to 100% renewable energy penetration by 2050. We also tested different assumptions on Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) production, imports, demand flexibility and biomass potential. We show that high renewable energy penetration would need significant investments in new capacities, new flexibility options along with imports and demand-response, and that it is likely to deteriorate power system reliability if no technologies dedicated to this issue are installed.

Abstract: Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers in the world. In northern countries, buildings consume most of the energy for space heating owing to the predominating cold climate conditions. Today there is a trend to use Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) in buildings to make the indoor environment more comfortable and to utilise energy in a more efficient way. Currently, BEMS lack a building heating model, and the control is often based on temperature zones. Integration of a good building heating model with BEMS may assist in monitoring the heating of buildings in an optimal way while saving energy. Hence, the goal is to develop a model that can be applied in on-line control with acceptable performance and accuracy. This article covers multi-floor physics-based building heating models developed in MATLAB and Modelica environments. The Modelica model uses the model components from Modelica Buildings Library and is more complex than the MATLAB model. The applicability of the two models in on-line control in BEMS principally depends on the accuracy of the predictions and prediction time. The prediction accuracy of both models is satisfactory while the Modelica model is robust. With the used computational power, the MATLAB model provides faster results compared to the Modelica model. More real-time experiments are needed for both models, and they can be applied in on-line control, depending on the model simplicity, available computational power and real-time segments in the system. In addition, the methodology used in the MATLAB model development is application independent and can be implemented in different natures of building configurations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Novel microencapsulated phase change materials with calcium carbonate shell and paraffin-based binary cores were prepared via self-assembly method. The phase change temperature of the microcapsules could be adjusted from 25 to 50 degrees C by changing the weight ratio of binary cores. FTIR confirmed that the calcium carbonate shell material was successfully fabricated upon the paraffin-based binary cores. SEM and TEM demonstrated the microcapsules had a spherical morphology and compact surfaces with diameter ranging from 1 to 5 gm. DSC results indicated that the binary cores content of microcapsules was in a range of 55.7-59.4%. TGA showed that mass loss of the microcapsules was between 5% and 28% when heated to 400 degrees C. Infrared imager exhibited the binary cores microcapsules possessed excellent temperature-regulated properties. Besides, the thermal conductivity of the microcapsules was significantly enhanced due to the presence of highly thermally conductive calcium carbonate shell. Since the low costs and outstanding properties, it exhibits a good prospect in the thermal energy storage and thermal management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Although China has experienced a wide variety of regional conflicts between water scarcity and electricity generation, there are few comprehensive quantifications that explicitly reveal the location and severity of these conflicts. Triggered by the soaring need for such information, we performed a high-resolution evaluation and projection of the spatial vulnerability of thermoelectric power generation to water scarcity problems. The study provides a comprehensive assessment by incorporating thermoelectric plants' reliance on water, local water supply stress and future impacts brought about by planning and climate change into the analysis simultaneously. To measure the vulnerability of thermoelectric plants to water scarcity, a vulnerability index was constructed and multi-disciplinary approaches were integrated to quantify this index. Seven hotpots in North China were highlighted as power-vulnerable to water scarcity currently. In order to fulfill the power generation target in the future, less-vulnerable watersheds identified by this study are suggested to become the sites of future power plants. Besides, lowering the water withdrawal intensity of power plants alone is not enough to solve the vulnerability concerns. Instead, it is necessary to implement other water management, including water rights allocation in the trans boundary river basins. This paper also highlights regions where climate change will threaten power generation by decreasing the water availability. These insights are valuable for adding the alleviation of water and electricity conflicts to climate change adaptation agenda. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Liquid desiccant dehumidification systems have accumulated considerable research interest in recent years for their great energy saving potential in buildings. Within the system, the regenerator recovering liquid desiccant plays a major role in its performance. When the ultrasonic atomization technology is applied to atomize the desiccant solution into numerous tiny droplets with diameters around 50 gm, the regeneration process could be greatly enhanced. To validate this approach, a novel ultrasonic atomization liquid desiccant regeneration system (UARS) was studied in this work. An Ideal Regeneration Model (IRM) was developed to predict the regeneration performance of the UARS. Additionally, thorough experiments were carried out to validate the model under different operating conditions of the desiccant solution and air stream. The model predicted values and the experimental results coincided, with the average deviation less than 7.9%. The performance of UARS was compared with other regeneration systems from the open literature, while a case study was conducted for the power consumption and energy saving potential of UARS. It was found that the ultrasonic atomization technology enabled utilization of lower-grade energy for desiccant regeneration with the regeneration temperature lowered as much as 4.4 degrees C. In addition, a considerable energy saving potential of up to 23.4% could be achieved by the UARS for regenerating per unit mass flow of desiccant solution, while the power consumption of the ultrasonic atomization system was less than 7.0% of total energy cost. Moreover, when the UARS is integrated with the ultrasonic atomization assisted dehumidifier, energy savings can reach up to 60.4% as compared with the packed-bed system. This study validated the feasibility and energy saving potential of applying ultrasonic atomization technology to liquid desiccant regeneration systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper reports an integrated system consisting of a diesel genset and a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) unit for power supply to isolated end-users in remote areas. The integration is through three parts: direct-driven piston-compression, external air turbine-driven supercharging, and flue gas waste recovery for super-heating. The performance of the integrated system is compared to a single diesel unit and a dual-diesel unit with a capacity of electricity supply to a village of 100 households in the UK. It is found the fuel consumption of the integrated system is only 50% of the single-diesel unit and 77% of the dual-diesel unit. The addition of the CAES unit not only provides a shift to electrical energy demand, but also produces more electricity due to the recovery of waste heat.

Abstract: Cyclic variations in diesel engines are undesirable since they are understood to lead to lower efficiency and higher emissions, as well as power output limitations. This work aims to improve the understanding of the source of cycle-to-cycle variations of in-cylinder pressure in conventional diesel engines and the implications these have for measurement and simulation best practices. Measurements in a single cylinder diesel engine employing single injection, under low temperature end-of-compression conditions and variable charge 02 concentration have shown that in-cylinder pressure fluctuations- i.e. excitation of the first radial mode of vibration of the cylinder gases, caused in single cycles by the rapid premixed combustion - result in increases in diffusion heat release rate. The average intensity of the pressure fluctuations was shown to increase with increasing amount and reactivity of the premixed combustion. This results in higher cycle-to-cycle variations under these conditions, revealed by greater cyclic deviations of maximum pressure.
A study of the single cycle pressure fluctuation intensity under long ignition delay conditions revealed that despite the increase of average intensity of fluctuations with increasing premixed reactivity, even under these conditions some cycles exhibited no pressure fluctuations. This indicates that the high premixed combustion rate is not in itself a sole prerequisite for the onset of the resonance of cylinder gases, with other, "random" effects also required to induce the pressure oscillations. Finally, under low temperature charge conditions the difference in peak pressure between the average cycle and cycles showing low fluctuation intensity was measured to be >3 bar (>3% of the peak). In all, these results underline the need for further understanding of the source of the pressure fluctuations and the effect of these cyclic variations on single-cycle and average emissions. The effect of the highly fluctuating cycles on the average cycle should lead the scientific community conducting measurements and simulations on such engines to reconsider the best practices for acquiring, evaluating and interpreting measured data. In addition, the community should acknowledge the contribution of extreme cycles when averaged data is used for simulation validation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Optimal energy delivery and energy consumption is vital in electric power systems as large amount of electricity cannot be stored in its electrical form. As part of upgradation, power systems are undergoing deregulation. One among the key issues of the deregulated power system is overload on a transmission line, also referred as congestion. Congestion is not acceptable as it increases the energy price and threatens system reliability and security. In this paper, a method of energy management is presented to remove congestion on transmission lines by rescheduling generators with the objective of minimizing energy rescheduling cost on day-ahead and hour-ahead basis. Usually, optimization methods are useful to achieve maximum gain. The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is employed in this article in order to get the optimized result. Numerical analysis of modified IEEE 30-bus system and real time application for TamilNadu (TN) 106-bus system is presented to provide evidence of the performance of the energy management measure. The realistic cases of base load, peak load, bilateral and multilateral power transactions, generation failure, and transmission line outages are considered and their corresponding energy generation, energy consumption and energy savings are obtained and are compared with the results of Particle Swarm Optimization. The discussed results show that the presented approach of energy management can reduce energy rescheduling cost and energy generation cost. In addition to that, the rescheduling of generators based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) can further reduce the congestion cost, system energy loss and the usage of fossil fuels. The presented algorithm takes less computational time to achieve their optimal energy rescheduling cost when compared with Particle Swarm Optimization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of a low-operating pressure evaporator using capillary-assisted tubes for adsorption cooling systems (ACS). When using water as a refrigerant in an ACS, the operating pressure is low (<5 kPa) and the performance of the system is severely affected when using conventional evaporators. This problem can be addressed by using capillary-assisted evaporators. A custom-built apparatus for evaluating cooling power is used to test five types of enhanced tubes with different fin geometries. Tests were performed with 10-20 degrees C chilled water inlet temperatures and water vapor pressures of 0.5-0.8 kPa. The results show that the capillary-assisted tubes provide 1.6-2.2 times greater heat transfer rate compared to a plain tube. Comparing tubes with equivalent inner surface areas (0.049 m(2)/m) and equivalent outer surface areas (0.193 m(2)/m), and different fin heights indicates that tubes with 1.42 mm parallel continuous fins (26 fins per inch (FPI)) have a 13% higher heat transfer coefficient than those with 0.9 mm fins (40 FPI). The effects of refrigerant height, dead volume inside the evaporator and chilled water mass flow rate on the performance of evaporator are studied. The heat transfer rate increases by 65% when the water height to tube diameter ratio decreased from 1.8 to less than 1. Increasing the chilled water mass flow rate from 2.5 to 15.3 kg/min (6.1 times higher) increases evaporator heat transfer coefficient by 110%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Research on building-integrated solar thermal collectors is attracting increasingly more interest. Many efforts have been focused at the design level for obtaining specific building-orientated products, but there is a significant lack of standardised methods for evaluating how the efficiency of solar collectors changes when a wall is an integral part of the solar component itself. Generally speaking, experimental tests on integrated components are not easy to realise and are, in any case, expensive in terms of time and money. Physical and numerical methods can be utilised, but at the moment, there is no common approach. The present work addresses a method for the calculation of a building-integrated component performance curve by means of a finite element method model. The main idea is to exploit data measured for a simpler and non-integrated component, which are readily available, for validating and calibrating a more complex model in which the system is coupled with a building element. Simulation assumptions and outputs are designed to comply with the main standards utilised for defining solar collector performance curves. The proposed method proves that it may be a good way to assess the performance curves of building integrated solar thermal collectors and that it is suitable for reducing test costs. The authors have also highlighted the measures that must be taken for the sample collector to better fit the BIST performance model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Microbial enhanced oil recovery has been well acknowledged and becoming an advanced technology for oil recovery. Compared with current techniques, a newly technical strategy of the in-situ heavy oil gasification to methane for oil viscosity reduction was proposed and successfully proved via enriching the methanogenic consortia from the brine of oil reservoir with heavy oil as carbon source. During 200 days anaerobic culturing, 2.34 g of heavy oil was degraded coupling with 1514 mu mol of methane production. Phylogenetic diversity analysis showed that the enriched consortia composed with sequences affiliated with the Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Deferribacteres and Bacteroidetes. The recovered archaeal phylotypes were close to the Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales, which could convert the produced small molecules (formic acid and acetic acids) to methane. The viscosity of the degraded heavy oil was reduced by 72.45% at 20 MPa after the dissolution of the produced methane. Core flooding tests finally showed that the oil degradation and methane production by the enriched methanogenic consortia made 14.7% of the tertiary enhanced oil recovery. These results demonstrated a promising and practical strategy of microbial technology on oil recovery by activating the methanogens in heavy oil reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To realize the optimal energy allocation between the engine-generator and battery of a hybrid tracked vehicle (HTV), a reinforcement learning-based real-time energy-management strategy was proposed. A systematic control-oriented model for the HTV was built and validated through the test bench, including the battery pack, the engine-generator set (EGS), and the power request. To use effectively the statistical information of power request online, a Markov chain-based real-time power request recursive algorithm for learning transition probabilities was derived and validated. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate was adopted to determine when the transition probability matrix and the optimal control strategy update in real time. Reinforcement learning (RL) was applied to compare quantitatively the effects of different forgetting factors and KL divergence rates on reducing fuel consumption. RI. has also been used to optimize the control strategy for HTV, compared to preliminary and dynamic programming-based control strategies. The real-time and robust performance of the proposed online energy management strategy was verified under two driving schedules collected in the field test. The simulation results indicate the proposed RL-based energy management strategy can significantly improve fuel efficiency and can be applied in real time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There is great potential in the use of urban wind energy to form electricity generation modules over a distribution network to maximize wind power production in densely urbanized areas. The objective of this study is to therefore develop computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based evaluation procedures to determine potential mounting sites of wind turbines and obtain estimates of wind power by taking into consideration the details of the local urban topography and boundary conditions of micro-environments. The predictions, including those of the wind velocity and direction as well as turbulence intensity, are compared with field measurements via ultrasonic anemometers and thermal flow velocity probes at 10 monitored sites over five different floors inside an objective building to validate the computational model as well as attain a better understanding of the interaction of the wind with buildings in a complex terrain. The predicted power density and turbulence intensity profiles are then used to analyze the power density, turbulence intensity and lowest mounting height for optimizing the potential mounting sites and estimates of wind power. The suggested deployment solution of using CFD for wind turbines on the studied site is clearly different from those suggested in the literature and their deficiency in providing optimum mounting sites in micro-environments. Moreover, an improved roof design with a rounded shape is proposed for the, enhancement of wind power density with relatively lower turbulence intensity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The low delta-T syndrome is one of the major faults that affect the operation and energy performance of the chilled water systems in practice, particularly for the complex chilled water systems. Low delta-T syndrome refers to the situation where the measured mean temperature difference of the overall terminal air-handling units is much lower than the expected normal value. The conventional pump speed control strategies lack the ability to handle the low delta-T syndrome. This paper presents an online robust control strategy for practical applications to avoid the low delta-T syndrome for chilled water systems including complex systems. On top of the conventional control strategies, a temperature set-point reset scheme is developed aiming at providing the reliable temperature set-point for enhancing the operation reliability of chilled water pumps. In addition, a flow-limiting control scheme is employed to perform the function of actively eliminating the deficit flow in the bypass line by a feedback mechanism. This robust pump speed control strategy has been implemented and evaluated on a real complex chilled water system in a high-rise building. The site test results show that the temperature set-point given by the proposed strategy is reliable and the system temperature difference is significantly raised by eliminating the deficit flow problem. When compared to the conventional control strategies, 78% of the total chilled water pump energy was saved in the test period. The actual pump energy saving percentage could be 39% in a year after implementing the robust control strategy in the studied system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Temporary housings play an important role by providing people a habitable environment while the effects of a disaster are being fixed. In this paper, life cycle energy and cost analysis of two common types of post-disaster temporary housings constructed in Turkey has been studied. The aim of this study was to identify whether it is more convenient to use prefabricated (PH) or container housings (CH) in post disaster reconstruction projects. Construction and operational energy requirements are calculated over 15 years using a comprehensive approach. The energy and financial requirements of the housings have been evaluated by considering four different base areas. The life cycle investment, operation, maintenance, service and end of life costs have been investigated by using the net present value technique. Life cycle primary energy consumption values of the most widely used prefabricated (PH70) and container (CH2O) housings are calculated to be 18.5 and 24.7 GJ/m(2), respectively. The results show that operational phase was dominant over the housings 15-year lifetime. The life cycle cost of PH70 and CH2O are calculated to be 919 and 1308 $/m(2), respectively. It is found that increasing the total base area of the housings is an important cost-effective energy reduction measure. The results expressed that prefabricated housings have 25.1 and 29.7% lower life cycle energy and cost requirements respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Direct expansion solar-assisted heat pump system (DX-SAHP) is promising in energy saving applications, but the performance of DX-SAHP under frosting conditions is rarely reported in the published literatures. In this paper, a DX-SAHP system with bare solar collectors for space heating is designed and experimentally investigated in the enthalpy difference lab with a solar simulator. The system is tested under a range of frosting conditions, with the ambient temperatures from 7 degrees C to -3 degrees C, the relative humidities of 50%, 70% and 90% and the solar irradiances of 0 W/m(2), 100 W/m(2), 200 W/m(2) and 300 W/m(2). The conditions when the DX-SAHP system frosts are studied. Results show that solar irradiance as low as 100 W/m(2) can totally prevent frosting when the ambient temperature is above -3 degrees C and the relative humidity is 70%. Besides, the frosting process is observed to be slower than that of fin-and-tube heat exchangers. The evaporator is not seriously frosted and the system performance is not significantly influenced after 360 min of continuous operating. Moreover the effects of ambient parameters, including the ambient temperature and the relative humidity, especially solar irradiation, on the system performance are studied and analyzed. Solar irradiation can effectively prevent or retard frosting, and also improve the heating performance of the DX-SAHP system. The DX-SAHP system is proved to be applicable under frosting conditions.

Abstract: In the present study, porous TiO2 foams (PTF) were prepared by particle-stabilized emulsion method. The samples having solid contents ranging from 20 wt.% to 35 wt.% were prepared and successfully impregnated with paraffin without using a surfactant. SEM images showed that the prepared PTFs had three-dimensional interpenetrating structures with good porosities. The pore structure and morphology of PTF was markedly influenced by the solid content. With increase in solid content, porosity decreased, along with a decrease in the homologous encapsulation ratio of paraffin. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) evaluated the thermal properties of the paraffin/PTF (PTFP) composites. DSC results showed that with a solid content of 20 wt.%, the paraffin adsorption reached 62 vol.% and latent heat of the composite PCM was 94.05 Jig after 200 melting/freezing cycles. TGA results showed that the form-stable composite PCMs had good thermal stabilities. In order to further enhance the thermal conductivity and improve the adsorption capacity of PTF, sucrose was added to the emulsion and carbonized in situ to form carbon/PTF (PTFC). This could also be successfully impregnated with paraffin to obtain the form-stable composite paraffin/PTFC (PTFCP). The TEM images and results of XPS analysis confirmed that the surfaces of TiO2 particles were covered with a 2 nm thick carbon film (C/TiO2). The thermal conductivity of PTFCP increased from 0.302 W/m K to 1.059 W/m K compared to PTFP, along with a further improvement in adsorption capacity. Furthermore, the results of FT-IR analysis and thermal cyclic tests showed that the form-stable composite PCMs had good chemical stability and thermal reliability after 200 melting/freezing cycles. Therefore, the prepared form-stable composite PCMs having excellent pore structures, thermal properties, thermal reliabilities, and chemical stabilities are promising PCM candidates for heat energy storage applications.

Abstract: The construction of pipelines along high-throughput fuel corridors can alleviate demand for rail, barge, and truck transportation. Pipelines have a very different externality profile than other freight transportation modes due to differences in construction, operation, and maintenance requirements; labor, energy, and material input intensity; location and profile of emissions from operations; and frequency and magnitude of environmental and safety incidents. Therefore, public policy makers have a strong justification to influence the economic viability of pipelines. We use data from prior literature and U.S. government statistics to estimate environmental, public health, and safety characterization factors for pipelines and other modes.
In 2008, two pipeline companies proposed the construction of an ethanol pipeline from the Midwest to Northeast United States. This proposed project informs our case study of a 2735-km $3.5 billion pipeline (2009 USD), for which we evaluate potential long-term societal impacts including life-cycle costs, greenhouse gas emissions, employment, injuries, fatalities, and public health impacts. Although it may take decades to break even economically, and would result in lower cumulative employment, such a pipeline would likely have fewer safety incidents, pollution emissions, and health damages than the alternative multimodal system in less than ten years; these results stand even if comparing future cleaner ground transport modes to a pipeline that utilizes electricity produced from coal. Monetization of externalities can significantly enhance the value of a pipeline to society. In this study, a pipeline with a construction cost of $1.37 million/km in 2014 USD and a NPV of revenue over 22.2 years of $1.85 million/km would be associated with $0.5-$1.3 million/km in avoided negative externalities the majority of which are expected from avoided air pollution-related deaths ($0.26-$1.0 million/km) and avoided GHG emissions ($0.12-$0.19 million/km).

Abstract: High-efficiency and low-emission low temperature combustion modes including homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) are limited at high load conditions due to rapid pressure rise rate, short combustion duration and ringing operation. This study uses two different HCCI engines to investigate combustion-generated ringing at a number of HCCI engine operating points between misfire and ringing zones for ethanol and n-heptane fuels. Ringing intensity (RI) is investigated along with main HCCI combustion parameters and engine-out emissions. The results show the RI generally increases by advancing crank angle of 50% fuel burnt (CA50) and also decreasing burn duration (BD). It is found that adjusting CA50 can provide a control knob for the RI since all the extreme noisy data points have CA50 < 9 CAD aTDC. In-cylinder pressure at 5, 10, 15 CAD aTDC (P-5,P-10 and P-15) and maximum in-cylinder pressure (P-max) show strong correlation with RI. To this end, P-5, P-10 and P-15 and P-max are used to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict RI. Experimental data at 155 steady-state points are used to evaluate the ANN model for two totally different HCCI engines running with high and low octane fuels. The validation results indicate that the ANN model can predict RI with less than 4.2% error. The ANN model can be used to identify HCCI ringing operation for combustion control applications.

Abstract: The integrated management of sludge and bio-waste by co-digestion and composting were investigated in a life cycle perspective. The working operations of a full-scale digester of an existing wastewater treatment plant for waste-mixed sludge (WMS) stabilization were reproduced using a pilot-scale apparatus. The effect of WMS co-digested with fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) was investigated at different organic loading rates (OLR), from 1.46 kg VS/m(3) day to 2.8 kg VS/m(3) day, and at reduced hydraulic retention time, from 14 days to about 10 days. Methane production per unit of digester volume increased from about 140 NL/m(3) day to a maximum of about 900 NL/m(3) day when OLR was increased from 1.46 kg VS/m(3) day to 2.1 kg VS/m(3) day. The maximum electrical energy producible from the full-scale anaerobic facility was about 3,500,000 kW h/year. In these conditions the electrical power output and the net efficiency of the co-generator were 470 kW and 37%, respectively. The life cycle analysis study highlighted the benefits achievable in terms of avoided resource depletion and ozone depletion potential. The best environmental performances were for an ORL of 2.1 kg VS/m(3) day. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy services play a key role in increasing energy efficiency in the industry. The key actors in these services are the local and regional energy companies that are increasingly implementing energy services as part of their market offering and developing service portfolios. Although expectations for energy services have been high, progress has so far been limited, and many companies offering energy services, including energy companies, are experiencing difficulties in implementing energy services and providing them to the market. Overall, this research examines what is needed for local and regional energy companies to successfully implement energy services (and consequently provide them to the market). In doing this, a two-stage process is used: first, we identify key activities for the successful implementation of energy services, and second, we aggregate the findings to the business model level. This research demonstrates that to succeed in implementing energy services, an energy company may need to renew parts or all of its existing product-based business model, formulate a new business model, or develop coexisting multiple business models. By discussing two distinct business model innovation processes, this research demonstrates that there can be different paths to success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Rural electrification in developing countries is often hampered by major information gaps between local communities and urban centers, where technical expertise and funding are concentrated. The tool presented in this paper addresses these gaps to support the implementation of off-grid micro hydropower infrastructure. Specifically, we present a method to site, size and evaluate the potential for micro hydropower based on remote sensing data. The method improves on previous approaches by (i) incorporating the effect of hillslope topography on the optimal layout of the infrastructure, and (ii) accounting for the constraints imposed by streamfiow variability and local electricity demand on the optimal size of the plants.
An assessment of the method's performance against 148 existing schemes indicates that it correctly identifies the most promising locations for hydropower in Nepal, but does not generally reproduce the specific design features of constructed plants, which are affected by site-specific constraints. We develop a proof-of-concept computer tool to explore the potential of webGIS technology to account for these constraints by collecting site-specific information from local users.

Abstract: Packed-bed of rocks using air as heat transfer fluid (HTF) are identified as a promising alternative and cost effective solution for thermal energy storage (TES) in concentrating solar power plants (CSP). Desert sands, igneous and other rocks are being intensively tested for heat storage at high temperature. This paper focuses on the study of several candidate rocks for heat storage. Thirteen samples are collected from diverse places in Morocco and thermally cycled between 20 degrees C and 650 degrees C. The chemical and thermo-physical properties influencing the lifetime of rocks are identified. Vickers hardness test has been used to evaluate the compressive strength of the samples and the effect of thermo-mechanical stress during thermal cycling. The obtained results show that quartz and calcite are the principal minerals controlling rock physical properties. Limestone, marble and granite have not withstood thermal cycling. Their hardness decreases after each cycle. Rhyolite and quartzitic sandstone show excellent ability during thermal cycling. When comparing their principal characteristics, rhyolite seems to be the most promising candidate for high temperature TES. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The availability of smart metering and smart appliances enables detecting and characterising appliance use in a household, quantifying energy savings through efficient appliance use and predicting appliance-specific demand from load measurements is possible. With growing electric kettle ownership and usage, lack of any efficiency labelling guidelines for the kettle, slow technological progress in improving kettle efficiency relative to other domestic appliances, and current consumer attitudes, urgent investigation into consumer kettle usage patterns is warranted. From an efficiency point of view, little can be done about the kettle, which is more efficient than other methods of heating water such as the stove top kettle. However, since a majority households use the kettle inefficiently by overfilling, in order to meet energy targets, it is imperative to quantify inefficient usage and predict demand. For the purposes of scalability, we propose tools that depend only on load measurement data for quantifying and visualising kettle usage and energy consumption, assessing energy wastage through overfilling via our proposed electric kettle model, and predicting kettle-specific demand, from which we can estimate potential energy savings in a household and across a housing stock. This is demonstrated using data from a longitudinal study across a sample of 14 UK households for a two-year period.(1) (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper discusses the development of hybrid electricity supply system (HESS) for a remote community, which takes our previous study some steps further. Previously, we have proposed a PV-based system to electrify 24 houses during the dry and wet seasons. While this system can support the users' demand during the dry season due to high solar irradiance, load reduction is inevitable during the rainy season to manage the available electricity. The users will be constrained to limit the operation of certain appliances, especially the fridges during such a period. Therefore, this new study introduces a diesel generator to the existing PV model to create the HESS, which is expected to address the load reduction issue, thus, meeting the users' worst-case demand at all the seasons. The HESS is modeled in DIgSILENT environment; the design methodologies and analyses are based on the global engineering standards and practical experience. Its techno-economic and environmental performances are then compared with those of PV-only and diesel-only systems for decision-making. Results reveal that the HESS is a better option in terms of ensuring the maximum comfort of the users during the two seasons, with relatively higher reliability. Though it has the highest initial capital cost, its life cycle cost, fuel consumption and carbon footprint are lower than the values obtained for the diesel-only option. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: As a type of sustainable energy, compressed air energy can be used to drive vehicles, which is applicable to situations requiring explosion prevention and no pollution emissions, including chemical plants and airports. As a key component of an air-driven hydraulic vehicle, an air-driven hydraulic transformer, which is called a hydropneumatic (HP) transformer, is used to pump high-pressure oil for such a vehicle's hydraulic system. To improve the power and efficiency of the HP transformer, in this paper, firstly, a mathematical model of its working process was developed. Secondly, to verify the mathematical model, a dedicated test bench for the HP transformer was established and studied. Through experimental and simulation of the designed HP transformer when the input air pressure, output oil pressure and area ratio are regulated within the ranges of 0.625-0.75 MPa, 1.7-2.2 MPa and 3-5 respectively, it can be concluded that the mathematical model developed in this study is accurate. Furthermore, to improve the output power of the HP transformer, the input air pressure, output oil pressure and area ratio should be increased. Additionally, decreasing the input air pressure from 0.75 MPa to 0.625 MPa may improve the efficiency of the transformer by 14%, increasing the output pressure from 1.7 MPa to 2.2 MPa may improve the efficiency of the transformer by 3%, and decreasing the area ratio of the pistons from 5 to 3 may improve the efficiency of the transformer by 10%. This study can be referred to as the performance and design optimization of air-driven hydraulic HP transformers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The socio-economic crisis of the past few years has led to a progressive and marked decline in the production of coal power plants in Europe. This situation affects the regions where coal is the main traditional energy source. Energy from forests is considered to be a good alternative to coal. The exploitation of forest biomass in these regions could counteract the negative effects posed by the marked decline in traditional coal mining activities. Given the abundance of forest in Asturias, Spains main coal mining area, the present work was conducted on the Central Coal Basin (CCB). This study focuses on the territory of the mining areas within the CCB, known as municipalities. The main goal was to evaluate the existing biomass resources in order to assess its sustainable energy potential and its replicability in other coal mining regions in Europe. The multiscale methodology used considers a combination of mass, energy and costs of the biomass available, to estimate the bioenergy obtainable and the assessment of the techno-economic feasibility of solid biofuel production as a source of alternative energy. A detailed evaluation of forest residues was carried out including the economic and environmental constraints. The average collection efficiency was 43.0% resulting in an estimated biomass total cost of 84.10 6/dry t. Finally, the conclusion was made to locate the Biomass Logistic Centre (BLC) in Oviedo due to its favourable technical, economical and geographical characteristics. The proposed BLC would have a production capacity of 17 dry kt/year of pellets, 8 dry kt/year of wood chips and 3 dry kt/year of briquettes, of which 40% (31 dry kt/year) would be collected within a 50 km radius. Such production would avoid 51 kt/year of CO2 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to propose an approach for statistical assessment of the potential of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) ancillary services, where it focuses on PEVs doing daily home-work commuting. In this approach, the possible ancillary services (A/S) for each PEV fleet in terms of its available V2G power (AVP) and flexible intervals are identified. The flexible interval is calculated using a powerful stochastic global optimization technique so-called "Free Pattern Search" (FPS). A probabilistic method is also proposed to quantify the impacts of PEV's availability uncertainty using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and interdependency of stochastic variables on AVP of each fleet thanks to a multivariate modeling with Copula function. Each fleet is analyzed based on its aggregated PEV numbers at different level of distribution grid, in order to satisfy the ancillary services localization limitation. A case study using the proposed approach evaluates the real potential in Niort, a city in west of France. In fact, by using the proposed approach an aggregator can analyze the V2G potential of PEVs under its contract. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The gas diffusion layer (GDL) is a key component of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell due to its role as a pathway for fuel, air, and water. GDL determines the mass balance and water management in the PEM fuel cell. Thus, an investigation of the optimal structural characteristics of the GDL with improved water management is important to ensure high performance of the PEM fuel cell. In this study, a PEM fuel cell model that considers the structural characteristics of GDL is developed, and the various the GDL structural characteristics are analyzed and validated. Specifically, the effects of pore size variation in the substrate of the GDL on water management and cell performance are investigated. Two GDL samples with different pore sizes are evaluated according to the porosity, pore size, thickness, and internal contact angle to understand the basic structural characteristics of the GDL. The GDL structural parameters with the basic characteristics are incorporated into the developed model. The cell performance is predicted to be relative to the two-phase mass transport inside the GDL. The characteristics of the micro-porous layer (MPL) and MPL penetration part are found to be affected by the variation in the macro-pore size of the substrate. The water management capability of the GDL varies with these differences with respect to water retention and removal characteristics. Under the condition of relative humidity (RH) 100%, the averaged saturation value of the MPL and MPL penetration part of the GDL with small macro-pore in the substrate is 18.8% higher than that of the GDL with large macro-pore in the substrate. The cell performance is also affected by the operating conditions of relative humidity and current load. The voltage of the GDL with small macro-pore in the substrate at the current density of 1.6 A/cm(2) is 10.3% lower than that of the GDL with large macro-pore in the substrate under RH 100%.

Abstract: The high-temperature blast furnace slag is conventionally treated by water quenching (WQ) method with enormous waste heat unrecovered. To address this issue, dry slag granulation (DSG) technology has been proposed to recover the waste heat from molten slag. Before commercial implementation, the sustain ability and feasibility of the DSG should be well assessed. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted on a designed DSG prototype system in commercial scale. The environmental sustainability and economic benefit of DSG are evaluated and compared with the WQ systems. The LCA results reveal that the DSG can potentially reduce the energy and resource consumptions by 150 kg-coal-eq/t-slag and 1547 kg/t-slag, respectively. The analysis on environment impact also clarifies that the DSG is an environmentally friendly method for slag treatment. Furthermore, the DSG method represents a possibility to recover the heat from high-temperature blast furnace slag and turn it into a valuable material with a profit of 92.9$/t-slag.

Abstract: The current EU energy efficiency directive 2012/27/EU defines the existing building stocks as one of the most promising potential sector for achieving energy saving. Robust methodologies aimed to quantify the potential reduction of energy consumption for large building stocks need to be developed. To this purpose, a benchmarking analysis is necessary in order to support public planners in determining how well a building is performing, in setting credible targets for improving performance or in detecting abnormal energy consumption. In the present work, a novel methodology is proposed to perform a benchmarking analysis particularly suitable for heterogeneous samples of buildings. The methodology is based on the estimation of a statistical model for energy consumption - the Linear Mixed Effects Model -, so as to account for both the fixed effects shared by all individuals within a dataset and the random effects related to particular groups/classes of individuals in the population. The groups of individuals within the population have been classified by resorting to a supervised learning technique. Under this backdrop, a Monte Carlo simulation is worked out to compute the frequency distribution of annual energy consumption and identify a reference value for each group/class of buildings. The benchmarking analysis was tested for a case study of 100 out-patient Healthcare Centres in Northern Italy, finally resulting in 12 different frequency distributions for space and Domestic Hot Water heating energy consumption, one for each class of homogeneous class of buildings. From the median value of each frequency distribution, reference values were extracted to be used in a benchmarking analysis. Beyond being flexible, open and upgradeable over time, a benchmarking analysis relying on both a sound statistical basis and on stochastic simulation is indeed able to overcome the limitations of the more common deterministic or one-dimensional bench marking approach.

Abstract: In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is utilized to implement a tri-objective design of a grid independent PV/Wind/Split-diesel/Battery hybrid energy system for a typical residential building with the objective of minimizing the Life Cycle Cost (LCC), CO2 emissions and dump energy. To achieve some of these objectives, small split Diesel generators are used in place of single big Diesel generator and are aggregable based on certain set of rules depending on available renewable energy resources and state of charge of the battery. The algorithm was utilized to study five scenarios (PV/Battery, Wind/Battery, Single big Diesel generator, aggregable 3-split Diesel generators, PV/Wind/Split-diesel/Battery) for a typical load profile of a residential house using typical wind and solar radiation data. The results obtained revealed that the PV/Wind/Split-diesel/Battery is the most attractive scenario (optimal) having LCC of $11,273, COE of 0.13 ($/kW h), net dump energy of 3 MW h, and net CO2 emission of 13,273 kg. It offers 46%, 28%, 82% and 94% reduction in LCC, COE, CO2 emission and dump energy respectively when compared to a single big Diesel generator scenario. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Air-cooled condensers are widely used for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plants where cooling water is unavailable or too costly, but they are then vulnerable to changing ambient air temperatures especially in continental climates, where the air temperature difference between winter and summer can be over 40 degrees C. A conventional ORC system using a single component working fluid has to be designed according to the maximum air temperature in summer and thus operates far from optimal design conditions for most of the year, leading to low annual average efficiencies. This research proposes a novel dynamic ORC that uses a binary zeotropic mixture as the working fluid, with mechanisms in place to adjust the mixture composition dynamically during operation in response to changing heat sink conditions, significantly improving the overall efficiency of the plant. The working principle of the dynamic ORC concept is analysed. The case study results show that the annual average thermal efficiency can be improved by up to 23% over a conventional ORC when the heat source is 100 degrees C, while the evaluated increase of the capital cost is less than 7%. The dynamic ORC power plants are particularly attractive for low temperature applications, delivering shorter payback periods compared to conventional ORC systems. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract: Aiming at the undesirable output (CO2 emission) and non-separable inputs and outputs, we employ a non-separable input/output SBM model to measure China's provincial green economic efficiency during 1995-2012. Empirical results indicate that (i) there are larger interregional differences in green economic efficiencies. The highest efficiency of 0.7339 is recorded at the southern coastal region, followed by those at the eastern coastal and northern coastal regions. The lowest efficiency only reaches 0.3049 at the northwestern region. (ii) Energy and CO2 emission are the key factors for green economic efficiencies. (iii) Different regions have different energy-saving and CO2 emission reduction potentials. The southern coastal region should at least save energy of 4.7 million tons of standard coal. The middle Yellow River, northern coastal and northeast regions should save energy as much as 62, 60, 51 million tons of standard coal. CO2 emission excess in the middle Yellow River region reaches 450 million tons in 2012, while CO2 emission excess in the southern coastal region is only 12 million tons. Finally, we propose some target policies to improve China's regional green economic efficiencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Renewable energy generation plays an important role in exploiting renewable energy towards green economy. The electricity market should be not only reevaluated with the coming of renewable energy, but also modified for maintaining market fairness and better utilization of renewable energy. Based on a Stackelberg game model, this paper puts forward a closed-form analysis on wind power producer's (WPP's) behavior in the electricity market involving large scale wind power. The WPP acts as a price maker in DA market and a deviator in RT balancing market. The analytical expression of WPP's behavior indicates how a WPP takes an action under various market regulations and statuses, including bidding regulations, deviation settlements, demand elasticity, market capacity, and renewable subsidy. Furthermore, the two-part compound bidding mode is verified and recommended for restraining WPP's market power when considering ramping constraints of conventional units. The presented models are validated using real-world data based on the IEEE 118-bus test system. Conclusions provide beneficial references for policy formulation of electricity market involving large scale wind power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work a detailed investigation of the hysteresis behavior of the open circuit voltage (OCV) in a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cathode-based lithium-ion cell is presented. For the first time the hysteresis behavior of the OCV in a LiFePO4 cell is investigated in detail, taking the aging state of the cells into account as a fundamental factor. Tests were carried out in a time window of more than two years on cells in different aging states. The dependency of the major and minor loops of the OCV on temperature, current rate, short-term history and aging are shown and deeply discussed. The results show that the characteristics of the hysteresis of the OCV change completely during battery lifetime, not only concerning the major OCV boundaries but also regarding the single minor loops obtained through partial charge/discharge processes. The paper discusses the results considering different approaches presented in the literature published by date, and addresses the necessity of understanding the physic-chemical behavior of the cell in order to correctly determine the battery state in the application.

Abstract: When it is necessary to select the best location to implant an onshore wind farm, the criteria that influence the decision-making are not always numerical values but can also include qualitative criteria in the form of labels or linguistic variables which can be represented through fuzzy membership. In this paper, some fuzzy approaches of different Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods are combined in order to deal with a trending decision problem such as onshore wind farm site selection. More specifically, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied to obtain the weights of the criteria, whereas the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) is used to evaluate the alternatives. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is applied to obtain the database of the alternatives and criteria which are transformed in a fuzzy decision matrix through triangular fuzzy numbers. The coast of the Murcia Region, located at the Southeast of Spain, has been chosen as the study area to carry out this evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Replacement of air-cooled chillers with water-cooled chillers for air-conditioning plants in existing buildings can yield a significant amount of energy savings, especially in a sub-tropical climate. However, due to variations in weather conditions and building operation patterns, the amount of actual energy saving is often uncertain in these retrofits. These uncertainties impose a risk of saving shortfalls when Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) guarantee building owners for a certain amount of energy savings in Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) projects. This study presents a probabilistic approach to estimating a range of possible energy savings with the associated confidence levels for chiller replacement in existing buildings, taking into account the annual variations in the influential parameters affecting energy savings. The influential factors include building cooling loads, system control and operation systems, as well as chiller plant characteristics. The proposed approach involves: the use of correlation analysis for identifying influential parameters; EnergyPlus for simulating energy use of chiller plant; and a Monte Carlo approach for simulating the probability of post-retrofit energy savings. A commercial building where the air-cooled chillers were replaced with water-cooled chillers is used to illustrate the proposed approach. Results show that the variations in annual energy savings for chiller replacement projects can be estimated with a defined degree of certainty. In the case study project, the possible annual energy savings during the post-retrofit period range from 1,149,000 kWh (37.6% of baseline consumption) to 1,504,000 kWh (49.2% of ditto) at 90% statistical significance. The risk mitigation measures for this type of energy retrofit are discussed as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Driven by renewable energy and being environment friendly, the absorption air-conditioning system is a good choice for green buildings. Concentrating the absorbent solution with electrodialysis method, the membrane regeneration absorption system has higher performance than the traditional absorption system. Its theoretical coefficient of performance can approach 6 under certain working conditions. However, the experimental data in this paper reveals the actual coefficient of performance of the membrane regeneration system is about 1-2, much lower than expected. It is caused by the energy loss in heating and electrochemical reactions. To improve, a capacitive deionization regeneration method is proposed: strong absorbent solution and pure water are acquired with the joint work of two units. Analysis has been made on the absorption air-conditioning system adopting this method. The mass and energy equations have been developed and some parameters have been investigated for performance optimization. Even with conservative prediction, the results show the capacitive deionization method has better performance than the membrane regeneration method. The coefficient of performance can be enhanced by 100% with the energy recovery strategy. Capacitive deionization method also has advantages on the cost and maintenance, which makes it a promising choice for the absorption air-conditioning system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Both methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are major greenhouse gases (GHGs); hence, effective processes are required for their conversion into useful products. CH4 is used by a few groups of methanotrophs to produce methanol. However, to achieve economical and sustainable CH4 reduction strategies, additional strains are needed that can exploit natural CH4 feed stocks. In this study, we evaluated methanol production by Methylosinus sporium from CH4 and synthetic gas. The optimum pH, temperature, incubation period, substrate, reaction volume to headspace ratio, and phosphate buffer concentration were determined to be 6.8, 30 C, 24 h, 50% CH4, 1:5, and 100 mM (with 20 mM MgC12 [a methanol dehydrogenase inhibitor]), respectively. Optimization of the production conditions and process parameters significantly improved methanol production from 0.86 mM to 5.80 mM. Covalent immobilization of M. sporium on Chitosan significantly improved the stability and reusability for up to 6 cycles of reuse under batch culture conditions. The immobilized cells utilized a synthetic gas mixture containing CH4, CO2, and hydrogen (at a ratio of 6:3:1) more efficiently than free cells, with a maximum methanol production of 6.12 mM. This is the first report of high methanol production by M. sporium covalently immobilized on a solid support from a synthetic gas mixture. Utilization of cost-effective feedstocks derived from natural resources will be an economical and environmentally friendly way to reduce the harmful effects of GHGs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Most of the current Stirling-type pulse tube refrigerators (PTRs) adopt inertance tubes with large reservoirs for phase shifting. Recovering the acoustic power dissipated in the inertance tube provides a great potential for improving the efficiency of a PTR. In this study, an inertance tube PTR is modified by replacing the dissipative inertance tube and reservoir with a mass-spring displacer directly coupled to a compression space. Numerical simulations are conducted on both the PTRs based on a validated onedimensional computational fluid dynamics model. Optimization of the inertance tube PTR shows that the coefficient of performance (COP) is limited within 0.103 at the cooling temperature of 77 K. The simulation of the PTR with the feedback mechanism indicates that COP can be significantly improved due to the extra power recovered by the mass-spring displacer. The parametric analyses of the moving mass, spring stiffness, mechanical resistance, piston diameter, and working frequency of the mass-spring displacer are finally performed. The phase relations at both ends of the regenerator are significantly influenced by the geometric and operating parameters, which further affect the performance. The designing parameters have been optimized, COP reaches about 0.13-0.14 with the relative Carnot COP of around 0.4. It demonstrates that adopting the mass-spring displacer to feed the expansion power back into the compression space is an effective way of improving the performance of Nits. This work provides comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and characteristics of the PTRs with the mass-spring displacer. It would be helpful for future designs of such systems.

Abstract: This study presents the effect of biomass origin on the yield, nanostructure and reactivity of soot. Soot was produced from wood and herbaceous biomass pyrolysis at high heating rates and at temperatures of 1250 and 1400 degrees C in a drop tube furnace. The structure of solid residues was characterized by electron microscopy techniques, X-ray diffraction and N2 adsorption. The reactivity of soot was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. Results showed that soot generated at 1400 degrees C was more reactive than soot generated at 1250 degrees C for all biomass types. Pinewood, beechwood and wheat straw soot demonstrated differences in alkali content, particle size and nanostructure. Potassium was incorporated in the soot matrix and significantly influenced soot reactivity. Pinewood soot particles produced at 1250 degrees C had a broader particle size range (27.2-263 nm) compared to beechwood soot (33.2-102 nm) and wheat straw soot (11.5-165.3 nm), and contained mainly multi-core structures.

Abstract: Seasonal cold storage using natural cold sources for cooling is a sustainable cooling technique. However, this technique suffers from limitations such as large storage space and poor reliability. Combining seasonal storage with short-term storage might be a promising solution while it is not explored sufficiently. This paper presents a compound cold storage system that combines a heat pipe-based seasonal ice storage system with a chilled water storage system. The seasonal ice storage system automatically charges winter cold energy in the form of ice. In summer, the stored ice is extracted for cooling, and then the melting ice is used as a chilling medium for chilled water storage. Design optimization of the seasonal ice storage system and the compound storage system is addressed, including the sizes of heat pipes, the configuration and volume of the cold storage tank and the chiller capacity. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the design and the application of the proposed system in a real building in Beijing. Results show that the appropriate combination of the two types of cold storage can greatly improve the applicability of the seasonal cold storage and reduce the life-cycle cost of a building cooling system by 40%.

Abstract: To reduce the uncertain influence of wind power and solar photovoltaic power on virtual power plant (VPP) operation, robust optimization theory (ROT) is introduced to build a stochastic scheduling model for VPP considering the uncertainty, price-based demand response (PBDR) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR). First, the VPP components are described including the wind power plant (WPP), photovoltaic generators (PV), convention gas turbine (CGT), energy storage systems (ESSs) and demand resource providers (DRPs). Then, a scenario generation and reduction frame is proposed for analyzing and simulating output stochastics based on the interval method and the Kantorovich distance. Second, a bi-level robust scheduling model is proposed with a double robust coefficient for WPP and PV. In the upper layer model, the maximum VPP operation income is taken as the optimization objective for building the scheduling model with the day-ahead prediction output of WPP and PV. In the lower layer model, the day-ahead scheduling scheme is revised with the actual output of the WPP and PV under the objectives of the minimum system net load and the minimum system operation cost. Finally, the independent micro-grid in a coastal island in eastern China is used for the simulation analysis. The results illustrate that the model can overcome the influence of uncertainty on VPP operations and reduce the system power shortage cost by connecting the day-ahead scheduling with the real-time scheduling. ROT could provide a flexible decision tool for decision makers, effectively addressing system uncertainties. ESSs could replace CGT to provide backup service for the WPP and PV, to smooth the VPP output curve and to improve the WPP and PV grid connection by its charging-discharging characteristics. Meanwhile, IBDR and PBDR could smooth the load curve to the maximum extent, link the generation side with the demand side to minimize abandoned power value and reach the optimum benefit of VPP operation.

Abstract: In this paper a new method for the evaluation and comparison of potential future electricity systems is presented. The German electricity system in the year 2050 is used as an example. Based on a comprehensive scenario analysis defining a corridor for possible shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources (FRES) residual loads are calculated in a unified manner. The share of electricity from PV and wind power plants in Germany in the year 2050 is in a range of 42-122% and the load demand has a bandwidth of around 460-750 TWh. The residual loads are input for an algorithm that defines a supplementary mix of technologies providing flexibility to the system. The overall system layout guarantees the balance of generation and demand at all times. Due to the fact that the same method for residual load calculation and mixture of technologies is applied for all scenarios, a good comparability is guaranteed and we are able to identify key characteristics for future developments. The unique feature of the new algorithms presented here is the very fast calculation for a year-long simulation with hourly or shorter time steps taking into account the state of charge or availability of all storage and flexibility technologies. This allows an analysis of many different scenarios on a macro-economic level, variation of input parameters can easily be done, and extensive sensitivity analysis is possible. Furthermore different shares of FRES, CO2-emission targets, interest rates or social acceptance of certain technologies can be included. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by an analysis of potential German power system layouts with a base scenario of 90% CO2-reduction target compared to 1990 and by the identification of different options for a power sector with a high degree of decarbonisation. The approach also aims at a very high level of transparency both regarding the algorithms and regarding the input parameters of the different technologies taken into account. Therefore this paper also gives a comprehensive and complete overview on the technology parameters used. The forecast on all technologies for the year 2050 regarding technical and economic parameters was made in a comprehensive consultation process with more than 100 experts representing academia and industry working on all different technologies. An extensive analysis of options for the design of potential German energy supply systems in 2050 based on the presented methodology will be published in a follow-up paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: We developed a strategy for the catalytic production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels (butene oligomers) from cellulose and hemicellulose, which are the major fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. In this strategy the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions are separated through a pretreatment step and then converted to levulinic acid (LA) by monophasic and biphasic reactions using 2-sec-butylphenol (SBP) solvent respectively. The LA is upgraded catalytically to gamma-valerolactone (GVL), and subsequently to butene oligomers. To design the integrated strategy, we developed separation subsystems to satisfy the optimized feed concentration for catalytic conversions and to recycle solvents (SBP). To satisfy energy requirements for our process from combustion of biomass residues, we designed a heat exchanger network (HEN) for minimum energy consumption by maximizing heat recovery from the process streams. Our technoeconomic evaluation shows that the integrated strategy using corn stover feedstock results in a minimum selling price of $3.71 per gallon of gasoline equivalent for butene oligomers if using the best possible parameters.

Abstract: Designing envelope configurations of office building with the low construction cost and energy consumption is a discrete optimization problem. The configuration is currently determined merely on architects' experiences resulting in an inefficient expense or by building energy performance simulation which is time-intensive and involves complex processes. Based on an efficient regression equation to substitute complex energy simulators, this study developed an Office Building envelope Energy performance and configuration Model (OBEM) to provide envelope configurations, including construction material, sunshade type, sunshade length, window number, and window length and width for architects' reference. Also, Tabu search, which is effective in solving discrete optimization problems, was integrated with OBEM into an Optimal OBEM decision support system (OPOBEM). The OPOBEM was applied to a real office building construction for optimizing its envelope configuration at minimum construction budget under the energy conservation regulations of green buildings. The result shows that the optimized installation of sunshade type efficiently reduces solar heat gain according to the high variation of the sunshade coefficient, thus achieves the goal of energy conservation and reduces the envelope costs. Compared with architects' manual estimation, the optimized envelope design realizes nearly 41% budget savings, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed OPOBEM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Inbicon's lignocellulose-to-bioethanol technology is assessed in terms of its environmental and economic performance within this article. This is done under various scenarios to identify the influence of locations, raw materials and plant setups on the results. In all scenarios the specific GHG emissions of the bioethanol production are 50% below those of the fossil reference fuel, some scenarios even reach a GHG mitigation of over 60%. In many scenarios specific production costs are reached that are in the range or below those of conventional bioethanol today. But low emissions and low costs remain contradictory targets to a great extent. However, using C5 sugars in co-fermentation to produce bioethanol and the also generated biogas as an internal heat source seems to be a good compromise and leads to both relatively low costs of 27.2 EUR GJ(-1) and low emissions of 28.3 kg CO2-eq. GJ(-1). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Distributed energy systems (DES) can help in achieving less carbon-intensive energy systems through efficiency gains over centralized power systems. This paper presents a novel optimization framework that combines the optimal design and operation of distributed energy systems with calculations of electrical grid constraints and building energy use. The framework was used to investigate whether the negative impact of distributed generation on distribution grids can be mitigated and grid upgrades avoided by properly designing and determining operation strategies of DES.
Three new methods for integrating grid constraints were developed based on different combinations of a genetic algorithm and a mixed-integer linear programme. A case study is defined in order to analyze the optimality, accuracy of power flow calculation and solving performance of each method. The comparison showed that each method has advantages and disadvantages and should therefore be chosen based on the application and objectives.
The results showed that the electrical grid constraints have a significant impact on the optimal solutions, especially at high levels of renewable energy use, highlighting their importance in such optimization problems. The inclusion of such constraints directly in the operational scheduling achieved an additional 18% reduction in carbon emissions for a given cost compared to checking the validity of solutions a posteriori. Furthermore, by properly designing and determining operation schedules of DES, it is possible to integrated 40% more renewables without grid upgrades. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High-temperature heat storage is of growing importance for advanced solar energy utilization and waste heat recovery systems. Latent heat storage technology using alloys as phase change materials (PCM) is a promising option since it can achieve a thermal energy storage system with high heat storage density and high heat exchange rate because of the large latent heat and high thermal conductivity of metallic PCMs. Encapsulation of PCM is essential for its successful use, however, the encapsulation is very difficult owing to the high corrosivity of the metallic PCM and its volume expansion during the solid-liquid phase change. So far, the technology for encapsulating metallic PCMs has not been achieved. This study proposes the use of ceramic containers comprising a cap and a cup for macro-encapsulation of metallic PCMs, and a sealing method of the containers to endure the thermal stress from volume expansion during the phase change. The resulting PCM capsule has excellent corrosive resistance and cycling performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) may be one of the few cost-effective carbon-negative electricity technologies, but little work has focused on design of such systems. BECCS, like other bioenergy facilities, will likely exhibit economies of scale in capital costs, but diseconomies of scale in biomass transportation and supply costs. In this paper we develop a spatially explicit optimization framework to characterize the drivers of optimal sizing for potential BECCS facilities in Illinois. The approach leverages county-level biomass supply data, detailed road transportation networks, existing technology cost estimates, and previous geologic characterizations of long-term CO2 storage. Optimal scales are an order of magnitude larger than proposed scales found in existing literature. Biomass supply, scaling exponents, and technology costs are large drivers of optimal scale, while facility location, pretreatment options, and transportation costs are less important. When choosing between multiple facility locations, economies of scale support a centralized BECCS infrastructure. Deviations from optimal scaled size have little effect on overall systems costs - suggesting that other factors, including regulatory, political, or logistical considerations, may ultimately have a greater influence on plant size than the techno-economic factors we consider here.

Abstract: Flex Fuel Polygeneration (FFPG) is the use of multiple primary energy sources for the production of multiple energy carriers to achieve increased market opportunities. FFPG allows energy supply adjustments to meet market fluctuations and increase resilience to contingencies such as weather disruptions, technological changes, and variations in supply of energy resources. As an example of FFPG, we explored natural gas and municipal solid waste as the primary energy sources converted into electricity and transportation fuels as the energy carriers through the processes of anaerobic digestion, FischerTropsch synthesis (FTS), and combined cycle power. We combined previous techno-economic analyses of conventional energy production plants to obtain equipment and operating costs, and then evaluated the economic performance of the FFPG plant designs. We investigated the effect of changing operating parameters on economic performance of the baseline FTS and FFPG systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Significant changes in the power generation mix are posing new challenges for the balancing systems of the grid. Many of these challenges are in the secondary electricity grid regulation services and could be met through demand response (DR) services. We explore the opportunities for a water distribution system (WDS) to provide balancing services with demand response through pump scheduling and evaluate the associated benefits. Using a benchmark network and demand response mechanisms available in the UK, these benefits are assessed in terms of reduced green house gas (GHG) emissions from the grid due to the displacement of more polluting power sources and additional revenues for water utilities. The optimal pump scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer optimisation problem and solved using a branch and bound algorithm. This new formulation finds the optimal level of power capacity to commit to the provision of demand response for a range of reserve energy provision and frequency response schemes offered in the UK. For the first time we show that DR from WDS can offer financial benefits to WDS operators while providing response energy to the grid with less greenhouse gas emissions than competing reserve energy technologies. Using a Monte Carlo simulation based on data from 2014, we demonstrate that the cost of providing the storage energy is less than the financial compensation available for the equivalent energy supply. The GHG emissions from the demand, response provision from a WDS are also shown to be smaller than those of contemporary competing technologies such as open cycle gas turbines. The demand response services considered vary in their response time and duration as well as commitment requirements. The financial viability of a demand response service committed continuously is shown to be strongly dependent on the utilisation of the pumps and the electricity tariffs used by water utilities. Through the analysis of range of water demand scenarios and financial incentives using real market data, we demonstrate how a WDS can participate in a demand response scheme and generate financial gains and environmental benefits.

Abstract: Short-term load forecasting is important for power system generation planning and operation. For unit commitment and dispatch processes to incorporate uncertainty, a short-term load model must not only provide accurate load predictions but also enable the generation of reasonable probabilistic scenarios or uncertainty sets. This paper proposes a temporal and weather conditional epi-splines based load model (TWE) using functional approximation. TWE models the dependence of load on time and weather separately by functional approximation using epi-splines, conditional on season and area, in each segment of similar weather days. Load data are transformed from various day types to a specified reference day type among similar weather days in the same season and area, in order to enrich the data for capturing the non-weather dependent load pattern. In an instance derived from an Independent System Operator in the U.S., TWE not only provides accurate hourly load prediction and narrow bands of prediction errors, but also yields serial correlations among forecast hourly load values within a day that are similar to those of actual hourly load.

Abstract: Horizontal hydrokinetic energy can be harnessed using Steady Lift Technology (SLT) like turbines or Alternating Lift Technology (ALT) like the VIVACE Converter. Tidal/current turbines with low mechanical losses typically achieve about 30% peak power efficiency, which is equivalent to 50.6% power efficiency over the Betz limit at flow speed nearly 3.0 m/s. The majority of flows worldwide are slower than 1.0-1.5 m/s. Turbines also require large in-flow spacing resulting in farms of low power-to-volume density. Alternating-lift overcomes these challenges. The purpose of this study is to show that the ALT Converter is a three-dimensional energy absorber that efficiently works in river/ocean currents as slow as 1.0-1.5 m/s a range of velocities presently inaccessible to watermills and turbines. This novel converter utilizes flow-induced motions (FIM), which are potentially destructive phenomena for structures, enhances them, and converts hydrokinetic energy to electricity. It was invented in the Marine Renewable Energy Lab (MRELab) and patented through the University of Michigan. MRELab has been studying the effect of passive turbulence control (PTC) to enhance FIMs and to expand their synchronization range for energy harnessing. This study shows that multiple cylinders in proximity can synergistically work and harness more energy than the same number of a single cylinder in isolation. Estimation based on experiments, shows that a 4 PTC-cylinder Converter can achieve 88.6% peak efficiency of the Betz limit at flow speed slower than 1.0 m/s and power-to-volume density of 875 W/m(3) at 1.45 m/s. Thus, the Converter can efficiently harness energy from rivers and ocean current as slow as 0.8-1.5 m/s, with no upper limit in flow velocity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient methodology for the simulation-based multi-objective optimization problems, which addresses important limitations for the optimization of the building energy performance. In this work, a mono- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is coupled with EnergyPlus building energy simulation software to find a set of non-dominated solutions to enhance the building energy performance. To evaluate the capability and effectiveness of the approach, the developed method is applied to a single room model, and the effect of building architectural parameters including, the building orientation, the shading overhang specifications, the window size, and the glazing and the wall material properties on the building energy consumption are studied in four major climatic regions of Iran. In the optimization section, mono-criterion and multi-criteria optimization analyses of the annual cooling, heating, and lighting electricity consumption are examined to understand interactions between the objective functions and to minimize the annual total building energy demand. The achieved optimum solutions from the multi-objective optimization process are also reported as Pareto optimal fronts. Finally, the result of multi-criteria minimization is compared with the mono criterion ones. The results of the triple-objective optimization problem point out that for our typical model, the annual cooling electricity decreases about 19.8-33.3%; while the annual heating and lighting ones increase 1.7-4.8% and 0.5-2.6%, respectively, in comparison to the baseline model for four diverse climatic regions of Iran. In addition, the optimum design leads to 1.6-11.3% diminution of the total annual building electricity demand. The proposed optimization method shows a powerful and useful tool that can save time while searching for the optimal solutions with conflicting objective functions; therefore facilitate decision making in early phases of a building design in order to enhance its energy efficiency.

Abstract: To simplify the purification process of hot effluent gases produced by biomass and/or coal gasification, an integrated technique employing dual layer granular beds for the simultaneous removal of particulates and tar at high temperature (750-850 degrees C) has been proposed. Compared to the well studied process of particulate removal, investigations for the catalytic cracking of tar are inadequate. The present work conducted an experimental study of the catalytic cracking of tar based on two model compounds: toluene and methylnaphthalene. The experiments were conducted on a granular bed filter with an inner diameter of 40 mm and a height of 1000 mm. The catalytic cracking performances on an expanded perlite granule layer, an olivine granule layer, and a dual layer granular bed comprised of an upper layer of expanded perlite granules and a lower layer of olivine granules were investigated individually. It was found that the expanded perlite granule layer alone was effective for toluene cracking, and the efficiency was increased with increasing reaction temperature and gas residence time. The olivine granule layer provided excellent catalytic activity for toluene cracking. Furthermore, olivine granules exhibited significantly improved catalytic activity when calcinated at temperatures greater than 900 degrees C, or impregnated with NiO. The conversion efficiencies of toluene and methylnaphthalene attained values as great as 98.89% and 79.33%, respectively, at a temperature of 800 degrees C over a dual layer granular bed comprised of a 150 mm thick upper layer of expanded perlite granules and a 50 mm thick lower layer of 3 wt% NiO impregnated olivine granules.

Abstract: Hydrogen and fuel cells have the potential to play a significant role in the energy-mix network and providing a more sustainable future. Hydrogen is mainly produced from steam-reforming of natural gas and water electrolysis. However, it is suspected that the production of hydrogen through the electrolysis of ethanol is more energy efficient and more environmentally friendly. In this study, to gain a good insight of ethanol electrolysis process, we have investigated the ethanol electrolysis in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) reactor numerically. A two-dimensional, isothermal, and single phase ethanol electrolyzer numerical model, taking into account the transport phenomena and electrochemical reactions, has been developed for such purpose. Besides, a systematic parametric study is carried out to elucidate the effect of operating temperature, flow rate and the thickness of the membrane on the performance of the electrolytic cell. A reasonable agreement is found between the numerical data and the experimental results available in the literature indicating the predictive capability of the model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The explicit tendency to increase the power generation from stochastic renewable resources forces to look for technological solutions of energy management and storage. In the recent years, the concept of power-to-gas, where the excess energy is converted into hydrogen and/or further methanized into renewable methane, is gaining high popularity among researchers. In this study, we assess the power to-renewable methane system as the potential technology for power grid balancing. For the assessment, a mathematical model has been developed that assists in understanding of whether a power-to renewable methane system can be developed in a region with specific installed and planned capacities of wind energy and biogas plants. Considering the varying amount of excess power available for H-2 production and the varying biogas quality, the aim of the model is to simulate the system to determine, if wind power generation meets the needs of biogas plants for storing the excess energy in the form of methane via the methanation process. For the case study, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) have been selected, as the region is characterized by high dependence on fossil energy sources and electricity import. The results show that with the wind power produced in the region it would be possible to increase the average CH4 content in the methanized biogas by up to 48.4%. Yet, even with a positive H-2 net production rate, not in all cases the maximum possible quality of the renewable methane would be achieved, as at moments the necessary amount of H-2 for methanation would not be readily available, and the reaction would not be possible. Thus, in the region, the wind power capacities would not meet the biogas plant capacities nor now, nor until 2020. For the system's development, two potential pathways are seen as possible for balancing the regions' power grid. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The energy performance of Ground-Coupled Heat Pump systems (GCHPs) depends heavily on the fluid temperature over the entire time scale inside the ground heat exchangers (GHEs) and the ground temperature profile outside the borehole. These temperatures define not only the coefficient of performance (COP) of GCHPs but also the ground receptivity of the energy demand of buildings. Although GCHPs have been studied for many years, it is still a great challenge to develop a model that can accurately predict both short-term and long-term responses due to the complex borehole configuration and the thermal capacity of grout. A new transient quasi-3D entire time scale line source model is proposed in this paper, which introduces the concept of transient borehole thermal resistance and considers the heat flux profile along the U-pipe as a variable. The proposed model is firstly compared with several existent models, including several traditional line source models and a full scale response model, using the data collected from a reported Sandbox experiment. The comparison study shows that the proposed model is able to predict the temperature with a relative error less than 5%. Then, the outside ground temperature profile that defines the borehole distance is analyzed and compared with the Sandbox experiment result, which shows that the proposed model leads to a maximum relative error being less than 3.85%. Finally, the impact of the heat flux profile along the U-pipe on the ground temperature profile prediction is investigated, which shows that when the heat flux profile along the U-pipe is considered as a variable, the determination of borehole distance will be much more accurate. Therefore, the transient quasi-3D entire time scale "line source model is an effective method for the fluid and ground temperature prediction and may offer the theoretical basis for the system control and the borehole distance determination.

Abstract: Existing bus fuel consumption models produce a bang-bang type of control, implying that drivers would have to either accelerate at full throttle or brake at full braking in order to minimize their fuel consumption levels. This is obviously not correct. The paper is intended to enhance bus fuel consumption modeling by circumventing the bang-bang control problem using the Virginia Tech Comprehensive Power-based Fuel consumption Model (VT-CPFM) framework. The model is calibrated for a series of diesel-powered buses using in-field second-by-second data because of a lack of publicly available bus fuel economy data. The results reveal that the bus fuel consumption rate is concave as a function of vehicle power instead of convex, as was the case with light duty vehicles. The model is calibrated for an entire bus series and demonstrated to accurately capture the fuel consumption behavior of each individual bus within its series. Furthermore, the model estimates are demonstrated to be consistent with in-field measurements. The optimum fuel economy cruising speeds range between 40 and 50 km/h, which is slightly lower than that for gasoline-powered light duty vehicles (60-80 km/h). Finally, the model is demonstrated to capture transient fuel consumption behavior better than the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) and produces a better fit to field measurements compared to the Comprehensive Modal Emission Model (CMEM).

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of moisture content on the thermal inertia parameters of building material layers. Moisture variation affects the energy storage and therefore the energy gains/losses through buildings. To this effect the decrement factor and time lag are determined for three types of concrete layers and one of solid clay-bricks masonry layer. Their consideration is essential to enhance the design of building elements, from a thermal point of view, when exposed to varying moisture content conditions. Moisture content and relative humidity variations of each analysed layer, as defined by specific moisture storage functions, are shown to interrelate non-linearly with the layer resistor-capacitor circuit section parameters (thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity) showing notable consequences on the thermal inertia parameters. The dynamic thermal analysis is accomplished by using the thermal-circuit modelling approach and the nodal solution method. The deterioration of decrement factor and time lag due to moisture content are illustrated by appropriate metrics. Computer results for the studied layers with thicknesses varying from 10 cm to 50 cm show the influence of the variation of relative humidity and thickness on the decrement factor and time lag.

Abstract: Concerns regarding the fuel costs and climate change impacts associated with petroleum combustion are among the main driving factors for the adoption of electric vehicles. Future commercial delivery truck fleets may include Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Extended Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs); in addition to savings on fuel and maintenance costs, the introduction of these grid accessible electric vehicles will also provide fleet owners with possible Vehicle to Grid (V2G) opportunities. This study investigates the potential net present revenues and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation of V2G regulation services provided by electric trucks in a typical fleet. The total cost of ownership and the life-cycle GHG emissions of electric trucks are also analyzed and compared to those of traditional diesel trucks. To account for uncertainties, possible ranges for key parameters are considered instead of only considering fixed single data values for each parameter. The results of this research indicate that providing V2G regulation services for electric trucks could yield considerable additional revenues ($20,000-50;000) and significant GHG emission savings (approximately 300 ton CO2) compared to conventional diesel trucks.

Abstract: This paper assesses the energy efficiency of a prototype of a dynamic photovoltaic (PV) greenhouse that has an asymmetric cross section and allows the rotation of the PV modules around their longitudinal axis throughout the day to select the degree of shading inside the structure. The goal of this research is to study the production of energy and the microclimate inside the structure with different tilt angles of the PV panels to improve the information available to support the farmers and to create a PV greenhouse capable of producing income from electrical and agricultural activity. The average values of the internal air temperature and relative humidity, measured during the hottest period and on days with clear skies, are within the optimal ranges for major vegetable species (17-27 degrees C and 60-90%, respectively). The values of the solar radiation available for the plants were always sufficient for normal agricultural operations, except for the last two days of the experiment (values lower than 5 MI m(-2)) in which the shading percentage analyzed was too high for normal production. When the shading percentage was highest (78%), the maximum value of PV power (102 W m(-2)) was recorded and when the shading percentage was equal to 0%, the minimum value of PV power (20 W m(-2)) was recorded. The results show that it is possible to balance the electricity production using photovoltaic panels and the agricultural production as a function of the type of crop grown, latitude, operating season, and characteristics of the greenhouse.

Abstract: Energy, and particularly electricity, has played and will continue to play a very important role in the development of human society. Electricity, which is the most flexible and manageable energy form, is currently used in a variety of activities and applications. For instance, electricity is used for heating, cooling, lighting, and for operating electronic appliances and electric vehicles. Nowadays, given the rapid development and commercialization of technologies and devices that rely on electricity, electricity demand is increasing faster than overall primary energy supply. Consequently, the design and planning of power systems is becoming a progressively more important issue in order to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in timely fashion, not only in developed countries but particularly in developing economies where electricity demand is increasing even faster.
Power systems are networks of electrical devices, such as power plants, transformers, and transmission lines, used to produce, transmit, and supply electricity. The design and planning of such systems require the selection of generation technologies, along with the capacity, location, and timing of generation and transmission capacity expansions to meet electricity demand over a long-term horizon. This manuscript presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the design and planning of interconnected power systems, including the integration of generation and transmission capacity expansion planning. The proposed framework also considers renewable energies, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, demand-side management (DSM), as well as reserve and CO2 emission constraints. The novelty of this framework relies on an integrated assessment of the aforementioned features, which can reveal possible interactions and synergies within the power system. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a suite of case studies inspired by a real-world power system, including "business as usual" and "CO2 mitigation policy" scenarios. These case studies illustrated the adaptability and effectiveness of the framework at dealing with typical situations that can arise in designing and planning power systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Based on a small-scale high-speed diesel engine, the low temperature combustion and emission characteristics of four different fuels were experimentally investigated at different EGR ratios. The following fuels were studied: pure diesel (D100), a diesel and gasoline blend with a volume ratio of 70:30 (D70G30), a diesel and n-butanol blend with a volume ratio of 70:30 (D70B30) and a blend of diesel, gasoline and n-butanol with a volume ratio of 70:15:15 (D70G15B15). During the combustion of all four kinds of fuels, when the EGR ratio was smaller than 25%, the increase of EGR ratio sorted little effects on the maximum pressure rising ratio, as well as on the emission of soot, CO and total hydrocarbons (THC). Conversely, the emission of NO. decreased significantly as the EGR ratio increased. At the same EGR ratio, the variation of fuel characteristics by adding gasoline or n-butanol into diesel did not sort significant effects on the NO. emission, whereas it was found to greatly affect the maximum pressure rising ratio. When the EGR ratio was greater than 25%, the emissions of soot, CO and THC increased rapidly with the rising EGR ratio due to the decrease in excess air coefficient and to the excessively long ignition delay period. The D70B30 blended fuel exhibited more remarkable results in soot emission reduction than the D70G30 blended fuel. When the EGR ratio was close to 40%, NO. emissions almost approached zero. As the EGR ratio increased, the number concentration of nucleation-mode particles (Dp < 50 nm) during the combustion of the examined fuels first decreased and then increased; the number concentration of accumulation-mode particles (50 nm < Dp < 1000 nm) increased continuously. When the EGR ratio was smaller than 25%, the total particulate matters (PM) number concentration during the combustion of the four fuels did not present a clear trend; when the EGR ratio was higher than 25%, the total PM number concentration during the combustion of the four tested fuels increased rapidly, with a descending order of rising amplitude, D100 > D70G30 > D70G15B15 > D70B30. At a fixed EGR ratio, the count median diameters (CMD) corresponding to the peak values of the number concentration of both nucleation-mode and accumulation mode particles had an ascending order of D70B30 < D7 0G15B15 < D70G30 < D100. The emissions of soot, NOR, CO and THC and the number concentration of particles reached their optimum values during the combustion of D70B30 at an EGR ratio of approximately 25%.

Abstract: Personal carbon trading (PCT) is a downstream cap-and-trade scheme which could be used to reduce carbon emissions from the household sector. To explore the effectiveness of this scheme, it is necessary to investigate how consumers respond to allowance price change. In this paper, a general utility optimization (GUO) model and a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function are proposed to examine the price, substitution and income effects of carbon allowance price changes. It is shown that higher income consumers are more sensitive to the allowance price changes than lower income consumers. Moreover, the short-run adjustment in consumers' consumption of electricity in response to a change in allowance price would be lower than the long-run value. According to the sensitivity analysis, downward (upward) adjustments in the elasticity of substitution result in a positive (negative) effect on price effect. The findings in this study are used to draw policy implications. Suggestions for future research are also provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Facing upon the increasingly severe energy crisis, one of the key issues for reducing the building energy consumption is to pursue high-performance thermal energy storage technologies based on phase-change materials. In this study, a novel cement composite incorporated with flaky graphite-doped microencapsulated phase-change materials (FGD-MPCMs) was developed. Various techniques, such as field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to analyse the composite structure and thermal performances. The results indicate that the spherical microcapsules are well dispersed in the cement matrix. When combined within the cement, the thermal stability of the microcapsules was highly improved, and the inclusion of greater amounts of FGD-MPCMs further increased the latent heat of the composite. The mechanical properties of the cement composites were affected with the increase of FGD-MPCMs dosage and the porosity of the composites. In spite of this, the compressive strength and flexural strength of the cement composite with 30% FGD-MPCM could still reach to as high as 14.2 MPa and 4.1 MPa, respectively. Results from the infrared thermography and the model room test suggested that the composite filled with FGD-MPCMs is capable of reducing indoor temperature fluctuation and exhibits good potential for application in buildings to enhance energy savings and thermal comfort.

Abstract: Like ester type biodiesel fuel, green diesel is a next generation transportation fuel emerging due to the need for a renewable replacement of internal combustion engine fuel, which is also fully compatible with existing automotive powertrain systems. Besides other limitations, the main obstacle for wider application of such renewable fuels is their relatively high production cost, depending mainly on the raw material cost and the application of more efficient processing technology. Green diesel and ester type biodiesel can be produced from waste vegetable oil by catalytic hydrogenation, homogeneous alkali catalysed transesterification and supercritical non-catalytic transesterification. Techno-economic analysis and the sensitivity analysis reveal that economics of these production technologies strongly depend on the process unit capacity and the cost of feedstock. Green diesel production by catalytic hydroprocessing located in a petroleum refinery appears to be the most cost effective option for unit capacity close to and above 200,000 tonnes/year. Conventional ester biodiesel process and non-catalytic ester biodiesel process under supercritical conditions are less profitable at specified capacity. Unit capacities of the investigated processes which are below 100,000 tonnes/year are likely to result in negative net present values after 10 years of project lifetime. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Lignite utilizations are limited due to the disadvantages of lignites such as high moisture content, high ash yield, and low calorific value. Direct combustion and other conventional utilization processes of lignites emit a huge amount of CO2, leading to catastrophic global warming. Accordingly, mild and eco-friendly utilization technologies should be paid attention to overcome the disadvantages. Separation and structural characterization of organic species in degraded lignites are crucial for producing clean liquid fuels and value-added chemicals. Several molecular and network structural models for lignites have been proposed since 1976 based on the characteristics of the organic species from lignites. Since then, great progress has been achieved in this area, while reviews on the advances have rarely reported. This review focuses on mild (<400 degrees C) and low-CO2-emission chemical degradation methods for separating and characterizing value-added chemicals (VACS) from lignites, including low-temperature extraction (LTE), thermal dissolution (TD), extraction in ionic liquids (ILs), and mild oxidation. LTE gives low extract yields for lignites due to strong noncovalent interactions between the soluble organic species (SOSs) and macromolecular network in lignites. Such interactions can be significantly disrupted by TD around 300 degrees C, leading to dissolving much more SOSs (almost ash-free) which can be used as clean fuels for gas turbines or valuable precursors for chemicals and carbon materials. ILs could be promising green solvents for separating valuable SOSs from lignites. Mild oxidation also proved to be an effective approach for understanding macromolecular structures of lignites and simultaneously producing VACs such as short-chain aliphatic acids and benzenepolycarboxylic acids. Special attention has also been paid to the application of advanced analytical techniques for characterizing the VACs from mild degradation of lignites. Important information on functional groups, carbon and hydrogen forms, molecular mass distributions, and molecular compositions of the VACs can be characterized by using different analytical techniques presented in the review.

Abstract: A new approach for optimal combinations of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs) is proposed, for diesel-free remote communities and related decision-making problems. The objective of the design is to satisfy the load with total cost's minimization considering related constraints, where all analytical equations are given. The proposed system is a DC configuration for renewable energy integration in which Wind Turbines (WTs) are connected to the DC bus and the battery system removes the fluctuations in the DC bus. The WT is assumed to be well controlled to obtain the power curve and provide proper electricity to the grid. It is found that WT and Photovoltaic (PV) systems should be considered simultaneously on diesel-free generation islands to achieve a reliable and optimized configuration. A novel strategy is introduced for determining the range of batteries, which can be determined using the renewable energy potential to satisfy the load. It is also demonstrated that WTs are an essential power component in real HRES installations. It is illustrated that the range of WT operation must be first taken into account in real installations. Increasing WT fraction from an initial value, for instance 8%, to a desired value of about 33%, can lead to significant reductions in total cost as well as in the number of PV systems and batteries, even if the WT cost is significantly higher than that of PVs. A WT fraction higher than approximately 50% should not be considered. Finally, discussions are extended to consider the optimum WT fraction in a HRES. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We report an integrated CO2 capture process to manufacture iron and steel with low CO2 emissions from steel-making plants over a CaO-based, Fe-functionalized CO2 sorbent. This new process relies on a combined Ca-Fe chemical loop, where the exothermic oxidation of FeO provides the heat (or fractions of it) required to drive the endothermic decomposition of CaCO3. A key advantage of coupling a FeO/Fe2O3 redox cycle and a CaO/CaCO3 CO2 capture cycle within the as-prepared materials is that the heat could be transferred from FeO to CaCO3 directly at a molecular level. All materials synthesized require an appreciably reduced net heat, i.e. a decrease of 26-43%, for CaCO3 decomposition during the combined Ca-Fe looping when compared with conventional calcium looping. Importantly, materials CaFe-CA(1)EG(1)-pH(1), CaFe-CA(1)EG(1)-pH(2), and CaFe-CA(1)EG(1)-pH(3) exhibit a fairly stable cyclic CO2 uptake of similar to 0.16 g(CO2) g(sorbent)(-1) throughout 10 realistic combined Ca-Fe looping cycles. The medium capacity but excellent stability for CO2 capture of the CO2 sorbents makes them a promising alternative of naturally-derived, CaO-based materials, especially for the combined Ca-Fe chemical loop proposed. Using steel slag as feedstock, the material developed is very promising for CO2 abatement from the iron and steel industry accompanied by the recycling of CaO and Fe2O3 components in spent sorbents and recovery of energy from process gases.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel ensemble method for short-term load forecasting based on wavelet transform, extreme learning machine (ELM) and partial least squares regression. In order to improve forecasting performance, a wavelet-based ensemble strategy is introduced into the forecasting model. The individual forecasters are derived from different combinations of mother wavelet and number of decomposition levels. For each sub-component from the wavelet decomposition, a parallel model consisting of 24 ELMs is invoked to predict the hourly load of the next day. The individual forecasts are then combined to form the ensemble forecast using the partial least squares regression method. Numerical results show that the proposed method can significantly improve forecasting performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We develop tar removal technologies by using byproducts (bio-oil and char) in order to achieve low-cost and highly effective tar removal using only secondary removal methods in a pilot-scale gasification facility. The tar removal performance of a 100-L bio-oil scrubber and a 13-kg char filter is investigated with an up-draft gasifier. The tar removal rate of the bio-oil scrubber at 40, 50, and 60 degrees C is measured; the highest removal rate is 64.5% at 50 degrees C. Furthermore, even though the tar removal performance of water/oily scrubber generally degrades, that of the bio-oil scrubber does not decrease even after use for 22.5 h. The char can also be used as a tar adsorbent, like activated carbon, because of its high porosity. The char bed filter removes 81.5% of the tar from the producer gas at the beginning of the operation. The entire tar removal system, including the bio-oil scrubber and the char bed filter, exhibits a 98% tar removal rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An intermittent solar adsorption refrigerator can supply cold needed in third world countries, especially for vaccine and medicine preservation. This paper investigated theoretically the potential of solar adsorption refrigerators in Sub-Saharan Africa. The dynamic behavior of the system and its performance were assessed using real climatic conditions of four Sub-Saharan African sites. A refrigerator operating with activated carbon/methanol as a working pair was simulated using a 1-D mathematical model to investigate its dynamic optimization. The results showed that the best solar coefficient of performance (SCOP) was predicted in Garoua (Cameroon) and Beitbridge (Zimbabwe). The maximum specific cooling power (SCP) was achieved in Beitbridge (Zimbabwe). Under the climate of Lamu (Kenya), the system presented the lowest performance indices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Characteristics of stormwater in industrial areas are evaluated, specifically based on a biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant with on-site biomass fuel storage. An evaluation method is developed to combine general methodology applied for stormwater characterisation with the on-site features of the biomass-fired CHP plant. Investigations were carried out through on-site monitoring and laboratory experiments with the defined methodology. Recycled wood chips as biomass fuel currently used in Swedish biomass-fired CHP plants have been used as an example for this study. The impacts of outdoor biomass fuel storage have been analysed for both runoff water quantity and quality. The results indicate that the properties of stored biomass fuels will significantly affect the runoff quantity by its water absorption capability. The overall runoff quality is highly depended on precipitation intensity and the runoff volume from the biomass storage piles, which is influenced by the water retention capacity and leaching ability of biomass fuels. The practical data and information presented in this paper can be used to understand the principal issues and the most important factors for internal control of contamination sources in order to achieve sustainable Energy-Water systems for bioenergy conversion in biomass-fired CHP plants.

Abstract: Silica nanoparticles doped aqueous electrolytes have been prepared and implemented for the first time in rechargeable hybrid aqueous battery systems (ReHABs). The batteries were assembled from a cathode containing LiMn2O4 - a lithium intercalation compound, a zinc metal foil anode and a sulfate electrolyte containing Zn2+ and Li+ ions. Silica nanoparticles were doped into the liquid electrolyte with the initial aim to create a silica containing gel electrolyte. However, the 5% and 10% SiO2 doped electrolytes were viscous and could be easily absorbed in the Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) separator and the whole system (doped electrolyte + AGM) immobilized after a few minutes. The AGM loaded with silica doped electrolytes remained wet after storage for weeks under ambient condition thanks to the water retention ability of nanoscale silica particles. The doped silica nanoparticles restrained deposition of zinc dendritic crystals, and reduced float charge current and self-discharge. The ReHABs assembled from the silica nanoparticles doped electrolytes provided high specific discharge capacity, up to 140 mAh (g LiMn2O4)(-1) at 0.2 C, and the cyclability of such systems was significantly enhanced compared to the ReHABs assembled from conventional electrolytes. X-ray Diffraction revealed that the anode of the batteries using SiO2 doped electrolytes were protected since only the XRD peaks of Zn were detected after the batteries were running 700 cycles of charge and discharge.

Abstract: A novel solar thermal cogeneration system featuring the provision of potable water with membrane distillation in combination with domestic hot water supply has been developed and experimentally analyzed. The system integrates evacuated tube collectors, thermal storage, membrane distillation unit, and heat exchangers with the overall goals of maximizing the two outputs while minimizing costs for the given design conditions. Experiments were conducted during one month's operation at AURAK's facility in UAE, with average peak global irradiation levels of 650 W/m(2). System performance was determined for three integration strategies, all utilizing brackish water (typical conductivity of 20,000 mu s/cm) as a feedstock: Thermal store integration (TSI), which resembles a conventional indirect solar domestic hot water system; Direct solar integration (DSI) connecting collectors directly to the membrane distillation unit without thermal storage; and Direct solar with thermal store integration (DSTSI), a combination of these two approaches. The DSTSI strategy offered the best performance given its operational flexibility. Here the maximum distillate productivity was 43 L/day for a total gross solar collector area of 96 m(2). In terms of simultaneous hot water production, 277 kWh/day was achieved with this configuration. An economic analysis shows that the DSTSI strategy has a payback period of 3.9 years with net cumulative savings of $325,000 during the 20 year system lifetime. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Traditional power dispatch methods have difficulties in accommodating large-scale variable renewable generation (VRG) and have resulted in unnecessary VRG spillage in the practical industry. The recent dispatchable-interval-based methods have the potential to reduce VRG curtailment, but the dispatchable intervals are not allocated effectively due to the lack of exploiting historical dispatch records of VRG units. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel data-driven real-time dispatch approach to maximize VRG utilization by using do-not-exceed (DNE) limits. This approach defines the maximum generation output ranges that the system can accommodate without compromising reliability. The DNE limits of VRG units and operating base points of conventional units are co-optimized by hybrid stochastic and robust optimization, and the decision models are formulated as mixed-integer linear programs by the sample average approximation technique exploiting historical VRG data. A strategy for selecting historical data samples is also proposed to capture the VRG uncertainty more accurately under variant prediction output levels. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Multi-waste treatment of slag and wastewater can be combined with CO2 capture in the steelmaking industry by the high-gravity carbonation (i.e., HiGCarb) process using a rotating packed bed. In this study, the HiGCarb process is comprehensively evaluated by an engineering, environmental and economic (3E) triangle model. The feedstock CO2 for the HiGCarb process can be obtained directly from the industrial stacks, eliminating the need for additional CO2 concentration and transportation. The reacted steelmaking slag, i.e., basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS), is suited as cement substitution material, avoiding environmental burden from the cement industry, also a CO2-intensive emission source. Significant environmental benefits can be realized by establishing the waste-to-resource supply chain between the steelmaking and cement industries. The life-cycle assessment shows a net CO2 capture amount by the HiGCarb process of 282 kg-CO2/t-BOFS, accompanied by a CO2 avoidance of 997 kg-CO2/t-BOFS due to the product utilization. Moreover, the amount of revenue gained was estimated to be 20.2-23.2 USD/t-BOFS treated by the HiGCarb process. According to the 3E triangle model, the HiGCarb process is shown to be environmentally promising and economically feasible due to its high overall engineering performance, which makes it suitable as a potential CO2 sink in industry.

Abstract: This paper conducts sensitivity analyses on factors affecting the performance of vertical geothermal heat pump system, aiming to formulate design and operation strategies to improve its performance. It firstly describes the development of a 3D coupled Finite Element Model (FEM), which is utilized to simulate the steady state and transient behaviors of geothermal heat exchanger (GHE). The model holistically couples the heat exchange processes between pipe fluid flow, grouting backfill material, and adjacent ground associated with GHE. The model is firstly validated by comparison with the experimental data from an in-service GHE. Base on the calibrated model, a series of sensitivity analyses are conducted on the influence of geological, design, and operational factors intermittent operation mode of GHE achieves higher such as the initial ground temperature profile, GHE pipe installation depth, circulation fluid flow velocity, inlet temperature, subsurface water flow velocity, and material thermal properties. It also assess the behaviors of GHE under continuous operation versus intermittent operation modes. The results show that both design parameter (i.e., GHE pipe installation depth) and operational parameters (i.e., circulation fluid flow velocity) have major influence on the GHE performance. For a certain design length of GHE, the GHE performance improves with higher circulation fluid flow velocity until beyond a critical velocity. For GHE working in the heating mode, the heat extraction by GHE increases with decreasing fluid temperature at the inlet. In the geological factor aspect, the thermal conductivity of the ground material plays a very important role on the GHE performance operating in the continuous operation mode, while its specific heat capacity exerts no appreciable influence. However, for intermittent operation mode, both thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the ground, particularly the grouting materials, affect the ground thermal energy extraction. The results also showed that the presence of subsurface ground water flow improves the heat exchange of GHE. Operation wise, the GHE achieves higher performance and Coefficient of Performance (COP) under intermittent operation mode than under continuous operation mode. These observations point to ways to improve the performance of GHE from both design and operation aspects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The production of H-2 through steam reforming involves intensive energy consumption. Concentrated solar energy could be employed for the endothermic reaction in the steam reformer to produce H-2. However, at high operating temperatures, the solar absorber has huge radiation heat loss to the ambient as the radiation energy is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. In order to avoid the large radiation heat loss and obtain higher surface temperature, here we present a 2D photonic crystal (PhC) solar selective absorber. The selective absorber is made from titanium nitride (TiN) thin film. On top of the TiN thin film, nano cavity array structure and Al2O3 coating are deposited. The absorptivity of the selective absorber is measured at room temperature and the high operating temperature performance is predicted. The fabricated selective absorber is thermal annealed at 800 degrees C for two hours and proves its thermal stability. By comparing the steam reformers with different absorbers (selective absorber and blackbody absorber), the selective absorber shows superior results including higher surface temperature, higher C3H8 conversion rate as well as higher H-2 production rate. The experimental and simulation results in this study shows that the 2D PhC solar selective absorber is a good candidate in the steam reforming application for H-2 production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Two combined cogeneration cycles are examined in which the waste heat from a recompression supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle (sCO(2)) is recovered by either a transcritical CO2 cycle (tCO(2)) or an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for generating electricity. An exergoeconomic analysis is performed for sCO(2)/tCO(2) cycle performance and its comparison to the sCO(2)/ORC cycle. The following organic fluids are considered as the working fluids in the ORC: R123, R245fa, toluene, isobutane, isopentane and cyclohexane. Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic models are developed for the cycles on the basis of mass and energy conservations, exergy balance and exergy cost equations. Parametric investigations are conducted to evaluate the influence of decision variables on the performance of sCO(2)/tCO(2) and sCO(2)/ORC cycles. The performance of these cycles is optimized and then compared. The results show that the sCO(2)/tCO(2) cycle is preferable and performs better than the sCO(2)/ORC cycle at lower PRc. When the sCO(2) cycle operates at a cycle maximum pressure of around 20 MPa (similar to 2.8 of PRc), the tCO(2) cycle is preferable to be integrated with the recompression sCO(2) cycle considering the off-design conditions. Moreover, contrary to the sCO(2)/ORC system, a higher tCO(2) turbine inlet temperature improves exergoeconomic performance of the sCO(2)/tCO(2) cycle. The thermodynamic optimization study reveals that the sCO(2)/tCO(2) cycle has comparable second law efficiency with the sCO(2)/ORC cycle. When the optimization is conducted based on the exergoeconomics, the total product unit cost of the sCO(2)/ORC is slightly lower than that of the sCO(2)/tCO(2) cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The aim of this work was to reduce the sulfur content of pyrolysis oil derived from the scrap tire pyrolysis. In this respect, a series of pyrolysis experiments was conducted in both a fluidized bed reactor (one-stage pyrolysis) and a newly developed two-stage pyrolyzer consisting of an auger reactor and a fluidized bed reactor in series (two-stage pyrolysis). The one-stage pyrolysis was carried out at similar to 500 and similar to 600 degrees C with different fluidizing gases (N-2 and product gas). In the experiments, the pyrolysis oil obtained at similar to 500 degrees C had a lower sulfur content than that produced at similar to 600 degrees C. N-2 was better at producing a low-sulfur pyrolysis oil than product gas. The sulfur contents of the oils obtained from the one-stage pyrolysis ranged from 0.75 to 0.92 wt.%. The two-stage pyrolysis was conducted using product gas as the fluidizing medium at different auger reactor temperatures (similar to 230-450 degrees C) and at a constant fluidized bed reactor temperature (similar to 510 degrees C). A pyrolysis oil containing only 0.55 wt.% of sulfur could be produced at the temperatures of the auger reactor of similar to 330 degrees C and fluidized bed reactor of similar to 510 degrees C. Moreover, the two-stage pyrolysis could produce an oil with a low nitrogen content (0.28 wt.%). A pyrolysis oil obtained from the auger reactor contained DL-limonene up to 50 wt.%.

Abstract: The challenges of replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy in steel industry furnaces include not only reducing CO2 emissions but also increasing the system energy efficiency. In this work, a multi-stage gasification system is chosen for the integration with a heat treatment furnace in the steel powder industry to recover different rank/temperature waste heat back to the biomass gasification system, resulting higher system energy efficiency.
A system model based on Aspen Plus was developed for the proposed integrated system considering all steps, including biomass drying, pyrolysis, gasification and the combustion of syngas in the furnace. Both low temperature (up to 400 degrees C) and high temperature (up to 700 degrees C) heat recovery possibilities were analysed in terms of energy efficiency by optimizing the biomass pretreatment temperature.
The required process conditions of the furnace can be achieved by using syngas. No major changes to the furnace, combustion technology or flue gas handling system are necessary for this fuel switching. Only a slight revamp of the burner system and a new waste heat recovery system from the flue gases are required.
Both the furnace efficiency and gasifier system efficiency are improved by integration with the waste heat recovery. The heat recovery from the hot furnace flue gas for biomass drying and steam superheating is the most promising option from an energy efficiency point of view. This option recovers two thirds of the available waste heat, according to the pinch analysis performed. Generally, depending on the extent of flue gas heat recovery, the system can sustain up to 65% feedstock moisture content at the highest pyrolysis temperature studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The RD 413/2014 new economic and regulatory framework for producers of electricity from renewable energy sources in Spain has been here analysed, putting the focus on its impact on the economic results of the existing grid connected PV systems. A complete formulation of the new remuneration scheme is first presented, making evident its high complexity and the great number of regulatory parameters involved. Then, in order to facilitate the discernment of its operating mechanism a simplified model is proposed. This approach has proven to be a useful tool to identify the most influential regulatory parameters and also which could be the plausible future regulatory actions in order to contain the cost to the Spanish Electricity System. Finally, the NPV and the IRR among other indicators are calculated for a representative case study facility, evidencing a substantial profitability reduction in the transition from the former economic and regulatory framework to the RD 413/2014 new remuneration scheme.

Abstract: Previously, the authors have proposed the concept of piston trajectory-based combustion control enabled by free piston engines (FPEs). With this novel method, the FPE realizes in-cycle adjustment of combustion phase and real-time control of in-cylinder temperature and pressure through variable piston trajectories. As a result, higher indicated thermal efficiency, compared to conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs), is achieved. In this paper, the effects of this new combustion control on engine-out emissions are investigated. First, a comprehensive model is developed that includes different piston trajectories in the FPE, a convective heat loss model and a reduced n-heptane reaction mechanism with major emissions species. Afterwards, the chemical kinetics of CO and NOx emissions are described in details that reveal the feasibility of reducing engine-out emissions by employing novel piston trajectories. At last, analyses of the corresponding simulation results and comparisons of emissions and thermal efficiencies between the FPE and conventional ICEs are presented, which further shows the advantages of the trajectory-based combustion control.

Abstract: Heat pipe building integrated photovoltaic/thermal system (heat pipe BIPV/T system) can produce both the electrical and thermal energies at the same time, which have been paid enormous attentions since the energy crisis in the 1970s. In this paper, the heat pipe BIPV/T system with the metal wires filling into the space between the finned heat pipes and insulation has been proposed, which will be expected to enhance the heat transfer and improve the electrical generation of the system. To investigate the thermal performance of the system, the variations of the temperatures, e.g., flat-plate glass cover, PV panel, filling space, heat pipe, and tank water, as well as the ambient temperature, were measured, and the system's thermal efficiency was calculated and studied for different simulated solar radiations and water flow rates. It was found that the temperatures of the flat-plate glass cover, PV panels, filling space, and heat pipe presented the similar variation pattern when the ambient temperature was stable. The tank water temperature could reach the maximum of 53.83 degrees C when the simulated solar radiation was at 900 W/m(2) and the water flow rate was at 200l/h. The linear relation between the system efficiency and (T-mean - T-amb)/I had been setup. The maximum thermal efficiency was found at 44.04% with the simulated solar radiation of 300 W/m2 and water flow rate of 200l/h, and 7.9% for the maximum electrical efficiency. Compared with the traditional systems of the previous research, the proposed system performed well with additional features, e.g., low cost, waste materials recycling. This research will be helpful in indicating the potential research area of the low-carbon-emission and energy-saving technology for the researchers overseas and domestic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Bio-methane from biomass gasification (bio-methane) is expected to play a major role as a biofuel in the heavy transport sector, since the production process has reached the technical maturity required for large-scale exploitation, and the fact that bio-methane can be distributed through the compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply chains. Assuming that the burning of biomass is climate-neutral, we compared the well-to-wheel (WtW) emissions from the use of bio-methane in heavy duty engines with those from currently used fossil alternatives: CNG, LNG, and diesel. The well-to-tank (WtT) analysis of bio-methane is based on the case study of the new GoBiGas plant in Gothenburg (Sweden), which is the largest bio-methane plant in the world currently in operation. Finally, tank-to wheel (TtW) section compares three different state-of-the-art heavy duty gas engines: a spark-ignited (SI) gas engine; a dual fuel (DF) engine; and a high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) engine.
The WtT emissions for compressed bio-methane (bio-CNG) and liquefies bio-methane (bio-LNG) were estimated at 21.5 [gCO(2)e/MJ(bioCNG)] and 26.2 [gCO(2)e/MJ(bioLNG)]. As compared to diesel the WtW emissions from bio-methane were reduced by 60-67%, 43-47%, and 64% when used in SI, DF, and HPDI engines, respectively. HPDI and DF are the most efficient technologies for the utilization of biomass, reducing emissions by 39 gCO(2)e and 33-36 gCO(2)e per MJ of biomass, respectively, compared with the diesel case, whereas the SI engine gave an emissions saving of 29-31 gCO(2)e.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) is becoming increasingly important as the volatility on the grid continues to increase. Current DR approaches are predominantly completely manual and rule-based or involve deriving first principles based models which are extremely cost and time prohibitive to build. We consider the problem of data-driven end-user DR for large buildings which involves predicting the demand response baseline, evaluating fixed rule based DR strategies and synthesizing DR control actions. The challenge is in evaluating and taking control decisions at fast time scales in order to curtail the power consumption of the building, in return for a financial reward. We provide a model based control with regression trees algorithm (mbCRT), which allows us to perform closed-loop control for DR strategy synthesis for large commercial buildings. Our data-driven control synthesis algorithm outperforms rule-based DR by 17% for a large DoE commercial reference building and leads to a curtailment of up to 380 kW and over $45,000 in savings. Our methods have been integrated into an open source tool called DR-Advisor, which acts as a recommender system for the building's facilities manager and provides suitable control actions to meet the desired load curtailment while maintaining operations and maximizing the economic reward. DR-Advisor achieves 92.8-98.9% prediction accuracy for 8 buildings on Penn's campus. We compare DR-Advisor with other data driven methods and rank 2nd on ASHRAE's benchmarking data-set for energy prediction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In smart grids, demand response and distributed energy systems aim to provide a higher degree of flexibility for load-shifting operations and the leverage to control intermittent wind supply. In this more dynamic energy system, deployment of energy storage at the site of consumption is envisioned to create synergies with the local distributed generation (DG) system. From a large end-user perspective, this paper contributes to the practical understanding of smart grids by modelling the impact of real-time pricing schemes (smart grids) on a hybrid DG system (mixed generation for heating and electricity loads) coupled with storage units. Specifically, we address: How does the portfolio of DG units affect the value of energy storage? and, what is the value of energy storage when assessing different designs of demand response for the end-user? To this end, we formulate a dynamic optimization model to represent a real life urban community's energy system composed of a co-generation unit, gas boilers, electrical heaters and a wind turbine. We discuss the techno-economic benefits of complementing this end-user's energy system with storage units (thermal storage and battery devices). The paper analyses the storages policy strategies to simultaneously satisfy heat and electricity demand through the efficient use of DG units under demand response mechanisms. Results indicate that the storage units reduce energy costs by 7-10% in electricity and 3% in gas charges. In cases with a large DG capacity, the supply-demand mismatch increases, making storage more valuable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work consists of a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model for defining optimized schedules of components in a grid-connected microgrid. The microgrid includes a hydrogen energy system consisting of an alkaline electrolyzer, hydrogen cylinder bundles and a fuel cell for energy storage. Local generation is provided from photovoltaic panels, and the load is given by a fixed load profile combined with a flexible electrical load, which is a battery electric vehicle. The electrolyzer has ramp-up constraints which are modeled explicitly. The objective function includes, besides operational costs and an environmental indicator, a representation of peak power costs, thus leading to an overall peak load reduction under optimized operation. The model is used both for controlling a microgrid in a field trial set-up deployed in South-West Germany and for simulating the microgrid operation for defined period, thus allowing for economic system evaluation. Results from defined sample runs show that the energy storage is primarily used for trimming the peak of electricity drawn from the public grid and is not solely operated with excess power. The flexible demand operation also helps keeping the peak at its possible minimum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the novel long-term energy mix optimization model eMix, which takes into account daily requirements of power system operation (primary, secondary and tertiary reserve) and how should they react to increasing RES penetration.
Until now there has been no computational effective, long-term optimization model of energy mix with individual representation of power generating assets that allows for RES development incorporation and consider the daily requirement of power system operation. Existing unit commitment models, although comprehensive, are not appropriate for long-term, large-scale problems because of computational limitations. The eMix links long-term planning (investments) with short-term requirements of power system operation reserves (primary, secondary, tertiary) provided by dispatchable units. Additionally, development of the RES introduces stronger requirements to the reserve's level in order to maintain the flexibility of the power system operation. This relation has significant impact on the final energy mix and was modeled in the eMix. The costs are calculated annually for each individual unit (given to the application of Mixed Integer Linear Programming), to reflect the real conditions of energy sector operation, where annual repayment of loans, amortization as well as operation and maintenance costs are applied. eMix is also fully scalable and allows for freely definable interval and horizon of the calculation.
To prove the quality of presented model, the authors calibrated it with the data from Polish power system for different scenarios. Results indicate that the consideration of financial costs and required reserves increase the reliability of the optimization outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The multiple injection performance of Common Rail injectors has been analyzed at a hydraulic test rig as the dwell time was varied. The dependence of the injected volume on the dwell time has been investigated for direct acting piezoelectric and hydraulically-controlled (or indirect-acting) servo injectors. The injected fuel volumes in the long dwell-time range have been shown to be affected by the pressure waves that travel along the high pressure circuit for hydraulically-controlled servo injectors. On the other hand, the influence of pressure-wave-induced disturbances on multiple injection performance has been shown to be negligible for direct acting piezoelectric injectors.
An analysis of closely-coupled injections has been conducted on a solenoid injector. When the dwell time is progressively reduced below a critical value, an increase in the fuel quantity that is injected in the second shot is observed. Injection fusion phenomena occur as the dwell time is diminished below a certain threshold and a maximum in the fuel volume, which is injected during the joint injections, is eventually detected for a very short electric dwell time value close to 100 mu s. The cycle-to-cycle dispersion around this dwell time value results to be reduced significantly.
A previously developed 1D model of the fuel injection system has been applied to analyze the injector transients. Detailed knowledge of the injection dynamics in the short dwell time region is of fundamental importance to optimize the implementation of both discontinuous and continuous rate shaping strategies. At present, there is a great deal of interest in these advanced schedules, since they can allow a minimization of soot emissions, fuel consumption and combustion noise to be achieved in diesel engines equipped with indirect-acting injectors.

Abstract: In this paper an adaptive energy management strategy (EMS) based on fuzzy logic and the optimal sizing for a tramway with a hybrid energy storage system (ESS) combining batteries (BT) and supercapacitors (SC) are presented. The EMS applies a sliding window to estimate the forward energy consumption and adapt the instantaneous power target for BT and SC. The hybrid ESS sizing is obtained by an optimization with multi-objective genetic algorithms (GA). The fitness functions are expressed in economic terms, and correspond to the costs of the energy absorbed from the catenary as well as the operation cost of the hybrid ESS (investment and cycling cost). The selected case study is the tramway of Seville, which operates in zones with and without catenary. The aim is to minimize the daily operating cost of the tramway taking into account the BT and SC degradation approach (cycling) and fulfilling the performance of the tramway in the catenary-less zone. The proposed approach (adaptive EMS and optimal sizing) is compared with the current solution in the tramway (SC-based) and with a hybrid ESS managed by a rule based EMS (RB-EMS) in terms of daily operating cost and energy harnessing during regenerative braking phase. The proposed approach show cost reductions up to 25.5% (from SC-based), 6.2% (from hybrid ESS with RB-EMS) and a global efficiency around 84.4%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A key issue in designing and optimizing Stirling engines is to build a precise thermodynamic model to predict the output power, thermal efficiency, and detailed performance properties and provide useful information for further improvement. In this study, a thermodynamic model called Improved Simple Analytical Model (ISAM) was proposed, carefully considering heat and power losses in Stirling engines. A 100 W beta-type Stirling engine was built and tested with helium and nitrogen when pressure and rotary speed ranging from 1.6 MPa to 3 MPa and 260 r/min to 1380 rimin, respectively. Experimental information on performance, such as PV diagrams and temperatures of the heater and cooler, was much detailed. Increasing rotary speed brings a "thin" PV diagram because it made compression and expansion processes become more imperfect, indicating heat transfer enhancement was necessary for compression and expansion chamber in a high speed Stirling engine. Shaft power reached the maximum value of 30.1 W for helium and 21.0 W for nitrogen at rotary speeds of 1000 r/min and 650 r/min, respectively. Improving the mean pressure of gas increased the indicated power, cycle efficiency, shaft power, and electrical power. The maximum indicated power and cycle efficiency were 165 W and 16.5% for helium and 139 W and 12.2% for nitrogen in the same working conditions of 2.96 MPa and 1120 r/min. The ISAM agrees well with the experimental data with a deviation of 4.3-13.4% for helium and 1-7.1% for nitrogen. Analysis of energy losses with ISAM indicated that helium had larger shuttle and seal leakage losses and smaller flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses than nitrogen under the same working conditions. Flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses, which increased much more rapidly than seal leakage or shuttle heat losses with the increase in rotary speed and pressure, played an important role and resulted in different performances with the two working gases. This study provides comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanism of rotary speed, pressure and working gas in the view of heat/power losses for Stirling engine performance, and recommends that more work (e.g., mechanisms of heat and power losses and PV diagrams) should be performed to improve the precision of second-order models.

Abstract: The cost of Ni-MH and Li-ion battery packs is cut considerably for applications in HEV and pHEV onboard energy storage. The operational lifetime of these battery packs is still a cost concern for end users and limits long distance applications. The battery storage devices currently dominate onboard energy storage fields via slow electrochemical reactions. The battery pack experiences an extra burden when absorbing bursts of energy or releasing the required energy to facilitate quick acceleration. The dynamic operation under thermal and mechanical stresses especially during severe weather conditions has adverse effects on the battery operating life due to chemical compounds and electrode materials degradation. To overcome these limitations, an ultracapacitor can quickly polarize electrolyte solutions and accumulate energy via rapid electrostatic charges at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The ultracapacitor combines advantages including long cycle life and high power density of a conventional capacitor with enhanced energy storage capability due to high electrode surface area and low internal resistance. A hybrid ultracapacitor can be designed by using both a double-layer capacitor electrode and a battery electrode. This hybrid structure increases energy conservation and capacitance. It is also recognized as an asymmetric ultracapacitor. A power module consisting of 10 asymmetric ultracapacitors with 300 F at an operating window from 4.0 V to 14.5 V was tested for studying of these unique features. These 10 electrochemical capacitors were connected in series and performed electrical characterizations including Ragone plots, self-discharge, features at high current loads, working voltage, and related energy storage performance. The ultracapacitor module was then operated together with a Pb-acid battery as a hybrid power device. Performance of the hybrid power system was characterized by using an adjusted cold cranking and a modified hybrid pulse power profile. The irreplaceable structures on energy storage and power delivery serve as a potential to further reduce the cyclic burden and thermal stress in advanced battery packs for onboard energy storage applications.

Abstract: A novel online estimation technique for estimating the state of charge (SoC) of a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery has been developed. Based on a simplified model, the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the battery is estimated through two cascaded linear filtering stages. A recursive least squares filter is employed in the first stage to dynamically estimate the battery model parameters in real-time, and then, a fading Kalman filter (FKF) is used to estimate the OCV from these parameters. FKF can avoid the possibility of large estimation errors, which may occur with a conventional Kalman filter, due to its capability to compensate any modeling error through a fading factor. By optimizing the value of the fading factor in the set of recursion equations of FKF with genetic algorithms, the errors in estimating the battery's SoC in urban dynamometer driving schedules-based experiments and real vehicle driving cycle experiments were below 3% compared to more than 9% in the case of using an ordinary Kalman filter. The proposed method with its simplified model provides the simplicity and feasibility required for real-time application with highly accurate SoC estimation, Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, a novel technology of frost prevention and retardation for air source heat pump (ASHP), which reduces thermal discomfort, is introduced. It utilizes auxiliary electric heaters (AEH) on tubes before (B-AEH) and (or) after (A-AEH) the outdoor evaporator to retard frost formation or prevent frost from accumulating on the outdoor heat exchanger. This enables the supply of hot air into the interior space without interruption. This new method differs from the common high pressure hot gas bypass defrosting (HGBD) methods and the reverse cycle defrosting (RCD), both of which could result in significant temperature fluctuations and thermal discomfort. The orthogonal experiment design (OED) was applied in this study to evaluate the performance of the air source heat pump (ASHP) with different magnitudes of AEH power under a range of ambient frosting conditions. The L-25(5(6))orthogonal array was selected for the experiment and data were analyzed by means of the analysis of range (ANORA) and the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The optimum parameter combination affecting the performance of the ASHP was determined and the most significant parameters were identified. It was demonstrated that the proposed ASHP design is effective for frost prevention and retardation in real applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy and water are two interwoven elements of power generation systems. Because wind power is regarded as a promising renewable energy, how to increase its production and reduce energy and water costs has attracted many attentions. However, there is a lack of comprehension of the energy-water nexus in wind power generation systems. In this study, we developed a new energy-water nexus analysis framework for wind power generation systems, which includes both element and pathway nexus analyses. In element nexus analysis, energy used for water extraction and wastewater treatment and water consumed for electricity generation were investigated. The mutual interactions and control situations within the wind power generation system were also examined in pathway nexus analysis based on Network Environ Analysis (NEA). Taking a typical wind power generation system in China as the case, the element nexus analysis results show that water consumptions per unit of wind power generation are much lower than those of the other power generation systems. Energy consumption of the water system in the wind power generation system is 3.395 x 10(7) MJ, of which water extraction process constitutes 90.22%. In pathway nexus analysis, network utility analysis and network control analysis are performed to investigate the dominant sectors and pathways for energy-water circulation and the mutual relationships between pairwise components of the wind power generation system. The results of network utility analysis show that compartment of surface water and groundwater (WA) is beneficiary from waste treatment (WT), which implies that although extra energy is devoted to WT, the benefit of water recycling is larger than energy cost. The results of network control analysis indicate that on-grid power (PG) not only depends on direct wind resource input (WI) (with a dependence coefficient of 0.20), but also indirectly supported by major compartments of fossil fuel input (FU) (0.16), construction material input (CO) (0.14), and wind turbines manufactory (MA) (0.12). Compartments of WA and MA have large dependences on WT. Therefore, increasing wastewater and material treatment and recycling in the wind power generation system could reduce water and energy demand from the external environmental. Dissipation (DIS) mainly relies on FU (0.19), wind power generation (WP) (0.16) and CO (0.2), which should be the focus of dissipation reduction. The presented energy-water nexus analysis may shed light on synergistic management of wind power generation systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The necessity to reduce energy requirements of lighting systems should bring among engineers a more mature and conscious vision while planning and this means that their main goals should be the visual comfort and a decrease in energy and maintenance costs. Therefore this paper examines the case study of a classroom located in the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University in Rome and, to evaluate the possibility to combine natural and artificial light, it focuses on the realization of a new lighting system. This new solution is formed by LED sources and control systems able to modulate the power absorbed by every single lamp (to adapt, according to the hour and day, to the conditions of the natural light). In order to meet the EN 12464-1, the process of incorporating natural and artificial light must occur while guaranteeing both the minimum levels expected for the average illuminance E-m [lx] and the uniformity coefficient (E-min/E-m) and this is the reason why a simultaneous exertion of artificial lights and a variable shielding system of glass surfaces activated through a motorized electronic control unit is required. Thanks to the software DIALux Evo 5.1 a 3D model of the classroom was reproduced and validated in order to simulate the combination of natural and artificial lighting and to verify if the results complied with the regulations. This was followed by an analysis concerning: the reliability of the system (through the examination of the MTBF - Mean Time Between Failure) and energetic and economic aspects (through the software ecoCALC 4.5.4). The novelty of this study is represented by the fact that in order to obtain the highest results in each of the three fields examined, it is possible to avoid the exertion of those negative feedback control-type systems (requiring high installation and maintenance costs due to sensor devices), thanks to pre-programmed logic control systems based on the data obtained with the simulations by prediction softwares. In this case study the solution suggested, while using a pre-programmed control logic, presents a MTBF of 1205 h (about twice of a negative feedback system solution) with payback periods that justify the higher costs presented by the electronic characterizing the control logic system with respect to traditional plant solutions.

Abstract: Next-generation Smart Grid subsystems such as distributed district energy systems are likely to play significantly more important role in delivering a sustainable energy future. Therefore, there is a need for developing domain-specific standards-compliant automation platform which will facilitate their integration into the Smart Grid environment in order to provide value-added features during their exploitation. In this paper, utilization and adaptation of well accepted industrial automation standards such as OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and IEC 61850 for developing optimized middleware platform which will enable optimized remote control of flexible distributed multi-generation (DMG) energy systems is proposed. The simulation models of DMG systems are developed and connected to the middleware platform prototype in order to investigate benefits of DMG coordinated automation and evaluate economic and environmental impacts enabled by DMG remote control.

Abstract: This paper is a microgrid study of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), a large campus with diverse distributed energy resources (DER). It highlights a microgrid's "missing money", which sharply differs from a natural-gas-fired generation plant's "missing money" due to large-scale wind generation development. In response to UCSD's expressed financial interest, we assess three strategies for integrating renewable generation: peak load shifting, onsite photovoltaic firming and grid support. While all three strategies are technically feasible and can be cost-effective under certain conditions, California's current tariff structures and market prices do not offer sufficient incentives to motivate UCSD to offer these services. Alternative incentive mechanisms, which may resemble to those used to encourage renewable generation development, are necessary to induce UCSD's DER offer for renewables integration. Such mechanisms are also relevant to commercial and industrial loads across California, including the vast combined heat and power resources. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The evolution of energy markets is accelerating in the direction of a greater reliance upon distributed energy resources (DERs). To manage this increasing two-way complexity, virtual power plants (VPPs) are being deployed today all over the world. In this paper, a probabilistic model for optimal day ahead scheduling of electrical and thermal energy resources in a VPP is proposed where participation of energy storage systems and demand response programs (DRPs) are also taken into account In the proposed model, energy and reserve is simultaneously scheduled considering the uncertainties of market prices, electrical demand and intermittent renewable power generation. The Point Estimate Method (PEM) is applied in order to model the uncertainties of VPP's scheduling problem. Moreover, the optimal reserve scheduling of VPP is presented which efficiently decreases VPP's risk facing the unexpected fluctuations of uncertain parameters at the power delivery time. The results demonstrated that implementation of demand response programs (DRPs) would decrease total operation costs of VPP as well as its dependency on the upstream network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Three major perceived disadvantages of plug-in electric vehicles are limited driving range, slow recharge time, and availability of charging infrastructure. While increasing PEV range through larger and more efficient batteries may assuage concerns, public PEV charging infrastructure is required to increase the feasibility of widespread PEV adoption. In particular, Level 3 electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) can refuel a depleted PEV battery to 80% state of charge in half an hour. This work examines details of exact electric utility costs incurred by the operator of a public Level 3 EVSE used to refuel PEVs that perform two of the most common types of travel: driving to work and driving to shop. Both 44 kW and 120 kW EVSE refueling rates are considered. Utility rate models for Southern California are used to determine the cost of electricity. Cooperative game theory is then used to determine of the electrical demand charge incurred by each individual PEV that is charged. Results show that approximately 28-38% of typical travel results in a battery state of charge low enough to be eligible for Level 3 refueling. At low PEV total use, electric utility demand charges comprise an extremely high portion of electricity costs. Increasing PEV total use decreases demand charge contributions to the electricity costs, but must be coupled with parking management, such as valet parking, when dwell time at the destination is long (e.g., at work). Total energy costs to operate 44 kW Level 3 EVSE exceed $1 per kW h at low PEV use, but decrease as PEV use increases. The lowest costs occurred at the highest level of PEV use examined, resulting in a total energy cost of approximately $0.20 per kW h during the summer and $0.13 per kW h during the winter. Parking management may be avoided if multiple EVSE are installed, which is particularly effective in improving access for travel with a short dwell time (e.g., while shopping). Increasing EVSE refueling rate improves access to PEV refueling only if parking management is implemented, but always increases demand charges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The biogas fired tri-generation system for cooling, heating and electricity generation (BCCHP + PV) supported by a photovoltaic system (PV) is discussed and analyzed from energetic and ecological effectiveness point of view. Analyzed system is based on the internal combustion engine and the adsorption machine. For the evaluation of primary energy savings in the BCCHP aided by PV system, the indicators of the total primary energy savings (TPES) and relative primary energy savings APES were defined. Also an analysis is carried out of the reduction of greenhouse gases emission. In the ecological potential evaluation, the environmental impact as an indicator of the total greenhouse gasses reduction (TGHGR).is taken into account.
The presented detailed algorithm for the evaluation of the multigeneration system in the global balance boundary can be applied for the analysis of energy effects (consumption of primary energy) as well as ecological effect (emission of greenhouse gasses) for real data (e.g. hour by hour through the year of operation) taking into account random availability of renewable energy. It allows to take into account a very important factor characterized for renewable energy systems (RES) which is the variability or random availability (e.g. in the case of photovoltaic-PV) of primary energy. Particularly in the presented work the effects of the analysis and the application of the discusses algorithms have been demonstrated for the hour-by-hour availability of solar radiation and for the daily changing availability of chemical energy of biogas. Additionally, the energy and ecological evaluation algorithms have been integrated with the methods offered by exergy analysis. In the case of cogeneration systems there is a problem of the allocation of fuel between useful products (heat and electricity). The commonly applied methods of "energetic division" don't take into account different quality of products generated in the cogeneration unit. Moreover, these methods require subjective assumptions and it can lead in some cases to non-physical results of fuel allocation. It is commonly known that exergy losses decide on the amount of consumed energy driving the production process. If in the considered process two or more products are generated these losses should be proportionally allocated between these products. For this reason the correct allocation also should be done with the application of the exergetic allocation, what has been proposed in the algorithm presented in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: It is well known that the downsizing philosophy allows the improvement of the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) at part load operation for spark ignition (SI) engines. On the other hand, the BSFC is penalized at high load because of the knock occurrence and of further limitations on the turbine inlet temperature (TIT). Knock control forces the adoption of a late combustion phasing, causing a deterioration of the thermodynamic efficiency, while the TIT control requires the enrichment of the air-to-fuel ratio (A/F), with additional BSFC drawbacks.
In this work, two promising techniques are investigated by a 1D approach with the aim of improving the fuel economy of a turbocharged SI engine at full load knock-limited operation. The first technique is the recirculation of low-pressure cooled exhaust gas (EGR), while the second is the injection of liquid water at the intake ports. Proper "in-house developed" sub-models are used to describe the turbulence, combustion and knock phenomena.
The effects of the above techniques are studied in six operating points at full load and different speeds for various A/F levels and inert content, by varying the EGR rate and water-to-fuel ratio. The presented results highlight that both the solutions involve significant BSFC improvements, especially in the operating conditions at medium engine speeds. In fact, the introduction of inert gas in the cylinder contributes to reduce the knock tendency, resulting in the possibility to advance the combustion phasing and reduce, or even avoid, the mixture over-fuelling. The heat subtracted by the water evaporation enhances the above effects, resulting in an improved fuel economy. However, the BSFC advantages are limited by the maximum allowable in-cylinder pressure, TIT, turbocharger speed, and boost level.
The developed numerical procedure is able to take into account the complex interactions among different driving parameters affecting the engine behaviour. It can be hence very useful to define a numerical engine pre-calibration and to realistically predict the EGR- and water injection-related BSFC advantages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of wet ethanol with higher water content than the conventionally used in internal combustion engines can reduce fuel production costs due to lower energy expense during the distillation phase. However, during its combustion the extra water content may result in the deterioration of fuel conversion efficiency and therefore a global energy evaluation should be considered. This research investigated the operation of a single cylinder direct injected spark ignition engine running with gasoline, anhydrous ethanol and several wet ethanol compositions (5-20% of water-in-ethanol volumetric content) under stoichiometric and lean air/fuel ratios. Two part load conditions of 3.1 bar and 6.1 bar indicated mean effective pressure were evaluated at 1500 RPM. The impacts of increased water-in-ethanol content and lean operation on combustion and emissions were discussed. Higher water content affected the heat release rate, which increased the combustion duration and initial flame development phase. Lower nitrogen oxides emissions could be achieved with higher water-content ethanol at the expense of higher unburned hydrocarbon emission. An analysis of wet ethanol energy production costs and engine operation conditions was carried out. The lean engine operation with 10% (v/v) water-in-ethanol fuel showed global energy savings around 31% compared to anhydrous ethanol at stoichiometric conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this investigation the environmental impacts of the manufacturing processes of a new all-solid-state battery (SSB) concept in a pouch bag housing were assessed using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology for the first time. To do so, the different production steps were investigated in detail, based on actual laboratory scale production processes. All in- and outputs regarding material and energy flows were collected and assessed. As LCA investigations of products in an early state of research and development usually result in comparatively higher results than those of mature technologies in most impact categories, potential future improvements of production processes and efficiency were considered by adding two concepts to the investigation. Apart from the laboratory production which depicts the current workflow, an idealized laboratory production and a possible industrial production were portrayed as well.
The results indicate that electricity consumption plays a big role due to a lot of high temperature production steps. It needs to be improved for future industrial production. Also enhanced battery performance can strongly influence the results. Overall the laboratory scale results indeed improve strongly when assuming a careful use of resources, which will likely be a predominant target for industrial production. These findings therefore highlight hotspots and give improvement targets for future developments. It can also be deducted, that a comparison to the results of competing technologies that have already reached a commercial stage is not recommended for early LCAs.
To round things off a resource analysis was also conducted. It identifies the usage of lanthanum, lithium and zirconium oxide as critical, especially when taking laboratory production as a base. When looking at the scale up to industrial production parameters, lanthanum and lithium remain critical, zirconium oxide not. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Wood combustion is the main renewable heating source for European households and responsible for a large portion of the particle matter in the atmosphere. Firewood operated small-scale residential wood combustion units such as firewood stoves and tiled stoves are the most widespread wood combustion appliances in households. Next to purely technological reasons (i.e. type and age of appliance) and installation conditions (i.e. natural draft of chimney system), user behavior which includes all influences caused by the user during operation has a considerable effect on the combustion performance of room heating appliances. User behavior includes fuel related factors, different ways to ignite the fire, combustion air settings, as well as frequency and intensity of use. The objective of this work is to investigate user behavior by means of a survey. The survey aims to provide an overview as to how room heating appliances in European countries are used in real life. We performed a 28 question, multi-lingual online survey over a 14-week period. 1980 responses from 16 European countries were received. Most respondents are from Italy (35%), Germany (34%), Austria (12%) and Sweden (11%). Results Were separated by heating appliance type (firewood stove, tiled stove, cooker and other firewood stove), and by country. The results show a unique and detailed glimpse as to how room heating appliances are used in real life. They include the ignition procedure including used fire starters, point of fuel recharging, combustion air regulation and frequency of use. Results related to the fuel used (i.e. type of fuel, fuel conditions) are given in this paper, too. The results are crucial for further research and complement existing knowledge about the effects of the individual user and fuel related parameters on emissions and efficiency of room heating appliances.

Abstract: Coal mining not only produces, but also consumes a large amount of energy. Coal production has an extremely high energy efficiency potential, and benchmarking is critical to discover this potential. To address problems such as ambiguity of coal production (e.g. underground mining), benchmarking range and absence of both indicators and standards for energy efficiency benchmarking, this paper makes use of product-based and process-based benchmarking. These two techniques are used to construct a bench marking system for coal production with high energy efficiency, and improve the standards used at the eight coal mines owned by the Yankuang Group. Comparison and analysis of benchmarking in enterprises indicates that energy use during raw coal production could be reduced by 22.77%. Across China energy savings from coal production could reach 15.98-32.98 Mtce, with an equivalent 42-87 Mt of CO2 emissions saved. Lastly, this paper provides measures to improve coal production energy efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Understanding the long-run dynamics of OPEC and non-OPEC crude oil prices is important in an era of increased financialization of petroleum markets. Utilizing an ECM within a threshold cointegration and CGARCH errors framework, we provide evidence on the cointegrating relationship and estimate how and to what extent the respective prices adjust to eliminate disequilibrium. Our findings suggest that the adjustment process of OPEC prices to the positive discrepancies is slow which implies that OPEC producers do not prefer moderate oil prices; however, the reverse holds for non-OPEC producers. These results reflect distinct competitive behaviors between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A new hybrid methodology is introduced which is a combination of multiple regression model and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. Comparing the new approach and the vector auto-regression (VAR) model, this paper analyses the short-term dynamics of the energy efficiency index (EEI) in response to change in the five indicator variables for thermal power plants in China. The result indicates that: (i) The new hybrid model can directly calculate the EEIs of thermal power plants without artificial intervention. (ii) It can eliminate the disturbance of residual superposition. (iii) The new method will offer more direct information on the degree of volatility among determinants and operating inefficiency.

Abstract: The importance of load forecasting has been increasing lately and improving the use of energy resources remains a great challenge. The amount of data collected from Microgrid (MG) systems is growing while systems are becoming more sensitive, depending on small changes in the daily routine. The need for flexible and adaptive models has been increased for dealing with these problems. In this paper, a novel hybrid evolutionary fuzzy model with parameter optimization is proposed. Since finding optimal values for the fuzzy rules and weights is a highly combinatorial task, the parameter optimization of the model is tackled by a bio-inspired optimizer, so-called GES, which stems from a combination between two heuristic approaches, namely the Evolution Strategies and the GRASP procedure. Real data from electric utilities extracted from the literature are used to validate the proposed methodology. Computational results show that the proposed framework is suitable for short-term forecasting over microgrids and large-grids, being able to accurately predict data in short computational time. Compared to other hybrid model from the literature, our hybrid metaheuristic model obtained better forecasts for load forecasting in a MG scenario, reporting solutions with low variability of its forecasting errors.

Abstract: CO2 capture processes using aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) require significant energy expenditure. There are various possible structural modifications which can be implemented to reduce these energy requirements and enhance energy efficiency. However, as the optimal configuration may contain a combination of different modifications a systematic approach is necessary to consider all possibilities. In this study a superstructure including the conventional amine-based CO2 capture configuration and four different types of structural modifications is constructed in the process simulator UniSim (R). Optimization of this superstructure reveals the configuration and operating conditions giving the minimum energy costs, systematically and simultaneously considering all of the possible modifications included. This methodology is applied to a CO2 capture case study to illustrate how the proposed modeling and optimization framework can effectively investigate design options available for improving energy efficiency.

Abstract: Estimation of energy models from data is an important part of advanced fault detection and diagnosis tools for smart energy purposes. Estimated energy models can be used for a large variety of management and control tasks, spanning from model predictive building control to estimation of energy consumption and user behavior. In practical implementation, problems to be considered are the fact that some measurements of relevance are missing and must be estimated, and the fact that other measurements, collected at low sampling rate to save memory, make discretization of physics-based models critical. These problems make classical estimation tools inadequate and call for appropriate dual estimation schemes where states and parameters of a system are estimated simultaneously. In this work we develop dual estimation schemes based on Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) for constructing building energy models from data: in order to cope with the low sampling rate of data (with sampling time 15 min), an implicit discretization (Euler backward method) is adopted to discretize the continuous-time heat transfer dynamics. It is shown that explicit discretization methods like the Euler forward method, combined with 15 min sampling time, are ineffective for building reliable energy models (the discrete-time dynamics do not match the continuous-time ones): even explicit methods of higher order like the Runge-Kutta method fail to provide a good approximation of the continuous time dynamics which such large sampling time. Either smaller time steps or alternative discretization methods are required. We verify that the implicit Euler backward method provides good approximation of the continuous-time dynamics and can be easily implemented for our dual estimation purposes. The applicability of the proposed method in terms of estimation of both states and parameters is demonstrated via simulations and using historical data from a real-life building.

Abstract: Displacement of fossil fuel-based power through biomass co-firing could reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuels. In this study, data-intensive techno-economic models were developed to evaluate different co-firing technologies as well as the configurations of these technologies. The models Were developed to study 60 different scenarios involving various biomass feedstocks (wood chips, wheat straw, and forest residues) co-fired either with coal in a 500 MW subcritical pulverized coal (PC) plant or with natural gas in a 500 MW natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant to determine their technical potential and costs, as well as to determine environmental benefits. The results obtained reveal that the fully paid-off coal-fired power plant co-fired with forest residues is the most attractive option, having levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of $53.12-$54.50/MW h and CO2 abatement costs of $27.41-$31.15/tCO(2). When whole forest chips are co-fired with coal in a fully paid-off plant, the LCOE and CO2 abatement costs range from $54.68 to $56.41/MW h and $35.60 to $41.78/tCO(2), respectively. The LCOE and CO2 abatement costs for straw range from $54.62 to $57.35/MW h and $35.07 to $38.48/tCO(2), respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We have quantified the impact that an introduction of electric vehicles into the car fleet has on air quality (regarding NO and NO2) using a numerical dispersion model. An experimental campaign is conducted close to a highway in Milan, Italy. Meteorological parameters and chemical concentrations are measured along with the traffic emissions. We use a Lagrangian Stochastic Dispersion Model to create numerical simulations of the chemical reactions and dispersion involving pollutants from the highway. To evaluate the air pollution reductions, emission scenarios with different rates of electric vehicles introduction are simulated. We have found that only a significant replacement (50%) of non-electric vehicles with electric ones yields a remarkable reduction of the pollutant concentrations. However, even with lower electric vehicles introduction rates, the air quality improvements may be relevant during intense pollution episodes. The results provide useful information to decision makers and public administrators for planning measures to modify the car fleet composition aiming to improve the urban air quality.

Abstract: Engine idling of refrigerator trucks during loading and unloading contributes to greenhouse gas emissions due to their increased fuel consumption. This paper proposes a new anti-idling system that uses two sources of power, battery and engine-driven generator, to run the compressor of the refrigeration system. Therefore, idling can be eliminated because the engine is turned OFF and the battery supplies auxiliary power when the vehicle is stopped for loading or unloading. This system also takes advantage of regenerative braking for increased fuel savings. The power management of this system needs to satisfy two requirements: it must minimize fuel consumption in the whole cycle and must ensure that the battery has enough energy for powering the refrigeration system when the engine is OFF. To meet these objectives, a two-level controller is proposed. In the higher level of this controller, a fast dynamic programming technique that utilizes extracted statistical features of drive and duty cycles of a refrigerator truck is used to find suboptimal values of the initial and final SOC of any two consecutive loading/unloading stops. The lower level of the controller employs an adaptive equivalent fuel consumption minimization (A-ECMS) to determine the split ratio of auxiliary power between the generator and battery for each segment with initial and final SOC obtained by the high-level controller. The simulation results confirm that this new system can eliminate idling of refrigerator trucks and reduce their fuel consumption noticeably such that the cost of replacing components is recouped in a short period of time.

Abstract: In this work, two sets of experiments were performed including air and oxy-combustion premixed flames stabilized over a perforated-plate burner. A set of experiments was performed considering air-fuel combustion in order to identify a range of equivalence ratio for stable flame operation at fixed oxidizer Reynolds number and over a range of premixing ratio (namely 7, 25, 45, 67 and 128). Also, effects of premixing ratio (LID) on lower and upper flammability limits over a range of oxidizer Reynolds number were investigated. Another set of experiments was performed considering oxy-fuel combustion in order to identify a range of equivalence ratio for stable flame operation at fixed oxidizer Reynolds number. The study documents the visual flame length, appearance and color and identifies the extinction mechanism outside the flammability limits for both air and oxy-combustion flames over wide ranges of operating equivalence and premixing ratios. For air combustion flames, the results showed wide ranges of flammability limits at lower premixing ratios and tight ranges of flammability limits at higher premixing ratios. This can be attributed to the increase in the degree of flame diffusivity while reducing the premixing ratio and, as a result, more stable flame is obtained. Reductions in the emissions of NO and CO were observed while increasing the premixing ratio for the air combustion case. For the oxy-combustion flames, the results showed stable flame operation at oxygen fraction of 36%; however, the flammability limits were approximately 20% lower as compared to those of air combustion flames. Flash back was observed when operating oxygen fraction exceeded 40% and flame stability was affected badly with the decrease of oxygen fraction. The visual flame length was longer in cases of oxy-combustion flames as compared to those of air combustion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Optimal thermal management of modern internal combustion engines (ICE) is one of the key factors for reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. These are measured by using standardized driving cycles, like the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), during which the engine does not reach thermal steady state; engine efficiency and emissions are therefore penalized. Several techniques for improving ICE thermal efficiency were proposed, which range from the use of empirical look-up tables to pulsed pump operation. A systematic approach to the problem is however still missing and this paper aims to bridge this gap.
The paper proposes a Robust Model Predictive Control of the coolant flow rate, which makes use of a zero-dimensional model of the cooling system of an ICE. The control methodology incorporates explicitly the model uncertainties and achieves the synthesis of a state-feedback control law that minimizes the "worst case" objective function while taking into account the system constraints, as proposed by Kothare et al. (1996). The proposed control strategy is to adjust the coolant flow rate by means of an electric pump, in order to bring the cooling system to operate around the onset of nucleate boiling: across it during warm-up and above it (nucleate or saturated boiling) under fully warmed conditions. The computationally heavy optimization is carried out off-line, while during the operation of the engine the control parameters are simply picked-up on-line from look-up tables. Owing to the little computational effort required, the resulting control strategy is suitable for implementation in the ECU of a modern engine.
The control strategy was validated by means of experimental tests under several operating conditions, involving both warm-up and fully warmed engine thermal states. The tests were carried out with a small displacement Spark-Ignition Engine which was equipped with an electric coolant pump, directly driven by the control algorithm.
Results show that the controller is robust in terms of disturbance rejections, it respects the defined system constraints and is also very fast in terms of response to the perturbations. The experimental tests proved that the proposed control is effective in decreasing the warm-up time and in reducing the coolant flow rate under fully warmed conditions as compared to a standard configuration with pump speed proportional to engine speed. The adoption of these cooling control strategies will, therefore, result in lower fuel consumption and reduced CO2 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the current European energy context, the use of recovered industrial waste heat provides an attractive opportunity to substitute primary energy consumption by a low-emission and low-cost energy carrier. In the case of industrial waste heat, this potential is currently not only largely untapped, but also unaccounted for. In order to achieve a widespread use of recovered industrial waste heat, assessments with a large scope and high spatial resolution are needed. Three methods published in the period 20022010 have been found in the literature, which are potentially transferable to other regions. These three methods are based on either the energy consumption of each manufacturing sector or the individual site CO2 emissions. The scope of this analysis is, first, to investigate in how far a transfer of the figures to different countries or regions is sensible in comparison to former studies in the literature. In the process, some uncertainties when transferring methods were identified (different definitions of industry, different standard industrial activities classifications or no standard at all, etc.). The second goal is, once the methodology is accepted, to apply it to a case study, in this case the industrial sector in Spain and two of its counties (Catalonia and the Basque Country) for the years 2001, 2009, 2010 and 2013. In this period, and based on the different approaches employed, the Spanish annual industrial waste heat potential ranges from 54.3 to 151.1 PJ, Catalonia from 8.6 to 29.7 PJ, and from 7.2 to 11.9 PJ for the Basque Country. The methods are considered highly transferable but uncertainties inevitably arise in the case that the source and destination industrial sectors are very different. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Biofuel policy is under near constant review at both the federal and state level. For example, as part of on-going implementation of the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), the California Air Resources Board has recently designed and is implementing a new cost containment mechanism as part of the compliance credit market embedded within the LCFS. This mechanism was born out of concerns that there may be a shortage of LCFS credits, which could lead to an unpredictable rise in the credit price. In general, it is important to develop appropriate mathematical tools with which to estimate the impact of policy changes on biofuel markets. Motivated by the need for such analyses, a novel regional market model is developed that quantifies several categories of impacts across different regional markets. These market impacts include policy-specific effects of California's LCFS as well as the federal level Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Several scenarios are developed to highlight issues of long term LCFS feasibility; in particular, this work highlights the role that biodiesel/renewable diesel might need to play in order for the goals of the LCFS to be met. We find that biodiesel blending will need to increase dramatically within a short period of time (i.e., by 2016 all diesel fuel would need to be 20% blends) in order to generate enough LCFS credits. Additionally, this model highlights the indirect market linkages between the LCFS/RFS credit markets; certain biofuels can register under both programs and generate both credits. As a result, if attempts in the US Congressional to fully repeal the RFS are successful, it is possible that the LCFS credit price could increase more than 50%. Symmetrically, it is also true that if the LCFS program were eliminated, certain RFS credit markets would also be impacted, but to a lesser extent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The Ca-Looping (CaL) process is at the root of a promising 2nd generation technology for post-combustion CO2 capture at coal fired power plants. The process is based on the reversible and quick carbonation/calcination reaction of CaO/CaCO3 at high temperatures and allows using low cost, widely available and nontoxic CaO precursors such as natural limestone. In this work, the efficiency penalty caused by the integration of the Ca-looping technology into a coal fired power plant is analyzed. The results of the simulations based on the proposed integration model show that efficiency penalty varies between 4% and 7% points, which yields lower energy costs than other more mature post-combustion CO2 capture technologies such as the currently commercial amine scrubbing technology. A principal feature of the CaL process at CO2 capture conditions is that it produces a large amount of energy and therefore an optimized integration of the systems energy flows is essential for the feasibility of the integration at the commercial level. As a main novel contribution, CO2 capture efficiency is calculated in our work by considering the important role of the solid-state diffusion controlled carbonation phase, which becomes relevant when CaO regeneration is carried out under high CO2 partial pressure as is the case with the CaL process for CO2 capture. The results obtained based on the new model suggest that integration energy efficiency would be significantly improved as the solids residence time in the carbonator reactor is increased.

Abstract: Spectral beam splitting of sunlight can improve the efficiency of solar receivers. Hybrid photovoltaic thermal receivers designed for the concurrent generation of high grade heat and electricity can benefit considerably from this approach. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for filtering sunlight for high temperature hybrid solar receivers employed in linear solar concentrators. In this method, semiconductor doped glass is combined with propylene glycol to act simultaneously as the heat transfer fluid and a band pass filter for the optimal wavelength band, 700-1100 nm, required by silicon (Si) solar cells. Ray tracing and experimental analysis of the proposed design has shown that this filtering method directs 29% of the incoming concentrated solar spectrum to the silicon cells in the receiver with the remainder absorbed as heat. This means that 77% of the light in the optimal spectral band is effectively collected by the solar cells. The cell efficiency under this band can reach 26% in theory. The results demonstrate the potential for a simpler spectral filtering mechanism that is suitable for concentrating hybrid solar receivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ethanol production from C1 compounds, such as carbon monoxide, using acetogenic bacteria is an attractive alternative to produce renewable fuels. However, the process is generally associated with acetic acid accumulation, which is often produced in larger quantities than ethanol itself. This study shows the continuous production of ethanol and complete conversion of produced acetic acid to ethanol, which is possible through pH shifts from high pH to low pH using an optimized medium and one single gas-fed bioreactor. A first study with a single pH shift resulted in the production of 2408 mg/L of ethanol without any accumulation of acetic acid. In a next study a final ethanol concentration of 4260 mg/L was reached with just one pH shift and one partial medium renewal. These results indicate that maintaining an optimal growth pH at the beginning of the process in order to obtain a high cell mass, and later shifting the pH to a low value will improve ethanol productivity and avoid any acetic acid accumulation.

Abstract: Solar driven air conditioning systems can cope with solar collectors working in a wide range of temperatures. Sorption systems, including absorption and adsorption refrigeration systems, are among the best choices for solar cooling. Five systems including modular silica gel-water adsorption chiller, single/double effect LiBr-water absorption chiller, 1.n effect LiBr-water absorption chiller, CaCl2/AC (activated carbon)-ammonia adsorption refrigerator, and the water-ammonia absorption ice maker with better internal heat recovery were presented. The above five sorption chillers/refrigerators work under various driven temperatures and fulfill different refrigeration demands. The thermodynamic design and system development of the systems were shown. All these systems have improvements in comparison with existing systems and may offer good options for high efficient solar cooling in the near future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights eserved.

Abstract: A new and general method for holistic system modeling using multi-pole formalism is presented. The motivation of our research is to develop a structured method for simultaneous system description and assessment with respect to several criteria, e.g. economic profitability, energetic efficiency and environmental impact. The method is named multi-pole system analysis (MPSA) and allows to combine an arbitrarily complex connected system. Thus, one ends up with a simple mathematical expression which generates a concentrated and broad system understanding and highlights interactions of multiple input and output quantities. The MPSA method is used to describe a conceptual wind-energy converter both energetically and economically. The resulting techno-economic analysis consists of the three essential steps of (i) techno-economic modeling, (ii) detailed energetic and economic analysis and (iii) system optimization. By applying these steps one obtains systematically and in a structured manner the technoeconomic optimal system. The energetic analysis is performed by applying axiomatic conversion laws on a presented physical model of the energy conversion system. By using empiric scaling laws not only one but a multitude of possible systems are considered. The economic analysis is performed by applying economic models of the dynamic investment analysis. The techno-economic optimal system in the classic definition of Pareto optimality is shown. The method shows that only a simultaneous consideration of energetic and economic aspects leads to reasonable system design and operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The need for high efficiency energy systems is of vital importance, due to depleting reserves of fossil fuels and increasing environmental problems. Industrial operations commonly feature the problem of rejecting large quantities of low-grade waste heat to the environment. The aim of this work is to develop methods for the conceptual screening and incorporation of low-temperature heat upgrading technologies in process sites.
The screening process involves determination of the best technology to upgrade waste heat in process sites, and the combination of waste heat source and sink temperatures for a technology. Novel simplified models of mechanical heat pumps, absorption heat pumps and absorption heat transformers are proposed to support this analysis. These models predict the ratio of the real performance to the ideal performance in a more accurate way, than previous simplified models, taking into account the effect of changing operating temperatures, working fluids non-ideal behaviour and the system component inefficiencies.
A novel, systems-oriented criterion is also proposed for conceptual screening and selection of heat pumps in process sites. The criterion (i.e. the primary fuel recovery ratio) measures the savings in primary fuel from heat upgraded, taking into account power required to drive mechanical heat pumps and missed opportunities for steam generation when absorption systems are used.
A graphical based methodology is also developed for applying the PRR in process sites and applied to a medium scale petroleum refinery. Results show that applying the PRR yields 9.2% additional savings in primary fuel compared to using the coefficient of performance to screen and incorporate heat pumps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the impact of different Electric Vehicle (EV) penetration on quasi real-time Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) of smart distribution networks. Recent WO solutions enable capturing data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in quasi real-time to minimize distribution networks loss costs and perform Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) to save energy. The emergence of EVs throughout distribution feeder increases grid complexity and uncertainty levels that could affect AMI-based VVO objectives. Hence, this paper primarily introduces an AMI-based WO engine, able to minimize grid loss and Volt-VAR control assets operating costs while maximizing CVR benefit. It then presents a real-time co-simulation platform comprised of the VVO engine, grid model in a real-time simulator and monitoring platform, communicating with each other through DNP.3 protocol, to test the precision and performance of AMI-based WO in presence of different EV penetration levels. Accordingly, 33-node distribution feeder is studied through different EV penetration scenarios. The results show significant changes in AMI-based WO performance especially in CVR sub-part of WO according to EV model and type. Thus, this study could lead near future WO solutions to gain higher levels of accuracy and efficiency considering smart microgrid components such as EV in their models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper proposes an exergy-based well-to-wheels analysis to compare different passenger vehicles, based on three key indicators: petroleum energy use, CO2 emissions, and economic cost. A set of fuel pathways, including petroleum-based fuels, compressed natural gas, biofuels, and electricity are considered in five representative national energy mixes, namely Brazil, China, France, Italy, and the United States of America. Results show no fundamental difference in the fossil fuel pathways among the five scenarios considered. Compressed natural gas vehicles and electric vehicles can completely displace oil consumption in the personal transportation sector. Compressed natural gas vehicles also reduce CO2 emissions by over 20% compared to gasoline vehicles. Emissions from electric vehicles greatly vary depending on the electricity mix. In low-carbon electricity mixes electric vehicles reach almost-zero CO2 emissions, while the use of biofuels leads to the lowest CO2 emissions in carbon-intensive electricity generation mixes, where vehicles running on E85 could reduce CO2 emission by over 50% compared to gasoline vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles show the lowest overall economic cost, due to improved efficiency and low cost of petroleum-based fuels. Vehicles running on electricity are characterized by significantly higher capital cost and lower operating costs. Thus, different electricity generation costs impact minimally the overall cost. These results can be used to inform decision-makers regarding the multidimensional impact of passenger vehicles, including environmental impact, economic cost, and depletion of primary energy resources, with particular focus on petroleum.

Abstract: Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Plants (ISCCs), composed of a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant and a Natural Gas-Fired Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant, have been recently introduced in the power generation sector as a technology with the potential to simultaneously reduce fossil fuel usage and the costs of integrating solar power in an electricity system. This study quantifies the economic and environmental benefits of an ISCC power plant relative to a stand-alone CSP with energy storage, and a NGCC plant. The corresponding levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the Cost of Carbon Abatement (CoA) are estimated by simulating hourly operations for five U.S. locations with different solar resources and ambient temperature, under varying assumptions regarding natural gas prices, tax incentives, capacity factors, and capital costs. Results show that integrating the CSP into an ISCC reduces the LCOE of solar generated electricity by 35-40% relative to a stand-alone CSP plant, and provides the additional benefit of dispatchability. An ISCC also outperforms a CSP with energy storage in terms of LCOE and CoA. The current LCOE of an ISCC is lower than that of a stand-alone NGCC when natural gas prices reach 13.5 $/MMBtu, while its CoA is lower at a fuel price of 8.5 $/MMBtu. Although, under low to moderate natural gas price conditions, a NGCC generates electricity and abates carbon emissions at a lower cost than an ISCC; small changes in the capacity factor of an ISCC relative to the NGCC, or capital cost reductions for the CSP components significantly tilt the balance in the ISCC's favor. Hence, this technology should be seriously considered as a cost-effective baseload electricity generation alternative to speed up the transition to sustainable energy systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper puts forward a concept of 'potential carbon' and gives a definition analogous to potential energy. Potential carbon explains: (1) what is the driving force of the difference of carbon emissions, and (2) what is the position in the force field. On the basis, an approach about potential carbon analysis is developed to investigate a physical mechanism of carbon-related balance between energy supply and demand. Especially, a derived evaluation parameter of critical carbon level (CCL), which depends on availability of local energy sources and energy use profile, can reflect a geographical feature of a zone or zones in carbon-related balance. The proposed methodology is applied in a case of Haidian North region, Beijing. The result shows that potential carbon analysis is able to assist in making decisions on energy source planning to meet energy demand within carbon emission constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper, the methane conversion into hydrogen is investigated experimentally in a nanosecond pulsed DBD reactor. In order to achieve pure hydrogen production with minimum power consumption, effects of some operating parameters including external electrode length, applied voltage and pulse repetition frequency have been evaluated. Results show that although higher CH4 conversion and H-2 concentration can be obtained at longer electrode lengths, higher applied voltages and pulse repetition frequencies, these parameters should be optimized for efficient hydrogen production. Actually, the maximum CH4 conversion of 87.2% and maximum hydrogen percentage of 80% are obtained at the external electrode length, discharge power, voltage and frequency of 15 cm, 268.92 W, 12 kV and 10 kHz, respectively. However, the maximum efficiency of 7.23% is achieved at the external electrode length of 15 cm, applied voltage of 6 kV, pulse repetition frequency of 0.9 kHz and discharge power of 4 W. Furthermore, at this condition, due to low temperature of discharge zone very little amount of solid carbon was observed on the inner electrode surface of the reactor.

Abstract: In order to obtain high CO2 absorption efficiency and low ammonia escape rate, mixed additives of piperazine and Ni(II) were used as absorbent in bubbling reactor. The effects of mixed additive on CO2 absorption efficiency and ammonia escape rate were investigated; the performances of mixed additive in removal process were compared with that of pure ammonia solution. The proposed mechanism was analyzed by XRD and UV-visible spectrophotometer. The mixed additive has well effect on CO2 absorption efficiency and ammonia escape reduction. The CO2 absorption efficiency was 72% when 2 wt% ammonia solution mixed with 0.025 mol/L piperazine and 0.05 mol/L Ni(II), higher than that achieved by 3 wt% ammonia solution without additive, and the amount of ammonia loss was nearly 1/3 compared with 3 wt% pure ammonia solution. This paper provided one feasible method which is beneficial to the balance between CO2 absorption and ammonia escape in CO2 capture process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: One major obstacle in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD), retrofitting and energy performance evaluation is the lack of detailed hourly cooling load data. Cooling load measurement in commercial buildings is expensive and sometimes very difficult to implement. Detailed building simulation models, such as EnergyPlus, are too complicated to build and also must be calibrated. In this paper, an hourly cooling load prediction model, called the "RC-S" model, is proposed. This new cooling load calculation approach consists of a simplified thermal network model of the building envelope, a thermal network model for the building internal mass and the internal cooling load model from the submetering system. One existing RC model is introduced as reference model and three types of "RC-S" models are set up in this study. Genetic algorithm (GA) is selected to optimize the parameters in those models. Measurement data collected from a real commercial building and simulation data obtained from EnergyPlus model of the same commercial building are used to train and test the four models. The results prove that the proposed "RC-S" cooling load calculation method is more accurate than the existing RC model and much simpler than whole building simulation models. It can provide reasonable estimations of cooling loads for HVAC FDD and other performance evaluations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Autothermal Chemical-Looping Reforming (a-CLR) is a process which allows hydrogen production avoiding the environmental penalty of CO2 emission typically produced in other processes. The major advantage of this technology is that the heat needed for syngas production is generated by the process itself. The heat necessary for the endothermic reactions is supplied by a Ni-based oxygen-carrier (OC) circulatihg between two reactors: the air reactor (AR), where the OC is oxidized by air, and the fuel reactor (FR), where the fuel is converted to syngas. Other important advantage is that this process also allows the production of pure N-2 in the AR outlet stream. A renewable fuel such as bioethanol was chosen in this work due to their increasing worldwide production and the current excess of this fuel presented by different countries.
In this work, mass and heat balances were done to determine the auto-thermal conditions that maximize H-2 production, assuming that the product gas was in thermodynamic equilibrium. Three different types of bioethanol has been considered according to their ethanol purity; Dehydrated ethanol (approximate to 100 vol.%), hydrated ethanol vol.%), and diluted ethanol (approximate to 52 vol.%). It has been observed that the higher H-2 production (4.62 mol of H-2 per mol of EtOH) has been obtained with the use of diluted ethanol and the surplus energy needed could be compensated by the energy save achieved during the purification of ethanol in the production process.

Abstract: In this paper, a systematic review of academic literature and policy papers since 2008 is undertaken with an aim of identifying the prevalent energy systems models and tools in the UK. A list of all referenced models is presented and the literature is analysed with regards sectoral coverage and technological inclusion, as well as mathematical structure of models.
The paper compares available models using an appropriate classification schema, the introduction of which is aimed at making the model landscape more accessible and perspicuous, thereby enhancing the diversity of models within use. The distinct classification presented in this paper comprises three sections, which specify the model purpose and structure, technological detail and mathematical approach. The schema is not designed to be comprehensive, but rather to be a broad classification with pertinent level of information required to differentiate between models.
As an example, the UK model landscape is considered and 22 models are classified in three tables, as per the proposed schema. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

Abstract: A real-time control-optimization framework previously developed across multiple time scales is used for the analysis of power plant net operating revenue when retrofitted with a carbon capture plant. This framework which features high sample frequency commensurate with electricity dispatch and control instrumentation levels is proposed as a decision support tool for flexible operation of the carbon capture plant while considering electricity and carbon price dynamics. This paper presents the results of implementing this framework for operational flexibility of solvent-based post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) process in response to power plant dynamic loads (load following and unit turndown). An integrated plant (power plant with PCC) subject to forecast 2020 electricity and carbon prices is shown to generate yearly net operating revenue of approximately 12% of the gross revenue. While, the same integrated plant generates net operating revenue loss of roughly 13% under 2011 electricity and carbon prices. These results underpin the strategy that employs the proposed optimization-based control framework for flexible operation of a PCC plant in the year 2020, because such framework captures financial benefits hidden in the dynamics of electricity load, electricity and carbon price trends, and does so at high temporal resolution.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study conducted on an oil-free steam piston expander for micro combined heat and power systems. This expander can produce electrical power (between 740 and 2400 W) with a significant range of supply temperature (between 260 and 340 degrees C) and pressure (between 20 and 34 bar). The expander electrical power output exhibits a fast dynamic response to a change of working or supply fluid conditions. The reached expander overall isentropic efficiency (including electrical generator efficiency) was between 19% and 40%.
An empirical model has been developed in order to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the system by varying working variables such as supply and exhaust pressures, rotational speed and supply temperature. The parameters of this model have been identified using experimental results. The sensitivity analysis showed a limited increase of the electrical power output with a rotational speed until 900 rpm and a reduction of the power output for values beyond 900 rpm. It also highlighted the significant positive impact of the supply pressure on the electrical power output and the negative impact of the superheating on the expander overall isentropic efficiency.
The obtained results are useful for the future control of the expander integrated into a Rankine cycle.
Since the fluid at the expander exhaust is steam at a pressure close to 1 bar, it is possible to produce heat at a temperature close to 80 degrees C, which is sufficient for most domestic applications (heating or direct hot water production). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Within a medium-term market horizon, this research work provides a methodology that allows a commercial virtual power plant (CVPP) to form an optimal coalition of heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs) based on weekly bilateral contracting, futures-market involvement, and pool participation. The established model aims at composing an optimal portfolio of available DERs and jointly takes into account the risk associated with the energy trading strategy of the CVPP. Perceiving the fact that pool prices have highly uncertain nature, a framework based on stochastic programming approach is utilized to model this decision-making problem. The proposed framework consists of two stages. The first stage deals with decisions regarding DERs optimal selection for the VPP coalition, the amount of agreed quantity in the bilateral negotiation, and the type and quantity selection of futures-market contracts as well. In the second stage, decisions are made based on the most plausible realizations of the stochastic prices in the day-ahead market. For a given pre-specified risk level on profit volatility, the main objective is to maximize the expected profit for the VPP manager over the planning horizon. The efficiency and applicability of the developed model is illustrated and analyzed by its implementation in a system with few heterogeneous DERs and through different scenarios, and finally thereby meaningful conclusions are duly drawn.

Abstract: Laboratory tests of two heat storage units based on the principle of stable supercooling of sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) mixtures were carried out. One unit was filled with 199.5 kg of SAT with 9% extra water to avoid phase separation of the incongruently melting salt hydrate. The other unit was filled with 220 kg SAT mixture thickened with 1% carboxymethyl cellulose. The heat exchange capacity rate during the charging of the unit with the extra water was significantly higher than for the unit with the thickening agent due to the different levels of convection. The SAT mixtures in the units were stable and supercooled at indoor ambient temperatures for up to two months, after which the units were discharged. The energy discharged after solidification of the supercooled SAT and water mixture was 194 kJ/kg in the first test cycle, dropping to 179 kJ/kg after 20 test cycles. The energy discharged from the unit with SAT and the thickening agent after solidification was stable at 205 KJ/kg over 6 test cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The green systems ensured a green space, improved the thermal comfort of the residents by making the seasonal indoor temperature pleasant, and saved energy in buildings. This study aimed to develop an optimization model for the optimal green systems by considering the thermal comfort in and energy consumption of an educational facility. In addition, the optimal design scenarios were analyzed considering their economic and environmental effects. The study was conducted as follows: (i) selection of the design variables and objective function; (ii) optimization of the green systems; (iii) comparative analysis of the standard and optimal designs; and (iv) economic and environmental assessment of the optimal design scenarios. In order to compare the thermal comfort of the green systems with that of the existing building, this study used the percentage of predicted dissatisfied (PPD) which is the thermal comfort index based on Fanger's model. The implementation of the green systems improved the thermal comfort by 0.18-2.18% in terms of PPD, and reduced the energy consumption by 0.02-11.00%. The economic and environmental effects of the optimal green systems also showed up to 12.62% and 18.36% reductions, respectively. Thus, the implementation of the green systems was effective in terms of thermal comfort, energy consumption, life cycle cost, and life cycle assessment. This study could help the potential green systems users establish the optimal green systems in terms of thermal comfort, energy consumption, and the economic and environmental effects.

Abstract: This is the first empirical study to use annual data to probe the stationary property of non-fossil energy consumption in Japan. To understand the behavior of non-fossil energy from different sources, we adopt the univariate and panel Lagrange Multiplier unit root test, which can accommodate multiple structural breaks in data-generating processes, together with the Fourier-type Lagrange Multiplier test under a non-linear framework. Our empirical findings emphasize a difference between the stationary behavior of nuclear energy and renewable energy. Nuclear energy contains a unit root, which implies that random shocks to nuclear energy consumption, defined as regulatory change, may result in a permanent deviation from original target levels. However, renewable energy consumption series are found to be stationary, which implies that extant energy polices for such consumption could have a transitory effect. Thus, an innovation policy using effective and flexible incentive mechanisms needs to be adopted to enlarge renewable energy deployment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel poly-generation system is proposed for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and acetylene production with inherent CO2 capture and COS reduction. It is based on calcium looping coal gasification and oxygen-thermal CaC2 preparation. The system is comprised of calcium looping gasification reactors, preheaters, oxygen-thermal CaC2 furnace, and carbide slag modifier. Modified carbide slag and fresh CaCO3 are used as raw materials for sorption enhanced hydrogen production (SEHP). The cycled CaO-based sorbent is fed into oxygen-thermal CaC2 furnace for CaC2 production after calcination. CO-rich gas is generated from the furnace simultaneously. A portion of CO-rich gas which includes COS is fed into calcium looping gasification system to generate extra hydrogen. In addition, CO2 and COS are captured through the CaO-based sorbent. To maintain the heat balance of the system, a portion of CO-rich gas is fed into the regenerator for combustion. The entire process is modeled and simulated using Aspen Plus software. The proposed system efficiency could reach 81.62%. Parameters that affect the target products (H-2, CO, C2H2, and CaC2) are investigated in the sensitive analysis, including stearn/CO/CaO ratio, riser temperature, coke/CaO/O-2 ratio, and coal species.

Abstract: This paper presented a novel mathematical programming model for the simultaneous optimization of heat integrated water allocation networks featuring parallel heat exchanger network (HEN) structure. In the HEN structure, both freshwater and wastewater can be split freely. This model was suitable for both uniform wastewater treatment and separate wastewater treatment cases. The proposed model was formulated as a MINLP (mixed-integer non-linear programming) problem, making it applicable to large scale problems. The main objective was to minimize the total annual cost. Three literature examples, including a large scale example, were illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the model. It was shown that the proposed method was as accurate as the literature methods for small scale problems, but performed better for large scale problem applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic cooling performance of a novel system combining natural ventilation with diffuse ceiling inlet and thermally activated building systems (TABS). This system is tested in the lab under three climatic conditions representing typical seasons in Denmark, including a typical winter day, a typical day in the transitional season and a typical summer day. The corresponding dynamic control strategies have been designed for these three cases in the measurements. In the winter case, TABS have to be activated for two hours to supply extra heating to ensure a comfortable indoor environment. In the case representing the transitional season, changing the ventilation rate during both occupied and un-occupied hours can ensure the thermal autonomy of the room without extra heating or cooling from TABS. In the summer case, the free cooling potential of ventilation air is limited due to the relatively high inlet air temperature. Therefore, TABS are activated for ten hours to supply the.extra cooling. Due to the use of the diffuse ceiling, the whole-body and local thermal comfort conditions are quite good in the measurements. The dynamic measurements in the paper are beneficial to the future design and application of this system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Modeling of batteries in photovoltaic systems has been a major issue related to the random dynamic regime imposed by the changes of solar irradiation and ambient temperature added to the complexity of battery electrochemical and electrical behaviors. However, various approaches have been proposed to model the battery behavior by predicting from detailed electrochemical, electrical or analytical models to high-level stochastic models. In this paper, an improvement of dynamic electrical battery model is proposed by automatic parameter extraction using genetic algorithm in order to give usefulness and future implementation for practical application. It is highlighted that the enhancement of 21 values of the parameters of CEIMAT model presents a good agreement with real measurements for different modes like charge or discharge and various conditions.

Abstract: Latent heat thermal energy storage is a promising option for efficient utilization of intermitted and instable energy. However, the intrinsically low thermal conductivity of phase-change materials (PCMs) is the major shortage, leading to low energy charging and discharging rate. An experimental setup was designed to investigate the dynamic thermal behavior of a shell-and-tube latent heat thermal storage unit. Paraffin wax was employed as the PCM, of which the thermal properties, including that of melting temperature and latent heat, were detected by Differential Scanning Calorimetry. In order to improve the heat transfer performance, copper foam and a bottom fin were compounder:110 the PCM. High temperature water flowed through the copper tube as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The temperature variations of the selected detected points inside PCM and the solid-liquid interface evolution in axial plane of symmetry for three samples, including that of pure paraffin, paraffin-copper foam composites without and with the bottom fin, were recorded under the different heating temperatures and flow rates of HTF. The experimental results indicate that completely melting the PCM in composite takes over 1/3 less time than that of pure paraffin under the same operating conditions. The total charging time consumption of the composite with a bottom fin is the least, as well as the heat transfer rate is the largest among the three samples. The influence of HTF temperature on the charging process is more significant than that of the HTF flow rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy conversion from heat to sound is desirable in some practical applications such as thermoacoustic heat engines or cooling systems. However, it is unwanted in gas turbine or aeroengine combustors. In this work, a Rijke-type thermoacoustic model with a linearly varied mean temperature configuration is developed. An acoustically compact heat source is confined and characterized by a modified form of King's law. Unlike previous models available in the literature, the mean temperature is assumed to undergo not only a sudden jump across the heat source but also linearly increasing and decreasing in the pre- and after-heating regions respectively. Such mean temperature configuration is consistent with the experimental measurement. Coupling the heat source model with a Galerkin series expansion of the acoustic fluctuations provides a platform to gain insight on (1) the nonlinearity of the thermoacoustic system, (2) onset of limit cycle oscillations, (3) predicting its non-normality behaviors, (4) energy distribution and transfer between neighboring eigenmodes, and (5) evaluating the performance of feedback controllers. Pseudospectra and transient energy growth analyses are then performed. It reveals that the system is non-normal. And it is associated with transient growth of acoustical energy. The non-normality is found to be less intensified in comparison with that in a system with an invariant mean temperature from pre- and after-heating regions. To mitigate these limit cycle oscillations, the heat-to-sound coupling is interrupted by implementing multiple monopole-like actuators driven by a LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) controller. For comparison, a pole-placement controller is also implemented. Approximately 76 dB sound pressure level reduction is achieved. However, implementing the LQG controller is shown to be associated with transient growth of acoustical energy, which has potential to trigger thermoacoustic instability. The present work opens up new applicable way to model thermoacoustic systems in the presence of a mean temperature gradient. Furthermore, it reveals new potential risk of applying active controllers to stabilize thermoacoustic systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The interest of investigating offshore wind characteristics is receiving growing attention worldwide, which mainly attempts to boost the development of offshore wind energy and accelerate sustainable development. In particular, the understanding of offshore wind characteristics at the hub heights of wind turbines is of great significance in regard to the assessment of economic feasibility and structural design of wind turbines. Since traditional meteorological masts have limitations in height due to economic and technical considerations, remote sensing techniques have increasingly been employed for offshore wind observations.
This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of offshore wind characteristics on the basis of measurements from a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system at an offshore site in Hong Kong. The fidelity of the wind LiDAR measurements was firstly examined by comparing with those obtained from anemometers on a nearby meteorological mast. Statistical analysis of wind speed was performed by means of the Weibull distribution function, and the results were subsequently used to facilitate the determination of several characteristic parameters associated with wind energy applications. The vertical profiles of wind speed derived from the LiDAR system were compared with existing models. Characteristics of wind shear coefficient were examined within different height ranges. Furthermore, the offshore turbulence characteristics were investigated, including the turbulence intensity and gust factor. The outcomes of this study are expected to provide useful information for the development of offshore wind energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We model the economic incentives for market participants to cooperate in the development of a micro grid in a small electricity network served by a regulated utility. The microgrid can provide energy, ancillary services, heat and enhanced reliability to its customers. Using the framework of cooperative game theory, assuming exchangeable utility and full public information, we quantify how microgrid development affects prices, costs and benefits for parties in the network under alternative sets of assumptions. Our analysis yields three main results. First, market failures mean that the misalignment between the social objective (market efficiency) and objectives of private parties (profit maximization and consumer surplus maximization) can incent investment in inefficient scale and types of microgrid installations. We discuss how regulators can facilitate the realization of efficient market outcomes. Second, if the regulator does not correctly anticipate the timing of microgrid introduction and does not account for it in the rate making process, social benefits associated with microgrid development could be lower and suboptimal investments may take place, relative to the case in which there is no regulatory lag. Third, utility customers could reap most of the benefits of microgrid introduction, if microgrids result in lower electric rates for all customers. However, when regulated prices are above the marginal cost of power provided by the utility, introducing microgrids can instead raise rates and the resulting economic losses to utility customers might exceed the economic gains to the microgrid owner and its consumers. Our study shows how the cooperative game framework can be useful to regulators and policy makers for identifying the beneficiaries of microgrid promotion policies, and for correcting the market failures in utility pricing that can distort incentives for microgrid investment.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the design optimization of a stand-alone hybrid microgrid serving a 2000 inhabitants community located in a rural area of Bihar (India) and it investigates the potential of the use of wood biomass for electricity generation.
The economic performance of the different power generation configurations is evaluated simulating the microgrid operation over four periods of five days representative of a whole year with a time step of 10 min. The system operation is defined by an Energy Management System (EMS) which ensures that the demand of different goods by the community (AC and DC power, heating, domestic hot water, cooling and water for irrigation and domestic use) is satisfied with the minimum operational cost thanks to a proper optimization of the programmable units scheduling. For each time step, the most cost effective schedule is obtained using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) embedded in a rolling horizon approach considering start-up penalties, battery wear cost, ramp limits of each component and other operational constraints.
Three different system configurations are investigated. The first one considers the combination of photovoltaic panels and a diesel internal combustion engine (ICE). The other two investigate the possibility to substitute the fossil fuel generator with a renewable energy dispatchable generator powered by wood biomass: (i) a down-draft gasifier coupled with an ICE and (ii) a boiler coupled with an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC).
The obtained results show that the integration of renewable energy sources technologies has a beneficial effect on the LCOE of isolated microgrids. The introduction of PV panels allows, in the optimal case, a LCOE reduction of 19% in comparison with system based only on Diesel engine. A further, twice as much, decrease (up to 38%) is attainable using biomass as main energy source: both Gasifier-based and ORC-based systems show similar economic performances and ensure a share of electricity generated by renewables of about 95%.

Abstract: Accounting for technological changes and innovation is important when assessing the implications of rapidly-developing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation technologies. Technological learning curves have been commonly used as a tool to understand technological change as a function of cumulative production. Traditional learning curve approaches, however, do not distinguish the direct and upstream, supply chain technological changes by which cost reductions are achieved. While recent advances in learning curves have focused on distinguishing the different physical and economic drivers of learning, forecasted technological changes have not been applied to estimate the potential changes in the environmental performance of a technology. This article illustrates how distinguishing the different effects of technological learning throughout the supply chain can help assess the changing costs, environmental impacts and natural resource implications of technologies as they develop. We propose a mathematical framework to distinguish the effects of learning on the direct inputs to a technology from the effects of learning on value added, and we incorporate those effects throughout the supply chain of a technology using a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. An example for cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics (PV) illustrates how the proposed framework can be implemented. Results show that that life cycle GHG emissions can decrease at least 40% and costs can decrease at least 50% as cumulative production of CdTe reaches 100 GW. Technological learning in supply chain processes can further reduce emissions and costs by up to 1-2%. Lastly, we discuss the implications of using this new technological learning framework in the long-term assessment of the costs, environmental impacts and resource requirements of technologies using life-cycle assessment.

Abstract: This review considers data and models for CO2 transport. The thermophysical properties of CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures are needed as a basis for various models within CO2 capture and storage (CCS). In particular, this is true for transient models of pipes and vessels. Here, the data situation for phase equilibria, density, speed of sound, viscosity and thermal conductivity is reviewed, and property models are considered. Further, transient flow data and models for pipes are reviewed, including considerations regarding running-ductile fractures, which are essential to understand for safety. A depressurization case study based on recently published expansion-tube data is included as well. Non-equilibrium modelling of flow and phase equilibria are reviewed. Further, aspects related to the transport of CO2 by ship are considered. Many things are known about CO2 transport, e.g., that it is feasible and safe. However, if full-scale CCS were to be deployed today, conservative design and operational decisions would have to be made due to the lack of quantitative validated models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Thermal insulation of building envelope plays a key-role in energy saving: a growing interest is focused on new materials, such as the recycled and sustainable ones. Innovative mineral fiber insulating panels were developed and investigated as a strategy for building refurbishment. The thermal and acoustic properties were investigated in order to compare them to conventional solutions. The thermal conductivity was evaluated by means of a Heat Flow meter apparatus: it is in the 0.031-0.034 W/(m K) range, depending on the density. The acoustic absorption coefficient and the Transmission Loss values measured by means of Kundt's Tube showed a very good acoustic behavior, when compared to conventional solutions with similar chemical composition, but worse mechanical resistance, such as rock wool panels. The low value of thermal conductivity (0.0312 W/(m K) for a density of 165 kg/m(3)), together with other characteristics such as acoustic insulation improvement, sustainability (very low presence of additives, such as resin), mechanical resistance, high resistance to fire, and finally easy application in buildings with very low thicknesses (9-27 mm) suggest this solution as a very useful one for building refurbishment, especially for historical buildings.

Abstract: Chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) are carbon capture technologies which achieve gas separation by means of cycling oxidation and reduction of a solid oxygen carrier. In this study, the performance and CLOU properties of an oxygen carrier with perovskite structure, CaMn0.9Mg0.1O3-delta, were investigated in a 10 kW pilot. The fuel consisted of biochar with very low sulphur content. Around 37 h of operation with fuel were carried out in the 10 kW chemical looping combustor. Previous operational experience in this unit has been achieved using different natural minerals as oxygen carrier - mainly ilmenite and manganese ore. Parametric studies performed in this work included variation of fuel flow, solids circulation rate, temperature and fluidization gas in the fuel reactor. The oxygen carrier was exposed to a total 73 h of hot fluidization (T > 600 degrees C). No hard particle agglomerations were formed during the experiments. An oxygen demand as low as 2.1% could be reached under stable operating conditions, with a carbon capture efficiency of up to 98%. CLOU properties were observed at all fuel reactor temperatures, ensuring stable operation even without steam as gasification agent present in the fuel reactor. The results suggest that CaMn0.9Mg0.1O3-delta is suitable for the use as oxygen carrier in chemical looping combustion of solid biochar and offers higher gas conversion than previously tested materials without CLOU properties such as ilmenite. The experiments constitute the first successful operation using a non-copper CLOU oxygen carrier in combustion of solid fuel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this reported work, multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics studies of diesel combustion and soot formation processes in a constant volume combustion chamber and a marine diesel engine are carried out. The key interest here is firstly to validate the coupling of a newly developed skeletal n-heptane mechanism and a revised multi-step soot model using laser extinction measurements of diesel soot obtained at different ambient pressure levels in an optical accessible, constant volume chamber experiment. It is revealed that ignition delay times and liftoff lengths generated using the new skeletal model are close to those produced by the larger and more comprehensive chemical mechanisms, apart from those at the low pressure condition. The current study also demonstrates that the variation of averaged soot volume fraction with respect to the change of combustion chamber pressure captured using the revised soot model agrees reasonably well with the measurements in terms of peak values. The numerical model is subsequently applied to investigate the flame development, soot/nitrogen monoxide formation and heat transfer in a two-stroke, low-speed uniflow-scavenged marine diesel engine operating at full load condition, where optical measurements are not available. Comparisons to the experimental data show that the simulated pressure rise starts 1.0 crank angle degree in advance and the calculated peak pressure is 1.7% lower. The associated flame liftoff length is negligible, yielding higher local equivalence ratio and soot volume fraction values as compared to those under similar test condition in the constant volume chamber. With the use of the revised model, the total heat transfer to the walls calculated when soot radiative heat loss is taken into account is approximately 30% higher compared to that when only convective heat loss is considered. The averaged nitrogen monoxide concentration is 7.7% lower when both convective and soot radiative heat losses are accounted for but the net soot mass production is less sensitive to soot radiation. A sensitivity study reveals that neither increasing nor decreasing the soot absorption coefficient by 30% from the baseline setup is influential to nitrogen monoxide formation, soot mass production and heat transfer. The findings here aid to gain insights and provide a better understanding of the combustion and soot processes in large, uniflow-scavenged marine engines. The numerical model developed in this work can also be applied to explore different phenomena in this combustion system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An integrated gasification combined cycle process with sorbent CO2 capture (IGCC-SCC) using lime (CaO) was developed to assess the application of the gasification process to the power generation industry. Aspen Plus was used to simulate the detailed heat and material balance of the process. The process modeling results, including the composition, flow rate, temperature, pressure and enthalpy of different streams, were used to determine the sizes of the process units and related equipment.
A high-level economic model was prepared to evaluate the economic viability of an IGCC-SCC plant and to compare it to GE Energy and Shell Convective gasification plants for converting coal to power. The results show that the proposed process would produce 560 MW of power with a net plant efficiency of 46.4% compared to those of the GE Energy and Shell Convective plants, which are 39.2% and 42.0%, respectively. The total capital investment required for an IGCC-SCC facility having a coal capacity of 3000 tpd was estimated to be $1082 million, which translates to a specific annual capital expenditure (CAPEX) of 1889 $/kW. It was estimated that an IGCC-SCC plant could generate an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 14.4%, which is equivalent to a payback period of 9.1 years. This represents an improvement over the IRR and payback period of the GE Energy and Shell Convective plants at the same capacity.
A sensitivity analysis was also conducted in order to identify the relative importance of key economic variables driving the project returns and to quantify the impact of any changes to the assumptions used in the project economics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative methodology to perform market analysis of a new solar power generation technology based on parabolic dish and micro gas turbine engines. Technical, economic, social and political parameters of influence are combined together into a single figure of merit: index of market potential. This index is an original approach enabling the identification of the potential markets for this technology, tackling the inverse problem (from technology to market identification) in lieu of the usual direct problem (determining the interest of a technology in a predefined region).
The paper takes into account the availability of solar energy, population distribution, intensity of the electricity consumption, economic indicators, business environment and legal framework for a set of more than twenty countries. Risk assessment tools at various levels are also built into the numerical tool, which is not the case in similar works reviewed by the authors.
Finally, the methodology includes a probabilistic approach to handling uncertainty in the input data. The result of this confirms that the methodology is robust and is not very affected by changes in the initial assumptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The integration of different technologies acts as a leverage in boosting "circular economy" and improving resource use efficiency. In this respect, the coupling of anaerobic digestion with pyrolysis was the focus of this work. Solid-digestate obtained from anaerobic digestion was addressed to supply pyrolysis thus increasing the net energy gains and obtaining "biochar" (called "pyrochar" in our case) to be used as soil amendment alternatively to solid-digestate. The current interest on biochar is linked to its long-term soil carbon sequestration, thus contributing to global warming mitigation.
A parallel detailed screening of the physical and chemical properties of both solid-digestate and pyrochar was performed, inferring their effects on soil quality. Results showed that while P and K are enriched in pyrochar, total N showed no significant differences. Heavy metals revealed higher concentrations in pyrochar, but always largely below the biochar quality thresholds. Pyrochar exhibited a higher surface area (49-88 m(2) g(-1)), a greater water holding capacity (352-366%), and a more recalcitrant carbon structure. Both solid-digestate and pyrochar showed good soil amendments properties but with complementary effects. Although starting from the same biomass, being the original feedstock processed differently, their ability to improve the physical and chemical soil properties has proved to be different. While several other soil improvers of organic origin can substitute digestate, the important role played by biochar appears not-replaceable considering its precious "carbon negative" action.

Abstract: A switchable suspended particle device (SPD) evacuated (vacuum) glazing has low inherent heat loss and can control solar heat gain by changing its transparency. The thermal performance of combined SPD-vacuum glazing has been investigated using a test cell. In this work two different combination of SPD-vacuum glazing was evaluated. In the first combination, SPD glazing was facing the outside ambient environment and vacuum glazing was facing the indoor test cell environment (SPD-vacuum). In the second combination, SPD glazing was facing the indoor test cell environment and vacuum glazing was facing the outdoor ambient environment (Vacuum-SPD). Variation of the SPD glazing position in a combined SPD-vacuum glazing had little impact on either the internal test cell temperature or the glazing surface temperature. This combined glazing system achieved a dynamic transmission range from 2% (opaque state) to 38% (transparent state). Low overall heat transfer coefficients between 1.00 W/m(2) K to 1.16 W/m(2) K were found for this combined glazing. Dynamic solar heat gain coefficient was possible using this glazing, which varied from 0.045 to 0.27. This type of combined glazing system is suitable for summer and winter both conditions.

Abstract: Supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle has emerged as an alternative power block for Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) systems and nuclear plants. In order to optimise the thermal performance of the Supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles, a combination of high pressure and temperature are required. The high pressure of the S-CO2 Brayton cycles has a remarkable effect on not only the thermal performance of the cycle but also the thermodynamic and mechanical performance of the solar receiver. In this paper, three S-CO2 Brayton cycle configurations without reheat are proposed by introducing an ejector prior the heater, which reduces the pressure at the solar receiver.
A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis and a multi-objective optimisation were performed to study the thermodynamic feasibility of the proposed cycles. The effect of the cycle pressure ratios, turbine split ratio, turbine inlet temperature and exit pressure of the ejector on the thermal performance and output parameters of the S-CO2 Brayton cycles assisted by an ejector was analysed. The proposed configurations were compared with the conventional S-CO2 Brayton cycles without reheat and referenced steam Rankine cycles (projected thermal efficiencies of 0.416-0.47 in 2020-2025). The results showed that under some operating conditions, the proposed configurations assisted by an ejector can achieve higher efficiencies than the referenced steam Rankine cycles. As the ejector exit pressure increased, the thermal performance of the proposed configurations approached the conventional supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The proposed energy performance diagnosis is intended to identify poor energy performance in a building and pinpoint the causes to provide suggestions for building operators to implement timely repair and maintenance. Many previous studies have probed the complicated problem of building energy performance diagnosis to achieve energy conservation and better performance. However, few of them have been successful because most of these methods rely on a large amount of data from an Energy Management and Control System (EMCS), and these data are unreliable. A detailed description of the methodology based on energy consumption data is presented in this paper along with the development of a prototype integrated toolkit. Weekly, daily and hourly diagnoses are developed at the whole building level, system level and component level, respectively. To validate the feasibility and applicability of the method, a case study on an office building demonstrating the proposed method was completed and was able to detect underperformance operation and energy waste.

Abstract: Steel industry plays an important role economically in China. A great amount of hot waste liquids and gases are discharged into environment during many steelmaking processes. These waste liquids and gases have crucial energy saving potential, especially for steel slag cooling process. It could be possible to provide energy saving by employing a waste heat recovery system (WHRS). The optimum operation condition was assessed by integrating the first and the second law of thermodynamics for a water-water heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHE) for a slag cooling process in steel industry. The performance characteristics of a HPHE has been investigated experimentally by analyzing heat transfer rate, heat transfer coefficient, effectiveness, exergy efficiency and number of heat transfer units (NTU). A specially designed on-line cleaning device was used to clean the heat exchange tubes and enhance heat transfer. The results indicated that the exergy efficiency increased with the increment of waste water mass flow rate at constant fresh water mass flow rate, while the effectiveness decreased at the same operation condition. As the waste water mass flow rate varied from 0.83 m(3)/h to 1.87 m(3)/h, the effectiveness and exergy efficiency varied from 0.19 to 0.09 and from 34% to 41%, respectively. In the present work, the optimal flow rates of waste water and fresh water were 1.20 m(3)/h and 3.00 m(3)/h, respectively. The on-line cleaning device had an obvious effect on the heat transfer, by performing the device, heat transfer rate, heat transfer coefficient, effectiveness and exergy efficiency were improved by 6.11%, 9.49%, 7.19% and 7.93%, respectively.

Abstract: High purity hydrogen can be produced using sorption enhanced chemical looping reforming (SE-CLR) in which an oxygen carrier and an in situ CO2 sorbent are involved. In this study, the effectiveness of alumina modification with Mg as the support of Fe2O3 based oxygen carriers is investigated in CLR and SE-CLR processes for clean hydrogen production. The 22Fe(2)O(3)/Al2O3 and 22Fe(2)O(3)/MgAl2O4 oxygen carriers are synthesized with impregnation and sequential impregnation methods, respectively. Prior to SE-CLR process, the performance of three different calcium based sorbents including industrial CaO, synthesized CaO and cerium promoted CaO are investigated for CO2 sorption in calcium loop. The characterization of the oxygen carriers and sorbent samples is performed by XRD, BET, FESEM and TEM. It is found that the addition of cerium to the calcium-based sorbent effectively improves its structural properties and CO2 sorption performance. The obtained results reveal that the sorbent surface area is a significant parameter affecting its CO2 removal efficiency at high temperatures. In addition, the presence of Mg in oxygen carrier structure successfully prevents the formation of Fe-Al spinel by MgAl2O4 formation. An excessive H-2/CO molar ratio of 16.7 is also achieved using Fe2O3/MgAl2O4 oxygen carrier and synthesized Ce/Ca = 0.2 sorbent at 600 degrees C in SE-CLR process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing the operation of a building heating system under the hypothesis that the building is included as an active consumer in a demand response program. Demand response requests to the building operational system come from an external market player or a grid operator. Requests assume the form of price-volume signals specifying a maximum volume of energy to be consumed during a given time slot and a monetary reward assigned to the participant in case it fulfills the conditions. A receding horizon control approach is adopted for the minimization of the energy bill, by exploiting a simplified model of the building. Since the resulting optimization problem is a mixed integer linear program which turns out to be manageable only for buildings with very few zones, a heuristics is devised to make the algorithm applicable to realistic size problems as well. The derived control law is tested on the realistic simulator EnergyPlus to evaluate pros and cons of the proposed algorithm. The performance of the suboptimal control law is evaluated on small- and large-scale test cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Optimizing the design of fresh produce packaging is vital for ensuring that future food cold chains are more energy efficient and for improving produce quality by avoiding chilling injuries due to nonuniform cooling. Computational fluid dynamics models are thus increasingly used to study the airflow patterns and heat transfer inside ventilated packaging during precooling. This review discusses detailed and comprehensive mathematical modeling procedures for simulating the airflow, heat transfer, and mass transfer that occurs during forced-air precooling of fresh produce. These models serve to optimize packaging design and cooling efficiency. We summarize the most commonly used parameters for performance, which allows us to directly compare the cooling performance of various packaging designs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Vehicle to Grid technologies utilize idle EV battery power as a grid storage tool to meet fluctuating electric power demands. Vehicle to Grid systems are promising substitutes for traditional gas turbine generators, which are relatively inefficient and have high emissions impacts. The purpose of this study is to predict the future net revenue and life cycle emissions savings of Vehicle to Grid technologies for use in ancillary (regulation) services on a regional basis in the United States. In this paper, the emissions savings and net revenue calculations are conducted with respect to five different Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Organization regions, after which future EV market penetration rates are predicted using an Agent-Based Model designed to account for various uncertainties, including regulation service payments, regulation signal features, and battery degradation. Finally, the concept of Exploratory Modeling and Analysis is used to estimate the future net revenue and emissions savings of integrating Vehicle to Grid technology into the grid, considering the inherent uncertainties of the system. The results indicate that, for a single vehicle, the net revenue of Vehicle to Grid services is highest for the New York region, which is approximately $42,000 per vehicle on average. However, the PJM region has an approximately $97 million overall net revenue potential, given the 38,200 Vehicle to Grid-service available electric vehicles estimated to be on the road in the future in the PJM region, which is the highest among the studied regions.

Abstract: Free cooling by enhanced night-time ventilation could be an efficient technique for decreasing the energy demand for the cooling of buildings. Such systems use the ambient cold of surrounding air, which is transported into buildings by mechanical fan-driven ventilation systems. Only carefully designed and operated systems can be efficient enough to compete with other free-cooling techniques, such as evaporative cooling or even compressor-driven mechanical cooling systems. The efficiency of free cooling by enhanced night-time ventilation could be significantly improved if a model-based predictive weather control algorithm is used for operation control. The aim of this article is to present a generalized model-based predictive weather control (G-MPWC) algorithm that was developed with a detailed short time step numerical simulation of the thermal response of the building and free cooling system and simplified weather forecast data. The result of the G-MWPC is a set of control matrixes that includes data on the forecast required night-time air exchange rate and forecast daily coefficient of the performance of the free cooling system regarding the forecast daily average ambient air temperature and amplitude and the pre-set free cooling system on/off temperature difference. An additional matrix that includes data on forecast maximum indoor air temperature is developed for the case of the free cooling system being unable to fulfil pre-set thermal comfort requirements. A unique set of G-MWPS control matrixes must be developed for specific buildings and building operation conditions; afterwards, that control matrix can be used for the predicted controlling of the free cooling system by night time ventilation for the whole range of summer time meteorological conditions. In this article, the method and numerical model for developing a G-MPWC algorithm is presented as well as an example of a control matrix developed for a typical office room. The G-MPWC algorithm was validated for the case of a free-cooled office room. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper explores various questions regarding very high penetration of intermittent renewable to electricity grid. The study was performed using one-year hourly demand data of California's electricity grid together with the hourly-simulated output of various solar and wind technologies distributed throughout the state. The result shows that wind-solar complementarities carry significant multidimensional benefits to the future grid as compared to a stand-alone wind/solar based grid. Specifically at 20% total energy loss, it was shown that their optimal complementarities lead to very high renewable penetration with smaller storage and backup requirement. Our study of system dispatch shows that storage provides flexible dispatch strategy, which makes it applicable for various services depending on season of the year including reduction of summer backup capacity need. We have also found that the existing peak load based long term planning reserve criteria may no longer be applicable to very high renewable grid. Finally, comparing our result to literature data, we conclude that some of the pessimistic views of storage technology are borne out of our lack of understanding about its role and design requirement.

Abstract: Power system planning approach should meet the new requirements brought by continuous development of power systems. In recent years, wind power generation capacity keeps a rapid growth, but the problem of wind power curtailment becomes increasingly serious in some countries. The limitations of wind power integration produced by power systems, such as the inconsistency between installed generation capacity and transmission capacity and the insufficiency of regulation capacity, are drawing the attention in both academia and industry. This paper proposes a source-grid-load coordinated planning model for power systems with regulation capacity constraints being taken into account. In this novel model, traditional generation expansion planning and transmission expansion planning are integrated, and the peak-load regulation capacity and flexible regulation capability of power systems are considered. Meanwhile, the positive impacts of demand response are also taken into consideration. The numerical study verifies that the source-grid-load coordinated planning model can not only reduce the overall cost of the system, but also improve the wind power integration capacity and guarantee the sustainable development of wind power generation.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) is a promising, environmental friendly technique for its potential to reduce the using of fossil fuels. Massive EVs pose both opportunities and challenges for power systems, especially with the growing amount of wind-power integration. This paper investigates the problem of collaborative optimization scheduling of generators, EVs and wind power. A novel bi-layer optimization of transmission and distribution system is proposed to solve the scheduling problem of EVs charging and discharging load from respective time and space domain in the presence of wind-power. The upper layer optimization in transmission grid coordinates EVs with thermal generators, base load, with the consideration of wind power, to optimize load periods of EVs in the time domain. The lower layer optimization in distribution grid then spatially schedules the location of EVs load. Based on a power system benchmark with a 10-unit transmission grid and an IEEE 33-bus distribution grid, the performance of the proposed bi-layer optimization strategy is evaluated. The impacts of electricity price profile, EVs penetration and EVs load location are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed bi-layer optimization strategy can accommodate wind power and improve both the economics of grid operation and benefits of EV users by scheduling EVs charging and discharging temporally and spatially. Also, the results have shown that the location of EVs charging and discharging load is critical for the distribution network planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As an approach to replace pressure transducers, ion current sensing is a promising candidate for overcoming the difficult task of controlling the start of combustion in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines which require feedback from previous cycles. In this study, cyclic variations and prior-cycle effects of ion current signals are analyzed by comparing against pressure transducer signals using time-series methods in an HCCI engine. Additionally, the effects of various calibrated ion signal intensities are tested by adding cesium acetate (CsOAc) to the base fuel. Nonlinear characteristics of ion current signals are identified to cause strong cyclic variations through a single-zone model analysis with different equivalence ratios. By analyzing the time series, return maps, and coefficient of variations (CoV), the study finds that the stability of the ion signals can be largely improved by adding CsOAc due to the low ionization energy. After reconstructing a complex, nonlinear dynamical system model with symbol sequence statistics, the measured cycle-resolved data of the ion current signal is analyzed to determine the pattern structures within prior cycles of fixed length, which is optimized by a modified Shannon entropy calculation. The results suggest that long, consecutive symbols of the ion current signal can be reliably predicted through the application of designed deterministic patterns especially when a small amount of CsOAc is added, although the ion current signal is normally considered a localized information provider and affected by many dynamical factors. Consequently, ion current signals are very promising for model-based control systems in HCCI engines with tolerable amounts of signal enhancing additives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A major aim of Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms (CRMs) is to lead the power system expansion towards the level of security of supply that the regulator considers adequate. When introducing a capacity mechanism, therefore, regulators must ensure that the resulting mix will actually provide the firmness pursued, in such a way that both the generation and the demand resources awarded with the capacity remuneration actually perform as expected when the system needs them. In order to achieve this goal, some experts stressed the importance of including performance incentives in the CRM design. However, first capacity mechanisms (implemented mainly in the American continent) did not pay enough attention to this aspect. Two decades of operation have evidenced the need for performance incentives and these instruments are, at this writing, at the centre of the regulatory discussion.
On the basis of a model analysis, this article demonstrates how the introduction of properly designed explicit penalty schemes for under-delivery can positively impact the CRM outcomes, providing resources with effective incentives to maximise their reliability, discriminating against non-firm generation units, and therefore increasing the effectiveness of the mechanism in achieving its objectives.

Abstract: Buildings today represent 40% of world primary energy consumption and 24% of greenhouse gas emissions. In our society there is growing interest in knowing precisely when and how energy consumption occurs. This means that consumption measurement and verification plans are well-advanced. International agencies such as Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) and International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) have developed methodologies to quantify savings. This paper presents a methodology to accurately perform automated envelope calibration under option D (calibrated simulation) of IPMVP - vol. 1. This is frequently ignored because of its complexity, despite being more flexible and accurate in assessing the energy performance of a building. A detailed baseline energy model is used, and by means of a metaheuristic technique achieves a highly reliable and accurate Building Energy Simulation (BES) model suitable for detailed analysis of saving strategies. In order to find this BES model a Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is used, together with a highly efficient engine to stimulate the objective, thus permitting rapid achievement of the goal. The result is a BES model that broadly captures the heat dynamic behaviour of the building. The model amply fulfils the parameters demanded by ASHRAE and EVO under option D. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The redox properties and oxygen buffering capacity of reducible oxides, such as ceria, make them interesting support materials for oxygen carriers in Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC), an emerging clean combustion technology. However, the effectiveness of reducible oxides for redox applications depends crucially on oxygen mobility in the oxide lattice. In the present work, we demonstrate that addition of an aliovalent dopant (La) strongly enhances oxygen mobility in ceria, resulting in multiple performance benefits. A series of La-doped ceria (LaxCe1-xO2-x-2, 0 < x < 0.3) were investigated as supports for low-cost Fe-based oxygen carrier materials. Combining carrier synthesis and characterization with reactive tests, we demonstrate that La doping of ceria not only results in a drastic improvements in carrier reactivity and oxygen carrying capacity, but also strongly improved carrier stability during redox cycling. This is consistent with the creation of oxygen defects, which stabilize the supported Fe particles and facilitate oxygen transport in the ceria lattice. A balance between enhancement of oxygen mobility and lowered reducibility upon formation of a lanthana phase results in a strongly nonlinear dependence of carrier reactivity on the dopant concentration and gives rise to an optimum at low dopant concentrations. Overall, the results suggest that doping of reducible supports constitutes a highly attractive, effective, and low-cost way to strongly enhance the performance of oxygen carriers in chemical looping applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a generalized model for wind turbine (WT) anomaly identification based on the data collected from wind farm supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Neural networks (NNs) are used to establish prediction models of the WT condition parameters that are dependent on environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and wind speed. Input parameters of the prediction models are selected based on the domain knowledge. Three types of sample data, namely the WT's current SCADA data, the WT's historical SCADA data, and other similar WTs' current SCADA data, are used to train the condition parameter prediction models. Prediction accuracy of the models trained by these sample data is compared and discussed in the paper. Mean absolute error (MAE) index is used to select the prediction models trained by historical and other similar WTs' current SCADA data. Abnormal level index (ALI) is defined to quantify the abnormal level of prediction error of each selected model. To improve the accuracy of anomaly identification, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation method is used to integrate the identification results obtained from the different selected models. The proposed method has been used for real 1.5 MW WTs with doubly fed induction generators. The results show that the proposed method is more effective in WT anomaly identification than traditional methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Substantial virtual water concurrent electricity is transferred among six grids in China's electric power system. An in-depth understanding of this virtual water is essential considering the increasingly severe water deficiency in China. Using ecological network analysis (ENA), we investigate the virtual water network within China's electric power system (VWNCEPS) during 2007-2012, including (1) tracking the virtual water flows from the power generators to the power consumers and analyzing the tendency of the track results, (2) identifying the important grids that largely influence both the magnitude and diversity of the VWNCEPS, and (3) evaluating the overall performance of the VWNCEPS. Additionally, a new indicator is proposed that incorporates the concept of the water stress index (WSI) to measure the impact of the VWNCEPS on national water stress mitigation. The results show that during 2007-2012, the northern and central grids were always the most important input-oriented and output-oriented grids, respectively. Furthermore, the input-oriented impacts of the six grids are similar, while the output-oriented impacts exhibit substantial variations among the different grids. Regarding the overall performance, the VWNCEPS exhibits a high level of system efficiency, whereas its flexibility is relatively low. Moreover, the VWNCEPS has a rapidly increasing positive effect on national water stress mitigation in China during 2007-2012, and the virtual water connection between the central grid and the eastern grid is found to be the main contributor to this positive effect.

Abstract: Chemical looping steam methane reforming is a novel technology for syngas and hydrogen production. It's very important to find suitable oxygen carriers with good reactivity and high agglomeration resistance for this process. In the present work, the perovskite-type oxides LaFe1-xCoxO3 with x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 were used as oxygen carriers. The influence of Co doping on the characteristics and the stabilities of these perovskite-type oxides were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), Brunauer-E mmett-Teller (BET) surface area and fixed-bed experiments. All the as-prepared samples with various Co substitutions exhibited crystalline perovskite structure similar to LaFeO3. The surface adsorbed oxygen which is beneficial to the complete oxidation of CH4 increased as the Co substitution increase. From the point of view of the oxygen-donation ability, resistance to carbon formation, as well as hydrogen generation capacity, the optimal degree of Co substitution is x = 0.3. Despite slight sintering, the perovskite-type oxide LaFe0.7Co0.3O3. showed very good regenerability during the twenty redox reactions. In the methane reduction stage, syngas with H-2/CO molar ratio close to 2:1 was obtained in the twenty cycles with 85% of CH4 conversion, 43% of CO selectivity, and 50% of H-2 selectivity. While in the steam oxidation stage, a steadily hydrogen productivity at about 4 mmol/g oxygen carriers was generated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A solar radiation forecasting model can be utilized is a scientific contrivance for investigating future viability of solar energy potentials. In this paper, a wavelet-coupled support vector machine (W-SVM) model was adopted to forecast global incident solar radiation based on the sunshine hours (S-t), minimum temperature (T-max), maximum temperature (T-max), windspeed (U), evaporation (E) and precipitation (P) as the predictor variables. To ascertain conclusive results, the merit of the W-SVM was benchmarked with the classical SVM model. For daily forecasting, sixteen months of data (01-March-2014 to 30-June-2015) partitioned into the train (65%) and test (35%) set for the three metropolitan stations (Brisbane City, Cairns Aero and Townsville Aero) were utilized. Data were decomposed into their wavelet sub-series by discrete wavelet transformation algorithm and summed up to create new series with one approximation and four levels of detail using Daubechies-2 mother wavelet. For daily forecasting, six model scenarios were formulated where the number of input was increased and the forecast was assessed by statistical metrics (correlation coefficient r; Willmott's index d; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient E-Ns; peak deviation P-dv), distribution statistics and prediction errors (mean absolute error MAE; root mean square error RMSE; mean absolute percentage error MAPE; relative root mean square error RMSE). Results for daily forecasts showed that the W-SVM model outperformed the classical SVM model for optimum input combinations. A sensitivity analysis with single predictor variables yielded the best performance with S-t as an input, confirming that the largest contributions for forecasting solar energy is derived from the sunshine hours per day compared to the other prescribed inputs. All six inputs were required in the optimum W-SVM for Brisbane and Cairns stations to yield r = 0.928, d = 0.927, E-Ns = 0.858, P-dv = 1.757%, MAE = 1.819 MJ m(-2) and r = 0.881, d = 0.870, E-Ns = 0.762, P-dv = 9.633%, MAE = 2.086 MJ m(-2), respectively. However, for Townsville, the time-series of S-t, T-min, and T-max and E were required in the optimum model to yield r = 0.858, d = 0.886, E-Ns = 0.722, P-dv = 10.282% and MAE = 2.167 MJ m(-2). In terms of the relative model errors over daily forecast horizon, W-SVM model was the most accurate precise for Townsville (RRMSE = 12.568%; MAPE = 12.666%) followed by Brisbane (13.313%; 13.872%) and Cairns (14.467%; 15.675%) weather stations. A set of alternative models developed over the monthly, seasonal and annual forecast horizons verified the long-term forecasting skill, where lagged inputs of T-max, T-min, E, P and VP for Roma Post Office and Toowoomba Regional stations were employed. The wavelet-coupled model performed well, with r = 0.965, d = 0.964, P-dv = 2.249%, RRMSE = 5.942% and MAPE = 4.696% (Roma) and r = 0.958, d = 0.943, P-dv = 0.979%, RRMSE = 7.66% and MAPE = 6.20% (Toowoomba). Accordingly, the results conclusively ascertained the importance of wavelet-coupled SVM predictive model as a qualified stratagem for short and long-term forecasting of solar energy for assessment of solar energy prospectivity in this study region.

Abstract: Battery state of health (SOH) estimation is a crucial challenge for electric vehicles due to the complicated aging mechanism of a battery. In this paper, a new method for battery SOH estimation is proposed using the location interval between two inflection points or the transformation parameter of the differential voltage (DV) curve. And a new algorithm to obtain the DV curve according to the center least squares method is presented. Four LiFePO4 battery cells in different aging states are tested to validate the proposed method. Results show that the linear regression of the location interval between two inflection points versus the battery capacity from one single battery cell is able to evaluate the SOH of other three battery cells within 2% error bound. Transforming the measured DV curve to be congruent with the initial DV curve provided by the manufacturer, battery cell SOH can be estimated according to the transformation parameter with the error being within 2.5%. Furthermore, a battery pack SOH monitoring framework is inferred from the inflection point location and the transformation parameter of the DV curve to realize battery pack SOH estimation.

Abstract: The employment of parabolic trough solar power plants (PT-CSP) for electrical power and process heat generation is one of the most promising technologies for carbon free energy production. The selection of thermal fluids, both for the heat transfer (heat transfer fluid, HTF) and the storage (heat storage material, HSM), is a crucial point for increasing CSP efficiency and cost effectiveness. In this paper two different PT-CSP configurations, both presenting a double tanks storage system, are compared.
In particular, two different medium size (50 MWe) plant schemes, presenting two different working fluids as HTF, are described and analysed. In the first scheme a "binary" molten salt mixture, composed of sodium and potassium nitrate, is considered, while, in the second one, the employment, as HTF, of a "ternary" mixture, consisting of sodium potassium and lithium nitrates, is investigated. In both cases, the binary mixture is used for thermal storage (HSM).
The first scheme represents the configuration developed by ENEA and already used for the Archimede plant in Priolo Gargallo (Sicily-Italy). The second one is an innovative proposal, which aims to improve CSP plants performances and to reduce operating, costs. In particular, since the ternary mixture has a considerably lower freezing temperature than the binary one, this solution allows to keep the system at a lower temperature overnight, so reducing thermal energy losses.
In first instance, it is necessary to characterize the binary and ternary mixtures respect to their thermo-physical features.
The two CSP configurations are then sized and, by a techno/economic evaluation, compared with respect to the calculated unit cost of electricity production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Cooling Load based Control (CLC) for the chiller sequencing is a commonly used control strategy for multiple-chiller plants. To improve the energy efficiency of these chiller plants, researchers proposed various CLC optimization approaches, which can be divided into two groups: studies to optimize the load distribution and studies to identify the optimal number of operating chillers. However, both groups have their own deficiencies and do not consider the impact of each other. This paper aims to improve the CLC by proposing three new approaches. The first optimizes the load distribution by adjusting the critical points for the chiller staging, which is easier to be implemented than existing approaches. In addition, by considering the impact of the load distribution on the cooling tower energy consumption and the pump energy consumption, this approach can achieve a better energy saving. The second optimizes the number of operating chillers by modulating the critical points and the condenser water set point in order to achieve the minimal energy consumption of the entire chiller plant that may not be guaranteed by existing approaches. The third combines the first two approaches to provide a holistic solution. The proposed three approaches were evaluated via a case study. The results show that the total energy consumption saving for the studied chiller plant is 0.5%, 5.3% and 5.6% by the three approaches, respectively. An energy saving of 4.9-11.8% can be achieved for the chillers at the cost of more energy consumption by the cooling towers (increases of 5.8-43.8%). The pumps' energy saving varies from 8.6% to 2.0%, depending on the approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Characteristics of a high concentration photovoltaic/thermal (HCPV/T) module equipped with point-focus Fresnel lens have been investigated in this paper. Both electrical and thermal models of the module are developed by numerical methods. The electrical model is based on the Shockley diode equation, and the thermal model is grounded on a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer model. Influences of environmental parameters and coolant water are considered in the models. The inputs of the models consist of irradiance, ambient temperature, wind speed, water temperature and mass flow rate. The outputs mainly include electrical efficiency and thermal efficiency. The simulated results are compared with experimental results and a great agreement is obtained. By the virtue of the validated models, influences of different parameters on module performance are analyzed in detail. The results show that an electrical efficiency of 28% and a thermal efficiency of 60% can be obtained by the HCPV/T module. The electrical efficiency is mainly influenced by solar irradiation rather than cell temperature. The thermal efficiency increases with the increment of irradiance, ambient temperature and water mass flow rate. On the contrary, increasing water temperature and wind speed will lower the thermal efficiency. Also, the HCPV/T module can produce hot water as high as 70 degrees C without decreasing the electrical efficiency seriously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is the first time that pulsed high voltage spark discharge in ethanol solution has been used for hydrogen production in the existing documents. A needle-plate reactor for on-board hydrogen production was also designed, which is small-scale and portable for automobiles. By optimizing the reaction conditions, the flow rate of hydrogen can reach 422 mL/min at peak voltage = 30 kV, discharge frequency = 30 Hz, electrode distance = 15 mm, initial ethanol concentration = 50%. It was also found that energy consumption of this method is about 1.69 kW h/m(3), which is better than most existing methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The hydrodynamic performance of a fixed Oscillating Water Column (OWC) wave energy device under various wave conditions and geometric parameters was tested experimentally in a wave flume. The measured water surface elevation at the chamber center, the air pressure in the chamber of the OWC device and the hydrodynamic efficiency are compared well with the published numerical model results in Ning et al. (2015). Then the effects of various parameters including incident wave amplitude, the chamber width, the front wall draught, the orifice scale and the bottom slope on the hydrodynamic efficiency of the OWC device were investigated. It is found that the opening ratio epsilon (epsilon = S-0/S, where S-0 and S are the cross-sectional areas of the orifice and the air chamber, respectively) has a significant influence on the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency of the OWC device. The optimal efficiency occurs at the opening ratio of epsilon = 0.66%. Although bottom slope has little influence on the resonant frequency, the optimal hydrodynamic efficiency increases with the increase of bottom slope. A proper bottom slope can provide a work space in the OWC chamber almost independent on the sea wave conditions. The spatial variation of the water surface inside and outside the chamber was also examined. And the results indicate that the water motion is highly dependent on the relative wave length lambda/B (where A is the wave length and B is the chamber width). Seiching phenomenon is triggered when lambda/B = 2 at which the hydrodynamic efficiency is close to zero. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Latent heat storage allows efficient energy storage in systems with isothermal processes. The low thermal conductivity of cost-effective storage materials is the main challenge in the development of latent heat storage systems. Most of these systems developed so far use extended heat transfer surfaces to ensure sufficient heat transfer rates. The PCMflux concept described in this paper is based on the transport of the storage material across the heat transfer surface. The aim of this approach is to avoid the blockage of the heat transfer surfaces by solidified storage material. The paper gives an overview of the current development of the PCMflux concept including the theoretical analysis and the experimental proof-of-concept. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The feasibility of polyethylenimine (PEI)-impregnated millimeter-sized mesoporous carbon spheres (MCSs) for post-combustion CO2 capture is systematically studied over a wide range of adsorption and regeneration conditions. MCSs with developed mesoporous structure and good electrical conductivity are used as supports, while high-molecular-weight PEI (M-n similar to 10,000) is screened to be the optimal amine due to its thermal stability. At the optimal polyethylene glycol (PEG) loading of 20 wt.%, the mass/volume-based adsorption capacity is efficiently improved by 25.7% and 109.5%, respectively. The optimized adsorbent exhibits high equilibrium adsorption capacity of 163.4 mg/g for 15% CO2 at 75 degrees C under dry condition, and it could be further enhanced to 187.5 mg/g at the relative humidity of 60%. The presence of O-2, SO2, NO and NO2 would lead to the decreased adsorption capacity after consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles, due to the irreversible chemical reaction. Moisture could inhibit the negative effect of O-2 but deteriorate the detrimental effects of SO2, NO and NO2. Depending on the good sphericity, uniform particle size, excellent thermal electrical conductivity and good mechanical properties of MCS, PEI-impregnated MCS adsorbents could be directly used in fixed bed system and be applicable for thermal swing adsorption (TSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) and novel electric swing adsorption (ESA) processes. The adsorbents could maintain fairly stable cyclic performance during the rapid VSA process, making rapid VSA of great potential for technical-economical post-combustion CO2 capture.

Abstract: Exergy analysis proved to be important in understanding of regions with poor energy efficiency and improve the design of distillation processes. In this study a new method based on exergy analysis is developed for the synthesis of a light ends recovery unit. The algorithm is some kinds of evolutionary one which employ total exergy loss diagrams of distillation columns for limiting the search space and reducing configuration nominees. The new method presented here for the light end separation unit, applies exergy loss diagrams as a powerful tool in locating the weak spot in the distillation columns of the Brugma sequence (as a first guess) and change the structure of the sequence step by step to achieve the best sequence. The results show that the new method could reduce the amount of calculations between 16% and 55% of the cases considered in this case study. The reduction of the search space takes place without decreasing the comprehensiveness and precision of the synthesis algorithm. Besides the amount of reduction in total annual cost and exergy loss of the optimum sequence is considerable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The ability to regenerate energy when braking is a valuable advantage of hybrid and fully electric vehicles. The regeneration potential mainly depends on how a car is driven and on the capacity of the drivetrain. Detailed studies of the regeneration potential based on brake energy in real-world driving are needed to better understand the potential gains of car-electrification, since test cycles do not take individual driving characteristics or route elevation into account. This study uses a model of a normalized vehicle and a highly detailed and representative data set of individual car movements including elevation to analyze the potential for energy regeneration in cars when driven under current real-world Swedish conditions.
The ultimate energy regeneration potential (defined as the braking energy at the wheels) varies by about a factor of six among individual movement patterns, with an average of 0.033 kW h/km, corresponding to 27% of the total average energy supplied at the wheels. Earlier studies have shown a higher energy regeneration potential per km for cars driving under urban conditions with low average velocity and many starts and stops. Our results confirm this but also point out that a low average velocity and a high share of city driving are not very well correlated with the yearly energy savings; for this the yearly mileage is a more important indicator. This suggests that drivers who rack up the miles should be targeted as potential early adopters of regenerative technologies rather than city drivers per se. The results from real-world driving are compared to the NEDC and WLTP test cycles. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The paper presents an experimental research on NOx emissions during co-firing of coal with woody biomass and natural gas. The aim of the research was investigation of synergetic influence of advanced and simultaneously applied different primary reduction measures on NOx emissions in a multifuel combustion system. During the tests run on a 20 kW PC lab-scale furnace equipped with a swirl burner and over fire air system (OFAS), the process conditions such as fuel composition, combustion temperature, overall air amount and air distribution (air staging and OFA) and fuel distribution (reburning) have been varied. Three single low rank brown coals from Middle Bosnia coal basin and their blends have been used in combination with sawdust and natural gas. Woody biomass fraction was varied between 5 and 20%w in the fuel blend, while the fraction of natural gas used for reburning was varied between 5 and 10% th. Various process temperatures were applied to investigate their influence on the NOx emissions. Besides multiple air staging, effects of the fuel staging in respect to the NOx emissions have been investigated, first by staging the basic fuels, that is coal and woody biomass, and then by natural gas reburning.
In a multi-fuel case investigated, it has been demonstrated that over 50% of NOx reduction could be achieved at 0.1 cofiring at the same process temperature, and 67% if the process temperature is reduced. It has been shown that the coal blends at process temperatures above 1400 degrees C, with no fuel staging and OFA switched off, yield highest NOx emissions (above 1100 mg/m(n)(3) at 6% O-2 dry). On the other side, NOx emissions reduced significantly with the increase of the staging air portion and also with an increase in the distance between the burner and OFA nozzle. Furthermore, if the reburning is performed by natural gas with OFA switched on, NOx emissions reduce below 500 mg/m(n)(3) at 6% O-2 dry. If the temperature is reduced below 1100 degrees C, NOx emissions decreased to 400 mg/m(n)(3) at 6% O-2 dry. The results confirmed that the design and operation of multi-fuel system using coal, biomass and gas could be optimized, such benefiting further reduction of NOx emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Microbial photoelectrochemical cells (MPEC) is a state-of-the-art and self-sustained 'waste-to-energy' solution through coupling a synergistic microbial conversion of waste organics into electron and proton in a bioanode and photoelectrochemical catalysis of proton reduction for hydrogen evolution in a photocathode. With the advantage of visible light adsorption, p-type semiconductor Cu2O has exhibited superior photocatalytic potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but the instability of p-type Cu2O hinders its further practical application. Here, we fabricated a Cu2O/NiOx composite photocathode by spin coating a thin film of NiOx on Cu2O photocathode to improve its stability and photocurrent. Results showed that NiOx layer on Cu2O had a trade-off effect on photocathode performance. The thicker of NiOx film on Cu2O, the lower of the photocurrent, but more stable of the Cu2O electrode. With an optimal 240 nm thickness of NiOx layer, the Cu2O/NiOx composite photocathode extracted excited electrons effectively, and a H-2 production rate of 5.09 mu L h(-1) cm(-2) was obtained from a MPEC under continuous light illumination with 0.2 V external bias. By tuning the synergistic effect of bioanode and photocathode, MPEC could provide a feasible solution on simultaneously organic conversion and energy restoration from wastewater and solar light.

Abstract: This study attempt to add to the existing literature probing empirically the relationship between urbanization and carbon emission for the BRICS countries within the period 1985-2014.
In our present study, the panel unit root, cointegration, and causality tests allowing for cross-sectional dependence, nonstationarity, and heterogeneity are conducted to enhance the understanding of the causal effect of urbanization on carbon emission. Using heterogeneous panel cointegration test, long-run equilibrium cointegration relationship has been found to exist between urbanization and carbon emission. Moreover, empirical results clearly indicate that in the long term, urbanization Granger causes carbon emission. These findings contribute to advancing the emerging literature as well as deserve special attention from policy maker and urban planner in the BRICS countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Natural gas hydrates dissociate via an endothermic process. One of the key requirements for any production technique is to supply the heat necessary for this dissociation. In this study, first, a microwave stimulation model for the production of gas from methane hydrate sediment is developed, which includes mass transport, energy conversion and conservation, and intrinsic kinetic reactions as the governing equations. In addition, the theoretical mixing rule of Lichtenecker and Rother is introduced for calculating the average dielectric data of the sediment containing methane hydrates, which affects the penetration of microwaves into the sediment. Next, simulations are performed for investigating gas production, as well as effects of initial water saturation, initial hydrate saturation, and sediment thermal properties induced by microwave stimulation. Moreover, the energy efficiency ratio is employed in the simulation. The simulation results show that microwave stimulation provides timely energy conversion sufficient for promoting the dissociation of hydrates, with rapid, continuous gas production. Temperature gradients caused by the decrease of the microwave penetration depth appear in the reservoir, leading to a rapid dissociation rate in the upper part of the sediment. The energy efficiency ratio for all simulations ranges between 3.752 and 6.452. Hydrate saturation and the specific heat capacity of porous media are two factors that significantly affect energy efficiency. High hydrate saturation contributes to a rapid gas generation rate and a long rapid gas generation lasting time, leading to a high energy efficiency. A low specific heat capacity of porous media can decrease the loss of heat to the sediment, increase the gas generation rate, and improve energy efficiency. Furthermore, high initial water saturation can cause a rapid decrease in the microwave penetration depth and lead to large temperature gradients in the sediment. The thermal conductivity of porous media mainly affects gas generation in the latter period of hydrate dissociation. Macroscopic heat conduction in the sediment decreases the temperature gradients in the reservoir and promotes homogeneous hydrate dissociation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of charging battery electric vehicles at workplace in Netherlands using solar energy. Data from the Dutch Meteorological Institute is used to determine the optimal orientation of PV panels for maximum energy yield in the Netherlands. The seasonal and diurnal variation in solar insolation is analyzed to determine the energy availability for EV charging and the necessity for grid connection. Due to relatively low solar insolation in Netherlands, it has been determined that the power rating of the PV array can be oversized by 30% with respect to power rating of the converter. Various dynamic EV charging profiles are compared with an aim to minimize the grid dependency and to maximize the usage of solar power to directly charge the EV. Two scenarios are considered - one where the EVs have to be charged only on weekdays and the second case where EV have to be charged all 7 days/week. A priority mechanism is proposed to facilitate the charging of multiple EV from a single EV-PV charger. The feasibility of integrating a local storage to the EV-PV charger to make it grid independent is evaluated. The optimal storage size that reduces the grid dependency by 25% is evaluated.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hydrogen production process by Methane Cracking thermally coupled with Chemical Looping Combustion (MC-CLC) which provides an advantage of inherent capture of CO2. The energy utilisation performance of the MC-CLC process is compared with that of conventional Methane Cracking with combusting CH4 (MC-CH4) and Methane Cracking with combusting H-2 (MC-H-2) using exergy analysis, with focus on exergy flows, destruction and efficiency. The three MC processes are simulated using Aspen Plus software with detailed heat integration. In these processes, the majority of the exergy destruction occurs in the combustors or CLC mostly due to the high irreversibility of combustion. The CO2 capture unit has the lowest exergy efficiency in the MC-CH4 process, leading to a lower overall exergy efficiency of the process. The combustor in the MC-H-2 process has a much higher energy efficiency than that in the MC-CH4 process or the CLC in the MC-CLC process. Although the use of H-2 as fuel decreases the H-2 production rate, the MC-H-2 process provides the advantage of an absence of CO2 generation, and stores more chemical exergy in the solid carbon which can be utilised appropriately. The MC-CLC process obtains the highest exergy efficiency among the three models and this is primarily due to the absence of a CO2 capture penalty and the CLC's higher fuel utilization efficiency than the conventional combustion process.

Abstract: Increasing costs of electricity supply from the local grid, the decreasing photovoltaic (PV) technology costs and the decreasing PV feed-in-tariff according to the current German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) will in the future raise the monetary incentives to increase the self-consumption of PV energy. This is of great interest in commercial buildings as there mostly is sufficient place to install high capacities of photovoltaic panels on their own roofs. Furthermore, the electricity purchase price from the local grid for commercial consumers nowadays is about 20 (sic)ct/kW h, which is higher than the cost of generation of electricity from solar panels (about 8-12 (sic)ct/kW h). Additionally, the load profiles in commercial applications have a high correlation with the generated solar energy. Hence, there is a great opportunity for economic savings.
This paper presents optimization results with respect to self-consumption and degree of self-sufficiency for a supermarket in Aachen, Germany. The optimization is achieved using real measurement data of load profile and solar radiation. Besides, techno-economic analyses and sensitivity analyses have been carried out to demonstrate the influence of different PV system sizes, PV system costs and interest rates. Moreover, to raise self-consumption different battery sizes with different battery system costs have been investigated and analysed for 2015 and 2025 scenarios as well.
The results show that the installation of a PV system can reduce the electricity costs through self consumption of self-generated PV energy. Also, applying battery energy storages in combination with PV systems can reduce the electricity costs even more, assuming that the battery costs can be reduced down to 200 (sic)/kW h in the future.

Abstract: The thermal energy required for regeneration of CO2-rich adsorbents or absorbents is usually regarded as the most important criterion to evaluate different materials and processes for application in commercial scale CO2 capture systems. It is expected that the regeneration heat can be greatly reduced by replacing the mature aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) technology with amine-based solid adsorbents capturing systems, due to the much lower heat capacity of solid adsorbents comparing to aqueous MEA and the avoidance of evaporating a large amount of water in the regenerator. Comparing to the MEA technology, the regeneration heat for solid adsorbent based systems has not received adequate attention especially on the impacts of process related parameters. Further, the methodologies used in previous investigations to calculate the regeneration heat may have deficiencies in defining the working capacities, adopting proper heat recovery strategies and/or evaluating the effect of moisture co-adsorption. In this study, an energy equation to calculate the regeneration heat has been revised and proposed to systematically evaluate the most important parameters affecting the regeneration heat, including the physical properties of the adsorbents and process related variables including the heat of adsorption, specific heat capacity, working capacity, moisture adsorption of the polyethyleneimine (PEI)/silica adsorbent, the swing temperature difference and the degree of heat recovery. Based on the parametric analysis, the calculated regeneration heat for the PEI/silica adsorbent based system is found to be around 2.46 GJ/tCO(2), which is much lower than the value of 3.9 GJ/CO2 for a typical aqueous MEA system and is also lower than 3.3 GJ/tCO(2) for an advanced MEA system. Sensitivity analysis of all the parameters has also been conducted and the results have shown that working capacity, moisture adsorption and heat recovery ratios are the most influential factors. With more proficiency and development in the energy efficient process designs, the advantages of a solid adsorbent based capturing system over typical MEA systems will be justified.

Abstract: The impact of oxygen ion transport at the electrolyte-electrode interface of a micro-solid oxide fuel cell using different fuels is investigated. Model validation is performed to verify the results versus the reported values. Furthermore, as the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio decreases, the diffusivity of the oxygen ion increases. This increase in diffusivity is observed because the number of hydrogen atoms available as the reacting species increases in fuels with lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios. The oxygen ion conductivity and output power density decrease as the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the fuels decreases. The reason behind this impact is the formation of a gas-induced ion barrier at the electrode-electrolyte interface by the CO2 molecules formed during the reaction at the interface, thus blocking the flow of oxygen ions. As the oxygen ions become blocked, the output current contribution from the reaction also decreases and thereby affects the overall performance of the micro-solid oxide fuel cell. The experimental verification confirms this because of a significant decrease in the output power density. Furthermore, as per the application in portable devices, the appropriate choice of fuel can be chosen so that the micro-solid oxide fuel cell operates at the maximum power density.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient decomposition-based optimization method to optimize the hourly combined heat and power (CHP) production and power transmission between multiple areas. The combined production and power transmission problem is decomposed into local CHP production models and into a power transmission model. The CHP production models are formulated as linear programming (LP) models and solved using a parametric analysis technique to determine the local production cost as a function of power transmitted into or out from each area. To obtain the overall optimum, the power transmission problem is then formulated in terms of the parametric curves as a network flow problem, and solved using a special network Simplex algorithm. The decomposition method has been tested with different sized artificial problems. The method can be used in situations where it is necessary to solve a large number of hourly production and transmission problems efficiently. As an example, the method can be used as part of long-term planning and simulation of CHP systems in different cities or countries connected by a common power market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Facing serious energy constraints and environmental challenges, policy makers in China have set up clear targets to reduce energy intensity in order to secure a sustainable economic growth; however, it is unclear in theory what the determining forces are. The empirical evidence, although intensively discussed in the literature, also remain divided in opinion. This paper contributes to the existing literature full of heated debates using a Bayesian averaging approach to identify robust determinants of energy intensity in China. Using provincial level data, key contributors that help explain the level of energy intensity across China are found. By ranking the relative importance of explanatory variables according to their posterior inclusion probabilities, this study can also offer support to policy makers in designing intensity reduction policies. It is suggested that policies should focus on those robust and relatively more important factors such as fiscal expenditure, infrastructure and economic structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Pareto-efficient 12-h variable double auction bilateral power transactions have been considered here. Effect of such on the economic welfare is observed while solving the reactive power dispatch (RPD) by differential evolution with random localization technique. This has been accomplished by a combination of static and dynamic var compensators like capacitor and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) considering the IEEE 57-bus network. Out of these 12-h variable power transactions, the Pareto efficient transactions which were reconciled by planed biding, have provided the maximum global welfare. The economics were ascertained by cumulating the net benefits of the market players and the reduced merchandising surplus caused by the var compensators. The combined capacitor-SMES based Pareto efficient observations on economic RPD were able to reduce 7.41% more power loss and 2.5 times improved economic benefit over the singular capacitor placement. This further achieved 0.069% profit enhancement in connection to the fundamental global welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The performance of a thermoelectric power generation (TEPG) module and a device designed to convert engine exhaust heat directly into electricity was studied under different operating conditions using a proposed thermoelectric (TE) model in this work. The proposed model was obtained from the first law of thermodynamics, Ohm's law, nonlinear analytical solution of thermoelectric transport equation, and a control volume that represents a typical TEPG module or device such that the temperature dependent material properties of, the spatial-dependent heat flow rate through the TE element, and the interfacial electrical and thermal losses can be taken into account in the performance calculation. The performance of a typical TEPG module under a broad range of cold-side temperatures and the temperature differences between its hot-side and cold-side was calculated by the proposed model and the results agree very well with the existing model predictions. Comparison between the model predictions and the experimental results confirmed that reducing the interfacial electric resistance can enhance the module performance. The inter-dependence of the key thermal and TEPG system design and optimization parameters was examined for a real TEPG device using the proposed model and an optimal module fill factor of 0.35 was found within the given mass flow rates between 0.0154 and 0.052 kg/s of exhaust stream.

Abstract: We present a detailed optimal control model that captures spatiotemporal interactions between gas and electric transmission networks. We use the model to study flexibility and economic opportunities provided by coordination. A large-scale case study in the Illinois system reveals that coordination can enable the delivery of significantly larger amounts of natural gas to the power grid. In particular, under a coordinated setting, gas-fired generators act as distributed demand response resources that can be controlled by the gas pipeline operator. This enables more efficient control of pressures and flows in space and time and overcomes delivery bottlenecks. We demonstrate that the additional flexibility not only can benefit the gas operator but can also lead to more efficient power grid operations and results in increased revenue for gas-fired power plants. We also use the optimal control model to analyze computational issues arising in these complex models. We demonstrate that the interconnected Illinois system with full physical resolution gives rise to a highly nonlinear optimal control problem with 4400 differential and algebraic equations and 1040 controls that can be solved with a state-of-the-art sparse optimization solver.

Abstract: Microalgae play an important role in energy production to solve the major energy crisis. The present study demonstrates an efficient and environmental friendly route for bio-oil extraction from wet Nannochloropsis oculata algal biomass through photocatalysis. The method uses abundant solar energy and catalytic amount of titanium dioxide photocatalyst for the rupturing of wet algal cells and reduces most of the cost by avoiding dewatering and drying, for algal oil production. The various spectroscopy and microscopy techniques used show destruction of algal cell membrane by the photocatalyst, with a release of 52.2% lipid yield. The obtained lipid by photocatalysis on esterification yields biofuel which is in complete agreement with results obtained from conventional techniques. Algal oil is converted to biofuel through acid catalyzed transesterification. Bio-oil and biofuel samples were analyzed by ATR-IR, NMR and GCMS. The physicochemical characterization of photocatalyst was carried out by UV-Visible spectroscopy, XRD, EDS, BET and electron microscopy studies. The results suggest that the nanoparticles are efficient catalysts for rupturing the rigid micro algal cell membrane in an aqueous environment, using sunlight and hence prove to be a potential economic method for large scale bio-oil extraction.

Abstract: High percentage (up to 70% energy based) biomass co-gasification tests have been carried out at the 253 MWe coal based Willem-Alexander Centrale (WAC), Buggenum in The Netherlands utilizing steam exploded wood pellets to assess feasibility of scaling up and to address stringent EU emission requirements in the coming decades. This principal article for demonstrating high percentage biomass co-gasification in large scale IGCC power plants, presents the obtained experimental results with a detailed and validated steady state thermodynamic model developed as an aid to assess future plant operations. The validated model is also used to predict plant performance involving 70% co-gasification with two fuel blends of torrefied wood pellets since the desired power output of 230 MWe could not be achieved with steam exploded wood pellets. The model predicts plant performance and process parameters with reasonable accuracy and gives a net power output of 173 MW and a net plant efficiency of about 37.2% with steam exploded wood pellets. A net output of 240 MWe and net plant efficiency of 41.7% is predicted for 70% co-gasification with high lower heating value (LHV) torrefied wood pellets. Exergy analysis indicates largest thermodynamic losses in the gasifier and during combustion, providing additional scope for efficiency enhancement. The demonstration of such a high percentage biomass co-gasification test at a large scale power plant is of vital importance for further development of low emission/carbon neutral power plants. The presented test data also serves as a reliable and prime data source for modeling studies. The validated models could serve as a strong platform to plan real plant operation with various biofuels and carry out studies involving novel technology integration, retrofitting and plant optimization.

Abstract: A novel magnesia-stabilized carbide slag (MSCS) was synthesized with carbide slag, magnesium nitrate hydrate and by-product of biodiesel by combustion, which was used as a CO2 sorbent during the calcium looping process. The effects of preparation condition (combustion temperature, combustion duration, by-product of biodiesel addition and magnesia addition) and CO2 capture condition (carbonation and calcination atmosphere) on CO2 capture capacity of MSCS were investigated during the calcium looping cycles. The main compositions of MSCS are CaO and MgO. The addition of by-product of biodiesel in the preparation of the sorbent leads to the uniform mix of MgO and CaO grains in MSCS, which shows an obviously positive effect on its CO2 capture capacity. Only on the condition of the addition of by-product of biodiesel, MgO derived from magnesium nitrate hydrate improves the cyclic CO2 capture capacity and durability of MSCS during the multiple cycles. MSCS with a mass ratio of CaO to MgO of 80:20 combusted at 850 degrees C for 60 min exhibits higher CO2 capture capacity and greater durability. The CO2 capture capacity of MSCS can retain 0.42 gig after 20 cycles, which is 60% higher than that of carbide slag. MSCS calcined under the high concentration of steam displays much higher CO2 capture capacity and better sintering resistance during the cycles, compared to MSCS calcined under the high concentration of CO2. The addition of steam in the carbonation enhances CO2 capture capacities of MSCS and carbide slag. MSCS consists of CaO-MgO grain groups and the support of MgO sustains the high sintering resistance of the sorbent. MSCS remains much larger surface area and pore volume than carbide slag during the cycles, compared to carbide slag. MSCS appears promising as an effective and low-cost CO2 sorbent during the calcium looping. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The effectiveness of the electro-thermal and depressurisation based techniques applied to three marine gas hydrate reservoir settings of India is modeled and simulated using MATLAB and TOUGH + HYDRATE reservoir modeling software. The results indicate that the depressurisation technique (with an achievable Delta P of >90 bar) will be effective in dissociating gas hydrates up to 145 m from a well bore in the Krishna Godavari (KG) reservoir. The technique when applied to the Andaman and Mahanadi reservoirs is found to produce a maximum Delta P of 64 and 70 bar against the minimum required threshold of 134 and 152 bar, and hence, found to be less effective for hydrate dissociation. The in-situ electro-thermal technique will be effective in the KG and Andaman reservoirs; and in the Mahanadi reservoir, if the gas hydrate saturations are >17%. The depressurization technique when applied to a hypothetical sandy reservoir in the KG basin shows that the spatial pressure drop is nearly double that in a clayey setting, which is conducive for hydrate dissociation.

Abstract: Distribution-sited solar photovoltaics (PV) economics (including rooftop PV) have improved significantly during the past several years, spurring increased installations, with over 2.2 GW installed in 2014 in the United States. This increased deployment is largely projected to continue and has prompted additional interest in the interactions of rooftop PV deployment with the greater electricity system. In this paper we focus on one piece of this interface, namely the interaction between rooftop PV deployment and the evolution of the bulk power system. We develop a novel linkage between NREL's bulk power capacity expansion model (the Renewable Energy Deployment System [ReEDS] model) and NREL's rooftop PV adoption model (the dSolar model). We use these linked models to gain insights into the interactions of rooftop PV deployment with the bulk power system. We explore two sets of scenarios. In the first set we examine how different levels of rooftop PV deployment impact the generation mix on the bulk power system. In the second set we examine how the generation mix of the bulk power system impacts the deployment of rooftop PV by applying grid-wide curtailment rates to rooftop PV systems. In these sets of scenarios, we find that rooftop PV generation and utility PV generation have a nearly 1:1 substitution effect. We also find that curtailment rate feedback can have dramatic impacts on rooftop PV adoption, though the range of impacts is strongly dependent on the generation mix of the bulk power system and the amount of total PV generation in the system. For example, scenarios with more natural gas generation tended to have lower curtailment rates and thus more rooftop PV deployment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We present a thorough characterization of the thermal properties and thermal reliability of the eutectic mixture of decanoic acid with tetradecanoic acid, as a phase change material (PCM) of potential interest for passive temperature control in buildings. From the temperature-composition binary phase diagram we found that the eutectic composition is 0.82 +/- 0.02 mole fraction (78 +/- 2 mass%) decanoic acid. We thoroughly characterized the thermal properties of the eutectic mixture. The eutectic composition has a high latent heat of fusion Delta H-fus = 153 +/- 15 J g(-1) and a melting temperature T-onset = 20.5 +/- 1.5 degrees C. The heat capacity measured as a function of temperature for the solid and liquid phases just below and above the melting point is 1.9 and 2.1 +/- 0.2 J K-1 g(-1), respectively. The average value of the thermal conductivity of the solid phase measured between -33 and 9 degrees C is kappa(s) = 0.20 +/- 0.02 W m(-1) K-1 and for the liquid phase, the thermal conductivity is kappa(l) = 0.23 +/- 0.03 W m(-1) K-1 for 28 and 38 degrees C. The mixture has a good long-term thermal stability as indicated by negligible changes in Delta H-fus and T-onset after 3000 melt-freeze cycles. The parameters determined in this work allow more accurate modeling and optimization of the behavior of the eutectic mixture in preparation for implementation as a thermal energy storage PCM.

Abstract: Window design is decisive in providing appropriate visual comfort for occupants and sufficient energy savings in electric lighting. In daylighting, visual comfort is dependent on the maximum daylight autonomy. Moreover, energy consumption in electric lighting relies on daylight autonomy. The aim of this research is to quantify these metrics in a residential room for different window models and analyze the results obtained. The surface reflectance and the geometry of the window are variable. DaySim 3.2 lighting program provides the simulations of the room model according to different orientations and weather conditions. Following the trials, it was concluded that daylight autonomy is proportional to the glass surface and reflectance of surfaces at the back of the room, while its influence near the facade is negligible. However, energy consumption does not depend on window shape. It is also concluded that windows located higher up result in higher illuminance at the back of the room than those in centered locations. The conclusions of this research are contrasted with the analysis of daylight metrics for different locations and orientations of the window. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The fully building integrated Solar Thermal Facade (STF) systems can become potential solutions for aesthetics architectural design, as well as for the enhancement of energy efficiency and reduction of operational cost in the contemporary built environment. As a result, this article introduces a novel compact STF with internally extruded pin-fin flow channel that is particularly suitable for the building integration. A dedicated simulation model was developed on basis of the heat transfer and the flow mechanics. A prototype of this STF was fabricated and then it was tested under a series of controlled environmental conditions. The experimental validation illustrated a good agreement with the simulation results, indicating the established model was able to predict the STF's thermal performance at a reasonable accuracy (i.e. mean deviation of less than 5.46%). The impacts of several operational parameters, i.e. equivalent solar radiation, air temperature, air velocity, water mass flow rate and inlet water temperature, on the STF thermal performance were then discussed respectively. Given the baseline testing condition, the collector efficiency factor F is almost 0.9930, leading to a relatively high nominal thermal efficiency at about 63.21%, which demonstrates such STF, with simpler structure, lower cost and higher feasibility in architectural design, can achieve an equivalent or better thermal performance than recent bionic STF or the conventional ones. It is also concluded that the thermal efficiency varies proportionally with solar radiation, air temperature, and mass flow rate of water, but oppositely to air velocity and inlet water temperature. A sharp decreasing trend of this STF's thermal efficiency against the (T-in-T-a)/I was observed under the given operational conditions, which indicates current STF design is only suitable for pool heating, domestic hot water and radiant space heating in areas/climates with warm ambient air temperature and sufficient solar radiation. The overall research results are beneficial for further design, optimization and application of such STF in various solar driven systems, including the provision of hot water, space heating/cooling, increased ventilation, or even electricity in buildings. Such STF technology has the potential to boost the building energy efficiency and literally turn the envelope into an independent energy plant, creating the possibility of solar-thermal technologies deployment in high-rise buildings.

Abstract: A novel spectral beam splitting photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) solar receiver for linear concentrators has been developed capable of generating high-grade thermal energy concurrently with electricity. This paper evaluates the initial field testing of this receiver which combines a selective absorption heat transfer fluid (Propylene Glycol) with a band pass optical filter to achieve efficient spectral splitting. Wavelengths of light between 700 nm and 1100 nm are directed to the silicon PV cells, with the remaining wavelengths absorbed directly as heat. A prototype has been constructed and mounted to a parabolic trough concentrator with 42x geometrical concentration ratio. Results demonstrated considerable promise for this technique. High grade heat thermal efficiencies of 31% relative to the thermal beam splitting fraction were achieved at a receiver temperature of 120 degrees C, with a total system efficiency of 50%. Electrical yields of approximately 3.8% relative to the total incident power were measured. While lower than expected we expect with minor modifications system efficiencies beyond 75% will be achievable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy hubs play an important role in implementing multi-carrier energy systems. More studies are required in both their modeling and operating aspects. In this regard, this paper attempts to develop medium-term management of an energy hub in restructured power systems. A model is presented to manage an energy hub which has electrical energy and natural gas as inputs and electrical and heat energy as outputs. Electricity is procured in various ways, either purchasing it from a pool-based market and bilateral contracts, or producing it from a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit, a diesel generator unit and Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). Pool prices and wind turbine production are subject to uncertainty, which makes energy management a complex puzzle. Heat demand is also procured by a furnace and a CHP unit. Energy hub managers should make decisions whether to purchase electricity from the electricity market and gas from the gas network or to produce electricity using a set of generators to meet the electrical and heat demands in the presence of uncertainties. The energy management objective is to minimize the total cost subject to several technical constraints using stochastic programming. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure, is used to reduce the unfavorable risk of costs. In doing so, the proposed model is illustrated using a sample test case with actual prices, load and wind speed data. The results show that the minimum cost is obtained by the best decisions involving the electricity market and purchasing natural gas for gas facilities. Considering risk also increases the total expected cost and decreases the CVaR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Due to limited flexibility of engine operation, it is uneasy to improve the fuel economy of parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with a single electric machine (SEM) from control perspective only. However, from design perspective, it is likely to devise multiple operating modes on a powertrain system to achieve better fuel economy. Therefore, in this paper, a velocity coupling HEV system with a SEM has been proposed, which has eleven modes, including an electric vehicle (EV) mode, three regenerative braking modes, an engine-start mode, an electrically variable transmission (EVT) mode, a parallel HEV mode, an engine-only mode, and three charging modes. Dynamic Programming (DP), as a global optimization algorithm, is leveraged to minimize the fuel consumption of this system. For comparison purposes, the P1 and P2 HEV systems are also examined by DP using the same vehicular parameters. Comparative results indicate that the P2 HEV saves about 6.68% fuel consumption over the P1 HEV, while more improvement can be observed from the proposed velocity coupling HEV, with 13.82% fuel consumption reduction over the P1 HEV.

Abstract: China will enact a national emissions trading system in 2017. The rules for the initial allocation of emission allowances have not been settled yet. This paper assesses the effect of auctioning as an initial emission allowance allocation methods of the China electricity power generation sector. This study employs a combined model with modified Trans-log production function, dynamic simulation model and multi objective linear programming to provide more realistic results. After estimating the optimal electric power sources structure and technological structure under different auctioning rates, this paper calculates the abatement cost of the China's electric power generation sector. When the allowance is free, the carbon shadow price will be 206.12 Yuan/ton. When 5% allowance is auctioned, the price will be 216.91 Yuan/ton. When the auctioning rate increases, the carbon emission abatement cost increases accordingly, as does the growth rate. The results also show that when the allowance auction rate is 5%, the marginal abatement costs for coal-fired power generation and clean power generation are 0.123 Yuan/kW h and 0.121 Yuan/kW h respectively, and thus, the total additional cost of the electric power generation sector will increase by 0.244 Yuan/kW h, which would be a heavy burden to China's electric power generation sector and the forward progress of auctioning in the near future may be hindered.

Abstract: The interest in the use of electroactive microorganisms for different applications by means of bioelectrochemical systems (BES) has been constantly increasing since the last decade. The main application of BES among others, which has received a widespread attention and researched extensively, is the microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology that relies on the electrogenic nature of certain bacteria to simultaneously treat different wastewaters and produce electric power. Various types of wastewaters have been examined as substrates for feeding bacteria in MFCs. The number and complexity of wastewaters have increased rapidly over the last few years thus necessitating the need for documenting this data further. This review provides a comprehensive and the state-of-the-art information on various wastewater substrates that have been used in MFCs. The performance of different types (designs) of MFCs in terms of electric current and power outputs together with the wastewater treatment efficiency in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and columbic efficiency (CE) is presented. Some of the challenges and future perspectives with regard to the energy recovery from wastewaters using MFCs are briefly discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy storage devices, such as batteries and flywheels, are promising options for providing operating reserves due to their fast response and low emissions during operation. However, because of the complex nature of power systems, adding energy storage-based reserves to the power system may not necessarily benefit the environment. In this paper, we analyze these impacts in a test system and identify important drivers that affect the environmental outcomes. Dispatch results are obtained by solving an optimal power flow (OPF) problem and are used to determine emissions. We find that the impacts of adding energy storage are highly case-dependent. In systems with high renewable penetration levels and significant renewable curtailment, adding energy storage reduces emissions; in other systems, the impacts on emissions could be positive, neutral, or negative. The analyses presented in this paper show that policies to procure energy storage as a means to reduce emissions may actually lead to increased system-wide emissions if current dispatch algorithms are used. We also explore the impacts of modifying the dispatch algorithm to ensure system emissions with energy storage are no worse than system emissions without energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Methanolysis of sunflower oil catalyzed by a synthesized immobilized lipase (denoted as celite-alkyl-lipase) was carried out in a packed-bed reactor (PBR) (H = 167 cm, I.D = 1.5 cm) to produce biodiesel. Although complete conversion of the triglyceride can be achieved in a long-single column PBR with prolonged reaction time, the biodiesel production still reached a plateau of 67% conversion due to glycerol accumulation, which led to an increase in the mass transfer resistance. The biodiesel conversion was enhanced to 85% by carrying out the transesterification in a series of three packed-bed reactors integrated with glycerol removal devices. In the first column (H = 67 cm, I.D = 1.5 cm), triglyceride was converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), glycerol, as well as a considerable amount of intermediate products, while the second (H = 67 cm, I.D = 2.0 cm) and third columns (H = 67 cm, I.D = 2.5 cm) continuously converted intermediate products to FAME with the supply of methanol and without the accumulation of glycerol. The PBR series system was able to continuously produce biodiesel at the yield of 4413 kg kg(-1) celite-alkyl-lipase, without deactivation of the biocatalyst. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: China's rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in a great deal of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions, which is closely related to its sustainable development and the long term stability of global climate. This study proposes panel data analysis to model spatiotemporal CO2 emission dynamics at a higher resolution in China by integrating the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data with statistic data of CO2 emissions. Spatiotemporal CO2 emission dynamics were assessed from national scale down to regional and urban agglomeration scales. The evaluation showed that there was a true positive correlation between NSL data and statistic CO2 emissions in China at the provincial level from 1997 to 2012, which could be suitable for estimating CO2 emissions at 1 km resolution. The spatiotemporal CO2 emission dynamics between different regions varied greatly. The high-growth type and high-grade of CO2 emissions were mainly distributed in the Eastern region, Shandong Peninsula and Middle south of Liaoning, with clearly lower concentrations in the Western region, Central region and Sichuan-Chongqing. The results of this study will enhance the understanding of spatiotemporal variations of CO2 emissions in China. They will provide a scientific basis for policy-making on viable CO2 emission mitigation policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study introduces an improved Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index to measure the green productivity growth of China's manufacturing sector during the 11th Five-Year Period (2006-2010). A three-stage data envelopment analysis model is adopted to measure the effects of government measures on green productivity growth. The main results are: (i) the average value of the Malmquist productivity index is 1.045 and the average value of the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index accounting for CO2 emissions is 1.027. This indicates imply that the relatively higher values of the former are at the expense of substantial energy usage and CO2 emissions; (ii) China's energy-saving policies and measures, such as mass promotion and adoption of energy-saving technology, closure and elimination of obsolete production capacity, and reduction of over-capacity are important for green development; (iii) after eliminating the effects of environmental influences and statistical noise on output slacks, the adjusted green productivity changes are smaller while the adjusted technical changes are larger than the corresponding initial levels; (iv) the energy conservation policies implemented in China's manufacturing sector are far from the optimal level, and more stringent enforcement would be conducive for green productivity growth in the manufacturing sector.

Abstract: This study investigates the effect of housing relocation policies on energy consumption by simulating household relocation choice behaviors and consumption behaviors. Energy consumption is estimated based on consumption behaviors. Three types of policy are analyzed: the relocation subsidy policy, the suburban residence taxation policy, and the combination of subsidy and taxation policy. The results show that all policies have influence on housing relocation choice and consumption behaviors. The number of households in a given area would increase by two percent under the relocation subsidy policy. However, this type of policy contributes to greater demand of general goods, land, and more energy consumption. A suburban residence taxation policy shows very limited effect on housing relocation choice behaviors, with only a 0.1% increase of households in the designated area. However, this policy shows strong effect on energy reduction due to shorter trip time and less demand of car trips and land. A combination of subsidy policy and suburban residence taxation policy attracts 2.2% of households move to the city center area. Energy consumption increases as consumption of general goods increases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Innovative thermal regulation technologies could provide great potential for reducing energy consumption in buildings. In this work, we report, for the first time, the application of highly stretchable and tough double network hydrogels (DN-Gels) as durable and reusable 'sweating skins' for cooling buildings. These DN-Gels demonstrate outstanding cooling performance, reducing the top roof surface temperature of wooden house models by 25-30 degrees C for up to 7 h after only a single water hydration charge. More importantly, compared with single network hydrogels (SN-Gels) previously studied for cooling applications, these DN-Gels exhibit extraordinary toughness and cyclability due to their interpenetrated ionically and covalently cross-linked networks, as demonstrated by constant cooling performance over more than 50 cycles. This excellent cyclability is further demonstrated by the unaltered mechanical properties and charging capability of the hydrogels after many cycles, compared to fresh ones. By coating a 100 m(2) roof of a single house with tough DN-Gels, it is estimated that the annual electricity consumption needed for air conditioning can be reduced by similar to 290 kW h with associated CO2 emission reductions of 160 kg. Our results suggest that bio-inspired sweat cooling, specifically using tough DN-Gel coatings, represents a promising energy-efficient technology for cooling buildings as well as other devices and systems.

Abstract: Development of efficient and cost-effective pretreatment prior to hydrolysis is essential for the economical production of biobutanol from lignocelluloses. In this study, acetone pretreatment with a number of advantages over the other pretreatments was used to improve enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation with Clostridium acetolnitylicum for acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) production from sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB). Using the pretreatment at 180 degrees C for 60 min, the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis of SSB was improved to 94.2%, leading to a hydrolysate with 36.3 g/L total sugar, which was subsequently fermented to 11.4 g/L ABE. This process resulted in the production of 78 g butanol, 35 g acetone, 12 g ethanol, 28 g acetic acid, and 6 g butyric acid from each kg of SSB. Through the pretreatment, 143 g lignin per kg of SSB was dissolved into the solvent, with the potential to be recovered as unaltered pure lignin. Furthermore, the co-production of acetone by the ABE fermentation alleviated the concern about unavoidable solvent loss in the pretreatment, i.e., 24 g acetone/kg SSB, using an integrated process for biobutanol production from SSB. The energy equivalent obtained in the form of butanol and ethanol (72 g gasoline equivalent/kg SSB) was higher than that obtainable via ethanolic fermentation (less than 70 g/kg SSB).

Abstract: The paper presents a unit commitment model, based on mixed integer linear programming, capable of assessing the impact of electric vehicles (EV) on provision of ancillary services in power systems with high share of renewable energy sources (RES). The analyses show how role of different conventional units changes with integration of variable and uncertain RES and how introducing a flexible sources on the demand side, in this case EV, impact the traditional provision of spinning/contingency reserve services. In addition, technical constraints of conventional units, such as nuclear, gas or coal, limit the inherit flexibility of the system which results in curtailing clean renewable sources and inefficient operation. Following on that, sensitivity analyses of operational cost and wind curtailment shows which techno-economic constraints impact the flexibility of the high RES systems the most and how integration of more flexible units or decommission of conventional nuclear, coal and gas driven power plants would impact the system's operation. Finally, two different wind generation polices (wind penalization and wind turbines as reserve providers) have been analysed in terms of operational flexibility through different stages of conventional unit's decommission and compared with the same analyses when EV were used as reserve providers.

Abstract: The limited drive range (The maximum distance that an EV can travel.) of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is one of the major challenges that EV manufacturers are attempting to overcome. To this end, a simple, accurate, and efficient energy consumption model is needed to develop real-time eco-driving and eco-routing systems that can enhance the energy efficiency of EVs and thus extend their travel range. Although numerous publications have focused on the modeling of EV energy consumption levels, these studies are limited to measuring energy consumption of an EV's control algorithm, macro-project evaluations, or simplified well-to-wheels analyses. Consequently, this paper addresses this need by developing a simple EV energy model that computes an EV's instantaneous energy consumption using second-by-second vehicle speed, acceleration and roadway grade data as input variables. In doing so, the model estimates the instantaneous braking energy regeneration. The proposed model can be easily implemented in the following applications: in-vehicle, Smartphone eco-driving, eco-routing and transportation simulation software to quantify the network-wide energy consumption levels for a fleet of EVs. One of the main advantages of EVs is their ability to recover energy while braking using a regenerative braking system. State-of-the-art vehicle energy consumption models consider an average constant regenerative braking energy efficiency or regenerative braking factors that are mainly dependent on the vehicle's average speed. In an attempt to enhance EV energy consumption models, the proposed model computes the regenerative braking efficiency using the instantaneous vehicle operational variables. The proposed model accurately estimates the energy consumption, producing an average error of 5.9% relative to empirical data. The results also demonstrate that EVs can recover a higher amount of energy in an urban driving environment when compared to high speed highway driving using the proposed model. Moreover, the study also compared different electric vehicles and quantified the impact of auxiliary systems, including the air conditioning and heating systems, on vehicle energy consumption levels using the proposed energy model. The study demonstrated that the use of the heating and air conditioning system could significantly reduce the EV efficiency and travel range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Typical power-to-gas plants mainly consist of a water electrolyzer, a mechanical compressor, an active cooler and a dryer. The best sequence of the single components as well as the pressure levels throughout the process are ambiguous. They depend on the hydrogen delivery pressure and the humidity requirements of the final product.
The present analysis is based on a uniform technology independent model framework of the single process units. It allows for the calculation of the overall energy demand, independent of the requirements on hydrogen pressure and water content. In the present contribution two main superordinate configurations, which differ in the sequence of mechanical compressor and dryer, are compared and the best pressure profile throughout the process is determined.
The analysis exemplarily focuses on hydrogen delivery pressures between 1 and 100 bar and an aimed maximal water content of 5 mu mol/mol, as required e.g. for automotive applications. The results show that the energy demand for drying dominates the total energy balance at low delivery pressure. Higher electrolyzer pressures increase the losses due to hydrogen crossover. A mechanical compression prior to drying can be used to reduce the overall energy demand of the process. The electrolyzer pressure can be kept below 20 bar, which reduces hydrogen crossover and besides enables anyhow efficient drying at high pressures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper focuses on households' development of new energy-efficient habits as demonstrated in the context of a major electricity shortfall event. Energy conservation policies should encourage households to take measures that are actually effective in reducing energy consumption and that can be sustained over long periods of time. Few studies, however, have empirically examined what types of energy saving measures are actually effective and persistent. The electricity shortages following the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster provided an opportunity to examine this question. A web survey of households in Japan was implemented to obtain data on metered electricity use in the summers of 2010-2013, household behaviors for electricity savings, and household socioeconomic attributes. Regression analysis was conducted to explain the effectiveness and persistence of energy saving behaviors. Results indicate that most households took several electricity-saving measures after the disaster to adapt to the electricity shortage. Certain types of measures led to 2-4% savings in electricity consumption (per measure) and persisted for two years. The effective and persistent electricity-saving measures tended to be those that did not require either frequent efforts or considerable discomfort. Findings suggest that electricity-saving behaviors requiring infrequent effort and little discomfort can become engrained as new habits or lifestyles. In particular, one promising measure may be to lower the electricity-usage settings of appliances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The concerns on energy security and environment protection have driven the need to produce, transform and utilize energy in a more efficient, clean and diversified way. Under this background, we design a paradigm for energy hubs that combine distributed energy supply/combined cooling heating and power (DES/CCHP), renewable energy and energy storage. These energy hubs are comprised of heating, cooling and power systems, and natural gas, power generation and photovoltaic (PV) are the primary energy sources. Also, we propose a paradigm and its operation model for regional multi-energy prosumers (RMEP) whose energy demands are served by interconnected energy hubs. The energy exchange in energy hub is based on the structure of energy buses including power bus, heating bus and cooling bus. These energy buses are interconnected as a ring heating/cooling network and a radial power grid to implement mutually complementary reserves of energy hubs. Moreover, the bi-directional energy flows between prosumer and the main grid are also analyzed. In addition, an optimal scheduling model for RMEP is proposed. The formulated objective of this model is to minimize prosumer's cost of purchasing electricity and natural gas plus the cost of GHG emission or to maximize the revenue of selling electricity back to the grid, while considering various electricity and gas prices and heating/cooling demands during different time periods. The decision variables for prosumer include the amount of purchased gas, the amounts of purchased and sold electricity at energy hubs. Case studies are undertaken on the 15-node multi-energy prosumer system, where the system comprises three energy hubs. Prosumer's operational strategies under system normal and contingency conditions on typical summer and winter load days can be obtained. Comparative analyses between mutually independent energy hubs are also conducted. According to the simulation results, prosumer can play an important role in responding to the time-of-use electricity and gas tariffs, shaving the regional peak loads as a whole. Besides, the interconnected energy hubs can enhance the overall system operational flexibility and reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Multiple energy carrier systems stem from the need to evolve traditional electricity, gas and other energy systems to more efficient, integrated energy systems. An approach is presented, for controlling multiple energy carriers, including electricity (AC or DC), heat, natural gas and hydrogen, with the objective to minimise the overall cost and/or emissions, while adhering to technical and commercial constraints, such as network limits and market contracts. The technique of multi-agent systems (MAS) was used. The benefits of this approach are discussed and include a reduction of more than 50% in the balancing costs of a potential deviation. An implementation of this methodology is also presented. In order to validate the operation of the developed system, a number of experiments were performed using both software and hardware. The results validated the efficient operation of the developed system, proving its ability to optimise the operation of multiple energy carrier inputs within the context of an energy hub, using a hierarchical multi-agent system control structure.

Abstract: Reliability evaluation of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) based on Smart Agent Communication (SAC) is studied in this paper. The typical structure and reliability evaluation modeling for IESs is firstly introduced. A new reliability evaluation approach is then presented, in which SAC based system reconfiguration is innovatively integrated into the reliability evaluation process. Based on this combination, state evaluation (key procedure of the reliability evaluation) along with system reconfiguration can be conducted autonomously in reliability evaluation. Algorithm and procedures of the system reconfiguration based on a decentralized agent communication algorithm (K-1 algorithm) is described. The system reconfiguration does not depend on global information of whole system, which can effectively improve reliability evaluation and modeling efficiency. The presented models and approaches are conducted on the multi-paradigm modeling and simulation platform-AnyLogic, and validated by extensive cases studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The integration temperature difference Delta T-i considers the heat transfer routes, linking the heat transfer process with the thermodynamic behavior of heat exchangers. The first and second non-dimensional integration temperature differences are defined as Delta T*(i,h) = Delta T-i/Delta T-h,T-i and Delta T*(i,s) = Delta T-i/(Delta T-h,T-i - T-0) respectively, where T-h,T-i is the heat source temperature and T-0 is the environment temperature. This paper is the first to experimentally verify the significance of the non-dimensional integration temperature differences on organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems. The first non-dimensional temperature difference is shown to have linear relationship with the revised entropy generation numbers (N-s). With increases of the second non-dimensional integration temperature difference, the expander powers, system thermal and exergy efficiencies had parabola distributions. They simultaneously reached maximum at Delta T*(i,s) = 0.282, under which the vapor cavitation in the expander disappears and the exergy losses of heat exchangers are acceptable to elevate the expander efficiency. Beyond the optimal point, the ORC performance is worsened either due to the vapor cavitation in the expander, or due to the poor thermal matches in the evaporator and condenser. The second non-dimensional integration temperature difference comprehensively reflects the effects of heat source temperatures, heating powers and organic fluid flow rates and pressures, etc. It balances exergy destructions of various components to optimize the system. Thus, it can be an important parameter index to maximize the power or electricity output for a specific heat source. The usefulness of the integration temperature difference and the future work are discussed in the end of this paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study proposes a set of optimal emission taxes that could be used to fully internalize environmental externalities. Carbon fees are computed for low-income economies, lower-middle-income economies, upper-middle-income economies, high-income economies, China and the United States. Subsequently, the implementation of these emission taxes is evaluated under two different scenarios; one assuming abatement substitution and the other relaxing this assumption. Estimated damages and abatement from various sectors lie between 0.0003 to 0.021 and 0.001 to 0.012 lb per dollar output respectively. Optimal pollution taxes per dollar output range as high as 2.8% for heavy manufacturing in the high income countries, and as low as 0.01% in the service sectors of the low income countries. On the impacts of these taxes, the study produces evidence that, whether abatement substitution is present or not, production in low-income economies would be less adversely affected due to carbon taxes relative to high-income countries. In addition, the emissions taxes reduce environmental damages by nearly 50% in all regions. Worldwide welfare gains from internalizing negative externalities when no abatement substitution is present is about three times the welfare gains in the presence of abatement substitution. Although these results imply a sort of tradeoff between the economics of production and environment, improved environmental benefits due to carbon taxes seem to outweigh the deterioration in economic activities; and as such, welfare improves in general.

Abstract: This paper aims at assessing the value of load shifting and demand side flexibility for improving electric grid system operations. In particular, this study investigates to what extent residential heat pumps participating in load shifting can contribute to reducing operational costs and CO2 emissions associated with electric power generation and how home owners with heat pump systems can be best motivated to achieve these flexibility benefits. Residential heat pumps, when intelligently orchestrated in their operation, can lower operational costs and CO2 emissions by performing load shifting in order to reduce curtailment of electricity from renewable energy sources and improve the efficiency of dispatchable power plants. In order to study the interaction, both the electricity generation system and residences with heat pumps are modeled. In a first step, an integrated modeling approach is presented which represents the idealized case where the electrical grid operation in terms of unit commitment and dispatch is concurrently optimized with that of a large number of residential heat pumps located in homes designed to low-energy design standards. While this joint optimization approach does not lend itself for real-time implementation, it serves as an upper bound for the achievable operational cost savings. The main focus of this paper is to assess to what extent load shifting incentives are able to achieve the aforementioned savings potential. Two types of incentives are studied: direct load control and dynamic time-of-use pricing. Since both the electricity generation supply system and the residential building stock with heat pumps had been modeled for the joint optimization, the performance of both load shifting incentives can be compared by separately assessing the supply and demand side. Superior performance is noted for the direct-load control scenario, achieving 60-90% of the cost savings attained in the jointly optimized best-case scenario. In dynamic time-of-use pricing, poor performance in terms of reduced cost and emissions is noted when the heat pumps response is not taken into account. When the heat pumps response is taken into account, dynamic time-of-use pricing performs better. However, both dynamic time-of-use pricing schemes show inferior performance at high levels of residential heat pump penetration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Increasing focus on energy affordability and environmental impact is drawing interest towards the potential value of low carbon technology (LCT) interventions in buildings and district energy systems. Relevant interventions may include improvements of the insulation levels and installation of low carbon and renewable generation technologies (e.g., combined heat and power, photovoltaics, heat pumps). These LCT interventions for both electricity and heat supply can, in principle, reduce energy costs and CO2 emissions for final energy consumers. This can be achieved by coupling, and possibly optimising, multiple energy vectors from traditionally independent systems (e.g., electricity, heat and gas). However, this transition to distributed multi-energy systems introduces complex physical and commercial interactions between the different energy vectors. Further, these interactions can be fundamentally different at different aggregation levels (e.g., premises, district, and commercial level). This makes the assessment of business cases for LCT interventions in a multi-energy context a grand challenge, and given the potentially disruptive commercial impact of many such novel technologies, such complexity might result in a barrier to their development. In light of this, this paper proposes a techno-economic framework for the assessment of business cases of LCTs, which systematically models the physical and commercial multi-energy flows at the premises, grid connection point, and commercial levels. This is particularly important given the commonly asymmetrical nature of various energy price components, which can have significant effects on the business cases of LCTs and associated actors (e.g., retailers and energy service companies). The proposed framework is demonstrated through a series of case studies that highlight the value of various LCT interventions and of aggregation, in terms of energy, emission and operational cash flow metrics. The relevance and importance of the framework to developing business cases for various energy system actors, including policy makers and regulators, is discussed, with the final aim of facilitating the uptake of low carbon multi-energy technologies.

Abstract: Distributed power systems in the U.S. and globally are evolving to provide reliable and clean energy to consumers. In California, existing regulations require significant increases in renewable generation, as well as identification of customer-side Distributed Energy Resources (DER) controls, communication technologies, and standards for interconnection with the electric grid systems. As DER deployment expands, customer-side DER control and optimization will be critical for system flexibility and demand response (DR) participation, which improves the economic viability of DER systems. Current DER systems integration and communication challenges include leveraging the existing DER and DR technology and systems infrastructure, and enabling optimized cost, energy and carbon choices for customers to deploy interoperable grid transactions and renewable energy systems at scale.
This paper presents a cost-effective solution to these challenges by exploring communication technologies and information models for DER system integration and interoperability. This system uses open standards and optimization models for resource planning based on dynamic-pricing notifications and autonomous operations within various domains of the smart grid energy system. It identifies architectures and customer engagement strategies in dynamic DR pricing transactions to generate feedback information models for load flexibility, load profiles, and participation schedules. The models are tested at a real site in California Fort Hunter Liggett (FHL). The results for FHL show that the model fits within the existing and new DR business models and networked systems for transactive energy concepts. Integrated energy systems, communication networks, and modeling tools that coordinate supply-side networks and DER will enable electric grid system operators to use DER for grid transactions in an integrated system.

Abstract: Integrated energy systems (IESs) are under development for a variety of benefits. District electricity and heating systems (DEHSs) deliver electricity and heat, the most common energy demands, to end-users. This paper studies the interactions in a DEHS considering the time-scale characteristics. Interaction mechanisms of a DEHS are analyzed. A disturbance in one system influences another system through coupling components, depending on the disturbance, operating characteristics, and control strategies. A model of the main components in DEHSs is presented. The time scale characteristics are studied based on a dynamic comparison of the different components. Then the interaction process is divided into four stages; each is a quasi-steady state. A quasi-steady multi-energy flow model is proposed and calculated, with a heating network node type transformation technique developed. A case study with detailed results and discussion of 3 types of disturbance is presented to verify the methods. The results present the interactions between the electricity and the system. It is suggested that attention should be paid both on the fast hydraulic process and slow thermal process for system security and economic operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The widespread use of decentralised multi-energy supply solutions such as gas-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP), heat pumps, gas boilers, and so forth is more and more increasing the linkages between electricity, heat and gas distribution networks. However, there is currently no model able to model the three networks in an integrated manner and with a suitable level of detail for operational purposes. A multi-temporal simulation model, which has been implemented in a relevant MATLAB-Excel VBA tool, is presented in this paper to carry out integrated analysis of electricity, heat and gas distribution networks, with specific applications to multi-vector district energy systems. The network linkages have been modelled through a multi -vector efficiency matrix specifically developed to map the transformation of final demands into network energy flows while taking into account the inter-network locations of the individual supply technologies. The relevant coupled electrical, heat and gas flow equations have been solved simultaneously using a Newton-Raphson approach. A real case study of a district multi-energy system in the Campus of the University of Manchester illustrates the quantitative use of the model in different scenarios for technical, economic and environmental studies. Sankey diagrams of the energy flows across the networks are also presented to give a visual picture of the multi-energy interactions and losses in the district in different scenarios. The model can be flexibly adapted to generic network topologies and multi-energy supply technologies, and can thus be used for practical operational implementations as well as to inform planning of low carbon multi -vector energy systems.

Abstract: Along with the development of Smart Energy System (SES), the advancing popularity of hybrid energy appliances, such as micro-combined heat and power (CHP) and electric heaters, requires an overall energy management strategy to optimize the energy using while guaranteeing energy supply for both the electricity and heat demand. This paper based on the concept of Multi-Commodity Smart Energy System (MC-SES) proposes a self-sufficient hybrid energy model to minimize the energy exchange with the external electricity grid. Next to the optimization solution for this hybrid energy management problem, a greedy algorithm has been proposed to alleviate the high computational complexity of optimization searching. The optimization, direct allocation and greedy-based methods will all be analyzed, simulated and compared in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Heat pumps (HP) and electric immersion boilers (EB) "have great potential to increase flexibility in energy systems. In parallel, decreasing taxes on electricity-based heat production are creating a more favorable economic environment for the deployment of these units in Denmark. In this paper, the economic value of heat pumps and electric boilers is assessed by simulating their day-to-day market performance using a novel operational strategy based on two-stage stochastic programming. This stochastic model is employed to optimize jointly the daily operation of HPs and EBs along with the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units in the system. Uncertainty in the heat demand and power price is modeled via scenarios representing different plausible paths for their future evolution. A series of case-studies are performed using real-world data for the heat and power systems in the Copenhagen area during four representative weeks of 2013. We show that the use of stochastic operational models is critical, as standard deterministic models provide an overestimation of the added benefits from the installation of HPs and EBs, thus leading to over-investment in capacity. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity studies to investigate the effect on market performance of varying capacity and efficiency for these units, as well as of different levels of prices in the electricity market. We find that these parameters substantially affect the profitability of heat pumps and electric boilers, hence, they must be carefully assessed by potential investors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper focuses on technical and economic analysis of a hydrogen refilling station to provide operational insight through tight coupling of technical models of physical processes and economic models. This allows the dynamic relationships of the system to be captured and analysed to provide short/medium term analytical capability to support system design, planning, and financing. The modelling developed here highlights the need to closely link technical and economic models for technology led projects where technical capability and commercial feasibility are important. The results show that hydrogen fuel can be competitive with petrol on a GBP/KG basis if the return on investment period is over 10 years for PEM electrolysers and 5 for Alkaline electrolysers. We also show that subsidies on capital costs (as reflected by some R&D funding programs) make both PEM and Alkaline technologies cheaper than the equivalent price of petrol, which suggests more emphasis should be put on commercialising R&D funded projects as they have commercial advantages. The paper also shows that a combined wind and grid connected station is preferable so that a higher number of customers are served (i.e. minimum shortage of hydrogen). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The most striking feature of the solar energy is its intermittency and instability resulting from environmental influence. Hydropower can be an ideal choice to compensate photovoltaic (PV) power since it is easy to adjust and responds rapidly with low cost. This study proposed a long-term multi-objective optimization model for integrated hydro/PV power system considering the smoothness of power output process and the total amount of annual power generation of the system simultaneously. The PV power output is firstly calculated by hourly solar radiation and temperature data, which is then taken as the boundary condition for reservoir optimization. For hydropower, due to its great adjustable capability, a month is taken as the time step to balance the simulation cost. The problem dimension is thus reduced by decoupling hydropower and PV power in time scales. The modified version of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is adopted to optimize the multi-objective problem. The proposed model was applied to the Longyangxia hydro/PV hybrid power system in Qinghai province of China, which is supposed to be the largest hydro/PV hydropower station in the world. The results verified that the hydropower is an ideal compensation resource for the PV power in nature, especially in wet years, when the solar radiation decreases due to rainfalls while the water resource is abundant to be allocated. The power generation potential is provided for different hydrologic years, which can be taken to evaluate the actual operations. The proposed methodology is general in that it can be used for other hydro/PV power systems than those studied here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: With the increasing proportion of natural gas in power generation, natural gas network and electricity network are closely coupled. Therefore, planning of any individual system regardless of such interdependence will increase the total cost of the whole combined systems. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization model for the combined gas and electricity network planning is presented in this work. To be specific, the objectives of the proposed model are to minimize both investment cost and production cost of the combined system while taking into account the N-1 network security criterion. Moreover, the stochastic nature of wind power generation is addressed in the proposed model. Consequently, it leads to a mixed integer non-linear, multi-objective, stochastic programming problem. To solve this complex model, the Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to capture the optimal Pareto front, wherein the Primal-Dual Interior-Point (PDIP) method combined with the point estimate method is adopted to evaluate the objective functions. In addition, decision makers can use a fuzzy decision making approach based on their preference to select the final optimal solution from the optimal Pareto front. The effectiveness of the proposed model and method are validated on a modified IEEE 24-bus electricity network integrated with a 15-node natural gas system as well as a real-world system of Hainan province.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel solar thermal polygeneration (STP) system for production of cooling, clean water and domestic hot water is modeled and analyzed for the weather conditions of United Arab Emirates (UAE). The system comprises of solar collectors for production of thermal energy, single stage LiBr-H2O absorption chiller (VAC) for providing air conditioning to office cabins and membrane distillation (MD) modules for clean water production along with domestic hot water generation as by-product. The performance of STP is analyzed with three different solar collectors - flat plate collectors (FPC), evacuated tube collector (ETC) and compound parabolic collector (CPC). The system is modeled and dynamically simulated using TRNSYS software for optimization of various design parameters like slope of the collectors, mass flow rate through the collector loop, storage capacity and area of collectors. Combined and system efficiency of the STP system has been determined for optimum conditions. Economic benefits are analyzed for different collectors and fuel costs savings. A lowest payback period of 6.75 years is achieved by STP with evacuated tube collector field having gross area of 216 m(2). STP system has cumulative savings of $520,000 over the life time of the project through roof top solar collector installation. In terms of environmental benefits, 109 metric tons/year of CO2 emissions would be avoided and hence the overall payback period would be reduced by 8% based on cost saving through carbon credits. Economic and environmental benefits were aided by steady system performances of absorption chiller (35 kW), membrane distiller (80 l/day) and heat recovery system (1.2 m(3)/h) throughout the year. The complete simulation results of the STP system is utilized for the development, installation and testing of a polygeneration system at RAKRIC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the United States, natural gas-fired generators gained increasing popularity in recent years due to the low fuel cost and emission, as well as the proven large gas reserves. Consequently, the highly interdependency between the gas and electricity networks is needed to be considered in the system operation. To improve the overall system operation and optimize the energy flow, an interval optimization based coordinated operating strategy for the gas-electricity integrated energy system (IES) is proposed in this paper considering demand response and wind power uncertainty. In the proposed model, the gas and electricity infrastructures are modeled in detail and their operation constraints are fully considered, wherein the nonlinear characteristics are modeled including pipeline gas flow and compressors. Then a demand response program is incorporated into the optimization model and its effects on the IES operation are investigated. Based on interval mathematics, wind power uncertainty is represented as interval numbers instead of probability distributions. A case study is performed on a six-bus electricity network with a seven-node gas network to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method; further, the IEEE 118-bus system coupling with a 14-node natural gas system is used to verify its applicability in practical bulk systems.

Abstract: Thermal storage for air conditioning applications has potential to flatten peak load on electricity grids and improve energy savings of cooling systems. Phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal storage have much greater energy storage density than sensible thermal storage materials. It is proven that semi-clathrate hydrates of tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) can offer appropriate phase change temperatures and rapid formation rates, thus they are considered favourable for cold storage. To demonstrate the feasibility of TBAF hydrate as a cold storage medium, its thermal properties are determined. TBAF aqueous solutions are tested at a mass fraction range of 15-40 wt% in the presence or absence of another two quaternary ammonium/phosphonium salts - tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) and tetra-n-butylphosphonium bromide (TBPB). The T-history method is employed to determine the enthalpy and heat capacity of the material while the heat diffusion equation is used to obtain the material's thermal conductivity. The material with the highest formation enthalpy was selected for further analysis. For this material, a model of hydrate formation in a cold storage tube is established using the enthalpy method. By this means, the accumulated cooling capacity and charging rate of the tube is predicted, and the influencing factors on the charging performance are studied. The results indicate that careful selection of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) temperature, tube diameter, thermal conductivity and thickness of the tube wall can all potentially shorten the required charging time of the cold storage tube.

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust scheduling strategy to manage a building energy system with solar power generation system, multi-chiller system and ice thermal energy storage under prediction uncertainty. The strategy employs a two-stage adjustable robust formulation to minimize the system operation cost, wherein a parameter is introduced to adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solution against the modeled uncertainty. Then a column and constraint generation algorithm with modified initialization strategy is adopted to solve this optimization model along with mixed-integer linear programming. Further, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy by hourly simulating the system operation of a practical project with Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical results show that the robust scheduling with a proper parameter can be superior to the deterministic strategy in all the studied cases. Additionally, the proposed strategy has similar results with the model-based predictive control strategy while the former only needs to be implemented once. Even in the highest load case, the relative deviation between the two strategies is less than 2%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Natural gas has been suggested as a "bridge fuel" in the transition from coal to a near-zero emission energy system. However, the expansion of natural gas risks a delay in the introduction of near-zero emission energy systems, possibly offsetting the potential climate benefits of a gas-for-coal substitution. We use a schematic climate model to estimate CO2 and CH4 emissions from integrated energy systems and the resulting changes in global warming over various timeframes. Then we evaluate conditions under which delayed deployment of near-zero emission systems would result in loss of all net climate benefit (if any) from using natural gas as a bridge. Considering only physical climate system effects, we find that there is potential for delays in deployment of near-zero-emission technologies to offset all climate benefits from replacing coal energy systems with natural gas energy systems, especially if natural gas leakage is high, the natural gas energy system is inefficient, and the climate change metric emphasizes decadal time scale changes.

Abstract: Gas fired generation currently plays an integral support role ensuring security of supply in power systems with high wind power penetrations due to its technical and economic attributes. However, the increase in variable wind power has affected the gas generation output profile and is pushing the boundaries of the design and operating envelope of gas infrastructure. This paper investigates the mutual dependence and interaction between electricity generation and gas systems through the first comprehensive joined-up, multi-vector energy system analysis for Ireland. Key findings reveal the high vulnerability of the Irish power system to outages on the Irish gas system. It has been shown that the economic operation of the power system can be severely impacted by gas infrastructure outages, resulting in an average system marginal price of up to (sic)167/MW h from (sic)67/MW h in the base case. It has also been shown that gas infrastructure outages pose problems for the location of power system reserve provision, with a 150% increase in provision across a power system transmission bottleneck. Wind forecast error was shown to be a significant cause for concern, resulting in large swings in gas demand requiring key gas infrastructure to operate at close to 100% capacity. These findings are thought to increase in prominence as the installation of wind capacity increases towards 2020, placing further stress on both power and gas systems to maintain security of supply.

Abstract: Natural-gas-driven building cooling heating and power (BCHP) system shows high energy efficiency and low greenhouse gases emission, but is of dissatisfactory performance under part load working conditions due to the non-synchronized and fluctuating thermal and electrical demands. Integrating thermal energy storage (TES) device with BCHP system proves to be an effective way to improve the performance of the whole system. In this paper, the applicability of TES-BCHP system is investigated according to the relationship between user load demands and system energy supply. Based on the supply thermal power ratio of the prime mover and the required one of users, a new parameter, the degree of mismatch (DM), is defined. Moreover, the analytical relationship between primary energy saving ratio (PESR) of TES-BCHP system and DM is established, under following thermal load (FTL) and following electrical load (FEL) respectively for three typical working conditions. The results show that the more DM approaches to unity, the higher PESR of TES-BCHP will be, and that the exportability of the co-generated electricity is favorable for energy saving. It also indicates that TES-BCHP is more applicable for those where the heating demand is dominant. This work is of great significance in further understanding the energy saving mechanism between TES and BCHP and guiding the design of practical TES-BCHP systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays an irreplaceable role in the efficient management of electric systems. Particularly in the electricity market and industry, accurate forecasting could provide effective future plans and economic operations for operators of utilities and power systems. Hence, a more precise and stable load-forecasting model is essentially needed in the field of electricity load forecasting. To avoid the limitations of individual models, a new combined model is proposed. In this model, except for the multiple seasonal patterns used to reduce interferences from the original data, a new optimization algorithm is presented and applied to optimize the weight coefficients of the combined model based on non positive constraint combination theory. To estimate the forecasting ability of the proposed combined model, half-hourly electricity power data from New South Wales, the State of Victoria and the State of Queensland in Australia were used in this paper as a case study. In the numerical experiments, compared with other six single models, the average mean absolute percent errors (MAPEs) of the combined model were reduced by 0.7138%, 1.0281%, 4.8394%, 0.9239%, 9.6316% and 7.3367%, respectively.

Abstract: The variety of decision variables involved in the design of Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) and equipment still open opportunities to enhance efficiency and performance in the recovery of low grade and waste heat in spite of the high number of studies already available in the literature and the rapidly growing number of existing applications.
Most of the literature focuses on cycle configuration, design parameters and working fluid that maximize different performance metrics, but often ignores the expander design features that are necessary to obtain them, by fixing in advance the expander efficiency. This approach is questionable for ORC systems where the high volumetric expansion ratios, variable sizes and working fluids may markedly affect expander efficiency.
This study provides a design criterion of axial flow turbines which gives a reliable estimate of their efficiency for a wide range of operating duty specifications and working fluids. For fixed values of size parameter and volumetric expansion ratio the optimum values of duty parameters (flow and loading coefficients, degrees of reaction) and the associated turbine efficiency are obtained by a mean line design procedure including real gas properties and the recent loss correlations proposed by Aungier. For each working fluid, all the efficiency values obtained by this procedure for a wide set of size parameter and volumetric expansion ratio are included in a map, which updates a similar map obtained for high molecular weight ideal gases by Macchi and Perdichizzi in the eighties. A wide spectrum of working fluids and operating conditions is considered here to explore the effect of fluid characteristics on the shape of the efficiency maps.
Results show that the influence of the working fluid on the efficiency maps may be not negligible, and can be taken into account by including the working fluid critical temperature in addition to the size parameter and volumetric expansion ratio. Accordingly, a generalized efficiency map is obtained which is valid for any fluid, and can be easily integrated into a comprehensive thermodynamic cycle analysis and optimization to account for the real turbine performance.

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced stochastic analytical framework to quantify the benefits of smart electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs) on the carbon emission and the integration cost of renewable energy sources (RES) in the future UK electricity system. The typical operating patterns of EVs/HPs as well as the potential flexibility to perform demand shifting and frequency response are sourced from recent UK trials. A comprehensive range of case studies across several future UK scenarios suggest that smart EVs/HPs could deliver measurable carbon reductions by enabling a more efficient operation of the electricity system, while at the same time making the integration of electrified transport and heating demand significantly less carbon intensive. The second set of case studies establish that smart EVs/HPs have significant potential to support cost-efficient RES integration by reducing: (a) RES balancing cost, (b) cost of required back-up generation capacity, and (c) cost of additional low-carbon capacity required to offset lower fuel efficiency and curtailed RES output while achieving the same emission target. Frequency response provision from EVs/HPs could significantly enhance both the carbon benefit and the RES integration benefit of smart EVs/HPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a new design of a glazed and an unglazed inverted absorber partially covered photovoltaic thermal compound parabolic concentrator (PVT-CPC) water collector has been proposed. The performance of proposed systems has been compared with partially covered inclined and horizontal PVT-CPC water collector systems for constant mass flow rate mode. Analytical expressions for the outlet fluid temperature (T-fo1) and electrical efficiency of the proposed systems have been derived and presented. Based on the analytical thermal model, a software program has been developed in MATLAB 2010a to determine the outlet fluid temperature, electrical efficiency, thermal energy, electrical energy and overall exergy efficiency of the systems. The results showed that the glazed inverted absorber partially covered PVT-CPC water collector system exhibited higher values of instantaneous thermal efficiency. Further, the glazed inverted absorber partially covered PVT-CPC system is more suitable for higher thermal energy. However, the partially covered inclined PVT-CPC water collector is more favourable for electrical energy requirements. Further, the inverted absorber partially covered PVT-CPC system is cost effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To reduce the consumption of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, incentive-based policies are used to encourage end-users to utilize more clean energy. Hydrogen energy is an ideal clean energy that can be integrated into the next generation power grid. Deferrable electrolyzers (DES), as a typical electricity-to-hydrogen conversion devices and capable of modulating power consumption, can convert excessive power to store electricity as hydrogen. Therefore it can be used as a method for load management. The main contribution of this paper is to propose an energy-constrained state priority list (ECSPL) model, for analyzing the charging response of aggregated loads consisting of DE units. The typical hysteresis control of DEs as a load management mechanism is first discussed. A characteristic parameter, i.e. the energy state of DE charging load, is used to group and prioritize the DE units. The proposed ECSPL model optimally determines the operating status of DE charging and standby process, and it maintains the user-desired DE charging trajectory considering customer-constraints. The proposed model maintains the diversity of operating status of DE charging and standby process to prevent unexpected synchronization phenomenon for operating status. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an estimated baseline of the aggregated DE charging loads is obtained based on natural hysteresis control. The ECSPL control method of DE units for intra-hour load balancing is then evaluated. The effects of different energy-constraints, deadbands of sampled end-use state comparison, error associated with the charging-trajectory measurements are modeled to evaluate the performance of controlled DE group. The ECSPL model is described and demonstrated by the modeling results of investigated DE units. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A promising hybridization which increases the chances of deployment of Power to Gas technology is found in the synergy with oxycombustion of biomass. This study assesses the efficiency of an energy integrated system under different sizes and potential applications. District heating and industrial processes are revealed as the most suitable potential applications for this hybrid technology. Global efficiency of the combined system may be increased through thermal energy integration. The relative increment of efficiency achieved for those designs which avoid the requirement of an air separation unit and for those which completely consumed the generated CO2, are 24.5% and 29.7% respectively. A 2 MWth district heating case study is also analysed, revealing that 81.2% of the total available heat from the PtG-oxy system could be integrated raising the global efficiency up to 78.7% at the adequate operational point. Further 'full-fuel-cycle' analysis will be required prior to decide the interest of the concept under a specific scenario in comparison to other available energy storage technologies.

Abstract: The increasing share of natural gas-fired power plants (NGFPPs) has strengthened the linkage between electric power systems (EPSs) and natural gas systems (NGSs). It is imperative to analyze both systems jointly. In this paper, a probabilistic available transfer capability (PATC) model considering the static security constraints and uncertainties of electricity-gas integrated energy systems (IESs) is proposed. The concept of IES steady-state security regions is developed, and the mathematical model of ATC within IES security regions is formulated. The active constraint limiting the ATC is identified by the linear prediction and calculation (LPC) method, and then it is augmented into IES energy flow equations to determine the value of ATC. The uncertainties of correlated electricity/gas loads and wind power generations are also taken into account and are addressed by a combination of Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and the Nataf transformation. Moreover, the corrective adjustment in NGSs can be adopted to ensure the fuel availability of NGFPPs. Finally, test results on the modified IEEE 118-bus system and a 20-node NGS are presented to verify the applicability of the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The integration of electrical and heating systems has great potential to enhance the flexibility of power systems to accommodate more renewable power such as the wind and solar. This study was to investigate an optimal way to integrate the energy of both systems in urban areas. The amount of energy conversion between the electrical system and heating system was optimally decided so that the demand within both systems could be met at the least operational cost. Besides, the best node to join with the electrical system and heating system was chosen by consideration of the energy transmission loss. The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem was detailed as a large-scale non-linear program (LSNLP) in this paper. A decomposition-coordination algorithm was proposed to solve this LSNLP. At last, a 6-bus electrical power system with 31-node heating transmission system was studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The results showed that coordinated optimization of the energy distribution have significant benefits for reducing wind curtailment, operation cost, and energy losses. The proposed model and methodology could help system operators with decision support in the emerging integrated energy systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Solar electricity is growing very popular in the world, but it has some problems in matching of generation and demand both in hourly and seasonal levels. In northern latitudes the problem is especially significant, as the difference between solar availability in winter and summer is very large. Cooling needs do not increase electricity demand in summer as much as in southern locations, while there is a high demand for heating in the winter when solar power is not available.
This study looks into the economics and energy matching of photovoltaic (PV) systems for single-family houses in Finland. It also introduces the concept of zero energy level of buildings (ZEL), which can be used as a policy tool for renewable energy support schemes. PV self-consumption is compared between cases with district heating (DH), heat pump (HP) and direct electric heating (EH). Because the price of buying electricity is much higher than selling it, any excess PV power after meeting appliance loads was fed to a thermal storage to be stored as heat. Analysis was done for a single building and a community of ten similar buildings.
Excess solar power provided part of the space heating (SH) needs in spring and autumn and most domestic hot water (DHW) needs in summer. Self-consumption was increased by 15...70% with EH and by 20...40% with HP, when a PV system was used for space and DHW heating during summer and midseasons. Thermal storage increased energy matching, but high storage capacities did not provide a significant improvement over lower ones. Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for PV electricity in a single building almost reached grid parity (11 c/kWh) using EH, but the generation cost for HP and DH remained higher (13 and 17 c/kWh, respectively). Investment incentives reduced the LCOE below grid prices for electrically heated systems. In the community, the economies of scale lowered LCOE, such that in many cases grid parity was reached even without incentives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a source of renewable energy that employs temperature difference existing between water surface and some depth inside ocean. In this work, a small laboratory scale model radial turbine was designed with 2 kWe power output for OTEC application. Working fluid chosen for this turbine is refrigerant R134a. The turbine is designed for inlet and exit temperatures of 24.5 degrees C and 14 degrees C respectively. Speed of the turbine is chosen as 22000 rpm in order to avoid the use of gearbox. A comprehensive one-dimensional mean line design approach for radial-inflow turbine is adopted in this work. Important dimensions of R134a turbine are 35.5 mm and 22 mm for rotor tip and shroud radii respectively and blade widths at rotor inlet and outlet are 6 mm and 13 mm respectively. Detailed numerical simulation predicts the performance of the baseline turbine geometry described above. Further investigations were performed to bring out the effects of different geometric parameters on turbine performance. It is shown that blade edge filleting is very important to improve turbine performance over a wide range of operating parameters. Effect of tip clearance was found to be more significant than that in conventional large-sized turbines. Two phase flow calculation involving non equilibrium condensation of vapor shows the effect of liquid wetness fraction to be of limited influence because of restricted range of pressure ratio that the turbine goes through.

Abstract: This paper presents a double-layer smart charging management algorithm (SCMA) for electric vehicles in working place parking lots considering smart grid concept. This model enables safe and controlled charging, which satisfies both power grid and drivers' needs comprehensively. First level of SCMA controls each transformer power demand, transformer capacity, charging station status and the shortest way to reach suitable charger. Second level of SCMA is used during the charging process in order to provide cost-effective and reliable charging as well as less impact on power grid. The proposed SCMA strategy successfully routes the electric vehicles (EVs) to the most suitable charging point, decreases the charging costs and prevents the overloading of transformers. In this study, a comparison regarding the impacts of the whole charging process of the EVs on the power grid and drivers' requests with/without the proposed SCMA is presented and the results are discussed in detail.

Abstract: High energy consumption by the industry of developing countries has led to the problems of increasing emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) (primarily CO2) and worsening energy shortages. To address these problems, many mitigation measures have been utilized. One major measure is to mandate fixed reductions of GHG emission and energy consumption. Therefore, it is important for each developing country to disaggregate their national reduction targets into targets for various geographical parts of the country. In this paper, we propose a DEA-based approach to allocate China's national CO2 emissions and energy intensity reduction targets over Chinese provincial industrial sectors. We firstly evaluate the energy and environmental efficiency of Chinese industry considering energy consumption and GHG emissions. Then, considering the necessity of mitigating GHG emission and energy consumption, we develop a context-dependent DEA technique which can better characterize the changeable production with reductions of CO2 emission and energy intensity, to help allocate the national reduction targets over provincial industrial sectors. Our empirical study of 30 Chinese regions for the period 2005-2010 shows that the industry of China had poor energy and environmental efficiency. Considering three major geographical areas, eastern China's industrial sector had the highest efficiency scores while in this aspect central and western China were similar to each other at a lower level. Our study shows that the most effective allocation of the national reduction target requires most of the 30 regional industrial to reduce CO2 emission and energy intensity, while a few can increase or maintain their 2010 levels.

Abstract: The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, also known as Jing-Jin-Ji region, is the national capital region of China and has established ambitious targets for tackling air pollution and set measures to reach these targets within a rather complicated multi-level institutional architecture. From the perspective of the stages of development of Jing-Jin-Ji, there are significant differences among the regional industrial structures, energy application methods, and main sources of Particulate Matter (PM) and other polluting emissions. Despite the fact that the prevention and control policy for atmospheric pollution, which focuses on coal consumption at its core, has engendered creative efforts, a series of political, economic, and environmental problems has become a new round in the climate debate between national and local governments during climate policy implementation, thus diminishing the effect of the policy on air pollution prevention and control in Jing-Jin-Ji. Based on historical document analysis, a Competition & Cooperation framework of the local governments in the Jing-Jin-Ji region was constructed, and the historical analysis of government cooperation was conducted. The results show that for historical reasons, administrative decentralization and fiscal decentralization strengthen this phenomenon of governmental fragmentation, which led to both promoting economic growth and being an obstacle to the collaborative reduction of air pollutions in the region. Potential problems with the implementation of the control policy are also discussed. This paper provides a reference for how the dust-haze control policy compels the governmental cooperation in the Jing-Jin-Ji region and will help establish more specific and feasible proposals for PM reduction promotion.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of aluminum production, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China's aluminum industry (CAI) is posing a significant challenge. In this study, the energy-related GHG emission trajectories, features and driving forces of CAI are analyzed from the perspective of life cycle analysis (LCA) from 2004 to 2013. Results indicate that CAI experienced a rapid growth of energy-related GHG emissions with an average annual growth of 28.5 million tons CO(2)e from 2004 to 2013. Energy-scale effect is the main driving force for energy-related GHG emissions increase in CAI, while emission factor effect of secondary aluminum production plays a marginal effect. Construction and transportation-related activities account for the bulk of the embodied emissions, accounting for more than 40% of the total embodied emissions from CAI. Policy implications for GHG mitigation within the CM, such as developing secondary aluminum industry, improving energy mix and optimizing resource efficiency of production, are raised.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Malmquist energy conservation and emission reduction performance index (MECERPI) for assessing the performance changes in energy use and pollutant emissions over time. The index is built upon the non-radial directional distance function and can be derived by solving data envelopment analysis. We apply the MECERPI to empirically investigate the industrial performance of energy conservation and emission reduction in over two hundred cities in China as well as its influential factors. Our empirical results show that due to the combined effects of technological progress and efficiency improvement, the energy conservation and emission reduction performance of Chinese industry has improved at an average annual rate of 16%. The catch-up effect and convergence exist throughout the country, including the eastern, central, western and northeastern regions. The best performers, which act as the benchmark for industrial energy conservation and emission reduction, are the coastal cities in eastern China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel concept named as state of balance (SOB) is proposed and its online dynamic estimation method is presented for the high-power lithium-ion battery (LIB) packs, based on which the online dynamic equalization adjustment is realized aiming to protect the operation safety of its power supply application. The core parameter detection method based on the specific moving average algorithm is studied because of their identical varying characteristics on the individual cells due to the manufacturing variability and other factors, affecting the performance of the high-power LIB pack. The SOB estimation method is realized with the detailed deduction, in which a dual filter consisting of the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF), equivalent circuit model (ECM) and open circuit voltage (OCV) is used in order to predict the SOB state. It is beneficial for the energy operation and the energy performance state can be evaluated online prior to the adjustment method based on the terminal voltage consistency. The energy equalization is realized that is based on the credibility reasoning together with the equalization model building process. The experiments including the core parameter detection, SOB estimation and equalization adjustment are done and the experimental results are analyzed. The experiment results show that the numerical Coulomb efficiency is bigger than 95%. The cell voltage measurement error is less than 5 mV and the terminal voltage measurement error of the LIB pack is less than 1% FS. The measurement error of the battery discharge and charge maintenance current is less than 1% FS. The SOB estimation error is less than 5% in the laboratory room, the temperature of which is about 25 degrees C. The equalization charging current is 2 A and the equalization discharging current is 4.4 A, which can realize the real-time energy equalization adjustment among the connected cells in the LIB pack, guaranteeing its safety in the power supply application.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel control strategy for the optimal management of microgrids with high penetration of renewable energy sources and different energy storage systems. The control strategy is based on the integration of optimal generation scheduling with a model predictive control in order to achieve both long and short-term optimal planning. In particular, long-term optimization of the various microgrid components is obtained by the adoption of an optimal generation scheduling, in which a statistical approach is used to take into account weather and load forecasting uncertainties. The real-time management of the microgrid is instead entrusted to a model predictive controller, which has the important feature of using the results obtained by the optimal generation scheduling. The proposed control strategy was tested in a laboratory-scale microgrid present at the University of Seville, which is composed of an electronic power source that emulates a photovoltaic system, a battery bank and a hydrogen production and storage system. Two different experimental tests that simulate a summer and a winter day were carried out over a 24-h period to verify the reliability and performance enhancement of the control system. Results show an effective improvement in performance in terms of reduction of the microgrid operating cost and greater involvement of the hydrogen storage system for the maintenance of a spinning reserve in batteries.

Abstract: The Turgo Impulse turbine provides a unique and novel solution to increasing the capacity of a hydraulic impulse turbine while maintaining the nozzle and spear injector system (as used in Pelton turbines) for flow regulation. This has produced a turbine which operates in the higher flow ranges usually reserved for Francis machines while maintaining a relatively flat efficiency curve, characteristic of impulse machines.
Since its invention nearly 100 years ago, the Turgo turbine has been installed in thousands of locations across the globe. The majority of the development of the Turgo turbine design has been through the use of paper based and experimental studies however recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools have allowed the simulation of the complex, highly turbulent, multiphase flows associated with impulse turbines and some work has been done in applying this to the Turgo design. This review looks at the development of the of the Turgo turbine since its invention in 1919 and includes the paper based analyses, experimental studies and the more recent CFD analyses carried out on the design.

Abstract: Renewable energy has a critical role in limiting the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper assesses the implication of aligning renewable energy deployment target with national emission reduction target for mitigation cost. The assessment methodology uses Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment/computable general equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model to determine the mitigation cost in terms of GDP and welfare loss under alternative renewable targets in different climate-constrained scenarios. A range of country specific emission constraints is taken to address the uncertainties related to global emission pathway and emission entitlement scheme. Comparative results show that China needs to increase its share of non-fossil fuel significantly in the primary energy mix to achieve the stringent emission reduction target compared to India. The mitigation cost in terms of economic and welfare loss can be reduced by increasing the penetration of the renewable energy to achieve the same emission reduction target. The modeling results show that coordinated national climate and renewable energy policies help to achieve the GHG emission reduction target in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Abstract: Due to the strong nonlinearity and complex time-variant property of batteries, the existing state of charge (SOC) estimation approaches based on a single equivalent circuit model (ECM) cannot provide the accurate SOC for the entire discharging period. This paper aims to present a novel SOC estimation approach based on a multiple ECMs fusion method for improving the practical application performance. In the proposed approach, three battery ECMs, namely the Thevenin model, the double polarization model and the 3rd order RC model, are selected to describe the dynamic voltage of lithium-ion batteries and the genetic algorithm is then used to determine the model parameters. The linear matrilc inequality based H-infinity technique is employed to estimate the SOC from the three models and the Bayes theorem-based probability method is employed to determine the optimal weights for synthesizing the SOCs estimated from the three models. Two types of lithium-ion batteries are used to verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy and reliability of the SOC estimation against uncertain battery materials and inaccurate initial states.

Abstract: Several previous research initiatives have highlighted the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as key enablers for decreasing energy usage in buildings. However, few advances have been achieved in underground public spaces. This paper introduces a novel intelligent energy management system for underground stations. The system implements artificial intelligence solutions for autonomous building system control, based on advanced control algorithms that can learn from previous operations and situations. The robustness needed to operate in public spaces is achieved through a seamlessly integrated monitoring grid with self-diagnosis mechanisms. A middleware platform integrates existing devices, subsystems and newly deployed sensor-actuator networks. Results obtained during the implementation of the system in a prototype underground station showed potential yearly energy savings ranging between 74,336 and 87,339 kW h. The highest energy savings potential was found in the ventilation subsystem (30.6% +/- 2.0%), followed by the lighting system (24.1% +/- 1.9%) and escalators (8.5% +/- 1.9%). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Coal is the widespread fossil fuel on earth. It provides the necessary material foundation for economic development of a country. However, coal mining activities cause a lot of environmental impacts that are hazardous to the health of citizens in mining regions and place costs on the government. According to government laws and regulations, coal mines should invest in related pollution treatment projects to meet the emission standards. How to allocate the limited resources among a set of pollutant treatment projects to minimize the total losses, including penal loss and vacancy loss, from an investment perspective is a typical decision-making problem. Therefore, the present study proposed a discrete dynamic programming procedure to provide an effective solution for decision-making in treatment project investment. Furthermore, a case study involving the Laojuntang coal mine of Zhengzhou Coal Industry (Group) of China on the treatment project investment problem was implemented using the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective and applicable for environmental investment decision-making at a typical coal mine in terms of minimizing the total losses.

Abstract: China has become the world's largest carbon emitter. Its total carbon emission output from fossil fuel combustion and cement production was approximately 10 Gt CO2 in 2013. However, less is known about carbon emissions from the production of industrial materials, such as mineral products (e.g., lime, soda ash, asphalt roofing), chemical products (e.g., ammonia, nitric acid) and metal products (e.g., iron, steel and aluminum). Carbon emissions from the production processes of these industrial products (in addition to cement production) are also less frequently reported by current international carbon emission data sets. Here we estimated the carbon emissions resulting from the manufacturing of 5 major industrial products in China, given China's dominant position in industrial production in the world. Based on an investigation of China's specific production processes, we devised a methodology for calculating emission factors. The results indicate that China's total carbon emission from the production of alumina, plate glass, soda ash, ammonia and calcium carbide was 233 million tons in 2013, equivalent to the total CO2 emissions of Spain in 2013. The cumulative emissions from the manufacturing of these 5 products during the period 1990-2013 was approximately 2.5 Gt CO2, more than the annual total CO2 emissions of India. Thus, quantifying the emissions from industrial processes is critical for understanding the global carbon budget and developing a suitable climate policy. (C) 2015 The Author.

Abstract: China has proposed its ambitious cap targets of carbon emissions in both carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) and carbon scale (gross carbon emissions). Since mining sector is the foundation of the whole industrial production as well as a carbon intensive sector, it is critical to uncover the key driving factors on inducing corresponding carbon emissions so that appropriate mitigation policies can be raised. Under such a circumstance, this paper aims to fill such a research gap by employing a novel index decomposition method, namely, Generalized Divisia Index Method (GDIM), so that the driving factors of energy related carbon emissions changes in China's mining sector and its five sub-sectors over the period of 1999-2013 can be identified. In addition, a scenario analysis approach is applied in order to seek the feasible mitigation pathways on China's mining sector and its five sub-sectors. The results indicate that output scale effect is the primary contributor of the increase in carbon emissions of both mining sector and its five sub-sectors and energy use effect also plays a positive role, while carbon intensity effect contributes most to the decrease in carbon emissions. All sub-sectors have achieved the target of 45% carbon intensity reduction except the extraction industry of petroleum and natural gas. Nevertheless, more efforts should be made for the whole mining sector in order to achieve the 2030 peak target of carbon scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The optimum utilization of solar energy requires effective harvesting of both the direct and diffuse components of ground-reaching radiation. Although solar beams are typically key contributors to the total irradiance under cloudless conditions, the diffuse component becomes important especially in regions where clear skies are not dominant. Even if the cloud cover and cloud microphysics are known, it is not an easy task to estimate the diffuse irradiance at arbitrarily oriented sloped surfaces. This situation arises from the extreme difficulty in solving the radiative transfer equation in such a heterogeneous environment.
Models of Homogeneous Skies (MHS) with a set of discrete sky types are commonly applied in determining irradiance or illuminance. However, experimental data usually differ significantly from data predicted by MHS, for initially daylighting purposes where a simple sky luminance distribution is most useful. In this paper we show that the MHS error can be exceptionally large, especially for some cardinal directions. The use of MHS could also lead to misinterpretation of a momentary sky state if different sky types are required to accurately simulate irradiances on arbitrarily oriented surfaces. Nevertheless, use of multiple sky types at one moment in time has no theoretical basis and thus is generally unacceptable. Therefore, we have demonstrate that a new Unified Model of Radiance Patterns (UMRP) is more consistent with physical measurement and is generally applicable to all situations, including clear-, partly cloudy, and, overcast-sky conditions and, could accurately predict vertical irradiances or illuminances more accurately than MHS. UMRP implements heterogeneity of cloud systems and provides radiance or luminance distributions depending on the characteristic size of clouds, their albedo and their altitude. While the error in the irradiance computations is approximately 6% for UMRP, it can reach a value of 70% or even more in case of MHS. UMRP-based modeling of radiative fields is now simple using the UniSky Simulator, a heavily optimized multithreading application (publicly available at www.unisky.say.ski?lang=en&page=aplikacia). We expect the UMRP concept to be a new choice for modelers and PV systems engineers to predict solar energy more accurately under any meteorological conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from industrial sectors are increasing, particularly in the developing world where pursuing industrialization has been highly addressed. This calls for further studies to learn and share experiences for developing countries. In order to fill in such a research gap, this special issue focuses on examining the recent trend of industrial emissions in developing countries. Among the manuscripts submitted to the Special Issue, twelve papers have been accepted after review, covering assessment indicators, tools and methods, and policies. Key industrial sectors, including cement, lime, aluminum, coal, mining, glass, soda ash, etc, have been investigated. Valuable policy insights have been raised, including wide scale upgrading, replacement and deployment of best available technologies, integrated information platforms, cross-cutting technologies and measures, a shift to low carbon electricity, radical product innovations, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), demand on new and replacement products, systematic approaches and collaboration among different industries. These useful suggestions could be shared or learned by industrial policy makers or managers in the developing world so that the overall GHG emissions from their industrial sectors can be mitigated by considering the local realities.

Abstract: China is the world-leading primary aluminum production country, which contributed to over half of global production in 2014. Primary aluminum production is power-intensive, for which power generation has substantial impact on overall Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, we explore the impact of regional disparity of China's power generation system on GHG emissions for the sector of primary aluminum production. Our analysis reveals that the national GHG emissions factor (GEF) of China's primary aluminum production was 16.5 t CO(2)e/t Al ingot in 2013, with province-level GEFs ranging from 8.2 to 21.7 t CO(2)e/t AI ingot. There is a high coincidence of provinces with high aluminum productions and high GEFs. Total GHG emissions from China's primary aluminum production were 421 mt CO(2)e in 2013, approximately accounting for 4% of China's total GHG emissions. Under the 2020 scenario, GEF shows a 13.2% reduction compared to the 2013 level, but total GHG emissions will increase to 551 mt CO2e. Based on our analysis, we recommend that the government should further promote energy efficiency improvement, facilitate aluminum industry redistribution with low-carbon consideration, promote secondary aluminum production, and improve aluminum industry data reporting and disclosure.

Abstract: Thermal cooling systems are particularly attractive in locations supplied by district heating based on cogeneration heating plants (CHP). Moreover, solar thermal energy is a major renewable source for the provision of thermal energy, fulfilling demands for space heating, domestic hot water, process heat, and cooling. This energy source can be suitably used also in Nordic Countries.
The presented paper focuses on two configurations of a cooling solar-driven thermal system for an office building located in Finland. Dynamic simulation approach has been used through TRNSYS software. In particular, the configurations differ from the connection between the hot storage tank, the solar collectors and the chiller. Particularly, in the first configuration only the tank can supply the chiller (Case 1), while in the second, the chiller can be supplied either by the tank or the solar collectors directly (Case 2). System performance indexes, in case of district heating as main building heating supply system in winter and as auxiliary heating system for the chiller in summer, have been evaluated as a function of the tank and solar thermal field sizes.
Results show that Case 2 has better performance than Case 1, because of the versatility shown in summer. Particularly, when the solar irradiance is low, Case 2 solutions perform far better than Case 1 solutions,benefitting from the direct connection between the solar collectors and the chiller. This study has highlighted also the potential of this technology in cold climate areas supplied by means of DH based on CHP plants. Indeed, the adoption of such cooling technology, in addition to reduce both heating and cooling consumed energy and to shave summer electricity peaks, can potentially allow some CHP plants to operate also in summer, fulfilling the future energy networks aims: being able to provide electricity, heat and cooling energy.

Abstract: Using a mathematical programming model, we estimate the economic potential of biomass supply from crop residues in China at various exogenously-given biomass prices and identify the areas that are likely to produce crop residues. Our analysis indicates that China can potentially produce about 174.4-248.6 million dry metric tons of crop residues per year when biomass prices are larger than $100 per metric ton. Rice straw is expected to account for about 47% of total residue production across the different biomass prices and residue production scenarios that we considered. Corn stover and wheat straw can contribute 28% and 25%, respectively, to total biomass production in China. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Humidification of the membrane is very important in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), to maintain high ionic conductivity. At an elevated temperature, a large amount of thermal energy is required for humidification because of the exponentially increased saturation vapor pressure. In this study, the system efficiency of a PEMFC was evaluated by considering the heat required for preheating/humidification and compression work. Three-dimensional steady-state simulations were conducted using Fluent 14 to simulate the electrochemical reactions. The operating conditions were optimized using response surface methodology by considering both the fuel cell output and system efficiency. In addition, the effects of operating parameters such as the temperature, relative humidity, and stoichiometric ratio were investigated. The system efficiency can be improved more effectively by increasing relative humidity rather than increasing operating temperature because the ionic conductivity of the membrane was strongly influenced by the relative humidity.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, simple method for reducing external operating condition datasets to be used in multi-generation system optimization models. The method, called the Characteristic Operating Pattern (CHOP) method, is a visually-based aggregation method that clusters reference data based on parameter values rather than time of occurrence, thereby preserving important information on short-term relations between the relevant operating parameters. This is opposed to commonly used methods where data are averaged over chronological periods (months or years), and extreme conditions are hidden in the averaged values.
The CHOP method is tested in a case study where the operation of a fictive Danish combined heat and power plant is optimized over a historical 5-year period. The optimization model is solved using the full external operating condition dataset, a reduced dataset obtained using the CHOP method, a monthly averaged dataset, a yearly-averaged dataset, and a seasonal peak/off-peak averaged dataset. The economic result obtained using the CHOP-reduced dataset is significantly more accurate than that obtained using any of the other reduced datasets, while the calculation time is similar to those obtained using the monthly averaged and seasonal peak/off-peak averaged datasets. The outcomes of the study suggest that the CHOP method is advantageous compared to chronology-averaging methods in reducing external operating condition datasets to be used in the design optimization models of flexible multi-generation systems.

Abstract: Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a promising technology that provides a novel route for CO2 capture with low cost and energy penalty. Interaction between the oxygen carrier and sulfur contaminants in fuel is a significant concern in chemical looping systems, which will degrade the captured CO2 purity and even affect the reactivity of oxygen carrier. Experiments of a sulfur-containing synthesis gas (4000 ppm H2S, 25 vol.% H-2, 35 vol.% CO, and 39.6 vol.% CO2) as fuel and copper ore as oxygen carrier were performed by thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA-FTIR). The effects of reducing atmosphere, temperature and redox cycle number were studied. A weight gain was observed in all TGA experiments with 4000 ppm H2S synthesis gas as fuel, due to the sulfidation of the copper ore oxygen carrier. For the reaction of copper ore with H2S-containing synthesis gas, the main metal sulfide products were Cu2S and FeS, while the gaseous sulfur species were mainy SO2, COS, and CS2. H2S was easier to react with copper oxides than iron oxides. Moreover, the sulfidation of copper ore was further investigated in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor at 900 degrees C, using copper ore as oxygen carrier and synthesis gases with/without H2S as fuel. The results showed that the sulfidation of copper ore degraded its oxygen transport capicity and reactivity to some extent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Double-effect heat integration and mechanical heat pump technique are investigated for the extractive distillation process of the acetone-methanol minimum boiling azeotropic mixture with entrainer water and compared from the economical view by the total annual cost (TAC) and environmental aspect by CO2 emissions. Firstly, A novel optimal partial heat integration (OPHI) process is proposed and optimized through the minimization of a newly defined objective function called OF2 that describes the energy consumption used per product unit flow rate and allows comparison with the literature direct partial and full heat integration processes. We find that the minimum TAC is not achieved by the full heat integration process as intuition, but by the new OPHI process. Secondly, the vapour recompression (VRC) and bottom flash (BF) mechanical heat pump processes are evaluated with respect to energy and CO2 emissions. We proposed a new partial VRC and a new partial BF process in order to reduce the high initial capital cost of compressors. Overall the results show that compared to the conventional extractive distillation process the proposed OPHI process gives a 32.2% reduction in energy cost and a 24.4% saving in TAC while the full BF process has the best performance in environmental aspect (CO2 emissions reduce by 7.3 times).

Abstract: China is now the world's leading energy consumer and CO2 emitter; therefore, precise quantification of the CO2 emissions that occur in China is of serious concern. Although most studies focus on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production, the emissions from lime production is not well researched. Lime production is the second largest source of carbon emissions from industrial processes after cement production. This is the first study to present an analysis of CO2 emissions from China's lime production from 2001 to 2012, and we have estimated the process emissions (scope 1 direct emissions caused by the process), fossil fuel combustion emissions (scope 1 direct emissions caused by fossil fuel combustion), and scope 2 indirect emissions (CO2 emissions caused by electricity consumption) from China's lime industry. The estimations show that the process emissions increased rapidly from 88.79 million tonnes to 141.72 million tonnes from 2001 to 2012. In 2012, the scope 1 emissions from fossil fuel combustion were 56.55 million tonnes, whereas the scope 2 indirect emissions were 4.42 million tonnes. Additionally, we analysed the uncertainty of our estimations, and our analysis shows that the relative uncertainty of the emission factors and activities data falls between 2.83% and 3.34%.

Abstract: Integration of Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass with concentrated solar power thermal processing (CSP) for bio-oil production is a potential processing pathway for energy efficient generation of renewable biofuels. Solar HTL infrastructure avoids additional bolt-on components of conventional solar parabolic trough systems used for electricity production including heat transfer fluids, counter current heat exchangers, fluid transfer interconnectivity and electrical power control systems. The absence of such capital intensive additional equipment considerably reduces the production costs of solar HTL biofuels compared to electricity generation from conventional CSP power systems. An economic and market appraisal of variance and system economic resilience is presented. It is hypothesised that the combination of nutrient recycling with HTL/CSP unification has the potential for economically sustainable microalgae bio-oil production. A microalgae biofuel minimum fuel sales price of $1.23/kg has been modelled. Further experimental work would be able to validate this integrated model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper targets to evaluate the overall CO2 emissions from cement industry based on the detailed information of China's total 1574 cement enterprises in 2013. State-owned enterprises and large scale enterprises dominate the total CO2 emissions, accounting for 59.35% and 61.87% of the total emissions respectively. The process emission intensities of all enterprises ranged among 500-600 kg CO2/t clinker, while the energy emission intensities varied among different enterprises, with an average level of 348 kg CO2/t clinker and a standard deviation of 233 kg CO2/t clinker. The average CO2 emissions performance of China's cement enterprises (806 kg CO2/t clinker) is 35 kg CO2/t clinker lower than the global level in 2013. The CO2 emissions intensity of the best 20th clinker production, which is lower than the IEA's 2020 target, could be the entry threshold for future new enterprises and top runner bench mark for the existing enterprises. The Yangtze River Delta region is the most important hotspot of the cement CO2 emissions. Wuhu & Tongling are the hottest emission centers, with an average of 8288 ton of CO2 emissions per square kilometers. Ownership of cement enterprises should be carefully considered in the policy preparation. Favorable policies could focus on medium sized facilities and facilities in the ENDI type along the Silk Road Economic Belt. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study measured the industrial carbon productivity of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2012 and examined the space-time characteristics and the main factors of China's industrial carbon productivity using Moran's I index and spatial panel data models. The empirical results indicate that there is significant positive spatial dependence and clustering characteristics in China's province-level industrial carbon productivity. The spatial dependence may create biased estimated parameters in an ordinary least squares framework; according to the analysis of our spatial panel models, industrial energy efficiency, the opening degree, technological progress, and the industrial scale structure have significantly positive effects on industrial carbon productivity whereas per-capita GDP, the industrial energy consumption structure, and the industrial ownership structure exert a negative effect on industrial carbon productivity.

Abstract: A key aspect of greener network deployment is how to achieve sustainable growth of a telecommunications network, both in terms of operational and embodied energy. Hence, in this paper we investigate how the overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of a fast growing telecommunications network can be minimized. Due to the complexities in modeling the embodied energy of networks, this aspect of energy consumption has received limited attention by network operators. Here, we present the first model to evaluate the interdependencies of the four main contributing factors in managing the sustainable growth of a telecommunications network: (i) the network's operational energy consumption; (ii) the embodied energy of network equipment; (iii) network traffic growth; and (iv) the expected energy efficiency improvements in both the operational and embodied phases. Using Monte Carlo techniques with real network data, our results demonstrate that under the current trends in overall energy efficiency improvements the network embodied energy will account for over 40% of the total network energy in 2025 compared to 20% in 2015. Further, we find that the optimum equipment replacement cycle, which will result in the lowest total network life cycle energy, is directly dependent on the technological progress in energy efficiency improvements of both operational and embodied phases. Our model and analysis highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to better understand the interactions between network growth, technological progress, equipment replacement lifetime, energy consumption, and the resulting carbon footprint.

Abstract: Latent heat storage is a very efficient technique because of the high energy density of Phase Change Materials (PCM). However, these materials have low thermal conductivities which limit their use for industrial applications requesting a large power density. The purpose of this study is to present an experimental thermal energy storage using a phase change material associated with various configurations of conductive structures: finned exchangers, graphite powder and Expanded Natural Graphite (ENG) matrix. The experimental thermal conductivity enhancer setup consists of a heat exchanger tube. The outer annular portion of the exchanger is filled with the PCM. The Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (OHTC) between the fluid and the PCM is measured for each configuration. PCM embedded in an ENG matrix appears to be the best configuration with an OHTC of about 3000 W m(-2) K-1 and confirms the interest of such a storage device for industrial processes. A study of the thermal properties of this composite material is detailed. The measured thermal conductivity of the ENG/PCM composite is about 100 times greater than the conductivity of the PCM alone. A numerical model for the simulation of the heat transfer within such a material is developed by an enthalpy method in an axisymmetric geometry. It is used for the identification of the thermal contact resistance between the tube and the composite material. The numerical simulations are also compared to the experimental results and used to investigate the impact of the thermal contact resistance on the heat transfer process of the LHTS system.

Abstract: Fuel cell gas turbine hybrids present significant challenges in terms of system control because of the coupling of different time-scale phenomena. Hence, the importance of studying the integrated system dynamics is critical. With the aim of safe operability and efficiency optimization, the cold air bypass valve was considered an important actuator since it affects several key parameters and can be very effective in controlling compressor surge. Two different tests were conducted using a cyber-physical approach. The Hybrid Performance (HyPer) facility couples gas turbine equipment with a cyber physical solid oxide fuel cell in which the hardware is driven by a numerical fuel cell model operating in real time. The tests were performed moving the cold air valve from the nominal position of 40% with a step of 15% up and down, while the system was in open loop, i.e. no control on turbine speed or inlet temperature. The effect of the valve change on the system was analyzed and transfer functions were developed for several important variables such as cathode mass flow, total pressure drop and surge margin. Transfer functions can show the response time of different system variables, and are used to characterize the dynamic response of the integrated system. Opening the valve resulted in an immediate positive impact on pressure drop and surge margin. A valve change also significantly affected fuel cell temperature, demonstrating that the cold air bypass can be used for thermal management of the cell. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Fossil fuel is crucial to the development of modern society. The major types of fossil fuel are coal, crude oil and natural gas. The uneven distribution of the production and consumption of fossil fuel makes the fossil fuel flows between countries by international trade. This study aims to quantitatively analyse the features and evolution of the international trade of fossil fuel by complex network and emergy. We transform the trade quantity of coal, crude oil and natural gas into emergy by transformity and the sum of the three emergies is the emergy of fossil fuel. The complex network models of the integrated fossil fuel trade as well as the trade of coal, crude oil and natural gas are built up based on the value of emergy. We analyse the trade relationships, trade quantity, trade density, and hierarchy structure of the networks.
We find that the number of trade relationships and the trade quantities follow the power law distribution; countries with many export relationships tend to have many import relationships; the centralization of trade quantity is becoming more intense for fossil fuel, crude oil and coal, but less intense for natural gas; the pattern of top relationships is diversified; the trade density of fossil fuel is increasing; and countries with more than 20 trade relationships tend to have a hierarchy structure. Our findings implicate that as the hierarchy structure is becoming more ordered, the statuses of the countries are clearer, and thus it is easier for policy makers to identify the roles of their own countries or the roles of other countries. Coal is the "cheapest" fuel measuring by "energy cost" and is the most widely traded type of fossil fuel. When two countries exchange fossil fuel and money in the international trade, they should look further into the energy cost of them and reconsider the effectiveness of the trade. Our study can also reveal the trade strategy of the countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Even though industry consumes nearly half of total energy production, the relative share of total energy consumption related to heating and operating buildings is growing constantly. The motivation for this study was to reveal the differences in electricity use and district heating consumption in school buildings of various ages during the working day and also during the night when human-based consumption is low. The overall aim of this study is to compare the energy (electricity and heating) consumption of six school buildings in Kuopio, Eastern Finland. The selected school buildings were built in different decades, and their ventilation and building automation systems are also inconsistent. The hourly energy consumption data was received from Kuopion Energia, the local energy supply company. In this paper, the results of data analysis on the energy consumption in these school buildings are presented. Preliminary results show that, generally speaking, new school buildings are more energy-efficient than older ones. However, concerning energy efficiency, two very new schools were exceptional because ventilation was on day and night in order to dry the building materials in the constructions. The novelty of this study is that it makes use of hourly smart metering consumption data on electricity and district heating, using modern computational methods to analyse complex multivariate data in order to increase knowledge of the buildings' consumption profiles and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Using renewable energy sources is an efficient alternative to supply the electrical load of stand-alone remote areas. The main motivation of this paper is to optimize the size of a biomass-based PV power plant to supply the electrical power of agricultural wells located in Bardsir, Kerman, Iran. In an off-grid PV power plant, there must be a backup system to supply the demanded load in deficit conditions. Biomass energy generation systems could be complementary taking into account their different properties in reliability. As a result, the combination of PV and biomass systems could be an effective way to make a reliable and cost-effective hybrid energy system. In the proposed hybrid system, the area of the PV system and the size of the engine-generator of the biomass system are optimized for minimizing the total net present cost (TNPC) of the system during its lifetime. The reliability of the designed system is met by considering the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) concept. For the investigated region, the obtained results indicate that the PV/biomass generation system is more promising than a single PV system or a single biomass system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Emerging emission-to-liquid (eTL) technologies that produce liquid fuels from CO2 are a possible solution for both the global issues of greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel depletion. Among those technologies, CO2 hydrogenation and high-temperature CO2 electrolysis are two promising options suitable for large-scale applications. In this study, two CO2-to-methanol conversion processes, i.e., production of methanol by CO2 hydrogenation and production of methanol based on high-temperature CO2 electrolysis, are simulated using Aspen HYSYS. With Aspen Energy Analyzer, heat exchanger networks are optimized and minimal energy requirements are determined for the two different processes. The two processes are compared in terms of energy requirement and climate impact. It is found that the methanol production based on CO2 electrolysis has an energy efficiency of 41%, almost double that of the CO2 hydrogenation process provided that the required hydrogen is sourced from water electrolysis. The hydrogenation process produces more CO2 when fossil fuel energy sources are used, but can result in more negative CO2 emissions with renewable energies. The study reveals that both of the eTL processes can outperform the conventional fossil-fuel-based methanol production process in climate impacts as long as the renewable energy sources are implemented.

Abstract: Demand elasticity for petrol or diesel is an important policy parameter, both from energy security and global warming perspective. Despite an abundance of literature on petrol demand, there are few studies on diesel demand, and even fewer on demand by different vehicle types. This paper aims to model diesel demand for different freight duty vehicle types (e.g. heavy vs. light goods vehicles and rigid vs. articulated trucks) in the UK. We argue that the switch to diesel from petrol engines in the light vehicles sectors could have biased earlier petrol or diesel demand elasticities in Europe, and show that it was indeed the case for the light goods vehicle sector. Results show that both light and heavy goods vehicles have similar income elasticities, although within the heavy duty sector, articulated trucks are more elastic than rigid trucks. Overall, heavy goods vehicles were responsive to fuel prices, but light goods vehicles were not. Within the heavy duty sector, rigid trucks showed statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks did not respond to changes in fuel, prices. Our results show that price-based policies to curb fuel consumption from the light or heavy goods vehicles are unlikely to be effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study considers environmental impacts and the power production potential of a number of coastally attached tidal lagoons, proposed along the North Wales coast, UK. Initially, the impoundment shape, turbine and sluice gate locations were modified according to the regional bathymetric data. A refined 0-Dimensional approach was implemented to optimise the lagoon operation, based on given turbine and sluice gate specifications. In turn, a two-dimensional numerical model, based on an unstructured triangular mesh, has been refined to simulate the hydrodynamic processes, initially without and subsequently in the presence of the lagoons. The hydrodynamic model adopts a TVD finite volume method to solve the 2D shallow water equations, based on a second-order accurate spatial and temporal numerical scheme. An encouraging performance is apparent in reproducing the established conditions encountered in the region through comparisons against available data. The incorporation of tidal lagoons in the model appears to have a considerable effect on the flow structure in the region, by inducing high velocity accelerations near the sluices and turbines, depending on the stage of the tidal cycle. Considering a two-way generation regime, it is outlined that the loss of intertidal regions can be minimised, which is a major source of concern with regards to the environmental impact of such schemes through an ebb generation operation. Particular focus is directed towards the comparisons between the 0-D and 2-D modelling results, an aspect which has not been reported previously. Predictions of the models diverge as the scale of the lagoon project increases, but it is highlighted that the 0-D methodology can be utilised for the optimisation of the processes in the initial stages of design before proceeding to more sophisticated numerical model simulations.

Abstract: This study focused on the primary breakup of spray at the initial injector opening stage at injection to atmospheric conditions. A real-time mass flow rate instrument was first used to study the injection characteristics at the injector opening stage. A long distance microscope together with an ultrahigh speed CCD camera was then employed to study the primary breakup of diesel spray by photography technique with the help of backlighting. The mechanism of the formation of the mushroom shaped spray head was discussed and the laminar flow regime was expected to be the main reason for the resultant shape. During the initial spray stage, the mushroom spray head penetrated almost linearly with respect to time. The quantification of the fuel mass/spray area ratio suggested that the dispersion of the spray is greatly improved within a very short time, which is assumed to be caused by the further opening of injector.

Abstract: This study investigated the effect of an internal reflector (IR) on the productivity of a single-slope solar still (during the summer and winter) experimentally and theoretically. A mathematical model was presented which took into account the effect of all walls (north, south, west and east) of the still on the amount of received solar radiation to brine, and the model was validated with the experimental data. The model can calculate the yield of the still with and without IR on various walls. The results show that the simultaneous use of IR on front and side walls enhances the still's efficiency by 18%. However, installation of an IR on the back wall can increase the annual efficiency by 22%. The installation of IRs on all walls in comparison to a still without IR can increase the distillate production at winter, summer and the entire year by 65%, 22% and 34%, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of cloud factor on the installation of IRs on all walls was examined, and the results indicate that the increasing the cloud factor decreases the influence of IRs significantly.

Abstract: The goal for performing heat exchanger network (HEN) retrofit is not only to reduce utility consumption but to ensure that the retrofit is economically viable. The problem of using heat transfer enhancement for retrofit lies with the uncertainty of the best location in which to apply enhancement, the augmentation level and dealing with downstream effects after enhancement is conducted.
To solve these problems, a systematic methodology is proposed. The first step in this methodology is the identification of candidate heat exchangers. In the second step, two methods, sensitivity analysis and an area ratio approach are compared for the identification of the best candidate heat exchangers to enhance. Heat transfer enhancement is then performed on the best candidate heat exchanger and, a non-linear optimisation based model is used to deal with the downstream effects after enhancement, subject to meeting set constraints on the HEN, such as the stream target temperatures and heat transfer area. Following this approach, the problems posed by the use of enhancement for retrofit can be addressed in a simple and computationally inexpensive manner.
Heat transfer enhancement is an attractive option for HEN retrofit as it can provide energy saving without the need for topology modifications and additional heat transfer area with an added benefit of reduced implementation time, as modifications can be carried out during normal shutdown periods.

Abstract: Coal gasification to produce synthesis gas by chemical looping was investigated with two oxygen carriers, barium ferrite (BaFe2O4) and calcium ferrite (CaFe2O4). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and fixed-bed flow reactor data indicated that a solid-solid interaction occurred between oxygen carriers and coal to produce synthesis gas. Both thermodynamic analysis and experimental data indicated that BaFe2O4 and CaFe2O4 have high reactivity with coal but have a low reactivity with synthesis gas, which makes them very attractive for the coal gasification process. Adding steam increased the production of hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO), but carbon dioxide (CO2) remained low because these oxygen carriers have minimal reactivity with H-2 and CO. Therefore, the combined steam-oxygen carrier produced the highest quantity of synthesis gas. It appeared that neither the water-gas shift reaction nor the water splitting reaction promoted additional H-2 formation with the oxygen carriers when steam was present. Wyodak coal, which is a sub-bituminous coal, had the best gasification yield with oxygen carrier-steam while Illinois #6 coal had the lowest. The rate of gasification and selectivity for synthesis gas production was significantly higher when these oxygen carriers were present during steam gasification of coal. The rates and synthesis gas yields during the temperature ramps of coal-steam with oxygen carriers were better than with gaseous oxygen. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study examined the interaction between climatic variability and residential electricity consumption in a Southeast US state. Residential electricity consumers were surveyed to better understand how to diffuse positive attitudes and behaviors related to energy efficiency (EE) into households. The study found that 16.8% of the variability in residential electricity consumption for heating applications was explained by indirect EE costs. 36.6% of the variability in residential electricity consumption for cooling applications was explained by indirect EE costs and cooling degree days (CDD). A survey of 2450 residential electricity consumers was analyzed using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Significant findings suggest that those residents are aware of utility EE programs are more likely to participate, view utility company motives more favorably, to support governmental subsidies for EE programs, and to support the use of clean energy by utility companies.

Abstract: This paper describes an approach for thermodynamically consistent modeling of perovskite redox cycles for thermochemical energy storage and chemical-looping combustion applications. Prior modeling approaches to perovskite redox processes do not provide exact closure of the energy balance or thermodynamic consistency for calculating enthalpies and exergies of multiphase solid-gas flows needed in system-level process analysis. The approach documented here implements solid species thermodynamic functions derived from the enthalpies and entropies of reactions including oxidation/reduction and additional point defect reactions. The approach is fundamentally different than the typical approach of using partial molar properties to perform process flow modeling. Coupling process flow modeling to point defect reactions captures complex trends observed for oxygen non-stoichiometry and varying specific heat capacities during reduction and oxidation, maintains thermodynamic consistency between the solid and gas phase species, and thereby enables modeling of flow conservation equations for both the solid and gas phases. The thermodynamic model is fit to reported measurements for a highly reducible perovskite, strontium-doped calcium manganite (Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-delta), and then demonstrated through equilibrium thermodynamic calculations in process energy and exergy balances. Energetic and exergetic analyses for Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-delta redox cycles are presented for thermochemical energy storage and chemical-looping combustion systems where component exergy destructions are calculated. The model predicts roundtrip thermochemical energy storage efficiencies with Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-delta as high as 89% and 63% by first and second law analyses, respectively. The chemical-looping combustion of methane using Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-delta indicates first and second law efficiencies up to 90% and 66%, respectively. The modeling approach is used to explore trends in performance with operating conditions for both redox cycles thereby enabling new insight regarding design trade-offs for these emerging energy storage and conversion cycles.

Abstract: An early design of oxygen transport membranes (OTM) developed and fabricated by Praxair have been tested at 850-900 degrees C in an experimental coal gasifier using a blend of Illinois and Powder River Basin (PRB) coals. Oxygen flux was measured and found to be stable over approximately 80 h of gasifier operation. Study of interactions between the OTM and coal ash and gas phase impurities indicated that the OTM components remain chemically and structurally stable against coal ash and do not show any indication of solid or liquid (slagging) compound formation. The structure of the active fuel oxidation layer in the OTM exposed to the coal gas also remained stable and no interactions between the consecutive layers (porous support/fuel oxidation layer/gas separation layer/oxygen incorporation layer) were identified in the tested OTM system.

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the power sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) with the latest data and applies a retrospective modeling approach for its power market under (i) a cost minimization and (ii) an environmental impact minimization objective for the period 2003-2013 with domestic and international fuel prices. For the analysis an enhanced version of Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS) is utilized. Implemented model improvements include (a) temperature adjustments as the temperature difference between winter and summer of 20-30 degrees C is common almost all over the world and has significant impact on power generation efficiency, (b) a multi-objective target function considering both costs and emissions to create a Pareto frontier, and (c) emissions are assessed with the 'quality enhanced life days' (QELD) indicator to consider global (e.g. carbon dioxide) and local emissions (e.g. NOx) simultaneously. Results show that the biggest reductions in emissions can be reached by considering international fuel prices. While the amount of new technology is quite similar within the minimize emission cases, the installed type of technology differs significantly within the minimize cost cases: cost minimization with international fuel prices is forcing Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT or CC) plants and Steam Turbine (ST) plants whereas when considering domestic fuel prices, the share of inefficient Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT or GT) plants is 100%. Focusing on emission reduction within the international fuel price scenario a 19% cost increase results in 43% emission reductions while a 33% cost increase reduces emissions by 60%. Notably, an emission reduction of 50% can be reached independently of fuel pricing when the weight of emission criterion is 95% or higher within the enhanced OSeMOSYS model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Sieving of Dutch raw sewage over a 350 mu m screen, produces a cake layer called fine sieved fraction (FSF), an energy-rich material that contains mainly cellulosic fibers originating from toilet paper. The FSF biomethane potential (BMP) was studied under both mesophilic (35 degrees C) and thermophilic (55 degrees C) conditions, whereas the stability of the fed-batch digesters at both 35 degrees C and 55 degrees C was researched by varying the inoculum to substrate ratios (R-I/S: 0.5-15). Results clearly showed advantages of thermophilic conditions over mesophilic conditions at all tested R-I/S. Stable digestion was even possible at an R-I/S of 0.5 at 55 degrees C. Following the results of the batch tests, a compact high loaded thermophilic digester for on-site energy recovery from FSF was proposed. Based on the results of the study, high biogas production rates at high organic loading rates (OLRs) were predicted. In the energy balance calculations, surplus heat production from combined heat and power (CHP) was utilized to dry the digestate sludge before transportation to an incineration plant or for use in pyrolysis or gasification processes. Overall results showed the potential of generating 46% of the required energy for wastewater treatment via high rate FSF digestion and subsequent conversion of the bio-methane into electricity and heat. The net recoverable energy from fine sieving, anaerobic digestion of FSF, dewatering of digestate sludge and drying of dewatered digestate sludge amounted 287 MI/ton FSF and 237 kW h electric/ton FSF at 23% TS.

Abstract: This study reviews technical papers on transport and performance modeling of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells during the past few years. The PEM fuel cell is a promising alternative power source for various applications in stationary power plants, portable power device, and vehicles. PEM fuel cells provide low operating temperatures and high-energy efficiency with zero emissions. A PEM fuel cell is a multiple distinct parts device and a series of mass, momentum and energy transport through gas channels, electric current transport through membrane electrode assembly and electrochemical reactions at the triple-phase boundaries. These transport processes play crucial roles to determine electrochemical reactions and cell performance, so studies on the transport and performance modeling have been done deeply. This review shows how these modeling studies offer valid findings for transport and performance modeling of PEM fuel cells and recommendations that can be applied in enhancing transport processes for improving the cell performance.

Abstract: Integration of renewable energy resources into the power grid is essential in achieving the envisioned sustainable energy future. Stochasticity and intermittency characteristics of renewable energies, however, present challenges for integrating these resources into the existing grid in a large scale. Reliable renewable energy integration is facilitated by accurate wind forecasts. In this paper, we propose a novel wind speed forecasting method which first utilizes Wavelet Transform (WT) for decomposition of the wind speed data into more stationary components and then uses a spatio-temporal model on each sub series for incorporating both temporal and spatial information. The proposed spatio-temporal forecasting approach on each sub-series is based on the assumption that there usually exists an intrinsic low dimensional structure between time series data in a collection of meteorological stations. Our approach is inspired by Compressive Sensing (CS) and structured-sparse recovery algorithms. Based on detailed case studies, we show that the proposed approach based on exploiting the sparsity of correlations between a large set of meteorological stations and decomposing time series for higher-accuracy forecasts considerably improve the short-term forecasts compared to the temporal and spatio-temporal benchmark methods.

Abstract: Nowadays, many performing insulation materials are available on the market. However, their expected thermal performance can be affected by many sources of uncertainty due to random errors that can occur during the manufacturing and the measurement processes. In addition, the thermal performance is strongly affected by another source of uncertainty related to the insulation laying process. As a matter of fact, defects in insulation panels are introduced either for practical reasons or due to a lack of rigor of workers. These errors are still not yet properly considered for simulation, although they result in significant heat losses.
This work aims at investigating the impact of four common workmanship errors on the thermal performance of insulation panels. A coupling between experimental measurements and finite element modeling allows us to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of insulations in presence of defects. The uncertainty analysis allows us to quantify the dispersion of insulation conductivity according to different types and sizes of defects, showing that flexible materials seem to be more affected by the defects.
For simulation purpose, analytical models are proposed to assess the effective thermal conductivity in terms of size and type of defects. The numerical application to insulated wall shows the impact of each defect on the energy consumption, where deep grooves and openings are found to be strongly affecting the insulation performance.

Abstract: Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) systems, if improperly designed may lead to overheating or overcooling of the ground. Good designs ensure properly balanced energy storage through adequately sizing ground-loops. Hybrid systems combine conventional Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) with GSHPs in order to significantly reduce the high installation costs of GSHPs. The hybrid systems are designed in such a way that GSHPs provide the base building energy demands while the conventional HVAC is used only during the peak hours. In general, all buildings can be divided into two main categories: cooling dominant and heating dominant. If a building is cooling dominant, ground temperature increases with time and in heating dominant cases it decreases. A severe ground temperature increase/decrease is referred to as 'ground fouling' because it can render the GSHP inoperable, as temperature differences are required to maintain controlled heat flow. This paper compares long-term operation of hybrid and non-hybrid GSHP systems in order to investigate the effectiveness of hybridization at alleviating 'ground fouling'. A homespun 2D finite-volume model is proposed to study heat transfer in ground coupled heat pump systems and is verified against an analytical solution as well as experimental data. Through simulation of different building types, it is demonstrated that hybridization has potential to reduce 'ground fouling' but only in limited cases for which a large portion of the energy demands is being met by the conventional HVAC.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) systems allow concentrated solar power (CSP) producers to participate in a day-ahead market. Therefore, the optimal power scheduling problem can be posed, whose objective is the maximization of profits derived from electricity sales. The daily generation schedule has to be offered in advance, usually the previous day before a certain time, thus an electricity price and weather forecast must be carried out. This paper proposes a model-based predictive control (MPC) approach for optimal scheduling in CSP plants. This approach has a dual purpose: (1) the periodic update of the generation schedule to track the schedule that has been committed to by means of the most recent electricity price and weather forecast and information about the plant state and (2) the generation of the optimal schedule for the next day. As these two tasks are related, they are performed simultaneously. Therefore, the MPC sliding window is composed of a first time interval to track the committed schedule and a second time interval to generate the next schedule for the following hours. This is then offered as the generation schedule for the next day at the appropriate time. The proposed approach is applied, in a simulation context, to a 50 MW parabolic trough collector-based CSP plant with molten-salt-based TES. The chosen criterion to track the committed schedule is the even distribution of the possible generation error within the first interval. A case-study with overestimated initial DNI forecast is undertaken. The results show that the MPC control with short-term DNI forecast significantly improves the above-mentioned objective and allows for a reduction of the deviation from the scheduled generation, when compared with the case without short-term DNI forecast.

Abstract: Energy consumption control in energy intensive companies is always more considered as a critical activity to continuously improve energy performance. It undoubtedly requires a huge effort in data gathering and analysis, and the amount of these data together with the scarceness of human resources devoted to Energy Management activities who could maintain and update the analyses' output are often the main barriers to its diffusion in companies. Advanced tools such as software based on machine learning techniques are therefore the key to overcome these barriers and allow an easy but accurate control. This type of systems is able to solve complex problems obtaining reliable results over time, but not to understand when the reliability of the results is declining (a common situation considering energy using systems, often undergoing structural changes) and to automatically adapt itself using a limited amount of training data, so that a completely automatic application is not yet available and the automatic energy consumption control using intelligent systems is still a challenge.
This paper presents a whole new approach to energy consumption control, proposing a methodology based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and aimed at creating an automatic energy consumption control system.
First of all, three different structures of neural networks are proposed and trained using a huge amount of data. Three different performance indicators are then used to identify the most suitable structure, which is implemented to create an energy consumption control tool. In addition, considering that huge amount of data are not always available in practice, a method to identify the minimum period of data collection to obtain reliable results and the maximum period of usability is described. The general purpose of the work is to allow the automatic utilization of this kind of tools, so a method to identify a lack of accuracy in the model and two different retraining methods are proposed and compared (Mobile Training and Growing Training).
The whole approach is eventually applied to the case study of a tertiary building in Rome (Italy). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Despite the long-term benefit of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to customers and environment, the initial cost and limited driving range present significant barriers for wide spread commercialization. The integration of multi-speed transmissions to BEVs' powertrain systems in place of fixed ratio reduction transmissions is considered as a feasible method to improve powertrain efficiency and extend limited driving range for a fixed battery size. The aim of this paper is to enable the researchers or BEV manufacturers, especially for transmission systems, to estimate whether their products are worthwhile for the customer in terms of the price/performance relationship of others' design solutions. To do so a generic battery electric vehicle is modelled in Matlab/Simulink (R) to predict motor efficiency and energy consumption for single reduction, two speeds Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) and simplified Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) equipped battery electric vehicles. A credible conclusion is gained, through experimental validation of single speed and two speeds DCT scenarios and reasonable assumptions to support the CVT scenario, that both two speeds DCT and simplified CVT improve the overall powertrain efficiency, save battery energy and reduce customer costs. However, each of the configurations has unique cost and energy consumption related trade-offs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A minimum balance of plant (BOP) is desired for an open-cathode high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (HTPEM) fuel cell to ensure low parasitic losses and a compact design. The advantage of an open-cathode system is the elimination of the coolant plate and incorporation of a blower for oxidant and coolant supply, which reduces the overall size of the stack, power losses, and results in a lower system volume. In the present study, we present unique designs for an open-cathode system which offers uniform temperature distribution with a minimum temperature gradient and a uniform flow distribution through each cell. Design studies were carried out to increase power density. An experimental and simulation approach was carried out to design the novel open-cathode system. Two unique parallel serpentine flow designs were developed to yield a low pressure drop and uniform flow distribution, one without pins and another with pins. A five-cell stack was fabricated in the lab based on the new design. Performance and flow distribution studies revealed better performance, uniform flow distribution, and a reduced temperature gradient across the stack; improving overall system efficiency.

Abstract: The simulation model is the key point for obtaining an operation strategy because of the complexity of the distributed CCHP system. However, simplified simulation models are currently employed to formulate a system operation strategy in most studies. To investigate whether the simulation model accuracy will influence the operation cost substantially, several detailed simulation models are proposed in this paper. An analysis and a comparison are performed on operation cost by testing the simplified simulation model and the detailed simulation model, respectively. The results indicate that the operation cost obtained by the detailed model is larger than the simplified model. However, the detailed model performs better in terms of the rationality of the operation strategy. To investigate further the performance of the two models in guiding actual system operation, a case study is conducted. The results indicate that 2240 (sic)/day, accounting for 2.5% of the total daily cost, is reduced when the detailed model is used to formulate the operation strategy, demonstrating that the detailed model is superior to the simplified model when the economy and rationality of the optimal operation strategy are considered.

Abstract: This paper deals with a novel signal-based method for fault diagnosis of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Thanks to an in-lab test bench used for the experimental tests, various parameters can be recorded as electrical or fluidic measurements. The chosen input signal for the diagnosis uses no additional expensive and no intrusive sensors specifically dedicated for the diagnosis task. It uses insofar only the already existing sensors on the system. This paper focuses on the detection and identification of a high air stoichiometry (HAS) fault. The wavelet transform (WT) and more precisely the energy contained in each detail of the wavelet decomposition is used to diagnose quickly an oversupply of air to the fuel cell system. Finally, some experimental results are presented according to different input signals, in order to prove the efficiency of the patented method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the past few decades, extensive research has been conducted to develop operation and control strategy for smart buildings with the purpose of reducing energy consumption. Besides studying on single building, it is envisioned that the next generation buildings can freely connect with one another to share energy and exchange information in the context of smart grid. It was demonstrated that a network of connected buildings (aka building clusters) can significantly reduce primary energy consumption, improve environmental sustainability and building's resilience capability. However, an analytic tool to determine which type of buildings should form a cluster and what is the impact of building clusters' heterogeneity based on energy profile to the energy performance of building clusters is missing. To bridge these research gaps, we propose a self-organizing map clustering algorithm to divide multiple buildings to different clusters based on their energy profiles, and a homogeneity index to evaluate the heterogeneity of different building clusters configurations. In addition, a bi-level distributed decision model is developed to study the energy sharing in the building clusters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm and decision model, we employ a dataset including monthly energy. consumption data for 30 buildings where the data is collected every 15 min. It is demonstrated that the proposed decision model can achieve at least 13% cost savings for building clusters. The results show that the heterogeneity of energy profile is an important factor to select battery and renewable energy source for building clusters, and the shared battery and renewable energy are preferred for more heterogeneous building clusters.

Abstract: Accuracy of online measurement data is usually not satisfactory for coal-fired power plants due to constraints of measurement techniques. Data reconciliation can help to improve the accuracy of online measurement with no extra requirements on equipment upgrading. Traditionally, data reconciliation is applied to a sub-system of a coal-fired power plant, for instance, mass balance of a steam turbine system. In this work, we present a systematic approach where data reconciliation is applied to the overall thermal system of a real-life steam turbine power plant. Improvement of data accuracy is obtained via the proposed approach compared with sub-system studies. Optimization of system selection and configuration of a data reconciliation problem is analyzed. Results show that uncertainty of on-line measured data can be reduced by up to 50% in a 1000 MW ultra-supercritical coal-fired steam turbine power plant compared with previous studies.

Abstract: An experimental investigation was made on a downsized Euro 5 turbocharged diesel engine managing high/low pressure EGR systems and the variable nozzle turbine, aiming at major reductions in NOX emissions while enhancing fuel consumption in comparison with reference configuration. Three part load engine operating conditions were chosen at low and medium speed levels, applying different strategies to a number of control variables (relative air-fuel ratio, VNT opening degree/intake pressure, valves position in low pressure EGR circuit), thus exploring the whole range of high/low pressure EGR proportion. In suitable operating modes of tested conditions, NOX emissions were reduced up to 58-66%. Brake specific fuel consumption decreased around 5-9.5% at low speed/load, 1.7-3.3% in the intermediate condition while no advantages were achieved in the third working point. The activation of low pressure loop confirmed to be beneficial for turbocharger performance, rising its rotational speed thus granting for a better transient response, while increase in soot emissions ranged in a wide interval. For each condition, optimal operating modes were identified, with the relevant EGR proportion. A prevailing contribution from the long route circuit was generally requested, up to the exclusion of short route loop at higher level of speed and load. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ambient winds are generally unfavorable to the thermo-flow performances of air-cooled condensers in power plants. More emphases are placed to weaken the negative effects of ambient winds, but no layout alternative of air-cooled condensers is considered. In this work, a novel vertical arrangement of air-cooled condensers is proposed on the basis of a 2 x 600 MW direct dry cooling power plant, which can weaken the adverse wind effects and utilize the wind power to improve the cooling capacity of air-cooled condensers. By means of the CFD simulation and experimental validation, the flow and temperature fields of cooling air for the vertically arranged air-cooled condensers at ambient winds are obtained. The mass flow rate, inlet air temperature and turbine back pressure are computed and compared with the traditional air-cooled condensers. The results show that the flow rate of the novel air-cooled condensers increases conspicuously compared with the current ones both in the absence and presence of winds. In the wind directions of 60 and 90, the off-axis flow distortions of axial flow fans are greatly weakened and the average inlet air temperature of the novel air-cooled condensers is reduced and almost equals the ambient temperature. The thermo-flow performances of the air-cooled condensers are improved, thus the turbine back pressure is reduced by the novel layout of air-cooled condensers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: As a relatively clean energy, natural gas will be increasingly in demand to meet short-term low-carbon targets. The gap between the demand and supply of natural gas will be increasingly scrutinized, which highlights the significance of natural gas supply security. Considering the extensive connections among various aspects related to natural gas supply and the complex interactions behind these connections, ecological network analysis was applied to simulate the natural gas supply system in China and systematically measure its overall security level. Network Information Analysis, Structural Analysis, and Utility Analysis were conducted. It is found that the Chinese natural gas supply security increased during 2000-2011. In terms of the influence of different compartments on the whole natural gas supply system, in order from the largest to smallest influence they are: supply sources, consumption sector, refining, and reserve sectors. And the relationships among compartments became stronger in the later stage than that in the earlier stage of the study period. Suggestions on improving China's natural gas supply security were proposed based on the results and further scenario analysis. The network model developed herein is a new perspective for natural gas supply security assessment, which can be used as guidance for policy making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to investigate and obtain a fundamental understanding of the effect of dilution strategies and direct injection ratios on the stratified flame ignition (SFI) hybrid combustion. The combination of port fuel injection (PFI) and direct injection (DI) was used to form the homogeneous lean/diluted mixture and stratified charge respectively. Studies were carried out on effects of dilution strategies with different combinations of fuel/air equivalence ratio (phi(air)) and fuel/dilution equivalence ratio (phi(dilution)) with negative valve overlap (NVO). Compared to the stoichiometric SFI hybrid combustion, the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion optimizes the early flame propagation process because of the avoidance of over-rich mixture around spark plug. In order to explore the potential of SFI hybrid combustion under a high compression ratio (14:1) operation, the lean boosted dilution strategy with additional intake air and internal residual gas was proposed to address the trade-off between indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and maximum pressure rise rate (PRRmax) in air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion. Furthermore, the effect of direct injection ratio (r(DI)) was investigated as a means to optimize the fuel/air equivalence ratio distribution as well as the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion performance. It is found that the optimal SFI hybrid combustion with r(DI) of 0.16 can be used to both achieve higher IMEP for a given amount of fuel and moderate the rate of heat release. Finally, three different combustion regimes, including pure flame propagation zone, hybrid combustion zone and pure auto-ignition zone, are proposed to understand the effect of typical fuel/air equivalence ratio distribution patterns on the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion characteristics and performances. In order to obtain optimal hybrid combustion with high IMEP and low PRRmax, the in-cylinder stratified mixture should avoid over-rich condition around spark plug and over-lean condition at outer region. In addition, the internal residual gas in the dilution strategy should be carefully controlled to maintain sufficient thermal condition and ensure the stable auto-ignition of the lean mixture at outer region.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the possibility of converting a public building from inefficient energy consumer into a net-zero energy building (NZEB). This task is achieved through cost effective energy efficient measures (EEMs) and integration of solar energy systems. Three scenarios that utilize the same roof area are proposed to convert the building into NZEB. The first two scenarios use only PV system with the second scenario that incorporates replacing current chillers with more efficient chillers while the third scenario combines both PV and solar cooling systems. The first scenario attains NZEB on annual basis only whereas the other scenarios achieve NZEB on both annual and monthly basis. The second scenario has distinct advantages over other scenarios with respect to energy saving, interaction with energy grids and economic consideration.
Both implemented and proposed EEMs result in about 1480 MW h saving of the building consumption and about 1021 ton avoided CO2 emission annually with payback periods ranging from half to 3 years for the considered measures. Annual avoided CO2 emission of about 748 ton is achieved for first or second scenario and about 848 ton for third scenario with payback periods 14.1,11.8 and 15 years for the 3 considered scenarios, respectively.

Abstract: This paper provides a systematic approach for quantifying the influence of building size, construction category, climate, occupancy schedule, setpoint, and deadband on HVAC energy consumption in office buildings. Simulating the DOE reference office buildings of three sizes and three construction categories in all United States climate zones, using the EnergyPlus, we conducted several N-way ANOVA analyses to study the interrelationships between setpoints, deadbands and several building related and environment related factors. In summary, daily optimal deadband selection of 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 K would result in an average energy savings of-70.0%, -34.9%, -13.7%, 9.6%, 16.4%, and 21.2%, respectively, compared to baseline deadline of 3 K. Selecting the daily optimal setpoint in the range of 22.5 +/- 1 degrees C, 22.5 +/- 2 degrees C, and 22.5 +/- 3 degrees C would result in an average savings of 7.5%, 12.7%, and 16.4%, respectively, compared to the baseline setpoint of 22.5 degrees C. Additionally, we found that when the outdoor temperature is within -20 to 30 degrees C, the optimal setpoint depends on the building size. We also observed a range of outdoor temperatures (e.g., 9-14 degrees C for small buildings and 8-11 degrees C for medium buildings) where the setpoint selection would only slightly influence the energy consumption. However, the choice of setpoints becomes very influential (up to 30% of energy savings) where the outdoor temperatures are slightly outside the mentioned ranges on either direction. The potential savings from selecting daily optimal set points in the range of 22.5 +/- 3 degrees C in different climates and for small, medium and large office buildings, would lead to 10.09-37.03%, 11.43-21.01%, and 6.78-11.34% savings, respectively, depending on the climate.

Abstract: The present study investigated the technical and economic performance of the monoethanolamine (MEA)-based post-combustion capture process and its improvements integrated with a 650-MW coal-fired power station. A rigorous, rate-based model developed in Aspen Plus (R) was employed to evaluate technical performance, while a comprehensive economic model was used to determine the required capital investment and evaluate economic performance. The techno-economic model was validated with published cost results. Our estimation of the capital investment for the baseline MEA capture plant was US$1357/kW, with a CO2 avoided cost of US$86.4/tonne. We then proposed process improvements such as parameter optimisation, lean rich heat exchanger optimisation and flow sheet modifications to improve energy and cost performance. The combined process improvements reduced the capital investment by US$72/kW (a 5.3% saving) while cutting overall energy consumption by 24.5 MW/h (a 13.5% reduction). As a result, the CO2 avoided cost fell to $75.1/tonne CO2, a saving of US$11.3/tonne CO2 compared with the baseline. Lastly, we performed a sensitivity study and cost breakdown analysis to understand how the CO2 avoided cost would be apportioned to the economic and technical parameters. The results indicate the directions of technical development to further improve the economic viability of the CO2 capture process. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Wastage of food crops due to the dearth of proper cold storage facilities is a huge problem in underdeveloped and developing countries of the world. Conceptual design of a potato cold storage is presented here, along with performance appraisal over a calendar year. The microclimate inside the cold storage is regulated using a water-lithium bromide absorption system. Proposed system utilizes both solar thermal and photovoltaic generated electrical energy for its operation. A suitable operation strategy is devised and the performance of the integrated system is analyzed from energy and exergy point of view to identify the required numbers of thermal collectors and photovoltaic modules. The proposed system is found to provide a net surplus of about 36 MW h energy over a calendar year, after meeting the in-house requirements. A rudimentary economic analysis is also performed to check the financial viability of the proposed system. Both the thermal and photovoltaic components are found to have payback periods less than four years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The thermoelectric generator (TEG) has been widely considered as an electrical power source in many ground applications because of its clean and noiseless characteristics. Moreover, the hybrid photovoltaic cell and TEG (PV/TEG) system has also received wide attention due to its improved power conversion efficiency over its monolithic counterparts. This paper presents a study of the dynamics and the operation of the hybrid PV/TEG system in an outer space environment where a unified thermodynamic model of this system is presented. Moreover, the multi-objective NSGA-II genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the design of the TEG both in terms of optimal output power and in terms of mass. Specifically, the design of the single stage and the two stage variant of the aforementioned TEG are considered. Simulation results indicate that the optimized PV/TEG system does indeed achieve better efficiencies than that of the monolithic counterparts. Furthermore, it is shown that the single stage TEG is more beneficial than the two stage TEG in terms of achieving optimal performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This article captures the effects of energy price fluctuations on the demand and supply of energy. By focusing on the industries that depend on energy inputs, we are able to apply these effects and analyze the Chinese energy industry. Four main sets of results are presented. First, rising energy prices reduce output and social welfare. Second, the energy industry in China has a vertical market structure, which acts as an amplifier of energy price fluctuations that increase with market power of energy firms. Third, environmental objectives can be achieved through energy price regulation, thereby weakening the market power of energy firms. Interestingly, the formula of price regulation needed to achieve the environmental objectives is given. Finally, entry-level regulation can reduce emissions. In summary, this article supports the concept of energy industry regulation by decision-makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper describes the extension of CREST's existing electrical domestic demand model into an integrated thermal-electrical demand model. The principle novelty of the model is its integrated structure such that the timing of thermal and electrical output variables are appropriately correlated. The model has been developed primarily for low-voltage network analysis and the model's ability to account for demand diversity is of critical importance for this application. The model, however, can also serve as a basis for modelling domestic energy demands within the broader field of urban energy systems analysis. The new model includes the previously published components associated with electrical demand and generation (appliances, lighting, and photovoltaics) and integrates these with an updated occupancy model, a solar thermal collector model, and new thermal models including a low-order building thermal model, domestic hot water consumption, thermostat and timer controls and gas boilers. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in high-resolution domestic demand modelling, describes the model, and compares its output with three independent validation datasets.

Abstract: This study estimates the carbon abatement potential of 43 Chinese economic sectors by establishing and utilizing an environmental learning curve (ELC) model of carbon intensity. The model selects energy intensity, per capita value added and fuel consumption mix as the independent variables and obtains its learning coefficients using panel data regression. Based on this model, the carbon abatement potential of 43 economic sectors in 2020 is estimated for business-as-usual (BAU) and planned scenarios. The findings show that: (1) the established learning curves adequately simulate the carbon intensity of different sectors; (2) energy intensity has the strongest positive learning ability among the three variables for all sectors. A reduction in energy intensity will lead to reduced carbon intensities for 42 sectors (all except the agriculture sector). However, an increase in sectoral value added will make it possible to reduce carbon intensity in 34 sectors. Reducing the proportion of coal energy will result in decreased carbon intensities in only ten sectors; (3) the average carbon intensity reduction potential for 43 sectors in 2020 will be 33.0% and 39.0% based on 2012 in two different scenarios. Sectors related to the manufacture of food, medicine, beverages and chemical fiber have the largest carbon intensity potential among the 43 sectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) is a promising dual-fuel Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) strategy that provides a precise means for controlling the heat release rate and combustion phasing. Optimum RCCI engine operation depends cm optimum selection of fuel injection parameters. In this study, a detailed 3D/Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) combustion model in CONVERGE CFD code is developed and validated against experimental data at different engine operating conditions. Next, the effects of fuel injection parameters on the performance and emissions characteristics of an RCCI engine are analyzed. The fuel injection parameters include spray angle, injection pressure, Start of Injection (SOI) timing, and Premixed Ratio (PR). The baseline simulation results show that a proper selection of spray angle can cause significant reduction in HC and CO emissions, while improving combustion and gross indicated efficiencies. Furthermore, decreasing injection pressure and PR along with advancing SOI timing can improve the RCCI engine's HC and CO emissions productions. The developed CFD model is then used in an extensive computational study to determine optimum fuel injection parameters for the best RCCI engine performance. The optimization results show that spray angle 55, SOI = -53 degrees aTDC, 580 bar injection pressure, and PR = 0.76 provide the best combination of four major fuel injection parameters for the speed and load conditions studied. By choosing this set of parameters, HC and CO emissions decrease by 23% and 39% from the baseline condition while a notable improvement is observed in gross indicated and combustion efficiencies.

Abstract: In response to the gradual degradation of the natural environment, there is a growing interest to advance the development of sustainable buildings, in which renewable energy technologies are often incorporated to strategically minimize the carbon footprint of buildings. Pearl River Tower, a 71-storey tall building in Guangzhou, China, was designed to be the most energy efficient tall building in the world. In addition to a series of energy-efficient measures, the most eye-catching innovation in the design of Pearl River Tower is the deployment of four wind turbines installed in four openings in the tall building for power generation. This study aims to provide a performance assessment of these tall building integrated wind turbines. At the first step, a 1:150 scaled wind tunnel testing is carried out to experimentally assess the wind speed amplification effects inside the four openings. Comparative analysis and discussions corresponding to four different cases are presented. At the second step, the results from the wind tunnel testing, in conjunction with the statistical analysis results of long-term meteorological wind data recorded in Guangzhou, are applied for the performance assessment of these wind turbines for power generation. The outcomes of this study are expected to provide useful information for architects and engineers involved in the design of sustainable tall buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A successful pH control is of critical importance for ensuring efficient H-2 production in two-chamber MEC5. In this study, a novel two-chamber MEC is developed with biotic/abiotic hybrid electrodes, which are composed of carbon felt (CF) and stainless steel (SS) mesh. The CF is used for the electrogenic microorganisms attachment catalyzing the oxidation of organic matter (OM); the SS serves as the current collector and the H-2 evolution catalyst. The MEC is operated in the periodic polarity reversal (PPR) mode and two hybrid electrodes work alternately as an anode and a cathode. With the hybrid electrodes and the PPR mode, the pH fluctuation is limited within the range of 6.4-8.6, and the H-2 production is 5.3 times that of control without the PPR mode. The optimal reversal interval is 2 h for maximal H2 production. The H-2 production increases with the amplitude of the applied voltage (0.7-1.0 V). The using of hybrid electrodes, combining with the PPR mode, provides a simple but efficient pH control strategy and better H-2 production performance in MEC5. The findings of this study are expected to facilitate the design of pilot-scale MECs or similar bio-electrochemical reactors in future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper assesses the impact of the location and configuration of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) on Low-Voltage (LV) feeders. BESS are now being deployed on LV networks by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) as an alternative to conventional reinforcement (e.g. upgrading cables and transformers) in response to increased electricity demand from new technologies such as electric vehicles. By storing energy during periods of low demand and then releasing that energy at times of high demand, the peak demand of a given LV substation on the grid can be reduced therefore mitigating or at least delaying the need for replacement and upgrade. However, existing research into this application of BESS tends to evaluate the aggregated impact of such systems at the substation level and does not systematically consider the impact of the location and configuration of BESS on the voltage profiles, losses and utilisation within a given feeder.
In this paper, four configurations of BESS are considered: single-phase, unlinked three-phase, linked three-phase without storage for phase-balancing only, and linked three-phase with storage. These four configurations are then assessed based on models of two real LV networks. In each case, the impact of the BESS is systematically evaluated at every node in the LV network using Matlab linked with OpenDSS. The location and configuration of a BESS is shown to be critical when seeking the best overall network impact or when considering specific impacts on voltage, losses, or utilisation separately. Furthermore, the paper also demonstrates that phase-balancing without energy storage can provide much of the gains on unbalanced networks compared to systems with energy storage.

Abstract: Successful demonstration and promising characterization of a solar reactor pilot plant for thermal reduction of ZnO as part of a two-step water and CO2 splitting cycle has been accomplished at the 100 kW(th) scale in a 1 MW solar furnace. The solar reactor pilot plant was operated for over 97 h and achieved sustained reaction temperatures well above 2000 K, while demonstrating ZnO dissociation rates as high as 28 g/min totaling over 28 kg of processed reactant during 13 full days of experimentation. In-situ, high temperature, flow visualization of the quartz window enabled the unimpeded operation of the solar reactor. As many as three consecutive full day experiments were conducted without complication. Solar power delivered to the reaction cavity ranged between 90 and 128 kWth, at peak solar concentrations as high as 4671 kW/m(2). The products Zn and O-2 were quenched with Ar(g) and recovered in a filter battery, where collected particles contained molar Zn-content as high as 44%. During experimentation, switching between product collection filter cartridges resulted in 54 unique experiments, where a maximum solar-to-chemical efficiency of 3% was recorded for the solar reactor. Robust characterization of the product quenching device revealed inherent limitations in its effectiveness, and thus solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency was limited to 0.24% if it would have been possible to supply 4640 L-n/min of Ar(g). Further, only a limitation on available experimental time prohibited the demonstration of significantly higher dissociation rates, achievable with higher ZnO reactant feed rates. While the use of large volumes of quenching Ar(g) to separate the reaction products remains a significant obstacle to achieving higher solar-to-fuel efficiencies, demonstration of solar reactor technology at the pilot-scale represents significant progress toward the realization of industrial-scale solar fuels production.

Abstract: Building and transportation sectors account for approximately 75% of CO2 emissions. A mitigation strategy that combines both renewable energy sources and adoption of all-electric vehicles (EVs) instead of conventional gasoline powered vehicles thus seems most promising. The desired outcome of this strategy cannot be achieved without taking into consideration human activities in building and transportation. This study compares the energy use in building and transportation, aiming to provide a proper approach for evaluating the effectiveness and possible CO2 emissions reductions of GHG mitigation strategies. The analysis of the collected data "showed that on average each individual produced around 20 lbs of CO2 per day, 62% of the total CO2 was emitted in transportation. The mitigation strategy including EVs powered by electricity generated from coal-fired power plants resulted in average CO2 emissions reductions of 3.7%. The mitigation strategy using the EVs powered by solar energy obtained from grid-tied solar panels have led to 12.2% CO2 emissions reductions Per day (from 12.38 lbs/day to 10.87 lbs/day), and the strategy incorporating EVs with the off-grid source of power was the most successful strategy and resulted in an average CO2 emissions savings of 12.38 lbsiday. This study also estimates the initial cost per pound of CO2 emissions reduction per day for each of the mitigation strategies. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: As a follow-on work of the authors' theoretical study, the paper presented an experimental investigation into the energy performance of a novel PV/T thermal and power system employing the Micro encapsulated Phase Change Material (MPCM) slurry as the working fluid. A prototype PV/T module of 800 mm x 1600 mm x 50 mm was designed and constructed based on the previous modelling recommendation. The performance of the PV/T module and associated thermal and power system were tested under various solar radiations, slurry Reynolds numbers and MPCM concentrations. It was found that (1) increasing solar radiation led to the increased PV/T module temperature, decreased solar thermal and electrical efficiencies and reduced slurry pressure drop; (2) increasing the slurry Reynolds number led to the increased solar thermal and electrical efficiencies, decreased module temperature, and increased pressure drop; and (3) increasing the MPCM concentration led to the reduced module temperature and increased pressure drop. The experimental results were used to examine the accuracy of the established computer model, giving a derivation scale ranging from 1.1% to 6.1% which is an acceptable error level for general engineering simulation. The recommended operational conditions of the PV/T system were (1) MPCM slurry weight concentration of 10%, (2) slurry Reynolds number of 3000, and (3) solar radiation of 500-700 W/m(2); at which the system could achieve the net overall solar efficiencies of 80.8-83.9%. To summarise, the MPCM slurry based PV/T thermal and power system is superior to conventional air-sourced heat pump systems (ASHP) and solar assisted heat pump systems (ISAHP), and has the potential to help reduce fossil fuel consumption and carbon emission to the environment.

Abstract: The advent of Integrated Energy Systems enabled various distributed energy to access the system through different power electronic devices. The development of this has made the harmonic environment more complex. It needs low complexity and high precision of harmonic detection and analysis methods to improve power quality. To solve the shortages of large data storage capacities and high complexity of compression in sampling under the Nyquist sampling framework, this research paper presents a harmonic analysis scheme based on compressed sensing theory. The proposed scheme enables the performance of the functions of compressive sampling, signal reconstruction and harmonic detection simultaneously. In the proposed scheme, the sparsity of the harmonic signals in the base of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is numerically calculated first. This is followed by providing a proof of the matching satisfaction of the necessary conditions for compressed sensing. The binary sparse measurement is then leveraged to reduce the storage space in the sampling unit in the proposed scheme. In the recovery process, the scheme proposed a novel reconstruction algorithm called the Spectral Projected Gradient with Fundamental Filter (SPG-FF) algorithm to enhance the reconstruction precision. One of the actual microgrid systems is used as simulation example. The results of the experiment shows that the proposed scheme effectively enhances the precision of harmonic and inter-harmonic detection with low computing complexity, and has good capability of signal reconstruction. The maximum detection error reaches 0.0315%, and the reconstruction signals to noise ratio (SNR) is higher than 89 dB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents the annual overall energy performance and energy-saving potential of a ventilated photovoltaic double-skin facade (PV-DSF) in a cool-summer Mediterranean climate zone. A numerical simulation model based on EnergyPlus was utilized to simulate the PV-DSF overall energy performance, simultaneously taking into account thermal power and daylight. Based on numerical model, sensitivity analyses about air gap width and ventilation modes have been lead in Berkeley (California) with the aim to optimize unit's structure design and operational strategy of PV-DSF. Via simulation, the overall energy performance including thermal, power and daylighting of the optimized PV-DSF was evaluated using the typical meteorological year (TMY) weather data. It was found that per unit area of the proposed PV-DSF was able to generate about 65 kW h electricity yearly. If high efficiency cadmium telluride (CdTe) semi-transparent PV modules are adopted, the annual energy output could be even doubled. The PV-DSF studied, also featured good thermal and daylighting performances. The PV-DSF can effectively block solar radiation while still providing considerable daylighting illuminance. Due simply to excellent overall energy performance, a PV-DSF at Berkeley can reduce net electricity use by about 50% compared with other commonly used glazing systems. Efficiency improvements of semi-transparent PV modules would further increase the energy saving potential of a PV-DSF and thus making this technology more promising. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Building model calibration is critical in bringing simulated energy use closer to the actual consumption. This paper presents a novel, automated model calibration approach that uses logic linking parameter tuning with bias pattern recognition to overcome some of the disadvantages associated with traditional calibration processes. The pattern-based process contains four key steps: (1) running the original pre-calibrated energy model to obtain monthly simulated electricity and gas use; (2) establishing a pattern bias, either Universal or Seasonal Bias, by comparing load shape patterns of simulated and actual monthly energy use; (3) using programmed logic to select which parameter to tune first based on bias pattern, weather and input parameter interactions; and (4) automatically tuning the calibration parameters and checking the progress using pattern-fit criteria. The automated calibration algorithm was implemented in the Commercial Building Energy Saver, a web-based building energy retrofit analysis toolkit. The proof of success of the methodology was demonstrated using a case study of an office building located in San Francisco. The case study inputs included the monthly electricity bill, monthly gas bill, original building model and weather data with outputs resulting in a calibrated model that more closely matched that of the actual building energy use profile. The novelty of the developed calibration methodology lies in linking parameter tuning with the underlying logic associated with bias pattern identification. Although there are some limitations to this approach, the pattern-based automated calibration methodology can be universally adopted as an alternative to manual or hierarchical calibration approaches.

Abstract: Hydrogen (H-2) is a secondary fuel derived from natural gas. Currently, H-2 serves as an important component in refining operations, fertilizer production, and is experiencing increased utilization in the transportation industry as a clean combustion fuel. In recent years, industry and academia have focused on developing technology that reduces carbon emissions. As a result, there has been an increase in the technological developments for producing H-2 from natural gas. These technologies aim to minimize the cost increment associated with clean energy production. The natural gas processing chemical looping technology, developed at The Ohio State University (OSU), employs an iron-based oxygen carrier and a novel gas-solid counter-current moving bed reactor for H-2 production. Specifically, this study examines the theoretical thermodynamic limits for full conversion of natural gas through iron-based oxygen carrier reactions with methane (CH4), by utilizing simulations generated with ASPEN modeling software. This study initially investigates the reducer and the oxidizer thermodynamic phase diagrams then derives an optimal auto-thermal operating condition for the complete loop simulation. This complete loop simulation is initially normalized for analysis on the basis of one mole of carbon input from natural gas. The H-2 production rate is then scaled to match that of the baseline study, using a full-scale ASPEN simulation for computing cooling loads, water requirements and net parasitic energy consumption. The full scale ASPEN simulation is used to analyze the thermal efficiency of multiple energy recovery schemes, for further validation of the chemical looping process. Resulting from this study, the chemical looping technology is found to produce a cold gas efficiency improvement of more than 5 percentage points and an effective thermal efficiency of more than 6 percentage points over the conventional steam methane reforming process, while producing H-2 from natural gas with greater than 90% carbon capture.

Abstract: Bioenergy plays an important role in mitigating dangerous climate change and will therefore most likely have to further expand substantially. With 50% of the global population living in urban areas, cities are transforming into hotspots for future sustainable energy systems in the context of a low-carbon society. Bioenergy feedstock from urban forests could contribute substantially to low-carbon energy supply, yet urban ecosystems also provide other services that have to be balanced against future energy needs. This study conducts a geo-spatial analysis of urban forests with respect to its potential of increasing feedstock production for urban bioenergy generation. At the same time, social and environmental constraints are considered and co-benefits discussed. In order to test the wider applicability of the methodology, the Vienna Woods Biosphere Reserve is chosen as a case study to determine the feedstock potential for local bioenergy provided to Viennese households. The theoretical biomass potential is modeled using biophysical growth and yield tables for individual tree species and then compared to the existing production area using GIS tools. Results show that the biomass use within the biosphere reserve can be increased by about 60% without violating any national or international law that protects multiple ecosystem services provided by the reserve, nor sustainability criteria of forest management. This indicates a high potential of peri-urban forest ecosystems to contribute to urban resilience - i.e. with respect to energy security and emissions reduction. The study concludes that urban forests require sensible management in order to minimize conflicts of multiple environmental, economic and social uses of the area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Accurate metering of transported dense phase carbon dioxide (CO2) is imperative in carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations. Coriolis mass flow meters have been proposed for CCS operations metering due to their reliability and high accuracy. However, no studies have been reported to quantify the measurement uncertainty for Coriolis meters operating with high pressure liquefied CO2. Accordingly, an apparatus was designed, built and tested to calibrate an industrial scale Coriolis meter using CO2 in either high pressure liquid or supercritical phases. In this study, the standard uncertainty of the meter was evaluated within the temperature range 290-303 K and at pressures between 6.5 and 8.5 MPa, these being representative of CCS transport operating conditions. The apparatus and method developed was based on a gravimetric calibration in which the totalised mass recorded by the Coriolis mass meter was compared with the increase in weight of a collection cylinder mounted on a highly accurate weigh scale. A back pressure controller was used to maintain the system pressure above vapour pressure and ensure the CO2 remained in liquid phase. The average standard uncertainty of the Coriolis meter using liquid phase CO2 was calculated to be 0.11% which is in good agreement with the meter's technical specification provided by the equipment manufacturer. The uncertainty of measurement of CO2 under test conditions is hardly affected by temperature, pressure and flow rate conditions within the range investigated in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: When frost forms and accumulates over the outdoor coil's surface in an air source heat pump (ASHP) unit, system operating performance will be dramatically deteriorated. Reverse cycle defrosting is the most widely used standard defrosting method. A previous related study reported that downwards flowing of melted frost due to gravity over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil would decrease the reverse cycle defrosting performance. If the outdoor coil can be changed to horizontally installed, the flow path of melted frost over coil surface can be shortened, and the flow directions of refrigerant and melted frost changed from opposite to orthogonal. Consequently, a better defrosting performance is expected. In this paper, therefore, an experimental study on defrosting performance for an ASHP unit with a horizontally installed multi-circuit outdoor coil was conducted. Experimental results show that, when a vertical outdoor coil was changed to horizontally installed, the defrosting efficiency increased 9.8%, however, with the same defrosting duration at 186 s. Furthermore, when the outdoor air fan was reversed to blowing the melted frost during defrosting, the total mass of the retained water collected decreased 222 g. However, the defrosting efficiency was not increased, but decreased 6.6% because of the heat transfer enhanced between hot coil and cold ambient air. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposed a new smart home community architecture in power system, in which community controller will acts as a virtual power distribution company. The traditional real time pricing schemes may not be effectively implemented in terms of reduction of power peak to average ratio over the large number of end consumers. To overcome this problem, a true real time pricing between community controller and community end users is developed based on real time pricing and inclining block rates. The proposed pricing scheme implemented in the community is charged at the end of a day according to the combined load of the community. To schedule the electric appliances in a combined way, we have developed a power scheduling algorithm as well. The simulation results have revealed that by applying anticipated technique of pricing scheme in group of households, the consumption cost of end consumers decreases and the overall power peak to average ratio reduces as well which will be beneficial for the utilities.

Abstract: Soft Open Points (SOPs) are power electronic devices installed in place of normally-open points in electrical power distribution networks. They are able to provide active power flow control, reactive power compensation and voltage regulation under normal network operating conditions, as well as fast fault isolation and supply restoration under abnormal conditions. A steady state analysis framework was developed to quantify the operational benefits of a distribution network with SOPs under normal network operating conditions. A generic power injection model was developed and used to determine the optimal SOP operation using an improved Powell's Direct Set method. Physical limits and power losses of the SOP device (based on back to back voltage-source converters) were considered in the model. Distribution network reconfiguration algorithms, with and without SOPs, were developed and used to identify the benefits of using SOPs. Test results on a 33-bus distribution network compared the benefits of using SOPs, traditional network reconfiguration and the combination of both. The results showed that using only one SOP achieved a similar improvement in network operation compared to the case of using network reconfiguration with all branches equipped with remotely controlled switches. A combination of SOP control and network reconfiguration provided the optimal network operation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In the design of multistream plate-fin heat exchangers (MPFHEs), surface selection and layer pattern optimization have been investigated as two independent problems and still remain at the empirical stage, which becomes an obstacle for optimizing the performance of MPFHEs. A combined method of the equipartition of entropy production and the balance of local heat load is proposed in the present research to consider these two problems simultaneously, by means of which the decrease of heat transfer performance and the increase of pressure drop caused by inappropriate surface selection and layer pattern could be reduced to a large extent. The temperature difference and pressure drop are introduced into the optimization model in the forms of specific entropy generation rates of the heat transfer and fluid friction. These parameters are adopted as a dual-objective function in the optimization to associate the surface selection with the layer pattern. This combined method starts from the design of layer numbers and fin structures, includes the layer pattern arrangement and finally employs multi-objective optimization to achieve an optimal production. This method conforms to the actual design process and provides good robustness and high efficiency for a main heat exchanger in air separation plants, which is a beneficial approach for the design of MPFHEs.

Abstract: An efficient MgO-stabilized CaO sorbent via the citric acid treated dolomite coupled with carbonization process (denoted as carbon coating) was developed for CO2 capture at high temperature. The citric acid was used as a carbon source to produce the coated carbon, which was expected to effectively prevent the crystallites (CaO and MgO) from sintering. The original dolomite and citric-acid-treated dolomite with subsequent calcination in air were also prepared for comparison. Different characterizations (thermal decomposition, phase composition, morphology, and nitrogen adsorption) were performed. The cyclic-CO2-capture performance was tested in a fix-bed reactor. During the carbonization in N-2 atmosphere, the acidified dolomite transformed into carbon-coated, Mg-doped calcite, which could control thermal sintering and prevent the de-mixing of CaO and MgO in the secondary calcination step in air. Thus, the sorbent prepared using carbon coating achieved smaller grains, larger specific surface area and pore volume and more uniform distribution of CaO and MgO, which led to its superior activity and stability, compared to two reference sorbents.

Abstract: Cell performance and efficiency of tubular molten antimony (Sb) anode direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells (DC-SOFCs) was investigated with two different biomass carbon fuels. The 8 mol.% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) supported cells with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-10 mol.% Gd2O3 doped CeO2 (LSCF-10GDC) as the cathode were fabricated by slurry-casting, slurry-dipping and sintering processes. A relatively high power density of 196 and 304 mW cm(-2) was achieved at 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively. Two biomass carbon, cocoanut active charcoal (CAC) and pyrolysed corn starch (PCS), were used as the fuels for cell running at 750 and 800 degrees C and the exhausted gas consist was recorded. The proceedings of anode reactions were closely related to the fuel properties and working temperature and had an obvious influence on the cell running in turn. The fuel utilization and electrical efficiency of the special molten Sb anode cell was defined and calculated by the experimental data. The fuel utilization was above 50% but the electrical efficiency was below 34%, limited by the low Nernst voltage of the reaction of Sb oxidation, thick YSZ electrolyte used and significant heat generated by Sb2O3 reduction.

Abstract: Data centers are approximately 50 times more energy-intensive than general buildings. The rapidly increasing energy demand for data center operation has motivated efforts to better understand data center electricity use and to identify strategies that reduce the environmental impact. This research is presented analytical approach to the energy efficiency optimization of high density data center, in a synergy with relevant performance analysis of corresponding case study. This paper builds on data center energy modeling efforts by characterizing climate and cooling system differences among data centers and then evaluating their consequences for building energy use. Representative climate conditions for four regions are applied to data center energy models for several different prototypical cooling types. This includes cooling system, supplemental cooling solutions, design conditions and controlling the environment of ICT equipment were generally used for each climate zone, how these affect energy efficiency, and how the prioritization of system selection is derived. Based on the climate classification and the required operating environmental conditions for data centers suggested by the ASHRAE TC 9.9, a dedicated data center energy evaluation tool was taken to examine the potential energy savings of the cooling technology. Incorporating economizer use into the cooling systems would increase the variation in energy efficiency among geographic regions, indicating that as data centers become more energy efficient, their locations will have an increasing effect on overall energy demand. The proposal for the most energy-optimized data center is given by each climate zone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Efficient optimization algorithms are critical to the development of new engine technology. In this study, experimental investigations were carried out on optimizing the performance of a four-cylinder, turbocharged, direct-injection diesel engine running with soy biodiesel. An effective hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) method using a small population was developed and tested to optimize five operating parameters, including EGR rate, pilot timing, pilot ratio, main injection timing, and injection pressure. Based on the measured engine performance and emissions, results show that the new hybrid algorithm can significantly speed up the optimization process and achieve a superior optimum as compared to the basic GA method. The new hybrid PSO-GA method is expected to perform as an effective tool for rapid engine performance optimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hybrid off-grid energy systems enable a cost efficient and reliable energy supply to rural areas around the world. The main potential for a low cost operation and uninterrupted power supply lies in the optimal sizing and operation of such microgrids. In particular, sudden variations in load demand or in the power supply from renewables underline the need for an optimally sized system. This paper presents an efficient multi-objective model based optimization approach for the optimal sizing of all components and the determination of the best power electronic layout. The presented method is divided into three optimization problems to minimize economic and environmental objectives. This design optimization includes detailed components models and an optimized energy dispatch strategy which enables the optimal design of the energy system with respect to an adequate control for the specific configuration. To significantly reduce the computation time without loss of accuracy, the presented method contains the determination of a representative load profile using a k-means clustering method. The k-means algorithm itself is embedded in an optimization problem for the calculation of the optimal number of clusters. The benefits in term of reduced computation time, inclusion of optimal energy dispatch and optimization of power electronic architecture, of the presented optimization method are illustrated using a case study.

Abstract: Transmission congestion management plays a key role in deregulated energy markets. To correctly model and solve this problem, power system voltage and transient stability limits should be considered to avoid obtaining a vulnerable power system with low stability margins. Congestion management is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem in this paper. The proposed scheme includes the cost of congestion management, voltage stability margin and transient stability margin as its multiple competing objectives. Moreover, a new effective Multi-objective Mathematical Programming (MMP) solution approach based on normalized normal constraint (NNC) method is presented to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of the congestion management, which can generate a well-distributed and efficient Pareto frontier. The proposed congestion management model and MMP solution approach are implemented on the New-England's test system and the obtained results are compared with the results of several other congestion management methods. These comparisons verify the superiority of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of using a data-driven optimization approach to determine the coordinated control actions of wind turbines that maximize the total wind farm power production. Conventionally, for a given wind condition, an individual wind turbine maximizes its own power production without taking into consideration the conditions of other wind turbines. Under this greedy control strategy, the wake formed by the upstream wind turbine, resulting in reduced wind speed and increased turbulence intensity inside the wake, would affect and lower the power productions of the downstream wind turbines. To increase the overall wind farm power production, cooperative wind turbine control approaches have been proposed to coordinate the control actions that mitigate the wake interference among the wind turbines and would thus increase the total wind farm power production. This study explores the use of a data-driven approach to identify the optimum coordinated control actions of the wind turbines using limited amount of data. Specifically, we study the feasibility of the Bayesian Ascent (BA) algorithm, a probabilistic optimization algorithm based on non-parametric Gaussian Process regression technique, for the wind farm power maximization problem. The BA algorithm is employed to maximize an analytical wind farm power function that is constructed based on wind farm configurations and wind conditions. The results show that the BA algorithm can achieve a monotonic increase in the total wind farm power production using a small number of function evaluations and has the potentials to be used for real-time wind farm control.

Abstract: Life cycle analysis (LCA) using the process chain analysis (PCA) approach has been widely applied to energy systems. When applied to an individual energy system, such as coal or nuclear electricity generation, an LCA-PCA methodology can yield relatively accurate results with its detailed process representation based on engineering data. However, there are fundamental issues when applying conventional LCA-PCA methodology to a more complex life cycle, namely, a synchronized life cycle of interconnected energy systems. A synchronized life cycle of interconnected energy systems is established through direct interconnections among the processes of different energy systems, and all interconnecting systems are bounded within the same timeframe. Under such a life cycle formation, there are some major complications when applying conventional LCA-PCA methodology to evaluate the interconnecting energy systems. Essentially, the conventional system and boundary formulations developed for a life cycle of individual energy system cannot be directly applied to a life cycle of interconnected energy systems. To address these inherent issues, a new LCA-PCA methodology is presented in this paper, in which a new concept of partial temporal boundary is introduced to synchronize the interconnecting energy systems. The importance and advantages of these new developments are demonstrated through a case study on the life cycle of the coal-uranium system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In order to optimize battery performance, different geometries have been evaluated taking into account their suitability for different applications. These different geometries include conventional, interdigitated batteries and unconventional geometries such as horseshoe, spiral, ring, antenna and gear batteries. The geometry optimization was performed by the finite element method, applying the Doyle/Fuller/Newman model. At 330 degrees C, the capacity values for conventional, ring, spiral, horseshoe, gear and interdigitated geometries are 0.58 A h m(-2), 149 A h m(-2), 182 A h m(-2), 216 A h m(-2), 289 A h m(-2) and 318 A h m(-2), respectively.
The delivered capacity depends on geometrical parameters such as maximum distance for the ions to move to the current collector, d_max, distance between of current collectors, d_cc, as well as the thickness of separator and electrodes, allowing to tailor battery performance and geometry for specific applications.

Abstract: A novel solar electricity generation system (SEGS) using cascade cycle is proposed. The top and the bottom are steam Rankine cycle (SRC) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Particulary, screw expander (SE), which is characterized by good applicability in power conversion with steam-liquid mixture, is employed in the SRC. Steam is generated directly in the parabolic trough collectors (PTC) and expands in the SE. The heat released by steam condensation is used to drive the ORC. This type of SEGS has the advantages of avoidance of superheated steam, moderate operating temperature and pressure, low technical requirements in heat collection and storage, and suitableness for distributed power generation. Simulation of the system performance is conducted on the use of ten ORC fluids. Four hot/cold side temperatures of 473/313 K, 473/293 K, 523/313 K and 523/293 K are exemplified. The results indicate the ORC evaporation temperature corresponding to theoretical maximum solar power efficiency fails to provide a pressure ratio (PR) that matches the SE built-in PR. Off-design operation of the SE is recommended for the purpose of higher system efficiency and simpler ORC turbine. Efficiency of 13.68-15.62% for the proposed system can be achieved.

Abstract: Due to the temperature sensitive behavior of lithium-ion batteries a thermal management system (TMS) is typically integrated into the battery pack design. This system plays a crucial role in the total battery pack performance. During operation the TMS will induce nonuniform temperature distributions within the cells of the pack, due to relatively low cell thermal conductivity. However, limited research has been published regarding the effects of thermal nonuniformity throughout a cell, module, or pack. Understanding these effects will be beneficial to heat exchanger design and TMS control strategy optimization. Here, an experimental investigation is performed where fixed one-dimensional temperature distributions, emulating the effects of edge-based heat transfer, are applied across the face of a 10Ah NiCoMn Li-ion pouch cell. Average cell temperature conditions of 15, 25, and 35 degrees C with edge-to-edge temperature differences (Delta T) of 0, 5, 10, and 20 degrees C are applied. At each thermal treatment the effects on: (1) the pulse resistance at 50% state of charge, (2) the bulk resistance on a Charge-Depleting US06 power, profile, and (3) the overpotential during Constant-Current charge are investigated. Pulse resistance is decreased with increased Delta T. However, the discharge resistance on the Charge-Depleting cycle was increased with increased Delta T. The Constant-Current charging overpotential (and therefore resistance) was also increased with increased Delta T. All effects are largest at 15 degrees C, and negligible at 35 degrees C.

Abstract: Temperature effect on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Nannochloropsis gaditana and Chlorella sp. was investigated with 10% biomass loading at HTL temperatures of 180-330 degrees C, and reaction time of 30 min. Maximum yields of 47.5% for Nannochloropsis sp. and 32.5% biocrude oil yields for Chlorella sp. were obtained at 300 degrees C. The higher heating values of biocrude oils produced in this work ranged between 34 and 39 MJ/kg. 79% of energy in the Nannochloropsis sp. was recovered at 300 degrees C and 62% of energy recovery from Chlorella sp. was achieved at 200 degrees C. Valuable nutrients (NH3-N and PO43-) produced during the HTL process were quantified, from the aqueous phase for both strains of biomass. The aqueous phase samples obtained at all temperatures were also analyzed for amino acids and carbohydrates. The suitable temperatures for extraction of lipids, amino acids and carbohydrates have been identified. Sequential HTL experiments conducted have shown the prospect of recovering nutrients and other valuable byproducts along with biocrude oil. The experimental results and analysis indicate that sustainable biofuel production requires the development of strain based strategies for the hydrothermal liquefaction process.

Abstract: Biostimulation through providing nutrients to microorganisms has been proven to be highly effective in enhancing methane yield from bituminous coals in the Illinois basin. In light of the extremely cheap natural gas price at present, it is critically important to decrease the cost of nutrient solutions used to stimulate microbial gasification of coal and improve the cost-effectiveness of the biostimulation approach. To lower cost of a nutrient solution reported in previous studies, the three most expensive components, yeast extract, peptone and mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (Coenzyme M, CoM) were evaluated. Regarding the first two, decreasing their concentrations resulted in decreased methane production. In terms of CoM, its concentration could be reduced to at least half without affecting methane yield negatively. Complete elimination of CoM led to a methane yield of 85% of those with the presence of this compound in the original medium. Two complex media, trypticase soy broth (TSB) and corn steep liquor (CSL) were intended to replace yeast extract and peptone. TSB had increasingly positive effect with increasing its concentration while CSL had opposite trend. TSB at 100% (v/v) was then investigated under different cultivation conditions. Among the four parameters tested, TSB concentration and agitation were found to exert positive effect while coal loading and temperature had negative impact on methane production. The highest methane yield of 828.9 ft(3)/ton in 30 days was obtained under temperature of 28 degrees C with a coal loading of 200 g/L and agitation at 100 rpm. This yield is four-time higher than those observed with the original medium. These results clearly demonstrated that biostimulation is a viable method for enhancing methane production from coal and the ingredients of nutrient solutions need to be evaluated in detail in order to make biostimulation cost-effectively at commercial scales.

Abstract: Conventional diesel combustion produces harmful exhaust emissions which adversely affect the air quality if not controlled by in-cylinder measures and exhaust aftertreatment systems. Dual-fuel combustion can potentially reduce the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot which are characteristic of diesel diffusion flame. The in-cylinder blending of different fuels to control the charge reactivity allows for lower local equivalence ratios and temperatures. The use of ethanol, an oxygenated biofuel with high knock resistance and high latent heat of vaporisation, increases the reactivity gradient. In addition, renewable biofuels can provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based fuels as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, ethanol-diesel dual-fuel combustion suffers from poor engine efficiency at low load due to incomplete combustion. Therefore, experimental studies were carried out at 1200 rpm and 0.615 MPa indicated mean effective pressure on a heavy-duty diesel engine. Fuel delivery was in the form of port fuel injection of ethanol and common rail direct injection of diesel. The objective was to improve combustion efficiency, maximise ethanol substitution, and minimise NOx and soot emissions. Ethanol energy fractions up to 69% were explored in conjunction with the effect of different diesel injection strategies on combustion, emissions, and efficiency. Optimisation tests were performed for the optimum fuelling and diesel injection strategy. The resulting effects of exhaust gas recirculation, intake air pressure, and rail pressure were investigated. The optimised combustion of ethanol ignited by split diesel injections resulted in higher net indicated efficiency when compared to diesel-only operation. For the best emissions case, NOx and soot emissions were reduced by 65% and 29%, respectively. Aftertreatment requirements that are generally associated with cost and fuel economy penalties can be minimised. Combustion efficiency of 98% was achieved at the expense of higher NOx emissions.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are frequently and widely used in latent thermal energy storage (LTES) system and thermal management (TM) system due to their large latent heats and capabilities of maintaining nearly constant temperature. However, the performances of PCMs in LTES and TM systems are seriously limited by their low thermal conductivities and poor heat transfer performances, which consequently stimulates intensive experimental and theoretical investigations on improving the thermal conductivities and heat transfer performances of PCMs by using different methods. The present paper reviews the recent progresses of the investigations and applications of the composite PCMs with the enhanced performance. The focuses are placed on the composite PCMs fabricated by using the metal foams and carbon materials, which have been proved to be the most promising approaches for thermal conductivity and heat transfer promotion on PCMs. The fabrication processes of the composite PCMs are first introduced in the present paper followed by the thermal characterization. The measurement of the effective thermal conductivities of the composite PCMs is discussed in detail by comparing different measuring methods, and the theoretical models to predict the effective thermal conductivities of the composite PCMs are also presented. The mathematical models describing the phase change heat transfer characteristics of the composite PCMs which are very important for system modeling and design are also addressed and discussed in the present review. Furthermore, the applications of the composite PCMs to LTES and TM systems are introduced and summarized by illustrating the typical examples. It can be understood that the composite PCMs can effectively improve the performances of LTES and TM systems, which therefore calls for the further investigation in this research field. Finally, the future research topics are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To meet the fast growth of electricity demand, the traditional network solution tends to expand existing substations, build more new substations, and build transmission lines. Distributed Generation (DG) is posed as an alternative method for the network providers not only to accommodate the load increase and relieve network overload, but also to offer other additional technical and economic benefits. This paper addresses the issue of DG planning and has proposed a technique for optimizing the DG size and location to minimize the overall investment and operational cost of the system. The proposed optimization methodology assesses the compatibility of different generation schemes in terms of their cost factors that can be significantly contributed by a DG. The direct and indirect costs of power supply quality, reliability, energy loss, total power operation, and DG investment are used as key cost components of the DG siting and sizing strategy. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is applied to obtain the optimal DG planning solutions. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on a distribution feeder of an Australian power network. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Air layer involved envelopes (ALIEs) have gained considerable popularity in modern building design and construction, owing to their great potential in improving the building thermal performance. Basically, the air layer functions as an extra insulation layer or as a ventilation channel. This paper presents a literature review on building envelopes that contain inner air layers by tracing recent studies on existing air layer involved applications and technologies in walls, windows, roofs. The structural characteristics, the driving forces, the effects of the inner air layers, and the benefits of different types of ALIE systems are summarized and classified. And then operation modes of air layer used in building envelopes are roughly classified into three types: the enclosed type, the naturally ventilated type and the mechanically ventilated type. At the end, this paper analyzes current research gaps and provides possible future research directions on air layer technologies in building envelopes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Molten salts possess significant potential for use as heat transfer fluids (HTFs) and/or thermal storage media in advanced high-temperature concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. However, the thermal performance of these materials is hindered by typically low thermal conductivity on the order of 1 W/m-K in the solid phase and less in the liquid phase. Much work has been done to improve the thermal conductivity of HTFs through the addition of nanoparticles of higher conductivity, such as metallic nanoparticles or nanoparticulate graphite. These nanofluids display improved thermal conductivity and otherwise behave similarly to the pure HTFs. This investigation proposes such a system, focusing on the nitrate salts: potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, and the potassium-sodium nitrate eutectic (54 weight percent potassium nitrate), with melting points of 334 degrees C, 306 degrees C, and 222 degrees C, respectively. Attention is also paid to use of these materials as latent heat thermal energy storage (TES) materials-i.e., phase change materials (PCMs). The nitrate salt melt is a highly oxidative environment, so the use of carbonaceous materials or elemental metals may be hampered by degradative effects. Hence, this investigation specifically examines cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticle-enhanced nitrate salts systems. The thermophysical properties (e.g., thermal diffusivity, latent heat) of the salt-nanoparticle systems are measured. Further, temperature-variant FTIR spectroscopy is used to determine any potential degradation of the salt after thermal cycling. The suitability of the enhanced nitrate salts systems, in regard to the chemical stability of the additive and the improvement of the thermal performance of the system relative to the pure salts, is demonstrated.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to assess the performance of several designs of hybrid systems composed of solar thermal collectors, photovoltaic panels and natural gas internal combustion engines. The software TRNSYS 17 has been used to perform all the calculations and data processing, as well as an optimisation of the tank volumes through an add-in coupled with the GENOPT (R) software. The study is carried out by analysing the behaviour of the designed systems and the conventional case in five different locations of Spain with diverse climatic characteristics, evaluating the same building in all cases. Regulators, manufacturers and energy service engineers are the most interested in these results.
Two major contributions in this paper are the calculations of primary energy consumption and emissions and the inclusion of a Life Cycle Cost analysis. A table which shows the order of preference regarding those criteria for each considered case study is also included. This was fulfilled in the interest of comparing between the different configurations and climatic zones so as to obtain conclusions on each of them. The study also illustrates a sensibility analysis regarding energy prices. Finally, the exhaustive literature review, the novel electricity consumption profile of the building and the illustration of the influence of the cogeneration engine working hours are also valuable outputs of this paper, developed in order to address the knowledge gap and the ongoing challenges in the field of distributed generation.

Abstract: Solar energy installations in arid and semi-arid regions are rapidly increasing due to technological advances and policy support. Although solar energy provides several benefits such as reduction of greenhouse gases, reclamation of degraded land, and improved quality of life in developing countries, the deployment of large-scale renewable energy infrastructure may negatively impact land and water resources. Meeting the ever-expanding energy demand with limited land and water resources in the context of increasing demand for alternative uses such as agricultural and domestic consumption is a major challenge. The goal of this study was to explore opportunities to colocate solar infrastructures and agricultural crops to maximize the efficiency of land and water use. We investigated the energy inputs/outputs, water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and economics of solar installations in northwestern India in comparison to aloe vera cultivation, another widely promoted and economically important land use in these systems. The life cycle analyses show that the colocated systems are economically viable in some rural areas and may provide opportunities for rural electrification and stimulate economic growth. The water inputs for cleaning solar panels are similar to amounts required for annual aloe productivity, suggesting the possibility of integrating the two systems to maximize land and water use efficiency. A life cycle analysis of a hypothetical colocation indicated higher returns per m(3) of water used than either system alone. The northwestern region of India has experienced high population growth in the past decade, creating additional demand for land and water resources. In these water-limited areas, coupled solar infrastructure and agriculture could be established in marginal lands with low water use, thus minimizing the socioeconomic and environmental issues resulting from cultivation of economically important non-food crops (e.g., aloe) in prime agricultural lands.

Abstract: The study presented in this paper aims to evaluate the transient performance of a waste heat recovery Rankine cycle based system for a heavy duty truck and compare it to steady state evaluation. Assuming some conditions to hold, simple thermodynamic simulations are carried out for the comparison of several fluids. Then a detailed first principle based model is also presented. Last part is focused on the Rankine cycle arrangement choice by means of model based evaluation of fuel economy for each concept where the fuels savings are computed using two methodologies. Fluid choice and concept optimization are conducted taking into account integration constraints (heat rejection, packaging, ... ). This paper shows the importance of the modeling phase when designing Rankine cycle based heat recovery systems and yields a better understanding when it comes to a vehicle integration of a Rankine cycle in a truck.

Abstract: Longer chain alcohols, such as butanol, possess major physiochemical advantages over ethanol as bio-components for gasoline, including higher energy content, better engine compatibility, and less water solubility. In this study, two butanol isomers (n-butanol and isobutanol) are investigated as potential fuels for Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines. Wide ranges of intake pressure and equivalence ratio are investigated and the results are presented in comparison to ethanol and gasoline as reference fuels. Under all tested conditions, the butanol isomers require lower intake temperatures for a fixed combustion phasing, indicating higher HCCI reactivity. Both isomers show single-stage ignition behavior at all test points and behave similarly in regard to the combustion stability. Engine operation using n-butanol is slightly more stable under all conditions and misfiring occurs slightly later under very lean and naturally aspirated conditions. Similar to gasoline, n-butanol shows a higher heat release rate (HRR) at the beginning of combustion. The intermediate temperature heat release (ITHR) lowers the coefficient of variation (CoV) of IMEPg (gross indicated mean effective pressure), especially at retarded combustion timing and lean mixtures. However, the knock resistance of n-butanol is lower compared to isobutanol and the other tested fuels. The exhaust emissions of the two butanol isomers are in the same range as the two reference fuels. Overall, the results indicate that butanol is suited for use as a fuel in HCCI engines, either in neat form or in blend with gasoline. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Fushun-type process is the most common method of oil shale retorting used in China. The process is, however, characterized by poor thermodynamic performance. While conventional exergy analysis is able to quantitatively determine exergy destruction in a system, identification of the sources of the exergy destruction, and thus identification of areas with the greatest potential for efficiency improvement, requires advanced exergy analysis. In this paper, an advanced exergy analysis is applied to evaluate the performance of a Fushun-type oil shale retorting process.
The results indicate that, the simulation results are consistent with industrial data. The process can produce 21.90 t/h of shale oil from 500 till oil shale. The exergy efficiency of the Fushun-type oil shale retorting process studied in this work is 34.17% and the total exergy destruction is 442.62 MW. The analysis shows that 45.40% of the exergy destruction cannot be reduced. The retort is found to be the element of the Fushun-type oil shale retorting process having the greatest potential for decrease in exergy destruction. Improvement strategies are proposed to minimize exergy destruction in the retort. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The capacity degradation of the lithium ion battery should be well predicted during battery system design. Therefore, high-fidelity capacity degradation models that are suitable for the task of capacity prediction are required. This paper proposes a novel capacity degradation model that can simulate the degradation dynamics under varying working conditions for large-format lithium ion batteries. The degradation model is built based on a mechanistic and prognostic model (MPM) whose parameters are closely linked with the degradation mechanisms of lithium ion batteries. Chemical kinetics was set to drive the parameters of the MPM to change as capacity degradation continues. With the dynamic parameters of the MPM, the capacity predicted by the degradation model decreases as the cycle continues. Accelerated aging tests were conducted on three types of commercial lithium ion batteries to calibrate the capacity degradation model. The good fit with the experimental data indicates that the model can capture the degradation mechanisms well for different types of commercial lithium ion batteries. Furthermore, the calibrated model can be used to (1) evaluate the longevity of a battery system under a specific working load and (2) predict the evolution of cell variations within a battery pack when different cell works at different conditions. Correlated applications are discussed using the calibrated degradation model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High purity hydrogen can be produced through chemical looping with making use of the reaction between steam and lattice oxygen of an oxygen carrier. Since choosing a suitable oxygen carrier significantly affects the efficiency of this process, different oxygen carriers have been proposed. In this work, alumina supported Fe2O3 promoted with cerium or calcium oxides is assessed as an oxygen carrier. The effect of promoter type (M = Ca and Ce) and its loading weight percentage (x = 0, 5, 10) on the cyclic redox performance of 15Fe-xM/Al2O3 oxygen carrier is investigated. In addition, the reaction temperature (823-1023 K) and the oxygen carrier cyclic lifetime (up to 15 cycles) are studied at steam to methane ratio of 1.5. Surface and structural properties of some samples were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. The results show that the activity, long-term stability and coke formation resistance of the oxygen carrier are significantly affected by the promoter type. The catalytic activity of oxygen carrier improves successfully in the presence of 5% cerium or calcium promoter. At 923 K, the methane conversion is about 100% for 15Fe-5Ca/Al2O3 and 15Fe-5Ce/Al2O3 oxygen carriers, which is the highest conversion among all the tested samples. However, 15Fe-5Ca/Al2O3 oxygen carrier is consistently stable in chemical looping reforming with high hydrogen producing capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Optimal automatic operation of buildings and their subsystems in responding to signals from a smart grid is essential to reduce energy demand, and to improve the power resilience. In order to achieve such automatic operation, high fidelity and computationally efficiency whole building energy forecasting models are needed. Currently, data-driven (black box) models and hybrid (grey box) models are commonly used in model based building control. However, typical black box models often require long training period and are bounded to building operation conditions during the training period. On the other hand, creating a grey box model often requires (a) long calculation time due to parameter optimization process; and (b) expert knowledge during the model development process. This paper attempts to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of two significant system characteristics: system nonlinearity and response time, on the accuracy of the model developed by a system identification process. A general methodology for building energy forecasting model development is then developed. How to adapt the system identification process based on these two characteristics is also studied. A set of comparison criteria are then proposed to evaluate the energy forecasting models generated from the adapted system identification process against other methods reported in the literature, including Resistance and Capacitance method, Support Vector Regression method, Artificial Neural Networks method, and N4SID subspace algorithm. Two commercial buildings: a small and a medium commercial building, with varying chiller nonlinearity, are simulated using EnergyPlus in lieu of real buildings for model development and evaluation. The results from this study show that the adapted system identification process is capable of significantly improve the performance of the energy forecasting model, which is more accurate and more extendable under both of the noise-free and noisy conditions than those models generated by other methods.

Abstract: In this paper, a data-driven framework for improving the performance of wastewater pumping systems has been developed by fusing knowledge including the data mining, mathematical modeling, and computational intelligence. Modeling pump system performance in terms of the energy consumption and pumped wastewater flow rate based on industrial data with neural networks is examined. A bi-objective optimization model incorporating data-driven components is formulated to minimize the energy consumption and maximize the pumped wastewater flow rate. An adaptive mechanism is developed to automatically determine weights associated with two objectives by considering the wet well level and influent flow rate. The optimization model is solved by an artificial immune network algorithm. A comparative analysis between the optimization results and the observed data is performed to demonstrate the improvement of the pumping system performance. Results indicate that saving energy while maintaining the pumping performance is potentially achievable with the proposed data-driven framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The adverse environmental consequences and diminishing trend of fossil fuel reserves indicate a serious need for vibrant and judicious energy policy. Energy policy involves a number of stakeholders, and needs to incorporate the interests and requirements of all the key stakeholder groups. This paper presents a methodological technique to assist with formulating, evaluating, and promoting the energy policy of a country in a transparent and representative way with clear scientific justifications and balanced assessments. The multicriteria decision analysis approach has been a widely used technique for evaluating different alternatives based on the interests of a multitude of stakeholders, and goals. This paper utilizes the SMAA (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis) tool, which can evaluate different alternatives by incorporating multiple criteria, in order to examine the preferences of different policy elements. We further extend this technique by incorporating the LEAP model (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system) to assess the emission impacts of different policy elements. We demonstrate the application of this evaluation technique by an analysis of four hypothetical policy elements namely Business-as usual (BAU), Renewables (REN), Renewable-biomass only (REN-b), and Energy conservation and efficient technologies (ECET). These are applied to the case of sharing fuel sources for power generation for the Bangladesh power sector. We found that the REN-b and REN policy elements were the best and second best alternatives with 41% and 32% acceptability respectively. This technique gives transparent information for choosing appropriate policy elements that aimed at sustainable energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Interconnectivity and interoperability are very important features in the development of integrated energy management systems for industrial facilities. A simple and common strategy for exchanging energy-related information among the entities in a facility is currently lacking. To this end, the purpose of this study is to present an IoT-based communication framework with a common information model to facilitate the development of a demand response (DR) energy management system for industrial customers. Additionally, we developed and implemented an IoT-based energy-management platform based on a common information model and open communication protocols, which takes advantage of integrated energy supply networks to deploy DR energy management in an industrial facility. The experimental results of this study demonstrate that the proposed platform can not only improve the interconnectivity of the entities in industrial energy management systems but also reduce the energy costs of industrial facilities.

Abstract: The impact of avoiding the start-up and shut-down losses of a solar thermal power plant by directly integrating the back-up boiler into a tubular solar-only cavity receiver is studied using a multiple time-step, piecewise-continuous model. A steady-state analytical model of the mass and energy flows through both this device and a solar-only cavity receiver reported previously are incorporated within a model of the solar power generating plant with storage. The performance of the Hybrid Solar Receiver Combustor (HSRC) is compared with an equivalent reference conventional hybrid solar thermal system employing a solar-only cavity receiver and a back-up boiler. The model accounts for start-up and shut-down losses of the boiler, threshold losses of the solar-only cavity receiver and the amount of trace heating required to avoid cooling of the heat transfer fluid. The model is implemented for a 12 month/five year time-series of historical Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) at 1 h time-steps to account for the variability in the solar resource at four sites spanning Australia and the USA. A method to optimize the size of the heliostat field is also reported, based on the dumped fraction of solar power from the heliostat field. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for the HSRC configuration was estimated to be reduced by up to 17% relative to the equivalent conventional hybrid solar thermal system depending on the cost of the fuel, the storage capacity and the solar resource, while the fuel consumption was estimated to be reduced by some 12-31%.

Abstract: In an integrated steel mill, the byproduct gases of steel production processes can be recovered as fuel for the plant itself and can be used to generate electricity and steam in power plants. This work addresses the development of a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve the problem of byproduct fuel distribution, with the goal of maximizing energy utilization. Improvements are made in the formulation of the model and a heuristic procedure is proposed to assign appropriate weights to the objective function penalties, resulting in an increase in the operational performance of the fuel distribution system. Through case studies, a comparison is performed among a previous MILP-based optimization model found in the literature, the improved one proposed in this work and the real-world behavior of a fuel distribution system run by the operators without the aid of a computational tool.

Abstract: Environmental and security concerns urge energy planners to design more sustainable energy systems, reducing fossil fuel consumptions in favour of renewable solutions. The proposed scenarios typically rely on a mixing of different energy sources, thereby mitigating the availability and intermittency problems typically related to renewable technologies. Optimizing this combination is of crucial importance to cope with economic, technical, and environmental issues, which typically give rise to multiple contradictory objectives. To this purpose, this article presents a generalized framework coupling EnergyPLAN - a descriptive analytical model for medium/large-scale energy systems - with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm - a type of optimizer widely used in the context of complex problems. By using this framework, it is possible to automatically identify a set of Pareto-optimal configurations with respect to different competing objectives. As an example, the method is applied to the case of Aalborg municipality, Denmark, by choosing cost and carbon emission minimization as contrasting goals. Results are compared with a manually identified scenario, taken from previous literature. The automatic approach, while confirming that the available manual solution is very close to optimality, yields an entire set of additional optimal solutions, showing its effectiveness in the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of combinations.

Abstract: The Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell is a promising energy converter for various fields of application: stationary, portable and mobile. However durability avoids its widespread deployment. Deterioration mechanisms are not all fully understood and that is the reason why the prognostic of such device is gaining attention. This helps determine the present and future state of health of Fuel Cell, to deduce the remaining life in order to take corrective actions. The work presented in this paper attempts to address this issue by proposing a method based on a degradation model. An observer, based on an Extended Kalman Filter, estimates the state of health and the dynamic of the degradations. This result is extrapolated until a threshold is reached and the residual life is deduced. This method allows estimating the lifespan with a single model, robust to uncertainties, whatever the operating conditions are. Simulations are conducted to validate the method. Finally, this framework is used on a set of experimental data from long term test on a 5-cell stack operated under a constant current solicitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Design optimisation problems of window size and facade orientation in buildings have been investigated many times, with regard to energy and comfort criteria. To indicate daylight availability in indoor spaces, a number of daylight metrics have been proposed, but those metrics are not always fully accounted in the optimisation process. Also, most studies were conducted for locations with high latitude, where the sun is located most of the time either at the south or at the north part of the sky hemisphere, which is not the case in the tropics. Therefore, this article presents a simulation study to investigate the influence of window-to-wall ratio (WWR), wall reflectance, and window orientation on various daylight metrics and lighting energy demand in simple buildings located in the tropical climate. A simple approach for the multi-objective optimisation was proposed by classifying the results in six pairs of two different performance indicators. Solutions in all Pareto frontiers were filtered against the defined target criteria, and were accepted into the optimum solution space if they belong to at least 4 out of 6 Pareto frontiers, and were ranked either in the order of their mean distance to the utopia points, or in the order of number of times they belong to a Pareto frontier. Three optimum solutions are found, all of which belong to four Pareto frontiers. The most optimum solution with the least mean distance to the utopia points is the combination of WWR 30%, wall reflectance of 0.8, and south orientation. The proposed approach enables one to observe the inter-relationship between the involved performance indicators, while providing a possibility to visualise the boundaries of the solution space.

Abstract: The paper presents a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment for two domestic solar hot water systems. The first consists of polypropylene unglazed solar panels coupled with a 300-1 storage tank; the second one consists of a traditional system with glazed solar panels coupled with a thermal storage of the same volume. Life cycle assessment was conducted according to the Eco-Indicator 99 methodology, Egalitarian Approach, yielding 49.7 and 18.3 eco-indicator points for the glazed and unglazed panels systems, respectively. In addition, for each domestic solar hot water system, the energy, CO2 and economic payback times were calculated. In order to take into account the influence of local climate on the solar panels yield evaluate, the systems performance was simulated for three different locations; Rome, Madrid and Munich. The payback times were evaluated with respect to both natural gas and electrical boilers. The Energy Payback Time of the unglazed panel system ranges between 2 and 5 months, that of the glazed panel between 5 and 12 months. The CO2 Payback Time of the unglazed panel system ranges between 1 and 2 months, that of the glazed panel between 12 and 30 months.
The economic payback time, if compared with natural gas boiler, is in the range 9-11 years/8-13 years for the system with unglazed/glazed panels, respectively; if compared with the electrical boiler, it is in the range of 3-4 years for the system with unglazed panels and 4 years for that with glazed panels. The different national costs of natural gas and/or electricity play an important role in the economic payback times. Indeed, in Munich, the smaller energy savings achieved with the renewable systems are offset by the higher costs of these commodities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The segmental design method is employed to accurately capture the drastic variations of properties in the supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) recuperator. The local heat capacity flow rates of both fluids have drastic changes in sub-heat exchangers even the mass flow rates of both fluids remain unchanged. When the heat duty is given, the local heat conductance, local temperature difference, local effectiveness and local entransy dissipation number have extremums, which appear in the vicinity of the heat capacity rate ratio is one. The heat transfer performance of recuperator improves at the expense of heat conductance. When the total heat conductance is fixed, there exist the maximum local heat flux rates, and the local effectiveness tends to be constant after the local heat capacity rate ratio reaches one, the local entransy dissipation number has the relatively coherent performance behavior in the sub-heat exchangers. The local heat capacity rate ratio has crucial influences on the heat transfer performance of recuperator, and the design parameters must be considered carefully in the design of S-CO2 recuperator.

Abstract: This contribution deals with the development of suitable operating strategies for diesel/kerosene-fueled fuel cell APUs. The focus is on the autothermal reformer (ATR) and the water-gas shift (WGS) reactor. In the first part shutdown experiments under high-temperature shift (HTS) conditions were used to identify the possible detrimental effect of higher hydrocarbons on the activity and stability of two commercial WGS catalysts. The results indicated that 220 ppmv higher hydrocarbons had no negative effect on the catalyst activity/stability. The second part presents fuel processing system experiments, which revealed much higher concentrations of higher hydrocarbons during transients like startup/shutdown than the concentrations investigated in the first part. Through the development of new startup/shutdown strategies concentrations of higher hydrocarbons were lowered by a factor of up to 10 for startup and of up to 400 for shutdown. The results were reproduced using four different diesel and kerosene fuels. The newly developed strategies improve fuel conversion in the reformer and may possibly prevent catalyst deactivation in the water-gas shift reactor during transient conditions.

Abstract: This study analyses the sustainability of fuel ethanol production from cane molasses in Indonesia. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to evaluate the net emissions (climate change impact) and energy inputs (resource consumption) in the production chain. The lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production and use of ethanol are estimated at 29 gCO(2eq) per MJ of ethanol produced which is a 67% reduction in comparison to gasoline emissions. Net Energy Value (NEV) and Net Renewable Energy Value (NREV) are -7 MJ/I and 17.7 MJ/I, while the energy yield ratio (ER) is 6.1. Economic allocation is chosen for dividing environmental burdens and resource consumption between sugar (i.e, main product) and molasses (i.e. co-product used for fuel production). Sensitivity analysis of various parameters is performed. The emissions and energy values are highly sensitive to sugarcane yield, ethanol yield, and the price of molasses. The use of sugarcane biomass residues (bagasse/trash) for efficient cogeneration, and different waste management options for the treatment of spent wash (effluent of distilleries) are also explored. Surplus bioelectricity generation in the efficient cogeneration plant, biogas recovery from wastewater treatment plant, and their use for fossil fuel substitution can help improve energy and environmental gains. The study also compares important results with other relevant international studies and discusses issues related to land use change (LUC) impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Biomass transport cost from field to a conversion facility is a major component of biofuel production cost. Several studies have provided a general framework, independent of location, for maximising cost competitiveness of bioenergy plants. The majority of these studies assume uniform spatial distribution of biomass and road network, independent of the size of the biorefinery. Although this assumption simplifies the theoretical derivation, it may not be suitable for practical cases. We develop a more generic biomass transport model that allows biomass yield density and road network vary with transport radius, and then derive a formula for determining biomass transport cost, which more accurately represents changes in biomass transport cost with conversion plant capacity. The formula can be used to evaluate locations and investment opportunities in large scale biofuel production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In most of the world, borehole heat exchangers used with closed-loop ground source heat pump systems are backfilled with a low permeability grout to prevent water contamination. However, in Scandinavian countries, a different approach is taken - the borehole is sealed at the top and cased down to solid bedrock. The borehole then naturally fills with groundwater in the annular space between the U-tube and the borehole wall. Compared to grouted boreholes, the groundwater filling is advantageous in that it generally results in low borehole thermal resistance due to buoyancy-driven natural convection enhancing the heat transfer. Although this phenomena has been reported in several papers since the late 1980s, no calculation models have been available for use in either design tools or simulation programs. This paper presents experimental measurements from a single well-instrumented borehole under a range of heat transfer rates and annulus temperatures. Nusselt numbers for natural convection in the annulus are correlated against modified Rayleigh number. The results are verified by comparing to borehole thermal resistances predicted with the correlations to actual measurements from a range of boreholes in Sweden and Norway. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: High spatial and temporal resolution optimal power flow simulations of the 2013 and 2020 interconnected grid in Central Western and Eastern Europe regions are undertaken to assess the impact of an increased penetration of renewables on thermal power plants. In contrast to prior studies, the present work models each individual transmission line and power plant within the two regions. Furthermore, for conventional plants, electricity costs are determined with respect to fuel type, nameplate capacity, operating condition and geographic location; cycling costs are modeled as function of the recent operational history. For renewable power plants, costs and available power are determined using mesoscale weather simulations and hydrology models. Countrywide validation of the simulations shows that all renewable and most conventional power production is predicted with less than 10% error. It is shown that the increased penetration of renewables in 2020 will induce a 4-23% increase in the number of starts of conventional plants. The number of load ramps significantly increases by 63-181%, which underlines the necessity for equipment manufacturers and utilities to adapt to scenarios of high penetration of renewables. The increased cycling operation of coal plants is shown to depend strongly on the power plant's location and is mainly observed in Germany and the Czech Republic. Austrian coal plants are cycled less because they supply more base load power to southern Germany, where several nuclear power plants will be phased out by 2020. Thus there is a need for more transmission capacity along Germany's north-south corridor to transport renewable power from the windy regions of northern Germany to the demand centers in southern Germany.

Abstract: Two general methods to start the engine are investigated by the linear electric machine operating as a linear motor and identified one for a specific FPEG prototype configuration. Based on that, a novel method to start the engine by mechanical resonance is proposed. Both simulation and test results are presented, and the numerical model is successfully validated. The results show that with a fixed motor force of 110 N, within 0.5 s, the maximum in-cylinder pressure could reach 13 bar, indicating that the engine is ready for ignition. Further investigation on the engine performance with the closed-loop control strategy is carried out. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to start the FPEG with mechanical resonance with a closed-loop controlled electric linear machine that applies a proper constant motor force in the direction of the natural bouncing motion. With different starting motor force, the top dead centre (TDC) value for both cylinder is different during the first few running cycles, but the difference reduces and tends to be zero during the stable resonance state. There is not any significant difference observed on the engine frequency and piston profile during combustion process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The environmental impacts of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power generation from crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar modules in China have been investigated using life cycle assessment (LCA). The life cycle inventory was first analyzed. Then the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission during every process were estimated in detail, and finally the life-cycle value was calculated. The results showed that the energy payback time (T-EPBT) of grid-connected PV power with crystalline silicon solar modules ranges from 1.6 to 2.3 years, while the GHG emissions now range from 60.1 to 87.3 g-CO2,eq/kW h depending on the installation methods. About 84% or even more of the total energy consumption and total GHG emission occupied during the PV manufacturing process. The solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) production is the most energy consuming and GHG-emitting process, which accounts for more than 35% of the total energy consumption and the total GHG emission. The results presented in this study are expected to provide useful information to enact reasonable policies, development targets, as well as subsidies for PV technology in China.

Abstract: The gap between calculated and actual energy use has long be recognized as a major hurdle for a realistic assessment of buildings' performance and anticipated benefits from energy conservation measures, especially when attempting a national building stock analysis. A multinational European effort to develop a conceptual framework for monitoring the effectiveness of energy retrofit measures applied in the European housing sector has motivated a number of national pilot actions. This paper presents the results from the work carried out in Greece and elaborates a methodology for deriving different empirical adaptation factors that relate the normative calculated heating energy consumption from energy performance certificates (EPC) with the actual energy use. To gain some additional insight, the work is complemented by evidence from field surveys to collect actual energy use data from dwellings before and after refurbishment and behavioural surveys of occupants. The derived factors are used to adapt the predictions, which are then organized according to the Hellenic residential building typology. The overall approach is used with a building stock model to demonstrate a preliminary assessment of different energy conservation measures, towards meeting the national targets for 2020 and 2030.
The ratio of actual to calculated primary energy consumption using the processed EPC data from over 8500 dwellings, averages 0.56 (i.e. 44% lower energy use than calculated). Findings from field surveys of occupant behavioural changes in the operation of space heating systems, confirm poor indoor thermal comfort conditions resulting from reduced operating hours of space heating, lower thermostat settings etc., which deviate significantly from normative calculation assumptions. Other field data on actual energy use before and after refurbishment provide additional insight for adapting the predicted savings as a result of common retrofit actions. Popular measures include for older buildings the installation of double glazed windows, the replacement of heat production systems and roof thermal insulation. On average, the weather corrected actual primary heating energy savings are about 21% by installing double glazed windows and about 18% by replacing an oil-fired boiler with a new natural gas unit. The application of the results with a building stock model illustrates that future energy and emission targets could be reached with the conservative adaptation factors, but will mandate combined measures and more aggressive modernization rates using an average trend scenario.

Abstract: PV/Thermal flat transpired plate is a kind of air-based hybrid Photovoltaic/Thermal (PV/T) system concurrently producing both thermal and electrical energy. In order to develop a predictive model, validate, and investigate the PV/Thermal flat transpired plate capabilities, a prototype was fabricated and tested under outdoor conditions at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman in Kerman, Iran. In order to develop a mathematical model, correlations for Nusselt numbers for PV panel and transpired plate were derived using CFD technique. Good agreement was obtained between measured and simulated values, with the maximum relative root mean square percent deviation (RMSE) being 9.13% and minimum correlation coefficient (R-squared) 0.92. Based on the critical radiation level defined in terms of the actual exergy gain, it was found that with proper fan and MPPT devices, there is no concern about the critical radiation level. To provide a guideline for designers, using equivalent thermal efficiency as an appropriate tool, optimum values for suction velocity and PV coverage percent under different conditions were obtained.

Abstract: Accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimation is critical for the safety and reliability of battery management systems in electric vehicles. Because SOC cannot be directly measured and SOC estimation is affected by many factors, such as ambient temperature, battery aging, and current rate, a robust SOC estimation approach is necessary to be developed so as to deal with time-varying and nonlinear battery systems. In this paper, three popular model-based filtering algorithms, including extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and particle filter, are respectively used to estimate SOC and their performances regarding to tracking accuracy, computation time, robustness against uncertainty of initial values of SOC, and battery degradation, are compared. To evaluate the performances of these algorithms, a new combined dynamic loading profile composed of the dynamic stress test, the federal urban driving schedule and the US06 is proposed. The comparison results showed that the unscented Kalman filter is the most robust to different initial values of SOC, while the particle filter owns the fastest convergence ability when an initial guess of SOC is far from a true initial SOC.

Abstract: Deep air-staged combustion tests of Datong (DT) bituminous coal were carried out in a 20 kW down flame furnace (DFF) with the burner stoichiometric ratio (SR) ranging from 1.200 (unstaged) to as low as 0.696 (deep staged). The experimental results shown that the concentration of CO reach as high as 120,000 ppm (12 vol.%) and the NOx decrease to nearly zero in the reducing zone under deep staging conditions of SR = 0.696, which was never observed before. Thus, the extent of CO formation (i.e. char gasification) and the NOx reaction mechanism under deep staging condition were studied in order to understand the combustion process of coal. This paper presents a refined numerical simulation for reproducing the profiles of CO and NOx along the DFF under deep staging condition. The comparison between simulation and experimental results prove the reasonability of refined kinetic parameters of char gasification. The enhancement of char gasification by CO2 is proposed and validated. With the simulated CO profile in the DFF confirmed by experiment, the NOx profile could be further analyzed. The discrepancy of simulated NOx profile in the reducing zone (i.e. fuel-rich zone) indicates that there are some undetected nitrogenous species and undiscovered NOx transfer mechanism regardless of the consistence of final NOx emission between simulation and experiment. It is supposed by us that a majority of NOx immersing in high level of CO in the reducing zone is mainly transferred into undetected nitrogenous species (excluding HCN and NH3) which is then rapidly oxidized into NOx once the remaining oxygen is injected into the DFF.

Abstract: The performance of solar radiation models is evaluated based on time domain statistical metrics. These metrics include root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). However, this study adopts a new approach to model validation in phase and frequency domains. The study proposes frequency coherence and phase synchronization methods quantified into frequency coherence index (FCI) and phase lock value (PLV), respectively. To get more in-depth insight of the model's performance, important visual indicators based on wavelet cross-spectrum (WCS) and wavelet coherence analysis (WCA) are presented. Two different widely used solar radiation models based on artificial neural network (ANN) namely, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), are analysed. The proposed techniques are used to exploit weaknesses and strengths of the models. Anomalies in phase and frequency components are identified and the information is used to increase their performance. The MLP is modified into a non-linear autoregressive recurrent exogenous neural networks (NARX-NN) using recursive filtering. Results show that NARX-NN corrects the phase differences, filters out the faulty frequency components and increases the time domain validation metric, i.e. R-2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to considering the effect of seasonal changes in soil temperature on the performance of a horizontal geo heat exchanger. It is different from extant models which consider the seasonal changes in soil temperature by applying a real energy balance on the ground surface. In the new model, the seasonal changes in soil temperature, which are affected by the thermal interaction between the ground and the atmosphere, are expressed as an internal source term. The value of the internal source term depends on the soil density, soil specific heat, soil temperature difference during summer and winter, and time period. The simulation results show that the new approach, which takes into account the effect of periodic soil temperature fluctuations on the performance of the horizontal geo heat exchanger, is valid. The validated model is then used to conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the pipe length, fluid flow rate, inlet fluid temperature, and burial depth on the thermal performance of the horizontal geo heat exchanger.

Abstract: Platinum-tungsten trioxide nanocomposite electrocatalysts on carbon black support (Pt-WO3/C) are synthesized and their electrocatalytic performances toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are investigated in this study. Tungsten trioxide, which derived from the hydrolysis of tungsten hexachloride (WCl6) in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, is firstly deposited onto pristine or NaOH-treated Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (C or C-s) support to obtain tungsten trioxide/carbon black (WO3/C or WO3/C-s) nanocomposites, and then Pt nanoparticles are decorated onto these nanocomposites by polyol method to obtain PtWO3/C or Pt-WO3/C-s electrocatalysts. XRD and TEM characterizations are performed to examine the WO3 structures and the size distributions of the Pt nanoparticles. The effects of WO3 loading, annealing temperature and the NaOH-treatment of carbon black support on MOR mass activity and CO-tolerance ability of the electrocatalysts are investigated. The electrocatalyst (PtW(0.08)C(s)200) with the WO3/C-s nanocomposite derived from a DMF solution containing 0.08 M WC16, using NaOH-treated XC-72 carbon black as the support and annealed at 200 degrees C, achieves the highest MOR activity among all the electrocatalysts synthesized in this study. The MOR performances of PtW(0.08)C(s)200 is superior to that of the commercial ETEK Pt(20 wt%)/C and E-TEK PtRu(20 wt%)/C electrocatalysts under the same test conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A steady state analysis method was developed for gas networks with distributed injection of alternative gas. A low pressure gas network was used to validate the method. Case studies were carried out with centralized and decentralized injection of hydrogen and upgraded biogas. Results show the impact of utilizing a diversity of gas supply sources on pressure distribution and gas quality in the network. It is shown that appropriate management of using a diversity of gas supply sources can support network management while reducing carbon emissions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a data driven probabilistic graphic model to predict building energy performance. A directed graphical model, namely, a Bayesian Networks (BNs) model is created. Each node in the BNs represents a random variable such as outside air temperature and energy end use. The links between the nodes are probabilistic dependencies among these corresponding variables. These dependencies are statistically learned and/or estimated by using measured data and augmented by domain expert knowledge. BNs models became popular models in the last decade and only recently received attention for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning) applications. A case study of using a BNs model to predict HVAC hot water energy consumption in an office building is presented. The energy estimation results meet with the criteria recommended by ASHRAE Guideline 14. This case study also shown that the discretized Bayesian Network model is sensitive to the discretization policy (i.e., bin size selection) employed. The applicability of a BNs model becomes questionable outside the range in which the model is learned. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: When the surface temperature of the outdoor coil in an air source heat pump (ASHP) unit is lower than both the air dew point and freezing point of water, frost can be formed and accumulated over outdoor coil's surface. On the other hand, an outdoor coil normally has multiple parallel circuits on its refrigerant side for minimized refrigerant pressure loss and enhanced heat transfer efficiency. Currently, most attentions were paid to the experimental and numerical studies on defrosting with different methods, without however paying attention to the distribution of frost accumulation on the multi-circuit outdoor coil. The phenomenon of uneven frosting exists, which also maybe the most important reason of uneven defrosting for an ASHP unit with a multi-circuit outdoor coil. Therefore, in this study, a comparative and experimental study on system frosting performance when frost accumulated on a three-circuit outdoor coil's surface in an ASHP unit at different frosting evenness values (FEVs) has been carried out. Experimental results indicated that, when the FEV was increased from 75.7% to 90.5% for an ASHP unit with a three circuit outdoor coil, the COP could be increased from 4.10 to 4.26 at a 3600 s frosting process, and increased from 3.18 to 4.00 at its last 600 s.

Abstract: One of the main classified microgrids in a power system is the industrial microgrid. Due to its behaviors and the heavy loads, its energy management is challengeable. Virtual Power Plant (VPP) can be an important concept in managing such problems in this kind of grids. Here, a transmission power system is considered as a Regional Electric Company (REC) and the VPPs comprising Distributed Generation (DG) units and Demand Response Loads (DRLs) are determined in this system. This paper focuses on Industrial VPP (IVPP) and its management. An IVPP can be determined as a management unit comprising generations and loads in an industrial microgrid. Since the scheduling procedure for these units is very important for their participation in a short-term electric market, a stochastic formulation is proposed for power scheduling in VPPs especially in IVPPs in this paper. By introducing the DRL programs and using the proposed modeling, the operator can select the best DRL program for each VPP in a scheduling procedure. In this regard, a suitable approach is presented to determine the proposed formulation and its solution in a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP). To validate the performance of the proposed method, the IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE-RTS) is considered to apply the method on it, while some challenging aspects are presented.

Abstract: A latent heat storage system for concentrated solar plants (CSP) is numerically examined by means of CFD simulations. This study aims at identifying the convective flows produced within the melted phase by temperature gradients and gravity. Simulations were carried out on experimental devices for applications to high temperature concentrated solar power plants. A shell-and-tube geometry composed by a vertical cylindrical tank, filled by a Phase Change Material (PCM) and an inner steel tube, in which the heat transfer fluid (HTF) flows, from the top to the bottom, is considered. The conjugate heat transfer process is examined by solving the unsteady Navier Stokes equations for HTF and PCM and conduction for the tube. In order to take into account the buoyancy effects in the PCM tank the Boussinesq approximation is adopted. The results show that the enhanced heat flux, due to natural convective flow, reduce of about 30% the time needed to charge the heat storage. A detailed description of the convective motion in the melted phase and the heat flux distribution between the HTF and PCM are reported. The effect of the mushy zone constant is also investigated.

Abstract: A pulse tube cryocooler (PTC) cannot work with Carnot efficiency due basically to the expansion work that has to be dissipated thermally at the warm end of the pulse tube, this dissipation is especially phenomenal with high cooling capacity or at high temperatures which reduces the COP and limits the application of PTC above 120 K. Therefore, how to recover this amount of dissipated work becomes a critical issue in a high efficient PTC. Here, we proposed a cascade PTC with a built-in transmission tube between stages for energy recovery. The key point of this new configuration is that the acoustic power at the outlet of the primary stage can be recovered through the transmission tube which provides proper phase angle to drive the secondary stage. This idea is verified both theoretically and experimentally. The cooling efficiency can be improved by 33% when the machine works at 233 K. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The regenerative liquid ring (RLR) pump is a type of rotodynamic machine which has the ability to develop high heads at relatively low flow rates in only one impeller stage. Although the exact principle of operation of this type of pump has been a phenomenon not fully understood, it has nevertheless been widely applied for over a century in areas of liquid pumping. Despite the low efficiency, RLR pumps have several advantages over other turbomachines with similar tip speed due to relatively low manufacturing costs, simplicity, high reliability, enhanced priming behaviour and can in many applications offer a more efficient alternative. Efficiency improvements are key to reducing energy consumption and ultimately combatting the global climate change. This paper offers an extensive review into the development, performance challenges and design improvements of RLR pumps in order to provide some useful insight on future research and next steps, with a particular focus on improving efficiency throughout the pump life cycle.

Abstract: In this work, a new design of thermoelectric cooler (TEC) with variable semiconductor cross-sectional area is proposed to improve its transient supercooling characteristics. Four key evaluation indicators of transient supercooling for the conventional and new designs, including the minimum cold end temperature, maximum temperature overshoot, holding time of transient state, and recovery time ready for next steady-state, are examined and compared by a three-dimensional, transient, and multiphysics model. Two additional effects are observed in the TEC with variable semiconductor cross-sectional area. First, the variable cross-sectional area makes the thermal circuit asymmetric, so that Joule heat is preferentially conducted toward to the end with a larger cross-sectional area. Second, more Joule heat is produced close to the end with a smaller cross-sectional area. The present simulations find that these two effects can be utilized to achieve the desired evaluation indicators by changing the cross-sectional area ratio of hot end to cold end. When a lower cold end temperature, a smaller temperature overshoot, and/or a longer holding time are/is required, a larger cross-sectional area at the cold end is recommended. However, to achieve a shorter recovery time, a smaller cross-sectional area at the cold end is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Various solutions are being proposed to improve the performance of spark-ignition internal combustion engines. A very effective approach is the downsizing technique, which allows the reducing of the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) at part load, while maintaining the required performance at high load. On the other hand, the above technique may cause substantial BSFC detrainments at high load because of the onset of knocldng combustions.
In the present work, a turbocharged spark ignition engine equipped with a fully flexible valve system is numerically investigated by a 1D model (GT-Power (TM)). Proper "user routines" are used to simulate the turbulent combustion process and the knock phenomenon. In a first stage, the engine model is validated against experimental data under both high and part load operations, in terms of overall performance and combustion evolution. The validated model is then integrated in a multipurpose commercial optimizer (modeFRONTIER (TM)) with the aim to identify the engine calibrations that maximize the load and minimize the BSFC under high load knock-limited operations at a speed of 3000 rpm. The effects of different intake valve strategies are compared. The optimized operating parameters are the waste-gate valve opening and the air-to-fuel ratio, while the combustion phasing is automatically adjusted to avoid the knock onset. Proper constraints are assigned for the boost pressure, turbocharger speed, and turbine inlet temperature. The adopted optimization process shows the capability to reproduce the experimentally-identified calibration with satisfactory accuracy. In addition, the results underline the BSFC advantages related to an early intake valve closure strategy with respect to a Full Lift one, due to a better combustion phasing and a reduced mixture over-fuelling.
The developed automatic procedure allows for a "virtual" engine calibration on a completely theoretical basis and proves to be very helpful in reducing the engine development costs and time-to-market. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There is currently a lack of data recording the carbon and emissions inventory at household level. This paper presents a multi-disciplinary, bottom-up approach for estimation and analysis of the carbon emissions, and the organic carbon (OC) stored in gardens, using a sample of 575 households across a UK city. The annual emission of carbon dioxide emissions from energy used in the homes was measured, personal transport emissions were assessed through a household survey and OC stores estimated from soil sampling and vegetation surveys. The results showed that overall carbon patterns were skewed with highest emitting third of the households being responsible for more than 50% of the emissions and around 50% of garden OC storage. There was diversity in the relative contribution that gas, electricity and personal transport made to each household's total and different patterns were observed for high, medium and low emitting households. Targeting households with high carbon emissions from one source would not reliably identify them as high emitters overall. While carbon emissions could not be offset by growing trees in gardens, there were considerable amounts of stored OC in gardens which ought to be protected. Exploratory analysis of the multiple drivers of emissions was conducted using a combination of primary and secondary data. These findings will be relevant in devising effective policy instruments for combatting city scale green-house gas emissions from domestic end-use energy demand. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract: A symmetric outward convex corrugated tube design is introduced for parabolic trough receivers with the aim of increasing their heat transfer performance and reliability. An optical-thermal-structural sequential coupled method was developed to analyze the heat transfer performance and thermal deformation of the glass cover and metal tube of the parabolic trough receiver. The developed coupled method has been validated with experimental results conducted in the DISS test facility in Spain. The numerical results indicated that the introduction of a symmetric outward convex corrugated tube design for the metal tube of the parabolic trough receiver can effectively enhance the heat transfer performance and decrease the thermal strain. The effective heat transfer coefficient can be increased up to 8.4% and the maximum thermal strain of metal tube can be decreased up to 13.1% when symmetric outward convex corrugated tube is used at Re = 81728, p/D = 4.3. In addition, regression correlations are put forward in order to find an effective heat transfer coefficient and effective Nusselt number for the fluid flow in the parabolic trough receiver.

Abstract: The use of an electric pump instead of the standard crankshaft-driven one in Internal Combustion Engines, gives the possibility of controlling the coolant flow rate independently of engine speed, allowing therefore, the use of much lower coolant flow rates than usually adopted and the development of nucleate boiling flow regimes within the engine cooling system. In order to take advantage of nucleate boiling and of the associated high heat transfer coefficients, the onset of this heat transfer regime must be correctly identified. This work presents the results of an experimental campaign, which was carried out on a small displacement spark ignition engine (1.2 dm(3), 60 kW) with the aim of detecting the occurrence of nucleate boiling within the engine cooling system. The test rig was properly instrumented in order to measure coolant temperatures at engine inlet and outlet, coolant pressure at several locations in the circuit, coolant flow rate and engine metal temperatures. Operating conditions involving different coolant flow rates were selected in order to enforce both the usual single-phase heat transfer regime and nucleate boiling conditions. Several experimental quantities were analyzed with the aim of establishing the coolant flow rates ranges where the nucleate boiling occurs. The agreement in the trend of coolant temperature and pressure and engine wall temperature provides hints to identify experimentally the onset of nucleate boiling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Wind energy is expected to contribute to alleviating the rise in energy demand in the Middle East that is driven by population growth and industrial development. However, variability and intermittency in the wind resource present significant challenges to grid integration of wind energy systems. These issues are rarely addressed in the literature of wind resource assessment in the Middle East due to sparse meteorological observations with varying record lengths. In this study, the wind field with consistent space-time resolution for over three decades at three hub heights (50 m, 80 m, 140 m) over the whole Arabian Peninsula is constructed using the Modem Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset. The wind resource is assessed at a higher spatial resolution with metrics of temporal variations in the wind than in prior studies. Previously unrecognized locations of interest with high wind abundance and low variability and intermittency have been identified in this study and confirmed by recent on-site observations. In particular, the western mountains of Saudi Arabia experience more abundant wind resource than most Red Sea coastal areas. The wind resource is more variable in coastal areas along the Arabian Gulf than their Red Sea counterparts at a similar latitude. Persistent wind is found along the coast of the Arabian Gulf.

Abstract: Battery energy storage (BES) is one of a set of technologies that can be considered to reduce electrical loads, and to realize economic value for industrial customers. To directly compare the energy savings and economic effectiveness of BES to more conventional energy efficiency technologies, this study collected detailed information regarding the electrical loads associated with four Colorado manufacturing facilities. These datasets were used to generate a set of three scenarios for each manufacturer: implementation of a BES system, implementation of a set of conventional energy efficiency recommendations, and the implementation of both BES and conventional energy efficiency technologies. Evaluating these scenarios' economic payback period allows for a direct comparison between the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency technologies and that of BES, demonstrates the costs and benefits of implementing both BES and energy efficiency technologies, and characterizes the effectiveness of potential incentives in improving economic payback. For all of the manufacturing facilities modeled, results demonstrate that BES is the least cost-effective among the energy efficiency technologies considered, but that simultaneous implementation of both BES and energy efficiency technologies has a negligible effect on the BES payback period. Incentives are demonstrated to be required for BES to achieve near-term payback period parity with more conventional energy efficiency technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The final carbon conversion rate is of critical importance in the efficiency of gasifiers. Therefore, comprehensive modeling of char particle conversion is of primary interest for designing new gasifiers. This work presents a novel intrinsic-based submodel for the gasification of a char particle moving in a hot flue gas environment considering CO2 and H2O as inlet species. The first part of the manuscript describes the model and its derivation. Validations against experiments carried out in this work for German lignite char are reported in the second part. The comparison between submodel predictions and experimental data shows good agreement. The importance of char porosity change during gasification is demonstrated. The third part presents the results of CFD simulations using the new submodel and a surface-based sub model for a generic endothermic gasifier. The focus of CFD simulations is to demonstrate the crucial role of intrinsic based heterogeneous reactions in the adequate prediction of carbon conversion rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The increase in energy demand has led to expansion of renewable energy sources and their integration into a more diverse energy mix. Consequently the operation of thermal power plants, which are spearheaded by the gas turbine technology, has been affected. Gas turbines are now required to operate more flexible in grid supporting modes that include part-load and transient operations. Therefore, condition based maintenance should encapsulate this recent shift in the gas turbine's role by taking into account dynamic operating conditions for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In this paper, a novel scheme for performance-based prognostics of industrial gas turbines operating under dynamic conditions is proposed and developed. The concept of performance adaptation is introduced and implemented through a dynamic engine model that is developed in Matlab/Simulink environment for diagnosing and prognosing the health of gas turbine components. Our proposed scheme is tested under variable ambient conditions corresponding to dynamic operational modes of the gas turbine for estimating and predicting multiple component degradations. The diagnosis task developed is based on an adaptive method and is performed in a sliding window-based manner. A regression-based method is then implemented to locally represent the diagnostic information for subsequently forecasting the performance behavior of the engine. The accuracy of the proposed prognosis scheme is evaluated through the Probability Density Function (PDF) and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) metrics. The results demonstrate a promising prospect of our proposed methodology for detecting and predicting accurately and efficiently the performance of gas turbine components as they degrade over time.

Abstract: Integration of large-scale wind power creates challenges for power system operations. One of the effective ways of dealing with these challenges is to build thermal power plants to form bundled wind-thermal generation system (BWTGS), i.e., using thermal power to alleviate the fluctuation of wind power. This paper presents a method for optimal capacity and type planning of BWTGS with the given wind farms. Branch-descending technique (BDT) is used to generate candidate schemes of thermal generating units by analyzing the rules of total cost changing with the reduction of the number of thermal generating units. The optimal scheme of BWTGS can be obtained by simulating a long-term operation process of BWTGS and comparing the total costs of all schemes. Techniques to accelerate computation, such as combining redundant states in dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and the saving-branch-cost technique in BDT, are developed to reduce the computational complexity. The major advantage of the proposed method is that it can be used to obtain not only the optimal capacity of thermal generating units, but also the optimal type and number of thermal generating units. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The building sector in Europe and Sweden accounts for a large part of the total European electricity end use. A large fraction of Swedish buildings are equipped with heat pumps for heating and a combination of heat pumps and decentralized energy generation from photovoltaic systems is an interesting system solution for reducing the energy use. It is important that the building has a high self-consumption of the generated PV-electricity. Self-consumption can be seen as energy conservation and has a considerable higher economic value than exported electricity for the building owner.
A ground source heat pump with a novel weather forecast controller is simulated in Trnsys and compared to a reference case in regards to self-consumption and profitability. The economic analysis is based on the annuity method and a sensitivity analysis regarding annual cost, discount rate and annual electricity price change has been performed.
The results indicates that the increase in self-consumed photovoltaic electricity is limited to 7% with the proposed novel weather forecast controller, which means that the controller is unprofitable. Because of this the proposed novel forecast controller is not a viable way of increasing self consumption in systems with photovoltaic systems and ground source heat pumps in Sweden.

Abstract: In this study, some basic oxide additives are introduced into the conventional Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) cermet anodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for using methane as the fuel. The effects of incorporating basic oxides on the phase composition, electrical conductivity, microstructure, coking tolerance and catalytic/electrocatalytic activity of the anodes are systematically studied. The basic oxide content and the possible phase reactions in the composite anode have considerable effects on the chemical interactions, electrical conductivities and coking resistances of the cermet anodes. The CaO-modified Ni-SDC anode exhibits higher catalytic performance and/or superior coking tolerance than the Ni-SDC and BaO, SrO, MgO, La2O3-modified Ni-SDC anodes under methane steam reforming conditions. The SOFC with a CaO-modified Ni-SDC anode delivers a much higher power generation than the cells composed of the pristine and BaO-modified Ni-SDC anodes using humidified methane fuel at intermediate temperatures. The improved coking resistance of the CaO-modified Ni-SDC anode results in a more stable voltage in the durability test using methane fuel than the cell with a Ni-SDC anode under the same test conditions. In summary, the CaO-modified Ni-SDC composite is a potential coking-resistant and active anode material for SOFCs that use methane as fuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic study of fuel cell gas turbine (SOFC/GT) hybrid systems, focusing on the response to a drastic transient in anode fuel composition for constant turbine speed operations. This work is motivated by the potential of fuel cells for fuel flexibility, which could extend the opportunities for sustainability and profitability in energy conversion systems. A combination of hardware and numerical models in a hybrid simulator is used to investigate the transient trajectories of fuel cell process variables as well as the consequent impacts of fuel cell thermal effluent on the integrated gas turbine engine. The conversion of thermal energy stored in the fuel cell stack to chemical energy during the reforming at the beginning of the cell resulted in a 17% increase in thermal effluent from the fuel cell to the turbine in the first few seconds of the transient. Fuel cell solid temperature gradients increased by 39% at 250 s from the initiation of the transient. The distributed dynamic performance of the fuel cell in terms of the fuel composition gradient, thermal, and electrochemical performance across the fuel cell length was carefully characterized, considering their interactions and their impacts on the total system performance.

Abstract: Small liquid natural gas (LNG) distribution stations require compact, highly efficient cryocoolers to reliquefy boil-off gas in the LNG tank. This paper describes a pulse tube cryocooler measuring 420 mm x 690 mm x 780 mm and weighing 180 kg. With low input electric power, the relative Carnot efficiency exceeded 20%. Increasing the power to 10 kW, the cryocooler produced approximately 1.2 kW of cooling at 120 K. Approximately 295 normal cubic meters of boil-off natural gas per day can be condensed. If heat transfer in the main heat exchanger is improved, cooling power and efficiency could be further improved. This development offers an efficient, compact, and reliable configuration for energy saving in LNG distribution stations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Soft Open Points (SOPS) are power electronic devices installed in place of normally-open points in electrical power distribution networks. They are able to provide active power flow control, reactive power compensation and voltage regulation under normal network operating conditions, as well as fast fault isolation and supply restoration under abnormal conditions. Two control modes were developed for the operation of an SOP, using back-to-back voltage-source converters (VSCs). A power flow control mode with current control provides independent control of real and reactive power. A supply restoration mode with a voltage controller enables power supply to isolated loads due to network faults. The operating principle of the back-to-back VSCs based SOP was investigated under both normal and abnormal network operating conditions. Studies on a two-feeder medium-voltage distribution network showed the performance of the SOP under different network-operating conditions: normal, during a fault and post-fault supply restoration. During the change of network operating conditions, a mode switch method based on the phase locked loop controller was used to achieve the transitions between the two control modes. Hard transitions by a direct mode switching were noticed unfavourable, but seamless transitions were obtained by deploying a soft cold load pickup and voltage synchronization process.

Abstract: Runout Table (ROT) cooling is one of the most important factors for controlling quality of hot rolled steel. ROT cooling uses large quantities of water to cool the steel plate. Optimizing heat transfer in the ROT would reduce the amount of water used, which will lower the amount of energy needed for pumping, filtering, storage and use of water. Optimization will therefore result in a direct energy saving as well as increasing the product quality.
This study investigates heat transfer by turbulent water jets impinging on a hot flat steel plate at temperatures below the boiling point in order to understand convection heat transfer phenomena. This is an important stage that precedes the boiling and addresses the applicability of the heat transfer correlations available in the literature.
A single axisymmetric jet and a pair of interacting jets are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model under steady and transient conditions and the k-epsilon turbulence model are used in both 2D axisymmetric and 3D simulations. We investigate the influence of the water flow rate on the jet cooling characteristics and develop a correlation for the radial position of the maximum Nusselt number based on numerical results.
Two sets of boundary conditions - constant temperature and constant heat flux - are applied at the surface of the steel plate and evaluated. The single jet numerical results compare favourably with published data based on measurements and analytical models. The thermal performance of a two jet system was found to be no better than a single jet because the jets were too far from each other to generate any additional thermal interaction.

Abstract: This work investigated the effective precipitation recovery of boron by chemical oxo-precipitation (COP), which uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to transform aqueous boron to easy-precipitating perborates at room temperature. By using barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)(2)) as a precipitant, the boron removal enhanced with treatment time and the boron level was eventually reduced from 1000 ppm to 3 ppm in four hours. The transformation of the precipitates from amorphous to crystalline was assumed to be responsible for such high boron removal. The aqueous data and the characterization of the precipitates, including elemental analysis, dissolved oxygen, XRD and Raman microscopy, reveal that the phase transformation of perborate species in the precipitates carried out with time during the COP. Mechanisms of COP that describe the precipitates transformation from BaB(OH)(3)OOB(OH)3 and Ba(B(OH)(3)OOH)(2) to BaB(OH)(2)(OO)(2)B(OH)(2) were proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Variable Camshaft Timing strategies have been investigated at part-load operating conditions in two 3 cylinder, 1.0-litre, Spark Ignition engines. The two small-size engines are different variants of the same 4-valve/cylinder, pent-roof design platform. The first engine is naturally aspirated, port fuel injection and features high nominal compression ratio of 12:1. The second one is the turbo-charged, direct injection version, featuring lower compression ratio of 10:1. The aim of the investigation has been to identify optimal camshaft timing strategies which maximise engine thermal efficiency through improvements in brake specific fuel consumption at fixed engine load.
The results of the investigation show that the two engines demonstrate consistent thermal efficiency response to valve timing changes in the low and mid part-load envelope, up to a load of 4 bar BMEP. At the lower engine loads investigated, reduced intake valve opening advance limits the hot burned gas internal recirculation, while increasingly retarded exhaust valve opening timing favours engine efficiency through greater effective expansion ratio. At mid load (4 bar BMEP), a degree of intake advance becomes beneficial, owing mostly to the associated intake de-throttling. In the upper part-load domain, for engine load of 5 bar BMEP and above, the differences between the two engines determine very different efficiency response to the valve timing setting. The lower compression ratio engine continues to benefit from advanced intake valve timing, with a moderate degree of exhaust timing retard, which minimises the exhaust blow-down losses. The higher compression ratio engine is knock-limited, forcing the valve timing strategy towards regions of lower intake advance and lower hot gas recirculation. The theoretical best valve timing strategy determined peak fuel economy improvements in excess of 8% for the port fuel injection engine; the peak improvement was 5% for the more efficient direct injection engine platform.

Abstract: The integrated chemisorption technology driven by ultra-low grade heat for simultaneous electrical power and thermal energy storage has been investigated in this work. A resorption cycle employing low and high temperature salts, with the coupling between manganese chloride (MnCl2), calcium chloride (CaCl2) and sodium bromide (NaBr), was evaluated and compared in the proposed integrated system for a heat source temperature of between 30 degrees C and 100 degrees C. During the energy charging process, working fluid compression was introduced to convert mechanical power or electricity into chemical energy so that it could be stored during the adsorption process at the same time as utilising low temperature heat energy. During the energy discharging process, mechanical power could be generated via the expansion of the desorbed high pressure working vapour from the low temperature salt reactor, there is also a by-product potential of the cooling energy which can be extracted from the cold expansion exhaust. In addition to the power generation and the potential cold energy, upgraded heat could also be provided by the exothermic adsorption process in the high temperature salt reactor. The performance of this integrated cycle in terms of energy and exergy efficiency and energy density have been discussed. With the help of ultra-low grade heat, a 100% round-trip electricity storage efficiency of the proposed system has been found to be achievable using CaCl2-NaBr and MnCl2-CaCl2 pairs when the heat source temperature was higher than 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. Also a temperature lift of the heat by 15-33 degrees C and 22-68 degrees C respectively was possible using these two adsorbent pairs. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The need to reduce energy consumption and electricity expense is the primary driving force behind generating renewable energy for the operation and maintenance of road tunnels. Existing kinetic energy harvesting solutions, such as piezoelectric or mechanical energy harvesting systems, failed to meet the relatively high power demand of road tunnels. Traditional piezoelectric methods only supply micro electromechanical systems. Their low voltage leads piezoelectric methods to not be applicable in realistic facilities. Due to the transmission loss of energy in a mechanical motion rectifier, mechanical schemes also fail to promote the practical application of renewable kinetic energy harvesting. In this paper, we present a novel high-voltage kinetic energy harvesting system that is installed at the entrance and exit of a road tunnel. It harvests power wasted by vehicles passing over the harvester. The proposed system consists of four main steps: a speed bump and suspension, generator and power storage modules. Acting as the energy input, the speed bump module harvests kinetic energy created by running vehicles. The suspension module resets the speed bump by driving it upwards after vehicles depart from it. Meanwhile, the generator module generates electricity from the kinetic energy collected by the speed bump module. The power storage module rectifies the current and then stores the electrical energy in batteries. The high voltage obtained in the simulation and field tests is a proof that the retrofit mechanism of the energy harvesting system is beneficial and practical in generating energy for use in renewable road tunnels.

Abstract: A prosumer is a customer that both uses and supplies energy, such as electricity or district heat. These are already a part of the electricity system. Lately, prosumers have also been discussed as a part of the district heating systems. This calls for more knowledge in this area. The present study seeks to evaluate the potential for district heating contribution from small scale prosumers, based on excess heat, and their environmental impact in an area with diverse building types. The results were mainly developed through a case study performed on Hyllie, an area under construction in Malmo, Sweden. Data from property developers and some measured data were used to evaluate the annual prosumer potential of buildings. Environmental calculations were performed by simulations in the commercial simulation programme NetSim and data from Swedish literature. Four cases were investigated, based on whether the prosumers were allowed to deliver heat beyond the Hyllie borders or not and on two different ways of managing the supply temperature. The temperature of the excess heat was either raised with a heat pump, or directly utilised in the district heating network. In the latter case, the temperature of the domestic hot water was raised with electricity. The results showed that the potential for excess heat prosumers is fairly big, in Hyllie around 50-120% of the annual heat demand. Most of the excess heat is however produced during the summer months. The environmental results showed that the environmental output of the electricity applied in the prosumer solution decided whether or not the prosumer solution was better than the conventional district heating solution.

Abstract: Due to the band gap of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) (E-g = 2.1 eV) in visible light region, it is regarded as suitable n-type semiconductor material for solar water splitting. Although theoretical conversion efficiency can achieve 12.9%, the drawbacks of hematite, such as short hole diffusion length (similar to 10 nm), poor charge transport and slow oxygen evolution kinetic rate, cause the generated holes being trapped in photo anodes for low conversion efficiency. In this study, hematite nanorods photoanode was prepared via hydrothermal method and the grain sizes of hematite nanorods increased by adding absolute ethanol into growth aqueous solution. In addition, the morphologies observed by SEM showed that hematite nanorods transformed to nanocorals due to the addition of ethanol. To improve the electrical conductivity for reducing carrier recombination, Ti4+ ions were doped into hematite nanocorals photoanode. Herein, the photocurrent density of Ti-doped hematite nanocorals photoanode could achieve 1.72 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). Finally, the surfaces of hematite nanocorals photoanode was decorated by ZnFe2O4 heterojunction layer and Co-Pi oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) to improve the oxygen evolution reaction. The current density and power conversion efficiency could furthermore improve to 3.60 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V and 0.33%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The development of flexible thermoelectric (TE) power generators for harvesting energy from the human body has attracted significant interest in recent years. However, thus far, a wearable TE power generator based on commercially available fabrics has not been realized. In this study, nanostructured Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 were synthesized and deposited on both sides of a silk fabric to form TE columns. These TE columns were connected with silver foils to fabricate a prototype integrating an array of 12 thermocouples. The generator could effectively convert thermal energy into electricity in the temperature difference (AT) range of 5-35 K. The maximum voltage and power outputs were similar to 10 mV and similar to 15 nW, respectively, with no significant change in both, during 100 cycles of bending and twisting. Different voltage output profiles were collected from an arm-attached generator before and after 30 min of walking, to highlight the immense potential of the silk fabric-based TE generator. This study provides a new approach for developing fabric-based TE power generators for practical applications in wearable electronics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Finding a more efficient method for the transesterification of triglycerides to biodiesel fuel (BD) is important in today's world. In this study, transesterification of trilaurin was carried out in a solution containing 4 wt% of the Lewis acid AlCl3 dissolved in a cosolvent of ethanol and 5 MPa CO2. A conversion rate of over 90% was achieved within 1 h at the low temperature of 180 degrees C. The process indicates a co-catalytic effect of the Lewis acid and CO2. We postulate several key steps for the mechanism. First, the CO2-ethanol mixture enhances the hydrogen bonding, increasing the concentration of C2H5O center dot. Second AlCl3 attacks the oxygen of C-O-C to weaken the bonds to form carbonyl carbon ORI, which is then easily attacked by C2H5O center dot to give the transesterified product (C(2)H(4)COOR1). Third, AlCl3 is finally replaced by H to form glycerin (GL) and intermediates, such as unmethyl esterified compounds (uME). AlCl3 was used as a flocculant and catalyst for converting waste cooking oil (WCO) to BD. The process achieved 97% free fatty acid (FFA) conversion at 120 degrees C in 90 min, making it one of the most efficient systems available for WCO recovery. AlCl3 was also successfully applied to microalgae, signaling the potential for a process that combines harvesting, lipid extraction, and transterification, leading to fully integrated, microalgae-based BD production.

Abstract: In order to address climate change and attain sustainable growth, there is a need to quantify driving factors in CO2 emissions in the developing countries. While information for accounting of Philippine CO2 emissions are abound, there is a lack of analytical studies on the driving forces. In this study, the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) is used to quantify the driving forces of changes in Philippine CO2 emissions from 1991 to 2014. The top-down approach described from 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines was used to estimate CO2 emissions from national fuel combustion and electricity generation. Results affirm the negative impacts of economic growth and higher standard of living to CO2 emissions, and reveal the significant damages inconsistent energy structures deliver to the emissions performance of a country. This has never been highlighted in previous studies in ASEAN and other developing countries. Policies to protect the energy structure from fluctuating oil prices, to improve energy planning capabilities, and to promote industrial symbiosis are recommended. On the other hand, the contribution of economic activity and energy intensity to CO2 emissions offset each other. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In current centralized building climate control, occupants do not have much opportunity to intervene the automated control system. This study explores the benefit of using thermal comfort feedback from occupants in the model predictive control (MPC) design based on a novel dynamic thermal sensation (DTS) model. This DTS model based MPC was evaluated in chamber experiments. A hierarchical structure for thermal control was adopted in the chamber experiments. At the high level, an MPC controller calculates the optimal supply air temperature of the chamber heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, using the feedback of occupants' votes on thermal sensation. At the low level, the actual supply air temperature is controlled by the chiller/heater using a PI control to achieve the optimal set point. This DTS-based MPC was also compared to an MPC designed based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model for thermal sensation. The experiment results demonstrated that the DTS-based MPC using occupant feedback allows significant energy saving while maintaining occupant thermal comfort compared to the PMV-based MPC.

Abstract: The use of photovoltaic thermal (PVT) technologies enables improvement in the electrical efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) module by reducing the temperature of the PV module via active waste heat removal. In current PVT systems, the removed heat is mainly used for specific applications, such as water and/or room heating, but their need is intermittent and seasonal. For a more efficient and versatile use of the removed waste heat, we propose a new architecture where the PV module is integrated with a dual-functional electrolyzer that removes the waste heat by active cooling and produces hydrogen via electrolysis. The excess heat from the PV cell is utilized to enhance the reaction kinetics of the electrolysis process (due to an increase in temperature) inside an electrolyzer, which is located below the PV module. In this paper, we used finite-element analysis (FEA) simulations to optimize the geometry and operating conditions of an electrolyzer to maximize overall energetic efficiency and hydrogen production. To evaluate the practical feasibility of the approach, we performed a comprehensive energy analysis of the PVTE system using data from Phoenix, AZ. The energetic efficiency of the proposed PVTE system was calculated to be 56-59%, which is comparable to those of current PVT systems. Additionally, the integration of the electrolyzer with the PV module led to an almost 2.5-fold increase in hydrogen production compared to a stand-alone electrolyzer operated at ambient temperature. The analyzed hybrid approach potentially represents a viable and useful alternative for utilization of waste heat energy from PV cells. This approach may further increase the use of photovoltaic technologies as a renewable energy source. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hydrogen generation from water splitting reaction with the energy from sunlight via a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell is one of the ultimate goals in the renewable energy field. In the PEC process, energetic excited electrons can go through fast recombination with the holes, resulting in photon energy waste and lowering the solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency. So it is essential to increase the conductivity and lower the resistance of the photoelectrodes. Here, copper oxide thin film was chosen for the demonstration of the importance for the conductivity of the film toward the photocurrent density generation. By doping with Li, Ni, Co, Ag, Zn and Mg, the conductivity of the films increases from 3 x 10(-6) S/cm for the intrinsic CuO film to up to 10(-4) S/cm, two orders of magnitude higher, and thus leading to up to four folds increase in photocurrent density. On the other hand, the addition of Cr, Fe, and Mn introduced into CuO film leads to lower conductivity, to 10(-8)-10(-9) S/cm, and leads to a significant decrease of the photocurrent density. A correlation between the photocurrent density and conductivity is also reported in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Demand-response (DR) is regarded as a promising solution for future power grids. Here we use a Stackelberg game approach, and describe a novel DR model for electricity trading between one utility company and multiple users, which is aimed at balancing supply and demand, as well as smoothing the aggregated load in the system. The interactions between the utility company (leader) and users (followers) are formulated into a 1-leader, N-follower Stackelberg game, where optimization problems are formed for each player to help select the optimal strategy. A pricing function is adopted for regulating real-time prices (RTP), which then act as a coordinator, inducing users to join the game. An iterative algorithm is proposed to derive the Stackelberg equilibrium, through which optimal power generation and power demands are determined for the utility company and users respectively. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method can efficiently reshape users' demands, including flattening peak demands and filling the vacancy of valley demands, and significantly reduce the mismatch between supply and demand.

Abstract: The effect of biofuel use on the operation of Diesel Exhaust Aftertreatment System is investigated both numerically and experimentally, by focusing on the contribution of three main factors: raw PM-NOx emissions trade-off, NO-NO2 conversion efficiency of the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and PM reactivity toward oxidation.
The possibility of limited interventions on assessed engine technologies is key toward the deployment of the potential related to fuel based greenhouse reduction policies, for both road and non-road markets. To verify its impact on the Aftertreatment System, a Diesel engine for non-road applications has been tested with Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) biodiesel blended with commercial fossil fuel at 6% and 30% v/v. Six engine operating modes have been selected as the most representative of the reference standard cycle (NRTC) for non-road Diesel engines and have been run to evaluate the biodiesel impact on engine emissions. Experimental results indicate a significant reduction of soot emissions, in line with literature trends, especially at high loads, as fuel oxygen enhances oxidation in the fuel rich regions of the combustion chamber. On the other side, only a slight increase in NOx emissions has been observed, along with a similar trend of the equivalence ratio due to both the lower heating value and stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of biodiesel in comparison with fossil fueling.
The study has been also focused on the analysis of PM/NO2 ratio, in presence of the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, when biodiesel is used. Engine tests have in fact demonstrated that, although the NO2/NOx ratio on raw exhaust is almost unaffected, a slight reduction of the NO2/NOx light-off temperature of the DOC is observed.
This gives, along with a greater PM reactivity oxidation, more favorable conditions for the Diesel Particulate Filter passive regeneration process, with the final aim of a higher engine conversion efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Cement is one of the three main construction materials, which provides support for other related industries and fuels the economic growth. However, cement production is also a high-polluting sector. In this study, a life-cycle environmental assessment was performed for a typical new suspension preheater dry process (NSP) cement production in China. A comparison of the life cycle environmental impact of best available technologies was also conducted by setting a series of scenarios so as to find the most promising alternative in reducing environmental impacts. The results suggest that although direct calcination is the largest contributor of environmental emissions in the cement production system, indirect sections, particularly the downstream grinding section, play an important role in terms of environmental impact, which should be considered as the control point in achieving energy saving and emission reduction goal. Comparing the environmental performance of raw material and fuel substitution alternatives and best available technologies, the results of scenario analysis reveals that environmental benefits of carbide slag and the mixture of carbide slag and limestone slag as raw material substitutions is not prominent as it induces extra environmental costs that offset the environmental benefits from reduced limestone usage. Corn straw as coal substitution and heat recovery and cogeneration are found to be promising ways to achieve environmental mitigation with a notable environmental benefit for cement production. The prevailing NSP kiln technology is more environmental beneficial compared with shaft kiln technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ca-Cu chemical looping (CaL-CLC), consisting of calcination (regeneration), carbonation, and oxidation stages, is a novel process with high potential for CO2 capture. Its implementation is largely dependent on the effective matching, transferring and utilisation of the heat generated by CuO reduction, for CaCO3 decomposition, where the former is an exothermic and the latter an endothermic reaction. To better understand the calcination behaviour during CaL-CLC cycles, we developed a mathematical model coupling chemical reactions, mass and heat transfer inside a spherical particle composed of a number of uniformly distributed CuO and CaCO3 grains. Using the model, we simulated the dynamics of CuO and CaCO3 conversion, the profiles of temperature and gas concentrations, and the changes in porosity and the grain size inside the particle with time. Furthermore, the influence of several key variables on calcination behaviour within the spherical particle was numerically analysed. Results show that it is better to have an ambient temperature in the range of 1198-1223 K, a similar value of the initial particle temperature, and a small CaCO3 grain size to attain a good match between reactions of CuO and CaCO3, and to avoid the onset of local superheating within the particle.

Abstract: The control of PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) strictly depends on the management of the battery SOC (State of Charge) over a given trip. Indeed this key vehicle parameter affects the vehicle autonomy and its evolution may be enhanced by a proper match with further "external" variables, such as the availability of recharge stations and their characteristic speed for battery recharging.
In this paper we propose an easily implementable control strategy, that is intrinsically robust with respect to the variation of used SOC over a trip and is based only on a preliminary knowledge of the target distance. Its use is experimentally demonstrated on a prototype PHEV to accomplish a defined target SOC at the end of the trip. A vehicle model has also been validated, in comparison with previously gathered experimental data, and then applied to analyze the control strategy behavior by varying input data such as trip distance, speed over time and target SOC. Results show that the target SOC may be obtained within an error in the range of 2%, allowing for a potential fuel economy increase up to 8.2% if compared with a baseline PHEV strategy. However fuel economy increase definitely depends on key trip characteristics such as speed profile, duration, distance, etc. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: It was revealed in a previous related study that for an air conditioning (A/C) system used in a sleeping environment, the height of its supply air outlet would significantly affect its ventilation performance in terms of effectiveness. To further examine the underlying reasons of the differences in ventilation performance, the air flow field, distributions of mean age of air, air change efficiency and distributions of CO2 concentrations inside an experimental bedroom were numerically studied using CFD method under five different settings, where its supply air outlet was positioned at 5 different heights. The study results suggested that positing a supply air outlet at a lower level was effective in both saving energy and removing the exhaled CO2 in a breathing zone, and when a supply outlet was positioned at a higher level, less CO2 was removed from the region near the mouth of a sleeper.

Abstract: Air travel accounts for 2% of global CO2 emissions and this proportion is set to grow in the future. There are currently no large scale solutions to drastically reduce the industry's dependence on oil. Therefore, airlines are looking to use a basket of measures to reduce fuel consumption. Optimisation of the use of cost index (CI) could be a valuable addition to this. By balancing time-dependent costs with the cost of fuel, it controls the speed of the aircraft to achieve the most economic flight time. This has a direct impact on the CO2 emissions from the aircraft, with higher speeds resulting in higher fuel consumption. The aim of this study is to assess the impact that CI has on CO2 emissions for six different aircraft models on a flight-by-flight basis and to evaluate how the CI could be affected by future impacts on the industry for a representative aircraft. Results show that a range of representative CI values for different aircraft models exist and suggest that the maximum benefit for optimising CI values occurs for long range flights. The average saving in CO2 emissions is 1%. Results show that time-related costs have the greatest effect on the optimum CI values, particularly delay costs. On the fuel side of the equation it is notable that a carbon price resulting from the implementation of a market based mechanism has little impact on the optimum CI and only reduces CO2 emissions by 0.01% in this case. The largest savings in CO2 emissions result from the use of biofuels, with reductions of between 9% and 44% for 10% and 50% blends respectively. This study also highlights the need for further research into crew and maintenance costs, cumulative costs and delay induced by congestion and climate change events, as well as policy considerations to ensure that there is a reduction in CO2 emissions. The study concludes that CI should be seen as a valuable tool in both helping to reduce CO2 emissions, as well to assess the impact of future events on the industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Existing calculated benchmarking methods and main energy performance assessment schemes often lack the practical ability to manage the energy performance of a vast number of widespread telecommunication base stations (TBSs). Therefore, on the basis of a TBS survey, this paper puts forward the dynamic simulation and sensitivity analysis method to allow the new rule "one energy benchmark for a group of similar TBSs" rather than the traditional rule "one benchmark for one assessed building". The new method reasonably limits the number of benchmarks and a feasible benchmark system is established for managing numerous TBSs. The results indicate that, first, more than one million TBSs distributed in a large area of China can be divided into 448 typical scenarios. Second, the benchmarks for reasonable energy use of these scenarios can be organized into four simple benchmarking charts. Third, the attempt to establish further challenging energy benchmarks shows that the most energy-saving measure in TBSs, i.e., ventilation cooling, can fully eliminate the negative impact of poor configurations of envelops and cooling coefficients of performance (COP). Finally, establishing telecom industrial standards for locating the reasonable TBS energy consumption level even in giant countries appears feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Domestic gas prices in Russia are substantially lower than export netback prices. The Russian government aims to increase the domestic price level in the long term. The objective of this paper is to analyse the long-term effects of higher gas prices in Russia on the European gas market. The analysis is based on a modified analytical and a numerical Hotelling model. The main findings are as follows. Under a price elasticity of demand equalling -0.5, a 70% increase in the domestic gas price in Russia results in an annual average reduction in domestic gas consumption of 116 bcm. The export supply to Europe could be affected via two channels: (i) a stock effect and (ii) scarcity rents. The results show that in the presence of a stock effect with an elasticity equalling unity, the annual average increase in the export supply to Europe could account for 33.7 bcm. Although Russia may not face a resource constraint in the short and medium terms, scarcity effects could become more relevant in the future. A reduction in domestic gas consumption could reduce the future scarcity rent, implying a higher potential for exporting gas in the long term. Overall, total gas consumption in Europe could annually increase by 17.5 bcm on average. As the stock elasticity increases, so does the increase in total gas consumption. Furthermore, the results show that increasing the domestic gas price is associated with an annual average increase in the export tax revenue from gas of 38.4 billion USD and an annual average reduction in the domestic gas subsidy of 34.1 billion USD.

Abstract: The paper contributes to the limited literature modelling the term structure of crude oil markets. We explain the term structure of crude oil prices using the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model and propose to forecast oil prices using a generalized regression framework based on neural networks. The newly proposed framework is empirically tested on 24 years of crude oil futures prices covering several important recessions and crisis periods. We find 1-month-, 3-month-, 6-month- and 12-month-ahead forecasts obtained from a focused time-delay neural network to be significantly more accurate than forecasts from other benchmark models. The proposed forecasting strategy produces the lowest errors across all times to maturity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The integration of environmental sustainability and eco-efficiency has been recognized as a means to foster economic and environmental performance, increase competitiveness and use it as a lever to spur innovation. Besides integrating green technologies in the manufacturing system, putting environmental goals on the company agenda, and pursuing green norms and directives, the question is: quo vadis eco-factory? Based on a focus group study with 22 European experts and high-level representatives from industry, policy-makers and academia, we raised the question of what might be the research directions and solutions for eco-factories in the next 20 years. Our two major findings suggest that (i) research should more focus on the opportunities that human participants in a manufacturing system can foster change toward eco-factories and that (ii) firm-intern characteristics like enabling environmental capability, organization and structure will likely determine upon successful transition and increased competitiveness.

Abstract: High-temperature ESPs are proposed to improve energy efficiency and avoid damage to downstream equipment in integrated gasification combined cycle and pressurized fluidized-bed combustion. In this study, the effects of temperature and pressure on negative corona discharge characteristics were compared. Gas temperature varied from 373 K to 1073 K, and pressure varied from 30 kPa to 100 kPa to achieve the same gas density. The additional corona current Delta I-t induced by high temperature was calculated, and the additional ion current Delta I-i and electron current Delta I-e were studied. A wire-type electrode, a spiral electrode, a ribbon electrode, and four gas compositions (N-2/CO2/SO2/air) were investigated in the plate-type discharge configuration. Results show that corona current increases more rapidly with increasing gas temperature than that with decreasing pressure at the same gas density. The current density is 0.87 mA/m at 973 K and atmosphere pressure, which is higher than 0.45 mAlm at 30.9 kPa and room temperature. An additional temperature effect on corona discharge is proposed apart from the decrease of gas density as temperature increases. Delta I-t increases with increasing temperature because of enhanced molecule kinetic energy and ionization rate. The electron-carried current is important at temperatures above 873 K. Delta I-e/Delta I-t increases from 0 to 0.941 when temperature increases from 773 K to 973 K. Compared with the Delta I-t of wire and spiral electrodes, the Delta I-t of ribbon electrode is significantly larger because of the enhanced electron avalanche and secondary electron emission. Negative corona discharge does not occur in N-2, and corona onset voltages are in the following sequence: CO2 > SO2 (6000 ppm) > air, which is determined by gas molecule ionization energy. Delta I-t/I-P is smaller in gas atmosphere with strong electronegativity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In order to extend the cycle life of power battery pack within electric vehicle, a phase change material (PCM)/mini-channel coupled power battery thermal management (BTM) system, as well as the three-dimensional battery thermal model, was designed in this paper. The effect of various influencing factors, especially mass flow rate of water, phase change temperature and thermal conductivity of PCM, were investigated numerically. The results showed that the liquid volume fraction of PCM was greatly influenced by the thermal conductivity and the phase change temperature of PCM. The increasing number of channels results in a decrease of the maximum temperature (T-Max) and maximum temperature difference (AT) of battery packs. The optimal phase change temperature and thermal conductivity of PCM were 308.15 K and 0.6 W m(-1) K-1 respectively when the number of channel was eight and the mass flow rate was 8 x 10(-4) kg s(-1). Moreover, a maximum temperature of 320.6 K was predicted for the PCM/mini-channel coupled BTM system, while a maximum temperature of 335.4 K was predicted for the PCM-based BTM system. Additionally, the PCM/mini-channel coupled BTM system presented more effective thermal performance and the research will be a clear indicator for the design of the PCM/liquid coupled BTM system.

Abstract: The use of batteries in combination with PV systems in single homes is expected to become a widely applied energy storage solution. Since PV system cost is decreasing and the electricity marlcet is constantly evolving there is marked interest in understanding the performance and economic benefits of adding battery systems to PV generation under different retail tariffs. The performance of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems in combination with PV generation for a single home in Switzerland is studied using a time-dependant analysis. Firstly, the economic benefits of the two battery types are analysed for three different types of tariffs, i.e. a dynamic tariff based on the wholesale market (one price per hour for every day of the year), a flat rate and time-of-use tariff with two periods. Secondly, the reduction of battery capacity and annual discharge throughout the battery lifetime are simulated for PbA and Li-ion batteries. It was found that despite the levelised value of battery systems reaches up to 28% higher values with the dynamic tariff compared to the flat rate tariff, the levelised cost increases by 94% for the dynamic tariff, resulting in lower profitability. The main reason for this is the reduction of equivalent full cycles performed with by battery systems with the dynamic tariff. Economic benefits also depend on the regulatory context and Li-ion battery systems were able to achieve internal rate of return (IRR) up to 0.8% and 4.3% in the region of Jura (Switzerland) and Germany due to higher retail electricity prices (0.25 CHF/kW h and 0.35 CHF/kW h respectively) compared to Geneva (0.22 CHF/kW h) where the maximum IRR was equal to -0.2%.

Abstract: Low delta-T syndrome widely exists in the existing air-conditioning systems and results in increased energy consumption. This paper presents a system-level fault detection and diagnosis method(FDD) to detect and diagnose the low delta-T syndrome resulted from the performance degradation of AHUs system and plate heat exchanger system in a complex HVAC system. Performance indices are introduced to characterize the health status (normal or faulty) of the system. Reference models are developed to generate the benchmarks of the performance indices under fault-free conditions. In order to mitigate the impact of the model fitting uncertainty of the reference models and the measurement uncertainty of the performance indices, adaptive thresholds are adopted using t-statistic approach to identify the health conditions of the performance indices. The proposed method was validated in a dynamic simulation platform built based on a real complex HVAC system studied. The results show that the proposed FDD strategy can successfully detect the low delta-T syndrome, identify the related faults and quantitatively evaluate of the faults severity.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in China's response to climate change and energy security, studies undertaken at the subnational level are rare. In the context of the multilevel governance paradigm, this article examines the governance of climate change and energy policy in Shanghai, a rapidly growing Chinese megacity highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although the energy and carbon intensity of Shanghai's economy have fallen significantly since China launched its economic reforms, overall carbon emissions in the municipality continue to rise. Through examining the Shanghai case, this article argues that Chinese subnational climate mitigation policy is dominated by hierarchical governance arrangements. Nevertheless, shifts in national climate and energy policy since 2007 have mandated provincial-level governments, including Shanghai, to develop their own climate and energy policies while offering greater local autonomy for incorporating climate and energy issues into development goals: is this attributable to a decentred form of multilevel governance? The article concludes that Shanghai's climate mitigation and energy policy is dominated by hierarchical governance whereby policies are 'downloaded' from the central government. Perspectives for other cities and insights for policymakers are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of ground-source heat pump system has been widely adopted over the past decades due to its potentials to provide renewable and low carbon footprint energy source for building's heating and air-conditioning needs. This paper reports the design and post construction monitoring of a vertical ground-coupled heat pump system installed adjacent to a three-floor residential house located in Cleveland, OH, USA. The system operates under the special geological condition with shallow depth outcrop of sedimentary shale rock formation typical of Northeastern Ohio, USA. A comprehensive monitoring program was installed to collect data on the operation and performance of the ground-coupled heat pump system. The data recording was initialized in Oct. 2012 and has been in place ever since. Overall, the monitoring data shows that the ground heat pump achieved very good performance. The coefficient of performance (COP) of ground coupled heat pump system ranges from 3 to 4. The heat pump satisfies most of the house heating requirements, including severe cold winter, during the monitoring period. This case study demonstrates the feasibility of ground-coupled heat pump system in providing Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) source for residential building for either heating dominant or cooling dominant conditions under sedimentary rock geological conditions. The possible solutions to decrease the initial investment are proposed in the study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The open cathode design is commonly adopted for small sized proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) as it allows for smaller footprint and thus, higher power density. Axial fans are typically used to supply oxygen in these PEMFC systems. Apart from controlling stoichiometry, they also play a critical role in regulating internal temperature. This suggests that its location could have significant impact on fuel cell performance. In this work, the location of the fan is varied from the front to the rear in order to blow air or draw air into the stack respectively. The latter configuration reduces the non-uniformity in temperature and velocity by around 2 and 4 times respectively, resulting in a 16% increase in overall stack performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The aim of this study is the proof of concept and the validation in laboratory environment of a novel technique for in-situ measurement of indoor air temperature using IR thermography, the mock target IR thermography. The technique is based on the use of mock targets with appropriate hygrothermal properties. The physics of the examined concept are introduced by employing analytical predictions and numerical analysis, using finite elements simulations (Comsol Multiphysics). The selection of the mock target material is also justified and the optimal solutions are discussed. The laboratory validation of the proposed technique was implemented under controlled conditions in the climate chamber of the Kaunas University of Technology (Lithuania). The concept was tested under different indoor conditions and with the use of various mock targets. The measurements were also validated with the use of a compatible measurement technique (thermocouples). The prerequisites for the implementation of the technique, as well as the conditions under which the proposed technique provides reliable results are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A mathematical CFD model of pyrolysis process was developed to predict the volatiles in terms of tar and light gas as well as char fraction released in a biomass packed porous bed system. In particular, phenol was considered as tar representative while the main gas species were individually considered (in particular H-2, CO, CO2, CH4 and steam). The model was implemented in a commercial CFD code through several original User Defined Functions (UDFs) to reproduce the source terms in the continuity, energy and chemical species mass fraction equations. Furthermore, both inertial and viscous resistances within the packed bed were modeled and coded to assess the pressure drop in the porous media. Code validation was achieved by comparing the numerical results against experimental data obtained in a small-scale biomass reactor using N-2 as carrier gas. To assess the kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis model at different operating conditions, the experiments were carried out by varying, in a wide range, the temperature of both the N-2 flux and reactor walls.

Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics set a theoretical limit on the energy savings that can be realised in a given application. This thermodynamic potential cannot be reached in practice, and a technical potential for energy savings is defined by the performance of available technology. Only applications of the technology that are considered economic will usually be considered for installation. This economic potential will itself not be fully realised, with the actual savings that are achieved limited by further barriers. A database on surplus heat availability within UK industry was used to estimate the thermodynamic, technical, and economic potentials when converting this surplus heat to electricity using organic Rankine cycles (ORCs). Technical and economic information was based on that reported from existing installations and manufacturers. Installations economic over the target payback period totalled approximately 3.5 PJ/yr of electricity generation, primarily in the steel, chemicals and cement subsectors. However, this result is sensitive to the input parameters, particularly the future price of electricity and required payback period, which are uncertain. Therefore a range of possible scenarios were investigated. The results form a basis for discussion on how to close this "gap" between the identified potentials and the savings realised in practice.

Abstract: The high temperatures of sea-floor hydrothermal vents make them good targets for the exploitation of thermal energy. Taking advantage of this prospect, this study developed a thermoelectric converter that harvests thermal energy from hydrothermal fluids through a heat pipe and converts heat to electrical energy with thermoelectric generators. A power management system that enables the thermoelectric converter to continuously power a data logger and a light-emitting diode lamp was also proposed. The thermoelectric converter was field tested at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent with a depth of 2765 m at the Dragon Flag Field along the Southwest Indian Ridge. With the use of the thermal gradient between hydrothermal fluids and seawater, the thermoelectric converter obtained a sustained power of 2.6-3.9 W during the field test Our results demonstrate that the thermal energy of hydrothermal fluids can be an alternative renewable power source for seabed observation equipment that requires watt level power.

Abstract: This article summarizes the experience gained from the study, the siting, the design and the dimensioning of hybrid power plants in autonomous insular power systems in Greece. Wind parks and photovoltaic stations are employed as the RES units, while Pumped Storage Systems (PSS), electrochemical lead acid batteries and electrolysis units for hydrogen production are alternatively investigated as storage units. The examined hybrid power plants operation aims either at the maximization of the RES penetration or at the power demand peak shaving. The hybrid power plants' dimensioning is optimized using as a criterion either the RES annual penetration maximization or the optimization of the required investments economic indices. The work is integrated with an economic feasibility study for each investigated hybrid power plant. The hybrid power plants presented in this article refer to insular autonomous systems of very small size (Agios Efstratios, Castellorizo), small size (Karpathos-Kasos, Astypalaia), medium size (Rhodes, Samos) and large size (Crete). The article designates how the size of the insular system affects the hybrid power plant's synthesis and operating algorithm. The investigated hybrid power plants are proved to be technically and economically feasible, regardless of the size of the hosting insular system. The sensitivity analysis of the required investments' economic indices indicated that the produced electricity selling prices can be lower than the specific electricity production costs in the existing systems. In small and very small power systems, the economic feasibility of the introduced hybrid power plants is achieved with annual RES penetration higher than 90% of the annual electricity consumption.

Abstract: Chemical absorption of CO2 with a droplet of aqueous NH3 was numerically analyzed, and an empirical formula was derived to describe the instantaneous absorption mass flux as a function of instantaneous concentration conditions and other constant operating parameters. The proposed formula fit the numerical results excellently over a wide variation of initial or control parameter values and throughout the absorption process at different instants. The formula will be very useful to analyze the efficiency of an absorption reactor in which distribution of poly-dispersed droplets is nonuniform, and is applicable to various liquid absorption processes after appropriate modification of parameter values.

Abstract: The dynamic behaviour of opaque components of the building envelope in steady periodic regime is investigated using parameters defined by the fluctuating heat flux that is transferred in the wall. The use of the heat flux allows for the joint action of the loadings that characterise both the outdoor environment and the indoor air-conditioned environment to be taken into account.
The analysis was developed in sinusoidal conditions to determine the frequency response of the wall and in non-sinusoidal conditions to identify the actual dynamic behaviour of the wall. The use of non-dimensional periodic thermal transmittance is proposed for the sinusoidal analysis in order to evaluate the decrement factor and the time lag that the heat flux undergoes in crossing the wall as well as the efficiency of heat storage.
In the presence of non-sinusoidal loadings, the identification of the dynamic behaviour of the wall is obtained using several dynamic parameters: the decrement factor in terms of energy, defined as the ratio between the energy in a semi-period entering and exiting the wall; the decrement factor and the time lag in terms of heat flux, considering the maximum peak and the minimum peak. These parameters allow for the identification of how the form of the heat flux trend crossing the wall is modified.
The number of harmonics to be considered for an accurate representation of heat fluxes is determined by means of the introduction of the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), which quantifies the distortion of a non-sinusoidal periodic trend compared to a sinusoidal trend.
The methodology developed was used to evaluate the influence of external and internal loadings on the dynamic characteristics of two commonly used walls on a monthly and seasonal basis. The external loadings were changed considering two climatically different locations and different orientations of the walls; the internal loadings were changed by varying the operating mode of the plant and the shortwave radiative heat fluxes contributions on the inner surface.

Abstract: We developed bifacial transparent back contact (TBC) hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) semi-transparent glass-to-glass photovoltaic (PV) modules with emotionally inoffensive and esthetically pleasing colors have been developed by combining the transparent back contact and color of the back glass. Due to the high series resistance of the transparent back contact, the bifacial TBC a-Si:H semi-transparent PV modules had a lower rated power after light soaking than the monofacial opaque (metal) back contact (OBC) a-Si:H semi-transparent PV modules fabricated using the additional laser scribing patterns. However, the TBC a-Si:H semi-transparent PV module produced a higher annual electrical energy output than the OBC a-Si:H semi-transparent PV module thanks to bifacial power generation during the outdoor field test In particular, the performance ratio of the TBC a-Si:H semi-transparent PV module measured at the optimal tilt angle of 30 surpassed its simulated prediction by a drastically high value of 124.5%. At a higher tilt angle of 85, bifacial power generation produced a higher deviation between the measured and simulated annual performance of the TBC a-Si:H semi-transparent PV module. Since the reflected albedo has a tendency to increase toward higher tilt angles, bifacial power generation can compensate for the loss of lower direct plane-of-array irradiation at a higher tilt angle. Therefore, the TBC a-Si:H semi-transparent PV module is suitable for the vertically mounted building integrated photovoltaic modules for use in curtain walls, facades, roofs and traffic noise barriers by harvesting reflected and illuminated light.

Abstract: This paper shows the potential for valuable syngas (H-2 and CO) production from a laboratory-scale reactor, as an alternative and viable means for the treatment of acid gas (H2S and CO2). Claus process technology currently used for acid gas treatment often suffers from lack of high process efficiency due to various impurities present in acid gas that cause non-uniform gas composition. Increased environmental regulations on sulfur emissions have challenged environmental engineers to seek safe, reliable and efficient means of acid gas conversion to useful products. This paper provides suitable input and operational conditions of the reactor that helps to produce syngas from acid gas, having wide range of composition at high conversion rate of acid gas (H2S and CO2) to minimize environmental burden. The results reveal the importance of reactor temperature and the role provided by CO2 in acid gas on the composition of syngas produced. The results show that a reactor temperature of 1373-1473 K and high residence time favors the production of syngas at high conversion efficiency of acid gas. The syngas produced can be utilized for energy generation or value added products. The operational conditions provide means to quantify reactor performance with different composition of the syngas to aid in the production of biofuels and value added products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Because of their numerous advantages, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have recently become a focus of research interest for vehicle applications. Li-ion batteries are suitable for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) because of advantages such as their high specific energy, high energy density, and low self-discharge rate in comparison with other secondary batteries. Nevertheless, the commercial availability of Li-ion batteries for vehicle applications has been hindered by issues of safety, cost, charging time, and recycling. One principal limitation of this technology resides in its poor low-temperature performance. Indeed, the effects of low temperature reduce the battery's available energy and increase its internal impedance. In addition, performance-hampering cell degradation also occurs at low temperatures and throughout the entire life of a Li-ion battery. All of these issues pose major difficulties for cold-climate countries. This paper reviews the effects of cold temperatures on the capacity/power fade of Li-ion battery technology. Extensive attention is paid to the aging mechanisms of Li-ion batteries at cold temperatures. This paper also reviews several battery models found in the literature. Finally, thermal strategies are detailed, along with a discussion of the ideal approach to cold-temperature operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 (CIGS) thin-films are prepared by the particle-based screen printing technique followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) densification. Due to the short RTA time, CIGS absorber remains the ideal stoichiometric ratio originated from the CIGS particles in the coating paste and thus the conventional selenization process is not required. The effects of the particle concentrations of the coating paste, the RTA temperature and normal loading during RTA on the performances of the CIGS thin-films are studied. The film thickness increases with the increase of the particle concentration of the coating paste. The carbon content of the film is nearly zero when the RTA temperature is greater than 650 degrees C. The carrier concentration and Hall mobility of the CIGS film increase when increasing the RTA temperature from 300 degrees C to 650 degrees C. Using the coating paste with a particle concentration of 40 wt% for screen printing and a three-step, 250 degrees C solvent removal for 5 min, 500 degrees C annealing for 7 min and 650 degrees C densification for 3 min, 1.97 N cm(-2) normal loading RTA process, a p-type chalcopyrite CIGS film with the carrier concentration of 1.23 x 10(15) cm(3) and mobility of 26.21 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) is obtained.

Abstract: Polygeneration energy systems (PES) have the potential to provide a flexible, high-efficiency, and low emissions alternative for power generation and chemical synthesis from fossil fuels. This study aims to assess the economic value of fossil-fuel PES which rely on hydrogen as an intermediate product. Our analysis focuses on a representative PES configuration that uses coal as the primary energy input and produces electricity and fertilizer as end-products. We derive a series of propositions that assess the cost competitiveness of the modeled PES under both static and flexible operation modes. The result is a set of metrics that quantify the levelized cost of hydrogen, the unit profit-margin of PES, and the real option values of 'diversification' and 'flexibility' embedded in PES. These metrics are subsequently applied to assess the economics of Hydrogen Energy California (HECA), a PES currently under development in California. Under our technical and economic assumptions, HECA's levelized cost of hydrogen is estimated at 1.373 $/kg(h). The profitability of HECA as a static PES increases in the share of hydrogen converted to fertilizer rather than electricity. However, when configured as a flexible PES, HECA almost breaks even on a pre-tax basis. Diversification and flexibility are valuable for HECA when polygeneration is compared to static monogeneration of electricity, but these two real options have no value when comparing polygeneration to static monogeneration of fertilizers.

Abstract: Micro Gas Turbines (mGTs) appear as a promising technology for small-scale (up to 500 kW) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production. However, their rather low electrical efficiency limits their profitability when the heat demand is low. Hot liquid water injection in mGTs by means of a saturation tower within the micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT) cycle allows both improving the flexibility of heat production and the electrical efficiency of mGTs; two qualities that if enhanced would result in an increased economic feasibility of the technology.
Based on simulations performed on a Turbec T100 mGT converted into an mHAT, this paper presents an assessment of the economic profitability of both an mGT (working as a CHP) and an mHAT unit operated in real network conditions. To that end, we have used net present value, internal rate of return and discounted cash flow stream methodologies. The input to the study consists of (1) hourly heat and electricity demand profiles of two distinctive users, one located in Brussels the other in San Francisco and (2) 25 electricity and natural gas price scenarios. Our aim is to investigate whether the increase in flexibility and electrical efficiency achieved when transforming an mGT into an mHAT offsets the additional costs.
Results show that in scenarios with high electricity and low natural gas prices the relationship between these two variables depending on the user, CHP and mHAT units are economically competitive. For all the price combinations where investing in mGT technology is feasible, it is worth transforming the unit into an mHAT. Moreover, the lower the electricity demand' with respect to the nominal T100 production (100 kW(e)), the more sensitive the user is to the price at which electricity is sold to the grid and therefore, the more the feasibility of mGT and mHAT technologies depends on subsidies or primes on surplus-electricity production.

Abstract: Urban wind energy exploitation is an important topic for smart sustainable cities. The present investigation is a step in this direction, considering the latest advances in building aerodynamics, identifying and analyzing the optimum building-roof shape for the urban wind energy exploitation. This investigation focusses in two aspects: the isolated building shape optimization and the analysis of this building in an urban environment. The optimization includes an analysis of the roof-wall transition geometry by testing different variations of a spherical roof, a roof-width sensitivity analysis of the optimum geometry and an exploration of the building aspect ratio effect on the flow. A comparison of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence intensity is carried out. The wind turbine positioning on the roof is analyzed in detail. An exactly spherical roof connected to a cylindrical wall is identified as the most advantageous option. Additionally, the effect of the neighboring buildings is investigated considering different heights for the surroundings. The wind flow on the roof is strongly affected by the presence of surrounding buildings, increasing the turbulence intensity close to the roof surface. Slender shapes are identified as the most interesting building shapes for wind energy exploitation, leading to a higher speed-up and to a lower turbulence intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: An experimental and theoretical investigation of pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) performance was conducted. The characteristic parameters of a commercial membrane were determined experimentally. Gross power density of up to 7.1 W/m(2) was obtained, which is among the highest reported in the literature for a commercial membrane. The effect of operating conditions on membrane performance was also investigated. Results show that under typical test conditions, concentration polarization and spatial variations are minimized, but the resulting pressure losses due to friction lead to net power densities that are negative. Test conditions that favor net power density, and hence that are more appropriate for energy conversion applications, were identified. Under these conditions net power density of up to 4.5 W/m(2) was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, forecasting of the Electric Vehicle (EV) charging load has been based on two different data sets: data from the customer profile (referred to as charging record) and data from outlet measurements (referred to as station record). Four different prediction algorithms namely Time Weighted Dot Product based Nearest Neighbor (TWDP-NN), Modified Pattern Sequence Forecasting (MPSF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest (RF) are applied to both datasets. The corresponding speed, accuracy, and privacy concerns are compared between the use of the charging records and station records. Real world data compiled at the outlet level from the UCLA campus parking lots are used. The results show that charging records provide relatively faster prediction while putting customer privacy in jeopardy. Station records provide relatively slower prediction while respecting the customer privacy. In general, we found that both datasets generate comparable prediction error. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The paper deals with real-time energy management strategies for a hybrid energy storage system including a battery and supercapacitor for an electric vehicle. Besides efficiency concerns, a key issue for real-time applications is ensuring safe operations for the considered system. In such a system it is mandatory to limit the supercapacitor voltage by the energy management strategy to comply with efficiency and safety constraints. An optimisation-based strategy (1-control) and a rule-based strategy (filtering) are compared in this paper. The active limitation of the supercapacitor voltage is ensured in both strategies. Experimental results show that the two strategies have equivalent performances under real-driving cycles not known in advance. A difference of 2% between the strategies on the battery current root mean square value is shown. By varying the desired supercapacitor voltage range, the results show that the 1-control is better-suited for a high supercapacitor voltage range whereas the filtering gives the best performances for a low supercapacitor voltage range.

Abstract: This study experimentally investigated the application of weather forecasting in combination with the price-based control method for solar passive buildings. Two identical lightweight test huts were used for the experimental study, one finished with ordinary gypsum board and the other finished with PCM-impregnated gypsum boards. Based on the experimental results, the application of weather forecast data showed significant energy saving when PCM is used. In some days, an electrical energy saving up to 90% per day was achieved using the proposed method. The results also showed that the application of inaccurate weather forecasts can significantly deteriorate performance of the control system and even lead to more energy consumption in the PCM hut.

Abstract: A systematic study was conducted to make a comparative evaluation of the effects of blending n-butanol and n-pentanol with biodiesel at 10% and 20% by volume on engine performance and on the physicochemical characteristics of particulate emissions from a single cylinder, direct injection diesel engine. The engine was operated at a constant engine speed and at three engine loads. Compared to biodiesel, butanol-biodiesel blends lead to a maximum of 1.6% increase in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and an increase in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 1.9-3.9% at low and medium engine loads. Pentanol-biodiesel blends result in an improvement in the BTE and a maximum of 2% increase in the BSFC. Compared to biodiesel, both the blended fuels can reduce the particulate mass and elemental carbon (EC) emissions, with butanol being more effective than pentanol. The blended fuels also show a lower emission of total particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and also a lower carcinogenic potential. However, the proportion of particulate-bound organic carbon (OC) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) are increased for the both blended fuels, especially for 20% butanol in blends. The emissions of volatile and solid particles are reduced significantly in terms of their counts for both kinds of blended fuels at medium and high engine loads, whereas the total particle counts for both 10% and 20% butanol in blended fuels are increased at low engine load due to a significant increase in particles with diameter less than 15 nm.

Abstract: The size and geometry of oxygen carriers are one of the key factors to determine the efficiency of a large-scale chemical looping combustion (CLC) system in fixed bed reactors, because they strongly affect the dynamic conditions of the gas-solid reactions, such as the intra particle mass transfer limitation for reactants, the pressure drop and the flow distribution. In the present work, we describe for the first time the utilization of bulk monolithic oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion of methane in a fixed bed reactor. The comparison on the structure and reactivity of the monolithic Ce-Zr-Fe-O/Al2O3 oxygen carrier with the powder one is investigated in detail. The successive CH4-reduction/air-oxidation redox testing of the monolithic oxygen carrier is also performed. It is found that the Ce-Zr-Fe-O/Al2O3 oxygen carriers own high activity for methane complete oxidation due to the strong active component

Abstract: This study focused on the primary breakup of diesel spray at the initial injector opening stage with split injection strategy at injection to atmospheric conditions. An ultrahigh speed CCD camera was employed to investigate the primary breakup of spray by photography technique with the help of backlighting. The injection pressure, dwell duration, distribution of injection duration between split injections and the number of the splits significantly affected the strength of primary collision and thus the primary breakup characteristics. Besides, the spray characteristics of the split injections except those of the first split injection were simultaneously affected by three main factors, namely, induced air driving force, lower mass flow rate and primary collision. The combined influence of the injection pressure, injection duration distribution and dwell duration determined the main effect on the affected split injections. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Different oil price shock incentives under different domestic and international environment will cause different oil price shocks and bring different impacts to China's macroeconomy. However, there are few empirical studies on early warning prediction of the co-movements between oil price shocks and macroeconomy. This paper presents an incentive-oriented artificial intelligent (AI) early warning system (EWS) with ontology supported case based reasoning (CBR) method, called "relationship between oil price shocks and economy-an early warning system (ROSE2)", to forecast the co-movements between macroeconomy and oil price shocks in China. Simultaneously, multi-galois lattice (MGL), which is more suitable for matching multiple attributes, is used to improve the recall and precision capability of ROSE2. Finally, several practical queries called Q1-Q4 are presented for verifying the validation and efficiency of the ROSE2 system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes the allocation of CO2 emissions increment quotas and carbon intensity reduction burdens based on information entropy method. Allocating emissions increment quotas and cutting emissions intensity target should consider each province's objective weights of some valuable factors, such as carbon emissions reduction capacity, responsibility, potential and energy efficiency under interprovincial emissions trading system in China. Those provinces with better economic level, heavier cumulative CO2 emissions, stronger industrial carbon intensity and greater energy consumers may undertake greater shares of carbon intensity reduction targets during 2014-2020. All provinces in China may achieve a surprising reduction of CO2 emissions increment quotas during 2014-2020 with an increase of national emissions intensity reduction targets, and then have to increase greater burdens of emissions intensity reduction compared with the 2013 level.

Abstract: Actions for increasing the renewable share in the energy supply and improving both production and end use energy efficiency are often built into the regional level sustainability targets. Because of this, many local stakeholders such as local governments, energy producers and distributors, industry, and public and private sector operators require information on the current state and development aspects of the regional energy efficiency. The drawback is that an overall view on the focal energy system operators, their energy interests, and future energy service needs in the region is often not available for the stake-holders. To support the local energy planning and management of the regional energy services, an approach for increasing the regional energy efficiency is being introduced. The presented approach can be seen as a solid framework for gathering the required data for energy efficiency analysis and also evaluating the energy system development, planned improvement actions, and the required energy services at the region. This study defines the theoretical structure of the energy efficiency approach and the required steps for revealing such energy system improvement actions that support the regional energy plan. To demonstrate the use of the approach, a case study of a Finnish small-town of Lohja is presented. In the case example, possible actions linked to the regional energy targets were evaluated with energy efficiency analysis. The results of the case example are system specific, but the conducted study can be seen as a justified example of generating easily attainable and transparent information on the impacts of different improvement actions on the regional energy system.

Abstract: The Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used in the broad field of continuum mechanics in engineering disciplines for several decades. However, recently, some scholars have attempted to apply the method to social science phenomena. What is the scope of using FEM in social science-related fields? Anchored in the literature on social sciences, this paper, firstly, reviews the scope of using FEM in social science phenomena, and then applies FEM to a semi-hypothetical case study on the diffusion of solar photovoltaic systems in southern Germany. By doing so, the paper aims to shed light on why and how the Finite Element Method can be used to forecast the diffusion of solar photovoltaic systems in time and space. Unlike conventional models used in diffusion literature, the computational model considers spatial heterogeneity. The model is based on a partial differential equation that describes the diffusion ratio of photovoltaic systems in a given region over time. The results of the application show that the FEM constitutes a powerful tool by which to study the diffusion of an innovation as a simultaneous space-time process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Large integration of solar Photo Voltaic (PV) in distribution network has resulted in over-voltage problems. Several control techniques are developed to address over-voltage problem using Deterministic Load Flow (DLF). However, intermittent characteristics of PV generation require Probabilistic Load Flow (PLF) to introduce variability in analysis that is ignored in DLF. The traditional PLF techniques are not suitable for distribution systems and suffer from several drawbacks such as computational burden (Monte Carlo, Conventional convolution), sensitive accuracy with the complexity of system (point estimation method), requirement of necessary linearization (multi-linear simulation) and convergence problem (Gram-Charlier expansion, Cornish Fisher expansion). In this research, Latin Hypercube Sampling with Cholesky Decomposition (LHS-CD) is used to quantify the over-voltage issues with and without the voltage control algorithm in the distribution network with active generation. LHS technique is verified with a test network and real system from an Australian distribution network service provider. Accuracy and computational burden of simulated results are also compared with Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In energy markets, regulators are often tempted to use price schedules to improve economic efficiency and promote a reasonable resource allocation. Time-of-use pricing is very popular with economists, and many researchers have been written estimating and exploring the optimal time-of-use pricing for electricity markets. Yet, such pricing has rarely been used in the natural gas sector. In this paper, we propose an optimal time-of-use pricing in urban gas market based on an evolutionary game-theoretic perspective. As the urban gas market is a nonlinear complex economic system with several interacting agents, we use a multi-agent system comprising a government agent, a local gas distribution operator agent, and different types of end-user agents. A power structure demand response program is employed to simulate the user demand response. A mixed-integer linear programming is formulated to determine the time-of-use price-signal delivering maximum gas operator profit and the optimal load pattern for end-users. In an illustrative example, we simulate and compare the time-of-use block prices and time of-use hourly prices with traditional fixed pricing using real-world data of Wuhan in China. The numerical results indicate that time-of-use pricing schedules have significant potential for peak-shaving and load-shifting for urban gas pipeline network systems and would thus lower operating costs. Furthermore, different gas users exhibit different demand responsiveness intensity. Finally, we evaluate the impact on total social welfare of regulation scenarios and find that welfare decreases with deregulation, implying that the urban gas market is immature and reasonable regulation is still necessary.

Abstract: The aging rate under cycling conditions for lithium-ion cells is affected by many factors. Seven principal factors are systematically examined using orthogonal design of experiments, and statistical analysis was used to identify the order of principal factors in terms of strength in causing capacity fade. These seven principal factors are: the charge and discharge currents (i(1),i(2)) during the constant current regime, the charge and discharge cut-off voltages (V-1, V-2) and the corresponding durations (t(1), t(2)) during the constant voltage regime, and the ambient temperature (T). An orthogonal array with 18 test units was selected for the experiments. The test results show that (1) during the initial 10% capacity fading period, the capacity faded linearly with Wh-throughput for all the test conditions; (2) after the initial period, certain cycling conditions exacerbated aging rates, while the others remain the same. The statistical results show that: (1) except for t(1), the other six principal factors significantly affect the aging rate; (2) the strength of the principal factors was ranked as: i(1) > V-1 > T > t(2) > V-2 > i(2) > t(1). Finally, a multi-factor statistical aging model is developed to predict the aging rate, and the accuracy of the model is validated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An optimal structural design model of residential power and heat supply devices (R-PHDs), including cogeneration and heat pump units, was developed by considering their operational and capital recovery constraints. The structure of R-PHDs with peripheral devices, sizes of energy storage devices, and their multi-period operation were determined so as to minimize annual primary energy consumption. In addition to various operational constraints for a cogeneration unit and a battery unit, an operable hours constraint and daily selection of outlet water temperature were newly formulated for heat pump units. The capital recovery by reducing energy cost was also considered in order to select R-PHDs that have high energy-saving effects but are presently expensive. The developed model took the form of a mixed-integer linear programming problem. The model was applied to the structural design of R-PHDs, whose candidates are three types of cogeneration units (gas engine, polymer electrolyte fuel cell, and solid oxide fuel cell), heat pump unit, storage tank, battery unit, and peripheral devices. The result revealed a trade-off between energy savings and initial cost in the optimal structures. A sensitivity analysis of the initial costs of expensive devices was also carried out to clarify their initial cost targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the present study, the biomass upgrading depot capacity and biomass feedstock moisture were optimized to obtain the minimum production cost at the depot gate for the production of woody biofuels. Three technology scenarios are considered in this study: (1) conventional pellets (CP), (2) modestly torrefied pellets (TP1) and (3) severely torrefied pellets (TP2). TP1 has the lowest cost of $7.03/GJ(LHV) at a moisture of 33 wt.% and a depot size of 84 MWLHV. The effects of climatic conditions and biomass field conditions were also studied for three scenarios. In humid regions of Michigan, TP2 is more economical than other scenarios because of the increased production of combustible gas. The three scenarios have similar sensitivities to biomass field conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: When used in cold environment, the conventional flat plate solar collectors and all-glass evacuated tube solar collectors will cause various problems, such as large heat loss, low efficiency, freeze and tube-burst, which severely limit their applications. In this paper, a special small-sized parabolic trough solar collector (PTC), which could overcome the shortcomings of conventional solar collectors, was proposed for water heating in cold areas. An experimental platform was developed, and extensive tests were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of the proposed PTC. It was found that the thermal efficiency of the proposed PTC reached about 67% even under the condition of solar radiation of less than 310 W/m(2), indicating that the PTC could collect solar radiation efficiently. The results also showed that when the fluid temperature was under 100 degrees C, the thermal efficiency was improved with increased fluid temperature, due to the increase of Reynolds number caused by the great variation of thermophysical parameters of the heat transfer fluid (HTF), which resulted from the increasing fluid temperature. Both the frosting on the reflector and the ambient wind velocity weakened the thermal efficiency greatly. The highest thermal efficiencies were respectively about 26% and 56% under condition of frosting and wind velocity of 5.0 m/s. The comparison test showed the coated double glazing receiver had a longer temperature response delay to the deflected sunlight than that of the uncoated one. The tested PTC system operated normally in low fluid temperature condition, showing great anti-freezing property in cold environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Low-temperature pyrolysis is an economically efficient method for lignite to obtain coal tar and improve its combustion calorific value. The research on the distribution of pyrolysis product (especially coal tar yield) plays an important role in energy application and economic development in the now and future. Pyrolysis test was carried out in a tube reactor at 873 K for 15 min. The structure of the lignite was measured by solid C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thermal analysis was analyzed by thermo-gravimetric (TG) analyzer. The results show that the pyrolysis product distribution is related to the breakage of branch structures of aromatic ring in lignites from different sedimentary environment. The gas yield and composition are related to the decomposition of carbonyl group and the breakage of aliphatic carbon. The tar yield derived from lignite pyrolysis follows the order: Xianfeng lignite (XF, 13.67 wt.%) > Xiaolongtan lignite (XLT, 7.97 wt.%) > Inner Mongolia lignite (IM, 6.30 wt.%), which is mainly influenced by the aliphatic carbon contents, the CH2/H-3 ratio and the oxygen functional groups in lignite. The pyrolysis water yield depends on the decomposition of oxygen functional groups. IM has the highest content of oxygen-linked carbon so that the pyrolysis water yield derived from IM is the highest (9.20 wt.%), and is far more than that from the other two lignites.

Abstract: The rapid growth of energy consumption in China has led to increased emissions of air pollutants. As a response, in its 12th Five Year Plan the Chinese government proposed mitigation targets for SO2 and NOx emissions. In this paper, we have investigated mitigation measures taken in different sectors and their corresponding impacts on the energy system. Additionally, as non-fossil energy development has gained attention in addressing energy and environmental challenges in China, we investigated the impact of non-fossil energy development on air pollutant emissions, and explored interactions and co-benefits between these two types of policies. An extended Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) was used in this study. The extended version of GCAM includes an additional air pollutant emissions control module coupling multiple end-of-pipe (EOP) control technologies with energy technologies, as well as more detailed end-use sectors in China. We find that implementing EOP control technologies would reduce air pollution in the near future, but with little room left to implement these EOP technologies, other cleaner and more efficient technologies are also effective. These technologies would reduce final energy consumption, increase electricity's share in final energy, and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy and electricity consumption. Increasing non-fossil energy usage at China's proposed adoption rate would in turn also reduce SO2 and NO, emissions, however, the reductions from this policy alone still lag behind the targets for air pollutant reduction. A combination of air pollutant controls and non-fossil energy development could synergistically help realize the respective individual targets, and would result in lower costs than would addressing these issues separately.

Abstract: Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on the planet. However, power generation from coal results in large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Solvent-based carbon capture is a relatively mature technology which can potentially mitigate these emissions. Although, much research has been done on this topic, single-point performance analysis of capture plant and ignoring operational characteristics of the upstream power plant may result in unrealistic performance assessments. This paper introduces a new methodology to assess the performance of CO2 capture solvents. The problem is posed as retrofitting an existing pulverized coal power plant with post-combustion carbon capture using two solvents: CDRMax, a recently developed amine-promoted buffer salt (APBS) solvent by Carbon Clean Solutions Limited (CCSL) and the monoethanolamine (MEA) baseline solvent. The features of interest include model development and validation using pilot plant data, as well as integrated design and control of the capture process. The emphasis is on design and operation of the capture plant, when integrated with the upstream coal-fired power plant, subject to variations in the electricity load. The results suggest that optimal design and operation of capture plant can significantly mitigate the energetic penalties associated with carbon capture form the flue gas, while providing effective measures for comparing solvent performances under various scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents and applies a camera-based fuel tracking system for quantification of the motion of individual fuel particles at the surface of bubbling fluidized beds operated under hot conditions. In particular a bubbling fluidized bed with a cross section of 1.44 m(2) operated at 800 degrees C is investigated. Mixing of wood pellets and wood chips is investigated by feeding batches of fuel and applying multi particle tracking to the videos recorded by a specially designed camera probe. The influence of the bulk solids cross-flow and fluidization velocity on the mixing of fuel particles is analyzed.
It is shown that the new fuel tracking method can withstand industrial conditions. Applying the method gives reproducible results and yields lateral dispersion coefficients in the range 10(-3)-10(-2) m(2)/s for both pellets and wood chips. The lateral mixing of the fuel increases with fluidization velocity and, to a minor extent, with the cross-flow of bulk solids. As observed in previous work, the location of fuel particles on the bed surface confirms the existence of preferred bubble paths, and these are smeared out by the cross-flow of bulk solids. The vertical mixing is hindered by the cross-flow of bulk solids, while it is enhanced by fluidization velocity, which is in agreement with previous research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Integration of renewable energy sources in microgrids can be achieved via demand response programs, which change the electric usage in response to changes in the availability and price of electricity over time. This paper presents a novel control algorithm for joint demand response management and thermal comfort optimization in microgrids equipped with renewable energy sources and energy storage units. The proposed work aims at covering two main gaps in current state-of-the-art demand response programs. The first gap is integrating the objective of matching energy generation and consumption with the occupant behavior and with the objective of guaranteeing thermal comfort of the occupants. The second gap is developing a scalable and robust demand response program. Large-scale nature of the optimization problem and robustness are achieved via a two-level supervisory closed-loop feedback strategy: at the lower level, each building of the microgrid employs a local closed-loop feedback controller that processes only local measurements; at the upper level, a centralized unit supervises and updates the local controllers with the aim of minimizing the aggregate energy cost and thermal discomfort of the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a microgrid composed of three buildings, a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, and an energy storage unit. Comparisons with alternative demand response strategies reveal that the proposed strategy efficiently integrates the renewable sources; energy costs are reduced and at the same time thermal comfort of the occupants is guaranteed. Furthermore, robustness is proved via consistent improvements achieved under heterogeneous conditions (different occupancy schedules and different weather conditions). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Current aims regarding environmental protection, like reduction of fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, require the development of new technologies. These new technologies enable the production of renewable energy, which is both cleaner and more abundant in comparison to using fossil fuels for energy production. This necessity encourages researchers to develop new ways to capture solar energy, and if possible, store it for later use. In this paper, the Pavement Solar Collector (PSC), and its use to extract low temperature thermal energy, is studied. Such a system, which harvests energy by flowing water through a heat exchanger embedded in the pavement structure, could have a significant energy output since pavement materials tend to absorb large amounts of solar radiation. The main objective of this paper is to develop a modeling framework for the PSC system and validate it with a self -instructed experiment. Such a model will allow for a detailed parametric study of the system to optimize the design, as well as an investigation on the effect of aging (e.g. decreasing solar absorptivity) on the performance of the system. A long-term energy output of the system that is currently lacking is calculated based on results of the study on weather parameters. This newly acquired data could be the start of a comprehensive data set on the performance of a PSC, which leads to a comprehensive feasibility study of the system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This work presents the characterization results of a Canadian ilmenite ore tested in pressurized chemical looping combustion cycles. The ilmenite ore was isothermally cycled in a pressurized thermogravimetric analyzer using carbon monoxide as a reducing fuel and air as an oxidizing gas. All samples were calcined prior to submission to cycles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) comparing raw and calcined ore samples indicate the disappearance of ilmenite crystals and the formation of rutile and ferric pseudobrookite. Cycled ilmenite ore surface morphology was found to be insensitive to the total pressure (up to 51 bar) and CO partial pressure (3.2-8.0 bar). These findings are in agreement with thermodynamic equilibrium predictions using FactSage. SEM images reveal the development of cracks in the oxidized particles after 4 redox cycles at 950 degrees C and 16 bar, which was correlated to the original lamellar structure of the raw ilmenite ore. Increasing the number of redox cycles from 3.5 to 19.5 resulted in large cracks near iron-rich lamellae. Furthermore, the average grain size was smaller after 19.5 cycles. Increasing the reaction temperature from 850 degrees C to 1050 degrees C resulted in similar surface morphologies, but increased grain size. Despite being below melting temperatures, the sample cycled at 1050 degrees C did agglomerate. Local temperature excursions during sample oxidation may have led to melting. This study provides insights into the phase transformations and morphological changes accompanying the use of this type of ilmenite ore in a pressurized chemical looping combustion process, highlighting the need for proper adjustments to the design and operation of the process.

Abstract: To develop an environmentally acceptable refuelling solution for fuel cell-powered unmanned aerial systems (UASs) to operate in remote areas, hydrogen fuel must be produced on-site from renewable energy sources. This paper describes a Matlab-based simulation tool specifically developed to pre-design offgrid hydrogen refuelling systems for UAS applications. The refuelling system comprises a high concentrated PV array (CPV), an electrolyser, a hydrogen buffer tank and a diaphragm hydrogen compressor. Small composite tanks are also included for fast refuelling of the UAV platforms at any time during the year. The novel approach of selecting a CPV power source is justified on the basis of minimizing the system footprint (versus flat plat or low concentration PV), aiming for a containerized remotely deployable UAS offgrid refuelling solution.
To validate the simulation tool a number of simulations were performed using experimental data from a prototype offgrid hydrogen refuelling station for UAVs developed by Boeing Research & Technology Europe. Solar irradiation data for a selected location and daily UAS hydrogen demands of between 2.8 and 15.8 Nm(3) were employed as the primary inputs, in order to calculate a recommended system sizing solution and assess the expected operation of the refuelling system across a given year. The specific energy consumption of the refuelling system obtained from the simulations is between 5.6 and 8.9 kW h(e) per kg of hydrogen delivered to the UAVs, being lower for larger daily hydrogen demands. Increasing the CPV area and electrolyser size in order to supply higher daily hydrogen demands (e.g., above 10 Nm(3) H-2 per day) improves the system operability. However this can imply excessive system size and costs, jeopardizing the techno-economic feasibility of a remotely deployable off-grid refuelling solution. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract: Desiccant wheels have been extensively used for energy recovery of ventilation air from buildings. Performance of these wheels is influenced by many factors like the material properties, wheel matrix structures, operating conditions and fluid parameters. Previous studies only involved the macro-scale heat and mass transfer in the wheels and the system performance, by neglecting the micro-scale properties of wheel materials. In this study, a dual-scale modeling approach was proposed for a desiccant wheel with a novel organic-inorganic hybrid adsorbent (HA) material which combines high adsorption capability with good mechanical durability. The proposed dual-scale model included a micro-scale molecular dynamics (MD) sub-model for adsorbent material, a macro-scale sub-model for heat and mass transfer in matrix channels and system performance evaluation. The two sub-models were linked together through information exchange to form the dual-scale model. Through modeling, the effects of the micro physical-chemical properties of materials and macro structure of wheels, as well as the operating parameters on system performance were investigated. With the dual-scale model as a design tool, material compositions were optimized. The moisture adsorption capacity of the material was two times higher than that of silica gel B at high relative humidities. Consequently the sensible and latent effectiveness were improved by 12% and 30% respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel study of models for forecasting the electrical load for supermarket refrigeration. The data used for building the models consists of load measurements, local climate measurements and weather forecasts. The load measurements are from a supermarket located in a village in Denmark. Every hour the hourly electrical load for refrigeration is forecasted for the following 42 h. The forecast models are adaptive linear time series models. The model has two regimes; one for opening hours and one for closing hours, this is modeled by a regime switching model and two different methods for predicting the regimes are tested. The dynamic relation between the weather and the load is modeled by simple transfer functions and the non-linearities are described using spline functions. The results are thoroughly evaluated and it is shown that the spline functions are suitable for handling the non-linear relations and that after applying an auto-regressive noise model the one-step ahead residuals do not contain further significant information.

Abstract: In this paper a novel optimal Model Reference Adaptive Control approach, developed to tame the thermohygrometric behaviour of buildings as well as to guarantee the indoor comfort, is presented. The main advantages of the proposed method are: (i) no-need of a priori knowledge of the specific building dynamics due to climate, occupants' behaviour, building use, envelope features and utility rates; (ii) robustness with respect to a large class of perturbations, external disturbances, nonlinear unmodelled dynamics or parameters uncertainty; (iii) ability to impose desired optimal dynamics; (iv) accurate regulation and fast tracking of indoor air temperature and humidity in the case of stringent requirements in special building spaces (e.g. hospitals, museums, laboratories, etc.).
In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the developed strategy has been implemented in the new release of a white-modelling building energy performance simulation code, called DETECt 2.3. The tool enables multi-zone building simulation analyses and is capable to dynamically predict: (i) spaces sensible and latent heating and cooling demands and loads; (ii) indoor air temperatures and humidity, as well as building envelope internal and external temperatures; (iii) the performance of phase change materials (PCM) embedded in building enclosures and for any layer configuration; (iv) the thermohygrometric comfort of occupants.
In order to analyse the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy, several case studies have been carried out. They refer to some reference buildings with different geometry, use and construction materials (also including PCM integrated into the building envelope) simulated in different weather conditions. For each case study, both continuous and intermittent control system regimes have been considered. Results confirm the ability of the developed approach to achieve the selected indoor air temperature and humidity conditions in order to guarantee indoor comfort in uncertain conditions. The numerical analysis is complemented with the rigorous analytical proof of asymptotic stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As reported in the scientific literature and mentioned in building energy performance legislation, the thermal inertia of the opaque building envelope can have a significant positive impact on the reduction of summer indoor overheating, of space cooling peak load and of electricity consumption. At the early stages of the envelope design, there is a need to use simplified as well as effective parameters to correctly characterize the thermal performance of the opaque envelope under dynamic conditions.
In this work, a new methodology to describe the dynamic thermal behavior of opaque components is proposed. The approach is based on the harmonic parameters specified in ISO 13786 but it also takes into account realistic boundary conditions for different orientations and solar absorptance values. New equivalent thermal parameters are determined by means of dynamic simulations. The use of these parameters to assess the conduction heat flow rate by means of a simplified model is validated through a comparison with the results of a dynamic simulation.
The method presented in the article represents an improvement with respect to the parameters usually applied at the early design stage to thermally characterize the opaque envelope of the building under dynamic conditions. In fact, it allows simplified but reliable performance parameters referring to actual boundary conditions to be obtained. The application potential of the proposed methodology lies in the drawing -up of catalogues and technical standards that supply the values of the new equivalent thermal parameters for different technical solutions.

Abstract: Wind energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources in Germany and plays a key role regarding energy and climate policy targets of the German government. However, a further diffusion of wind farms involves strong spatial implications that refer to various adverse effects on landscape (onshore wind), noise level, and wildlife. Negative environmental impacts caused by the sometimes suboptimal siting of wind farms have induced an increasing gap between the social acceptance of this technology on the global and local levels. Particularly on the local level, siting processes of wind farm projects often trigger public protest. The aim of this paper is to improve the siting assessment by providing a holistic multi-criteria decision making approach that incorporates techno-economic, socio-political, and environmental criteria, which are defined in a way that social acceptance-related issues are specifically emphasized. We apply a GIS-based Analytic Hierarchy Process approach, where a group of local experts and stakeholders is asked to pairwise compare the incorporated criteria in order to derive the relative importance of each criterion. The results obtained indicate that 9.4% of the study area is still available for wind energy development, whereas only 1.74% of the region is characterized by high suitability. In particular, the northern part of the region offers substantial unexploited wind energy potential. A comparison with the location of existing wind farms validates the reliability and accuracy of the model results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Understanding the drivers of past and present energy consumption trends is important for a range of stakeholders, including governments, businesses and international development organizations, in order to prepare for impacts on global supply chains caused by changes in future energy price or availability shocks. In this paper we use environmentally-extended input-output tables to: (a) quantify the long-term drivers that have led to diversified energy footprint profiles of 186 countries around the world from 1990 to 2010; (b) identify which countries and sectors recorded an increase or decrease in energy footprints during this time period; (c) highlight the effect of international outsourcing of energy intensive production processes by decomposing the structural and spatial change in energy footprints; and (d) discuss the implications for national economic policy for the identified drivers. To this end, we use a detailed Multi-Regional Input-Output database and three prevalent structural decomposition analysis methods. To reduce biases in the results due to time lapse and currency variations, we convert input-output tables to common US$ and 1990-constant prices. This study provides a broad overview of the magnitude and distribution of the drivers for energy footprints across countries. The results of this study demonstrate that for almost all countries affluence and population growth are driving energy footprints worldwide, which is in part counteracted by the retarding effect of industrial energy intensity. In particular, this study demonstrates that with increasing per-capita GDP, the total energy footprint of a country is increasingly concentrated on imports or consumption.

Abstract: In this study, the thermodynamic behaviors, cage-specific guest distributions, structural transition, and dissociation enthalpies of sH hydrates with CO2 + N-2 gas mixtures were investigated for their potential applications to hydrate-based CO2 capture and sequestration. The stability conditions of the CO2 + N-2 + water systems and the CO2 + N-2 neohexane (2,2-dimethylbutane, NH) + water systems indicated that the gas mixtures in the range of flue gas compositions could form sH hydrates, thereby mitigating the pressure and temperature required for gas hydrate formation. Structure identification using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed the coexistence of sI and sH hydrates in the CO2 (40%) + N-2 (60%) + NH system and the hydrate structure transformed from sH into sI as the CO2 concentration increased. In addition, the Raman analysis clearly demonstrated that CO2 molecules were enclathrated into the cages of sH hydrates in the N-2-rich systems. It was found from direct CO2 composition measurements that CO2 selectivity in the sH hydrate phase was slightly lower than that in the corresponding sI hydrate phase. Dissociation enthalpy (Delta H-d) measurements using a high-pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter (HP mu-DSC) indicated that the Delta Hd values could also provide valuable information on the structural transition of sH to sI hydrates with respect to the CO2 concentration in the feed gas. This study provides a better understanding of the thermodynamic and physicochemical background for CO2 enclathration in the sH hydrates and its significance in gas hydrate-based CO2 capture and sequestration.

Abstract: Due to communication and technology developments, residential consumers are enabled to participate in Demand Response Programs (DRPs), control their consumption and decrease their cost by using Household Energy Management (HEM) systems. On the other hand, capability of energy storage systems to improve the energy efficiency causes that employing Phase Change Materials (PCM) as thermal storage systems to be widely addressed in the building applications. In this paper, an operational model of HEM system considering the incorporation of more than one type of PCM in plastering mortars (hybrid PCM) is proposed not only to minimize the customer's cost in different DRPs but also to guaranty the habitants' satisfaction. Moreover, the proposed model ensures the technical and economic limits of batteries and electrical appliances. Different case studies indicate that implementation of hybrid PCM in the buildings can meaningfully affect the operational pattern of HEM systems in different DRPs. The results reveal that the customer's electricity cost can be reduced up to 48% by utilizing the proposed model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of naturally occurring ores as oxygen carriers in CLC processes is attractive because of their relative abundance and low cost. Unfortunately, they typically exhibit lower reactivity and lack the mechanical robustness required, when compared to synthetically produced carriers. Impregnation is a suitable method for enhancing both the reactivity and durability of natural ores when used as oxygen carriers for CLC systems. This investigation uses impregnation to improve the chemical and mechanical properties of a Brazilian manganese ore and a Canadian iron ore. The manganese ore was impregnated with Fe2O3 and the iron ore was impregnated with Mn2O3 with the goal of forming a combined Fe/Mn oxygen carrier. The impregnated ore's physical characteristics were assessed by SEM, BET and XRD analysis. Measurements of the attrition resistance and crushing strength were used to investigate the mechanical robustness of the oxygen carriers. The impregnated ore's mechanical and physical properties were clearly enhanced by the impregnation method, with boosts in crushing strength of 11-26% and attrition resistance of 37-31% for the impregnated iron and manganese ores, respectively. Both the unmodified and impregnated ore's reactivity, for the conversion of gaseous fuel (CH4 and syngas) and gaseous oxygen release (CLOU potential) were investigated using a bench-scale quartz fluidised-bed reactor. The impregnated iron ore exhibited a greater degree of syngas conversion compared to the other samples examined. Iron ore based oxygen carrier's syngas conversion increases with the number of oxidation and reduction cycles performed. The impregnated iron ore exhibited gaseous oxygen release over extended periods in an inert atmosphere and remained at a constant 0.2% 02 concentration by volume at the end of this inert period. This oxygen release would help ensure the efficient use of solid fuels. The impregnated iron ore's reactivity for CH4 conversion was similar to the reactivity of its unmodified counterpart. The unmodified manganese ore converted CH4 to the greatest extent of all the samples tested here, while the impregnated manganese ore exhibited a decrease in reactivity with respect to syngas and CH4 conversion.

Abstract: In this study, soot formation in a Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine is simulated using a Stochastic Reactor Model (SRM Engine Suite) which contains a detailed population balance soot model capable of describing particle morphology and chemical composition. In order to describe the soot formation originating from the wall film, the SRM Engine Suite is extended to include spray impingement and wall film evaporation models. The cylinder is divided into a wall and a bulk zone to resolve the equivalence ratio and temperature distributions of the mixture near the wall. The combustion chamber wall is assumed to exchange heat directly only with the wall zone. The turbulent mixing within each zone and between the two zones are simulated with different mixing models. The effects of key parameters on the temperature and equivalence ratio in the two zones are investigated. The mixing rate between the wall and bulk zone has a significant effect on the wall zone, whilst the mixing rate in the wall zone only has a negligible impact on the temperature and equivalence ratio below a certain threshold. Experimental data are obtained from a four-cylinder, gasoline-fuelled direct injection spark ignition engine operated stoichiometrically. An injection timing sweep, ranging from 120 CAD BTDC to 330 CAD BTDC, is conducted in order to investigate the effect of spray impingement on soot formation. The earliest injection case (330 CAD BTDC), which produces significantly higher levels of particle emissions than any other case, is simulated by the current model. It is found that the in-cylinder pressure and the heat release rate match well with the experimental data. The particle size distribution in the simulation has the same order of magnitude as the experimental one. By tracing the particles in an equivalence ratio-temperature diagram, it is demonstrated that the rich mixture near the wall becomes the source of the soot formation as a result of the wall film evaporation.

Abstract: Due to fast rising energy demand, Southeast Asia has become a larger energy consumer and bigger player in global energy markets. Energy security and environmental emissions reduction have become higher priorities to ensure energy supply at affordable costs, for continued economic growth and development. To address these issues renewable energy plays a vital role in the long-term future for sustainable development. This paper estimates and analyzes the renewable energy potential in the energy mix in two Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia and Thailand. The LEAP energy model is used to develop different renewable energy policy scenarios from base year 2010 to 2050. The results of the simulation show that a large proportion of electricity must be produced by renewables by 2050 if full potential of renewables is to be exploited. In this case, 81% and 88% of CO2 emissions are reduced in Indonesia and Thailand respectively. In implementing renewables at large scale in both these countries the cost of production increases substantially. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper addresses the energy management strategy (EMS) for a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV). The purpose of this paper is to ensure an optimal power splitting between the fuel cell system (FCS) and the battery pack, taking into account the operating conditions of the FCS. The FCS is a multi-physics system, and consequently, its energetic performances depend on the operating conditions (i.e., temperature, gas relative humidity, gas stoichiometry, pressure and ageing). Specific techniques must be used to reach the best performances of the FCS. In this work, models are identified online by using the adaptive recursive least square (ARLS) method to seek a variation in the FCS performances. Then, an optimization algorithm is used on the updated model to find the best efficiency and power operating points. This process is used into an optimal EMS based on Pontryagin's minimum principle, for a FC-HEV. The effectiveness of the proposed EMS is demonstrated by conducting studies on two FCSs with different levels of degradation. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: By employing the SAFT-VR Mie equation of state, molecular-based models are developed from which the thermodynamic properties of pure (i.e., single-component) organic fluids and their mixtures are calculated. This approach can enable the selection of optimal working fluids in organic Rankine cycle (ORC) applications, even in cases for which experimental data relating to mixture properties are not available. After developing models for perfluoroalkane (n-C4F10 + n-C10F22) mixtures, and validating these against available experimental data, SAFT-VR Mie is shown to predict accurately both the single-phase and saturation properties of these fluids. In particular, second-derivative properties (e.g., specific heat capacities), which are less reliably calculated by cubic equations of state (EoS), are accurately described using SAFT-VR Mie, thereby enabling an accurate prediction of important working-fluid properties such as the specific entropy. The property data are then used in thermodynamic cycle analyses for the evaluation of ORC performance and cost. The approach is applied to a specific case study in which a sub-critical, non-regenerative ORC system recovers and converts waste heat from a refinery flue-gas stream with fixed, predefined conditions. Results are compared with those obtained when employing analogue alkane mixtures (n-C4H10 + n-Ci(10)H(22)) for which sufficient thermodynamic property data exist. When unlimited quantities of cooling water are utilized, pure perfluorobutane (and pure butane) cycles exhibit higher power outputs and higher thermal efficiencies compared to mixtures with perfluorodecane (or decane), respectively. The effect of the composition of a working-fluid mixture in the aforementioned performance indicators is non-trivial. Only at low evaporator pressures (<10 bar) do the investigated mixtures perform better than the pure fluids. A basic cost analysis reveals that systems with pure perfluorobutane (and butane) fluids are associated with relatively high total costs, but are nevertheless more cost effective per unit power output than the fluid mixtures (due to the higher generated power). When the quantity of cooling water is constrained by the application, overall performance deteriorates, and mixtures emerge as the optimal working fluids. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract: Recently, large-scale renewable energy resources have been widely integrated into power systems. To optimize large-scale integration of these resources and improve the operation performance of the distribution system, this paper proposes a novel dynamic energy management strategy with the cooperative interaction of an energy system: a multi-grid connected microgrids (MGs)-based active distribution system (ADS). A bi-level multi-objective optimization problem of the strategy is formulated with the active distribution network (ADN) in the upper level and MGs in the lower level. The interaction can be classified into two categories: the one between MGs and the ADN and the other one among MGs. The former is described by bi-level programming; the latter is innovatively explained by an interactive energy game matrix (IEGM) defined in this paper. The concept of the expanded energy storage system is defined and applied to the IEGM for the optimal operation of ADSs. The optimal operation includes improved technical performances in terms of power quality, energy utilization, adaptability and autonomy. The optimization problem is solved with a hybrid algorithm of Rough Set Theory-Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm-NSGA-II. Case studies of an ADS with different MGs and a real system would validate the efficiency of the proposed methodology. Results show that the proposed EM strategy can accurately quantify and guide the energy interaction among MGs and that between MGs and the ADN. Moreover, those technical performances of the ADS are improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An integrated short-cut nitrification and autotrophic denitrification microbial fuel cell (SNAD-MFC) was developed to achieve energy-positive nitrogen removal from wastewater. Ammonium was reduced mostly to nitrite instead of nitrate (the ratio of nitrite to nitrate: 3.0) in the cathode chamber of the short-cut nitrification MFC at low dissolved oxygen concentration (<= 3.5 mg/L), and nitrite was reduced to nitrogen gas through autotrophic denitrification in the cathode chamber of the denitrification MFC by using the electrons produced from anode chamber. The total nitrogen removal rate was 0.0125 kg N/m(3) d and the removal efficiency was 99.9%. The power generation in the short-cut nitrification MFC was 294.9 mW/m(2) with the highest current density of 0.158 mA/cm(2). The accumulated coulombs of the whole SNAD-MFC were 87.17 C at DO 3.5 mg/L. Unlike the energy-negative and carbon intensive biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes, the SNAD-MFC exhibits the distinct advantages of compact configuration, low aeration cost, no requirement of carbon sources, and produces the net electric power of 0.007 kW h/m(3), which has a high potential for self-sustained energy-positive nutrient removal.

Abstract: This study reports the thermal analysis of Al-Si alloys as candidate high-temperature phase-change materials (PCM) for temperatures above 500 degrees C and the corrosion behavior of the alloys with ceramic materials. Four Al-Si alloys with different Si contents (0-25 wt%) were selected as PCMs. Engineering ceramics such as Al2O3, AIN, Si3N4, SiC, and SiO2 were used for corrosion tests. Thermal analysis showed that the Al-Si alloys were better than conventional molten salts as PCM candidates because of the high heat storage capacity and high thermal conductivity of the alloys. The corrosion tests revealed that Al2O3, AIN, and Si3N4 showed high corrosion resistance to molten Al-Si alloys; therefore, these ceramics were suitable as structural materials for a latent heat storage (LHS) system using Al-Si alloys. These results demonstrate the feasibility of high-temperature LHS systems using Al-Si alloys as the PCMs and ceramics as structural materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are attractive as a power source options because ethanol is a nontoxic, leading to ease of handling and a high energy density fuel, leading to high system energy density. However, to provide practical DEFCs power source there are several issues that still must be addressed including low power density, effect of ethanol crossover on efficiency of fuel utilization, electrical, mechanical and thermal stability and water uptake of the DEFCs electrolyte membrane. This paper describes the proton exchange membrane and alkaline exchange membrane for DEFCs, focusing on current problems and advancements in DEFC membranes. It also presents the specifications and performances of the membranes used in DEFC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Four possible supply cost scenarios are proposed considering the uncertainties of import price, domestic unconventional gas production cost and geopolitical turbulence in import source countries. The analysis results show that (1). Domestic unconventional gas production cost (wellhead price) and gas import cost (import gas price represented by CIF) are two key points to gas flow and infrastructure deployment in China; (2). The development of unconventional gas is conductive to supply cost reduction and maintenance of infrastructure deployment stability, especially to Southwest and North China regions; (3). When gas import price increases, LNG import will decrease more than pipeline import, and imported LNG will be partly replaced by pipeline import rather than domestic gas in coastal regions; (4). The disruption of gas supply from Myanmar will lead to great changes of gas flow and infrastructure deployment in Southwest China regions; (5). The infrastructures are deployed according to the optimization gas flow in different scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy supply systems are usually considered as individual sub-systems with separate energy vectors. However, the use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, heat pumps and electric boilers creates linkages between electricity and heat networks. Two combined analysis methods were developed to investigate the performance of electricity and heat networks as an integrated whole. These two methods were the decomposed and integrated electrical-hydraulic-thermal calculation techniques in the forms of power flow and simple optimal dispatch. Both methods were based on models of the electrical network, hydraulic and thermal circuits, and the coupling components, focusing on CHP units and circulation pumps. A case study of Barry Island electricity and district heating networks was conducted, showing how both electrical and heat demand in a self-sufficient system (no interconnection with external systems) were met using CHP units. The comparison showed that the integrated method requires less iteration than the decomposed method. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Internal combustion engines are still the energy conversion units of choice in transport and distributed energy generation. Due to the fuel mix, spark ignition (SI) engines represent a viable solution that features improved fuel flexibility with respect to their compression ignition counterparts. Therefore, manufacturers are continuously trying to increase their performance and reduce emissions through experimental and numerical investigations. A growing trend in engine improvement is the application of simulations on a wider scale in order to contain development costs. Combustion is the most complex part of the working cycle and for SI power units, modeling flame propagation represents an essential feature of predictive numerical investigations. Within this context, the present study was aimed at better understanding the mass transfer between unburned and reacting gas, as well as characteristic reaction time scales within the reaction zone. A OD model with three zones was applied for different engine speed, load, air-fuel ratio and spark timing settings, chosen as representative for mid-road load automotive use. Combined in-cylinder pressure measurements and flame imaging were used for validating the essential concept of fresh charge entrainment and burn-up process. One major conclusion of the work was that there is a definite stratification of chemical species within the burned-reacting gas that can be well captured by the entrainment model. The fact that the calibration coefficients require different values for accurate prediction of the pressure traces during flame propagation, emphasizes the complexity of the combustion process, as well as the limitations of considering flames as laminar even at local scale. The study also identified the scale at which mass transfer takes place as an essential factor for correct turbulent combustion modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The understanding of ash sintering during combustion of agricultural residues is far from complete, because of the high heterogeneity of the content and composition of ash forming matters and the complex transformation of them. In order to make agricultural residues competitive fuels on the energy market, further research efforts are needed to investigate agricultural residues' ash sintering behavior and propose relevant anti-sintering measures. The aim of this work was to investigate the ash characteristics of rye straw and effects of additives. Three additives were studied regarding their abilities to prevent and abate rye straw ash sintering. Standard ash fusion characterization and laboratory-scale sintering tests were performed on ashes from mixtures of rye straw and additives produced at 550 degrees C. Ash residues from sintering tests at higher temperatures were analyzed using a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX). High sintering and melting tendency of the rye straw ash at elevated temperatures was observed. Severe sintering of the rye straw ash was attributed to the formation and fusion of low temperature K-silicates and K-phosphates with high K/Ca ratios. Among the three additives, calcite served the best one to mitigate sintering of the rye straw ash. Ca from the calcite promoted formation of high temperature silicates and calcium rich K-phosphates. In addition, calcite may hinder aggregating of ash melts and further formation of large ash slag. Therefore, the chemical reactions and physical restraining effects arose by calcite addition contributed to reduction of ash melts and sintering degree. Upon addition of kaolin, compositions of rye straw ash shifted from low temperature melting K-silicates to high temperature melting K-Al-silicates. The changes of ash chemistry were favorable for reducing sintering of the rye straw ash. As the Ca-sludge was added, reduction of sintering of the rye straw ash was less pronounced. Only K4CaSi3O9 and a small amount of KCaPO4 were identified in the rye straw ash as Ca-sludge was added. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In order to maximize the capacity/energy utilization and guarantee safe and reliable operation of battery packs used in electric vehicles, an accurate cell state-of-charge (SoC) estimator is an essential part. This paper tries to add three contributions to the existing literature. (1) An integrated battery system identification method for model order determination and parameter identification is proposed. In addition to being able to identify the model parameters, it can also locate an optimal balance between model complexity and prediction precision. (2) A radial basis function (RBF) neural network based uncertainty quantification algorithm has been proposed for constructing response surface approximate model (RSAM) of model bias function. Based on the RSAM, the average pack model can be applied to every single cell in battery pack and realize accurate terminal voltage prediction. (3) A systematic SoC estimation framework for multi-cell series-connected battery pack of electric vehicles using bias correction technique has been proposed. Finally, three cases with twelve lithium-ion polymer battery (LiPB) cells series-connected battery pack are used to verify and evaluate the proposed framework. The result indicates that with the proposed systematic estimation framework the maximum absolute SoC estimation error of all cells in the battery pack are less than 2%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Over the recent decades, China's building energy consumption has been growing rapidly. Also the fuel mix has been changing quickly with more natural gas 81 electricity and less coal being used. Meanwhile, the technologies used in building sector are improving in efficiency. In this paper, the impact of technical progress and the use of renewable energy in building sector are analyzed. The energy saving and emission reduction potential of building sector are also measured. China TIMES model is used to model the future energy consumption and carbon emissions in building sector. The modelling results indicate that building energy consumption is expected to grow to around 41.6EJ in the reference scenario in 2050. The energy saving potential in 2050 can be up to 4EJ due to the improvement of both building insulation (envelop) and energy use technologies. Renewable energy used in buildings can be a great contributor to the carbon mitigation in buildings. China's building sector can reach a relatively low-carbon future with more low- and non-carbon fuels consumed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The calcium-based sorbents are considered to be promising candidates for capturing CO2 from fossil fuel power plants and how to improve the CO2 capture and sintering-resistant performance of the sorbents during the cycling is a challenge for researchers. To improve the CO2 capture capacity and sintering resistant of the sorbents, CaO sorbents were synthesized by the sol-gel process with different precursors. Test matrices considering the important factors, such as dopant, doping amount, HNO3 addition and water addition in solvent were designed to investigate effects of synthesis conditions on reactivity of sorbents and to obtain an appropriate process for synthesizing sorbents for CO2 capture. The structural properties of the resulting sorbents were characterized by N-2 physisorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, showing that the sorbents prepared by the sal-gel process possessed wonderful microstructure as well as uniform distribution of CaO and MgO, MnO2 and TiO2. These features result in excellent reactivity enhancement and strong sintering resistant of sorbents compared with pure CaO, which give rise to high carbonation conversion, especially for CaO sorbents doped with MgO and MnO2, of 0.79 and 0.76 after 50 cycles under severe calcination condition, respectively. It demonstrates the excellent performance of sorbents synthesized by the sol-gel process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hydrogen plays a vital role in the future energy system, especially for spacecraft and fuel cell vehicle. In order to avoid the venting during the liquid hydrogen storage and decrease energy loss in space application, this paper presents a numerical study of the thermal performance of a hydrogen storage tank with nozzle injection and its improvement - a guide tube. Compared with the previous storage tank without guide tube, the chilling performance of the new storage system is enhanced since the guide tube improves the heat transfer and reduces the stagnant region to meliorate the flow circulation. Distribution profiles of temperature and velocity in the storage tank have been attained to evaluate the chilling performance. The key geometric parameters are further optimized by analyzing a series of cases under different geometry settings, from which the optimized ranges of dimensionless parameters have been obtained and studied respectively. This research provides guidelines for geometrical optimization of the liquid hydrogen cryogenic storage tank, and it helps to improve the chilling performance of the storage tank and promote the utilization of hydrogen energy.

Abstract: Since China has put forward a series of obligatory Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, provincial governments have issued provincial-level "Twelfth Five-Year" carbon intensity (CO2 emissions/GDP) reduction targets. There are 653 cities distributed throughout the eastern, middle and western parts of China, and each region has different quotas and paths to reduce GHG emissions, while the western part has greater challenges than the others. This paper predicts CO2 emission reduction potential of Chongqing, assesses the difficulty of achieving its CO2 emission reduction targets, and analyses its low-carbon transition path. The results show that the carbon intensity of Chongqing in 2020 will range from 1.58 to 1.75 ton CO2/10(4) RMB, and there exist some scenarios with strong potential to meet carbon intensity reduction targets for 2020. Improved technology, energy efficiency, the optimization of energy input mix, and the adjustment of industrial structure are suggested to be major strategies to reach Chongqing's carbon intensity targets.

Abstract: The recent advances in miniaturized mechanical devices open exciting new opportunities for combustion, especially in the field of micro power generation, allowing the development of power-supply devices with high specific energy. The development of a device based on a catalytic combustor coupled with thermoelectric modules is particularly appealing for combustion stability and safety. Furthermore, when implemented in micro/meso scale devices, catalytic combustion allows full utilization of hydrocarbon fuel's high energy densities, but at notably lower operating temperatures than those typical of traditional combustion. These conditions are more suitable for coupling with conventional thermoelectric modules since they prevent the modules' degradation.
In this work a novel catalytic meso-scale combustor fueled with propane/air mixture has been coupled with two conventional thermoelectric modules. The wafer-like combustor is filled with commercially available catalytic pellets of alumina with Platinum (1% weight). Temperature measurements, in terms of point values and 2D distribution across the combustor surfaces, were carried out in different operating conditions. Exhaust gases concentration measurements and pellet aging investigation were performed to determine the combustor efficiency and stability. Starting from these results the combustor has been coupled to bismuth telluride-based thermoelectric modules using a water cooled heat exchanger at the cold side. The system obtained produces 9.86 W of electrical power reaching an overall efficiency up to 2.85%: these results represent an improvement in portable-scale electrical power production from hydrocarbon fuels state-of-art. Moreover, the voltage and current characteristics allow using such generator for small portable devices power supplying. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A new method for assessing the grid interaction of a building's electricity consumption and generation is presented. It consists of the Grid Support Coefficients GSC(abs) and GSC(rei). GSC(abs) "weights" the electricity consumption profile with a time-resolved reference quantity which expresses the availability of electricity in the public grid (here: stock electricity price, residual load, cumulative energy consumption or fraction of wind and PV in the electricity mix). GSC(rel) relates GSC(abs) to the worst and best achievable values on a scale of -100 to 100 in order to increase the comparability of the results.
The new evaluation method is applied to analyze the electricity consumption and/or production of 52 different energy supply systems in buildings, where detailed monitoring data are available. These examples include twelve heat pumps or chillers in office buildings, 38 heat pumps in residential buildings and two combined heat and power units (CHP) in multi-family buildings, all located in Germany. The in-depth analysis shows that the analyzed present-day buildings predominantly consume electricity at times with a low or average electricity availability. Optimal scheduling of all heat pumps could flatten the residual load significantly. In order to achieve this, thermal storages several times larger than the ones currently installed would be required. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Sustainable consumption plays an important role in the mitigation of global warming and the conservation of energy. Promoting more environmentally responsible consumer behavior, especially through open communication between stakeholders, is one way to achieve low-carbon consumption. This study evaluates the potential for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through behavioral transformation of consumers in terms of their daily shopping habits. In this context, the behavioral transformative actions pertain to certain foods and daily necessities, and are analyzed from a life cycle assessment perspective. We developed multiple product-selection scenarios to evaluate GHG emissions related to the daily purchase of commodities. Based on the life cycle assessment, we estimated the GHG emissions that result from the production and distribution of these commodities, pertaining to both the current product selection and to a possibly improved selection. The results of our study show that because of seasonal consumption patterns and energy conversion, there is a substantial potential to reduce GHG emissions resulting from out-of-season produce cultivation. The GHG reduction potential is not high for each individual commodity because diverse commodities are needed on a daily basis. However, various actions in combination could have substantial potential for reducing emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High temperature heat transfer and energy storage performances of methane reforming with carbon dioxide in tubular packed reactor are investigated under different operating conditions. Experimental results show that the methane reforming in tubular packed reactor can efficiently store high temperature thermal energy, and the sensible heat and heat loss besides thermochemical energy storage play important role in the total energy storage process. When the operating temperature is increased, the thermochemical storage efficiency first increases for methane conversion rising and then decreases for heat loss rising. As the operating temperate is 800 degrees C, the methane conversion is 79.6%, and the thermochemical storage efficiency and total energy efficiency can be higher than 47% and 70%. According to the experimental system, the flow and reaction model of methane reforming is established using the laminar finite-rate model and Arrhenius expression, and the simulated methane conversion and energy storage efficiency fit with experimental data. Along the flow direction, the fluid temperature in the catalyst bed first decreases because of the endothermic reaction and then increases for the heat transfer from reactor wall. As a conclusion, the maximum thermochemical storage efficiency will be obtained under optimal operating temperature and optimal flow rate, and the total energy efficiency can be increased by the increase of bed conductivity and decrease of heat loss coefficient.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has been recognized as a primary means to increase the competitiveness of the industrial sector, and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in which energy efficiency measures (EEMs) are scarcely implemented. For this reason, future policies should carefully address such issue. Hence, it is really crucial to have a precise and punctual knowledge of the barriers to be tackled in the decision-making process of adopting an EEM and the drivers to be promoted. This study discussed the findings from a broad investigation within 222 manufacturing SMEs located in a Northern Italy region. Beside economic issues particularly affecting SMEs, awareness and behavioural issues emerge as critical, affecting the very first steps of the decision-making process, related to the punctual identification and evaluation of plausible EEMs. The support from manufacturers, technology suppliers, installers and ESCOs supporting SMEs through vocational training drivers (e.g. technical support) is really important to tackle such issues. More generally, beside financial institutions, the supply chain of technologies is recognized as particularly useful for supporting enterprises in the adoption of EEMs. Additionally, having previously conducted energy audit and implemented EEMs are critical factors able to highlight non-economic barriers and drivers. Therefore, the promotion of EEMs will necessarily imply a further effort in pointing out the so-called non-energy benefits (NEBs) from the implementation of EEMs. Finally, our study reveals that smaller and non-energy intensive emerge as most critical and therefore deserve greater attention from policy-makers.

Abstract: In the last decades, increasing attention has been paid to the enhancement of energy performance and comfort conditions of historic buildings, where the necessity to preserve architectural heritage does not allow typical invasive retrofit interventions. The need for a replicable methodology for improving the sustainability of historic buildings based on the integration of energy efficiency solutions with renewable technologies is here addressed, by riding over the constraints imposed by architectural preservations, rather taking advantage of heritage architectural peculiarities. The case study is represented by Palazzo Gallenga Stuart, a historical university building located in central Italy. The optimization of the building energy efficiency has been pursued through two strategies specifically prototyped for application in historic buildings, i.e. innovative cool tiles with the same appearance of traditional historic tiles, and a geothermal heat pump system with water storage tanks positioned in the under-ground unoccupied areas of the building previously used as archives, also preventing the use of external units spoiling the building facade. Four retrofit scenarios were analyzed and compared from a both technical and economical point of view. The results showed that the application of the innovative cool tiles lead to a maximum cooling energy saving of 14.0% and 3.8% in the classrooms of the top floor and in the whole building, respectively. Furthermore, the installation of a more effective energy plant leads to an average energy saving of 64.3% and 67.0% in terms of heating and cooling demand, respectively. The combination of the two effects leads to an average energy saving of 64.0% for heating and 69.2% for cooling. Additionally, the cost-benefit analysis showed a payback time of 5 years. This work shows the important environmental benefit achievable by researching around smart and innovative integrated systems for energy saving in historic buildings having a great potential in reducing energy demand and carbon emissions, in ancient European countries in particular.

Abstract: In this work, a combination of a latent heat thermal storage unit and a refrigeration system is presented as an air conditioning system. Overall system, including charging and discharging processes is analyzed for different phase change materials (PCMs) from exergoeconomic and environmental points of view. Based on comfort condition, three cases are selected with different size of PCM slabs and different PCMs: RT27, S27 and SP25. When the charging process takes place during the whole of off-peak hours the following results are obtained: (1) the system using SP25 has the highest value of the coefficient of performance; (2) the system using RT27 has the highest value of exergy efficiency and (3) the system using S27 has the lowest value of total cost rate. Finally, in order to obtain the best balance between the exergy destruction cost rate and the capital cost rate, the exergoeconomic factor is defined for each component, for different cases when system operates in the best performance conditions.

Abstract: This study explores the causes of changes in energy intensity and energy use in Latvia by applying logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition and mean-rate-of-exchange index analysis for energy sectors. Analysis on the latest data (2008-2012) reveals if any technological or structural changes have occurred during and after economic downturn in Latvia. The study explored effect of economic activity on final energy use. The results show that the reduction in energy intensity before the year 2008 can be largely attributed to decline in energy intensities within sectors, but the increase in energy intensity after the year 2008 is regarded to expansion of energy demanding sectors.

Abstract: CO2 capture and storage could efficiently mitigate CO2 emissions, wherein CO2 capture is a crucial energy-intensive process. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as potential liquid absorbents for CO2 separation. The CO2 absorption capacity and selectivity of ILs have also been investigated extensively. Although ILs have been screened for CO2 separation, only specific ILs have been examined in terms of energy consumption. In this study, 76 conventional ILs were collected and screened in terms of energy consumption to establish potential ILs for CO2 separation. Seventeen ILs were screened according to the CO2 dissolution enthalpy and CO2 working capacity criteria obtained from the Henry's law constant in the preliminary screening. Seven ILs were then screened from the 17 ILs according to the CO2 working capacity from the measured CO2 solubility in the final screening. The energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs (i.e., [Emim][NTf2], [Bmim][BF4], [Bmim][PF6], [Bmim][NTf2], [Bmim][NTf2], [Bmpy][NTf2], and [Hmpy][NTf2]) were calculated, and the corresponding gas solubility selectivities were discussed. The energy consumptions and properties of the seven screened ILs were compared with those of the commercial CO2 absorbents of 30 wt% MEA, 30 wt% MDEA, and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol (Selexol (TM) or Coastal AGR (R)). The results showed that the energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs were lower than those of the commercial CO2 absorbents. [Hmpy][NTf2] showed the lowest energy consumption among the seven screened ILs under the operating conditions set in this study. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The substantial increase in deployment of customer-sited solar photovoltaics (PV) in the United States has been driven by a combination of steeply declining costs, financing innovations, and supportive policies. Among those supportive policies is net metering, which in most states effectively allows customers to receive compensation for distributed PV generation at the full retail electricity price. The current design of retail electricity rates and the presence of net metering have elicited concerns that the possible under-recovery of fixed utility costs from PV system owners may lead to a feedback loop of increasing retail prices that accelerate PV adoption and further rate increases. However, a separate and opposing feedback loop could offset this effect: increased PV deployment may lead to a shift in the timing of peak-period electricity prices that could reduce the bill savings received under net metering where time-varying retail electricity rates are used, thereby dampening further PV adoption. In this paper, we examine the impacts of these two competing feedback dynamics on U.S. distributed PV deployment through 2050 for both residential and commercial customers, across states. Our results indicate that, at the aggregate national level, the two feedback effects nearly offset one another and therefore produce a modest net effect, although their magnitude and direction vary by customer segment and by state. We also model aggregate PV deployment trends under various rate designs and net-metering rules, accounting for feedback dynamics. Our results demonstrate that future adoption of distributed PV is highly sensitive to retail rate structures. Whereas flat, time-invariant rates with net metering lead to higher aggregate national deployment levels than the current mix of rate structures (+5% in 2050), rate structures with higher monthly fixed customer charges or PV compensation at levels lower than the full retail rate can dramatically erode aggregate customer adoption of PV (from -14% to -61%, depending on the design). Moving towards time-varying rates, on the other hand, accelerates near- and medium-term deployment (through 2030) but slows adoption in the longer term (-22% in 2050). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Oxy-fuel combustion of pulverized fuels (PF), as a promising technology for CO2 capture from power plants, has gained a lot of concerns and also advanced considerable research, development and demonstration in the past years worldwide. The use of CO2 or the mixture of CO2 and H2O vapor as the diluent in oxy-fuel combustion, instead of N-2 in conventional air-fuel combustion, induces significant changes to the combustion fundamentals, because of the great differences in the physical properties and chemical effects of the different diluents. Therefore, some fundamental issues and technological challenges need to be properly addressed to develop oxy-fuel combustion into an enabled technology. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, which has been proven to be a very useful and cost-effective tool in research and development of conventional air-fuel combustion, is expected to play a similarly vital role in future development of oxy-fuel combustion technology. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review and an in-depth discussion of PF oxy-fuel combustion fundamentals and their modeling, which underpin the development of this promising technology. The focus is placed on the key issues in combustion physics (e.g., turbulent gas-solid flow, heat and mass transfer) and combustion chemistry (e.g., pyrolysis, gas phase combustion and char reactions), mainly on how they are affected in oxy-fuel conditions and how they are modeled and implemented into CFD simulations. The system performance of PF oxy-fuel combustion is also reviewed. Finally, the current status of PF oxy-fuel combustion fundamentals and modeling is concluded and the research needs in these regards are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Solar thermal and heat pump combisystems are used to produce domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH) in dwellings. Many systems are available on the market. For an impartial comparison, a definite level of thermal comfort should be defined and ensured in all systems. This work studied the influence of component size on electricity demand for a state of the art solar thermal and heat pump system. A systematic series of parametric studies was carried out by using TRNSYS to show the impact of climate, load and size of main components as well as heat source for the heat pump. Penalty functions were used to ensure that all variations provided the same comfort requirements. Two reference systems were defined and modelled based on products on the market, one with ambient air and the other with borehole as heat source for the heat pump. The results show that changes in collector area from 5 to 15 m(2) result in a decrease in system electricity of between 305 and 552 kW h/year. Changes in heat exchanger size for DHW preparation were shown to give nearly as large changes in electricity use due to the fact that the set temperature in the store was changed to give the same thermal comfort in all cases. Decrease in heat pump size was shown to give a decrease in electricity use for the ASHP in the building with larger heat demand while it increased or had only a small change for other boundary conditions. Heat pump losses were shown to be an important factor highlighting the importance of modelling this factor explicitly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work focuses on the design of latent heat storage unit for direct steam generation power plants. In this paper a simple model for the design of a storage unit is presented. This model includes phase change of water/steam and the sensible heat stored in phase change material. The effectiveness of the storage is considered as the design criterion in this model and the influence of various design parameters on the effectiveness is explained. Results show that:
Length of storage has a major impact on the effectiveness.
Flow rate of heat transfer fluid is important.
Diameter of the tubes has an impact on the effectiveness.
Distance between tubes does not have significant effect on effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Because of their easy and widespread distribution and safe handling, liquid fuels are used in everyday life, to power vehicles, aircrafts, ships, etc. The use of fuels from conventional fossil sources is now called for a more sustainable alternative. Hence, chemical energy storage of electricity generated by renewable sources into synthetic fuels represents an interesting solution, solving also other typical problems with renewables, such as grid stabilization.
Within this framework, the present study deals with the production of synthetic green fuels by means of the Fischer-Tropsch process, downstream a previous electricity-to-gas conversion achieved operating a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOE) stack in co-electrolysis. With reference to the state of the art, this study developed the concept of integrating an SUE and a Fischer-Tropsch process in a small plant size, which is compatible with renewables power density. To this aim, fuel upgrading is supposed to be performed separately.
Based on experimental results on a Solid Oxide Cells stack operated in co-electrolysis, three systemlevel models were developed, evaluating the most performing option. Thus, considering a plant capacity of 1 bbl/day of liquid fuel, in the best scheme, the electricity-to-liquid efficiency was estimated to be 57.2%. Materials introduced into the system are simply water (33,701 ton/MJ) and carbon dioxide (79,795 ton/MJ). While hydrogen is necessary to feed the SOE, net consumption is zero because it is recovered from Fischer-Tropsch product lighter fraction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper is aimed to present an experimental criterion that allows researchers and designers to evaluate the performance of DC micro-grids dedicated to charging operations of full EV. The laboratory methodology is explained through tests on a demonstrator of power architecture, specifically designed as simplified case study of a DC charging station for fully-electrified low-power two-wheeler, such as: electric scooters and bikes. This experimental prototype is composed by a 20 kW AC/DC bidirectional grid-tied converter, which realizes the DC conversion stage, and two DC/DC power converters, interconnected with the micro-grid through a DC bus. The power architecture provides on one hand the charging operations of electric two-wheeler battery packs and on the other hand the integration of the micro-grid with an ES buffer, which has the main function of supporting the main grid while an electric vehicle is on charge. The performance of the considered architecture is characterized and analyzed in different operative conditions, through a specific management of the energy fluxes. The laboratory tests evaluate efficiency, charging times and impact on the main grid, with specific reference to the DC charging operations of electric scooters. The obtained experimental results show the advantages of adopting the DC buffer architecture, compared with an AC commercial battery charger, considered as reference in this work. Finally, the numerical data of this paper, related to the single power components and to the experimental results evaluated for the whole demonstrator, effectively support the lack of knowledge in the literature about charging stations for EVs. In fact, these pieces of information, based on experimental tests, are expected to support the building of simulation models and the identification of the best energy management and control strategies to be adopted in a smart-grid scenario, characterized by distributed generation systems including renewable energy sources.

Abstract: Replacement and upgrading of assets in the electricity network requires financial investment for the distribution and transmission utilities. The replacement and upgrading of network assets also represents an emissions impact due to the carbon embodied in the materials used to manufacture network assets. This paper uses investment and asset data for the GB system for 2015-2023 to assess the suitability of using a proxy with peak demand data and network investment data to calculate the carbon impacts of network investments. The proxies are calculated on a regional basis and applied to calculate the embodied carbon associated with current network assets by DNO region. The proxies are also applied to peak demand data across the 2015-2023 period to estimate the expected levels of embodied carbon that will be associated with network investment during this period. The suitability of these proxies in different contexts are then discussed, along with initial scenario analysis to calculate the impact of avoiding or deferring network investments through distributed generation projects.

Abstract: This paper presents a linearization of the dynamic equation for a free-piston engine generator (FPEG), and simplifies it to a one-degree forced vibration system with viscous damping. The analogy between a massspring damper and a FPEG system is expressed, and the solution to the vibration system is solved. The model was successfully validated with respect to experimental data obtained from a prototype. The simulated piston displacement during steady operation showed similar trends with the test results and the error of the displacement amplitude was controlled within 3%. The state-space equations and the transfer function of the system are obtain using the fast response numerical model. An example of model application in the real FEPG control system was provided. Compared to the previous numerical model with differential approaches, the solving time of the proposed fast response model can be significantly reduced. The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed model make it feasible to be implemented to several computing software, i.e. Matlab, AMESim, Labview, Dymola et al. It can be easily implemented to real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation model for the future piston dynamic control system development. In addition, since it reveals how an FPEG operates in a resonant principle, the model is useful for parameter selection in the FPEG design process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The key feature of Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) is the reuse of the heat generated from the air compression process at the stage of air expansion. This increases the complexity of the whole system since the heat exchange and thermal storage units must have the capacities and performance to match the air compression/expansion units. Thus it raises a strong demand in the whole system modelling and simulation tool for A-CAES system optimisation. The paper presents a new whole system mathematical model for A-CAES with simulation implementation and the model is developed with consideration of lowing capital cost of the system. The paper then focuses on the study of system efficiency improvement strategies via parametric analysis and system structure optimisation. The paper investigates how the system efficiency is affected by the system component performance and parameters. From the study, the key parameters are identified, which give dominant influences in improving the system efficiency. The study is extended onto optimal system configuration and the recommendations are made for achieving higher efficiency, which provides a useful guidance for A-CAES system design.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic technique to select the optimal design target for the heat exchanger network (HEN) synthesis by using a new trade-off plot which considers aspects of design, controllability in terms of steady state flexibility and sensitivity analysis, and cost. By selecting the HEN design target according to this guideline, the designer is able to predict the design, operability, and controllability of the designed HEN at the beginning of the synthesis stage. In this study, the HEN design target that needs to be optimized is the value of the minimum temperature difference (Delta T-min). In traditional HEN synthesis, designers only consider the trade-off between capital and operating costs in selecting the best Delta T-min. As a result, the HEN design at the selected Delta T-min may not be optimum in terms of steady state controllability. In addition to considering the capital and operating costs, the proposed new method provides additional design insights in terms of energy recovery, operability, controllability (steady state) through the flexibility and sensitivity. The proposed trade-off plot allows designers to choose the most suitable design target either for the purpose of improving a network's energy recovery and/or controllability. A case study has been applied to test the capability of the new proposed trade-off plot. The results show that Delta T-min = 40 degrees C is the optimal design target to synthesize flexible and operable HEN. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An assessment of residential CO2 emissions is typically performed through the intensity method, in which total energy consumption is estimated by multiplying floor space by intensity value. Although spatially detailed intensity data is required for an accurate estimation, the finer spatial resolution will result in a less stable estimated value due to the small sample size; hence, existing studies in Japan created intensity data at a regional or prefectural level. The objective of this study is to create municipality level intensity data via a statistical approach, using the household level micro data from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, by focusing on electricity. First, this study builds several (spatial) statistical models, where per household electricity expenditure is regressed on housing types (two categories), household types (seven categories), and other household specific variables. Second, by substituting averaged municipality level explanatory variables from official statistics into the model, it estimates municipality level intensity data. The obtained results suggest that conventional intensity data in Japan, created by the simple average of samples in each unit (prefecture), may suffer from an upward bias, suggesting a danger of overestimation of residential CO2 emissions.

Abstract: MgO/H2O/Mg(OH)(2) chemical heat storage of waste energy from industrial processes is a promising technology in view of a more efficient use and saving of primary energy sources. A new approach was used to develop a hybrid heat storage material made of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)) and exfoliated graphite (which is used to improve the heat transfer with its high thermal conductivity). Mg(OH)(2) nanoplatelets were directly grown on graphite surface via a deposition-precipitation method to increase the compatibility between the two materials. The material thus obtained, named DP-MG, was experimentally tested to determine its heat storage and output capacities. An improvement of the material efficiency was obtained with a higher storage capacity at lower reaction temperature and a higher heat output rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ever since energy sustainability is an emergent concern, Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) significantly affect the approaching smart grids. Indeed, Demand Response (DR) brings a positive effect on the uncertainties of renewable energy sources, improving market efficiency and enhancing system reliability. This paper proposes a multi-stage stochastic model of a PEV aggregation agent to participate in day-ahead and intraday electricity markets. The stochastic model reflects several uncertainties such as the behaviour of PEV owners, electricity market prices, and activated quantity of reserve by the system operator. For this purpose, appropriate scenarios are utilized to realize the uncertain feature of the problem. Furthermore, in the proposed model, the PEV aggregation agents can update their bids/offers by taking part in the intraday market. To this end, these aggregation agents take part in Demand Response exchange (DRX), markets designed in the intraday session by employing DR resources. The numerical results show that DR provides a perfect opportunity for PEV aggregation agents to increase the profit. In addition, the results reveal that the PEV aggregation agent not only can increase its profit by participating in the DRX market, but also can become an important player in the mentioned market.

Abstract: In this paper polyurethane-based phase change materials (PCMs) modified with graphene for thermal energy storage were obtained in situ using a one-step bulk polymerization method. Polyurethanes (PUs) have been synthesized with 1,4-butanediol as a chain extender or without a chain extender. FTIR-ATR, DSC, TGA, SEM, OM and ultrasonic techniques were used for characterization of the obtained composites containing up to 4 wt.% of graphene. FTIR-ATR analysis confirmed PU structure and proved that there was no chemical reaction between polyurethane and graphene. The highest heat of phase transition and crystallinity were found for PU system synthesized without the chain extender and modified with 1.0 wt.% of graphene. Microscopic observation results indicated spherulite structures typical for poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) which was used to form soft segments, with regions of lamellar crystal bundles radiating from the center of a spherulite. Thermal cycling tests were done by 50 and 100 heating/cooling cyclings in air and nitrogen atmosphere for verification of the thermal reliability and chemical stability it has been found the heat of phase transition was generally not diminished. Importantly, the thermal conductivity of the PCMs was improved after modification with graphene. Generally, PUPEG without chain extender exhibited higher heat of phase transition, higher thermal stability and better thermal reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Microgrids are an increasingly common component of the evolving electricity grids with the potential to improve local reliability, reduce costs, and increase penetration rates for distributed renewable generation. The additional complexity of microgrids often leads to increased investment costs, creating a barrier for widespread adoption. These costs may result directly from specific needs for islanding detection, protection systems and power quality assurance that would otherwise be avoided in simpler system configurations. However, microgrids also facilitate additional value streams that may make up for their increased costs and improve the economic viability of microgrid deployment. This paper analyses the literature currently available on research relevant to value streams occurring in microgrids that may contribute to offset the increased investment costs. A review on research related to specific microgrid requirements is also presented. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Driving cycles of a city bus is statistically characterized by some repetitive features, which makes the predictive energy management strategy very desirable to obtain approximate optimal fuel economy of a plug-in hybrid electric bus. But dealing with the complicated traffic conditions and finding an approximated global optimal strategy which is applicable to the plug-in hybrid electric bus still remains a challenging technique. To solve this problem, a novel driving-behavior-aware modified stochastic model predictive control method is proposed for the plug-in hybrid electric bus. Firstly, the K-means is employed to classify driving behaviors, and the driver models based on Markov chains is obtained under different kinds of driving behaviors. While the obtained driver behaviors are regarded as stochastic disturbance inputs, the local minimum fuel consumption might be obtained with a traditional stochastic model predictive control at each step, taking tracking the reference battery state of charge trajectory into consideration in the finite predictive horizons. However, this technique is still accompanied by some working points with reduced/worsened fuel economy. Thus, the stochastic model predictive control is modified with the equivalent consumption minimization strategy to eliminate these undesirable working points. The results in real-world city bus routines show that the proposed energy management strategy could greatly improve the fuel economy of a plug-in hybrid electric bus in whole driving cycles, compared with the popular charge depleting-charge sustaining strategy and it may offer some useful insights for realizing the approximate global optimal energy management for the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

Abstract: To limit the computational cost, bottom-up long-term (LT) energy-system planning models typically have a stylized temporal representation and do not consider techno-economic operational constraints of power plants. Both these simplifications have been shown to have a significant impact on the results. However, increasing the level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail will result in an increased computational cost. In this regard, the first goal of this work is to quantify which of these simplifications has the highest impact on the results, and should therefore be prioritized for improving. To do so, the impact of both the low level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail are quantified for a varying penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). For a high penetration of IRES, the gains obtained by improving the temporal representation are shown to outweigh the gains obtained by incorporating detailed techno-economic operational constraints. Therefore, improving the temporal representation is suggested to be prioritized. The second goal of this paper is to identify opportunities for model improvements. Different approaches to improve the temporal representation are proposed. While the focus in the literature lies primarily on the impact of the temporal resolution, this work more fundamentally considers and assesses different approaches of dealing with the temporal dimension. Using a different approach of defining the time slices to explicitly account for IRES variability is found to lead to a higher accuracy than can be obtained by simply increasing the temporal resolution, while requiring a lower number of time slices. Moreover, a temporal representation based on selecting a set of representative days can achieve an even higher accuracy, albeit requiring a higher number of time slices. An additional advantage of using representative days is that chronology is retained such that the impact of short-term dynamic fluctuations of IRES can be accounted for. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Reducing the energy consumption of distillation processes can lead to significant cost savings in refineries and the chemical process industry because distillation is a widely used and energy-intensive separation technology. A distillation column can be heat integrated with heat pumps to reduce the energy supplied by the utility, and it can also be integrated into the overall process to save energy for the overall process. However, previous studies have not adequately investigated the synergistic effect of integrating heat pump assisted distillation into overall processes. In this paper, a systematic design methodology is proposed for the simultaneous heat integration of distillation, its background process and heat pump systems. Such a holistic heat integration approach can lead to considerable energy savings for the overall process. The proposed methodology also includes systematic identification for the energy-optimum placement of the heat pump and its matching with process streams. Furthermore, the impacts of distillation process modifications on the holistic heat integration strategy are examined. A case study is presented to illustrate how the proposed design method is applied and to demonstrate its effectiveness in saving energy. For the case study, the hot and cold utilities are reduced by 61.5% and 20.6% compared to energy consumptions for the base case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The paper proposes a survey on three issues related to Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) policy. Firstly, what are the optimal SPR acquisition, drawdown and refilling policy in response to various market risks? Secondly, how SPR policy or actions will affect the market factors, i.e. oil demand or price. Thirdly, in what extend a disruption may induce price shock. For the purpose, the study proposed a Markov Decision Process model (SPR-MDP). In the model, oil supply, disruption size and duration are considered to be highly stochastic. Oil price is determined by market fundamentals exclusively. According to the empirical study, we come to some interesting conclusions. Firstly, oil price and disruption risk show different ways in influencing the desirable SPR size. It is found that the SPR size increases with the decrease of oil price while increase of disruption risk. Secondly, SPR acquisition may increase oil price slightly by influencing the basic fundamentals. In given case, we find acquisition of 7 million barrels per month increase the price by 2.6%. But the influence weakens with decrease of acquisition size. Thirdly, disruption duration shows significant impact on SPR drawdown policy. In a two-month disruption case, it is found that 51% of SPR should be released in the first month. Another 40% is released in the following month. The other 9% SPR is left for forthcoming disruptions. Meanwhile, SPR drawdown shows high efficient in damping oil price in the disruption. In given case, after drawdown of SPR, the oil prices only increases by 0.7% in the second month though continue disruption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A series of triaxial tests were conducted to investigate the mechanical behaviors of permafrost-associated methane hydrate-bearing sediments under different mining methods (depressurization/heating under exhaust/non-exhaust conditions, CH4-CO2 replacement). The results indicate that both depressurization and heating will decrease the stability of methane hydrate-bearing sediments containing ice which prepared by a mixture method, due to the loss of bearing capacity of methane hydrates and increasing pore pressure; the sediments dissociated under exhaust conditions present much higher failure strength and elastic modulus than those dissociated under non-exhaust conditions, which means that the instability of hydrate-bearing sediments containing ice is likely to be induced more easily in the low permeability regions in certain conditions; the sediments dissociated by depressurization are more stable than those dissociated by heating, due to the effect of ice re-formation under sub-zero conditions; and the failure strength and elastic modulus of methane hydrate-bearing sediments containing ice (mixture method) are slightly lower than that of the CO2 hydrate-bearing sediments containing ice (mixture method) under various conditions, which means that the layers may possibly keep stable when the methane hydrate is completely replaced by CO2 hydrate.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to analyze the role played by both foreign and indigenous innovation on energy intensity as well as the possible interactions between them across 30 Chinese regions. In addition, we consider different types of corporate ownership that operate in China. We control our estimates by energy price and the composition effect. We provide a complete picture of energy sector by examining all sources of energy. We use Beck and Katz estimator in order to take into account heterocedasticity and serial correlation over the period 2006-2010. Our results suggest that both foreign and domestic innovation efforts played a significant role in improving energy efficiency in China. However, the interaction between foreign and indigenous innovations is modest. We observe significant differences among investment ownership due to its geographical location. These findings have important policy implications for energy sector in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The spherical micro-cells are a semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) technology which can contribute to improve the sustainability of greenhouse systems. Previous prototypes were tested in laboratory conditions, but the size was not suitable for the greenhouse roof application. In this work, a new prototype has been developed and tested on a real greenhouse roof. The semi-transparent PV module (STM) was composed by 4800 spherical silicon micro-cells (1.2 mm diameter) sandwiched between glass plates and integrated on a greenhouse roof with 26.5 degrees slope. The STM was 910 mm long and 610 mm wide to match the size of the greenhouse framework. The percentage of the STM area covered with micro-cells was 2.3%, reaching 9.7% considering the metallic conductors. The cell density was 2 cells cm(-2) and the measured perpendicular light transmissivity of the semi-transparent area was 73%. The characteristics of the prototype were compared with those of a conventional planar multi-crystalline silicon module (CPM). The module conversion efficiency was steadily around 0.2% over wide incident sunlight angle. The micro-cells never completely eclipse the incident sunlight when observed from more than 1 m distance from the roof, keeping the eclipsing level at 9.7%. The yield factor of the STM was slightly higher than the CPM because of the isotropic properties of the spherical cells, which are able to use both the sky-incident and the ground-reflected irradiation for energy production, irrespective of the module slope. The prototype STM is promising for greenhouse roof applications and its performance can be improved by increasing the conversion efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Graphene/water nanofluids with and without surfactant carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) were prepared using ultrasonic vibration. Surfactant CMC caused the change in the zeta potential of graphene/water nanofluid from 3.9 mV to -53.1 my. The CIVIC-modified graphene/water nanofluid then froze with and without an external electromagnetic field and melted at room temperature. The particle size distributions and adsorption spectra of graphene/water nanofluid after a freeze/melt cycle at different current intensities were measured to evaluate the electromagnetic field effect on graphene rejection and engulfment by the advancing ice-water interface. Results show that (1) without an electromagnetic field, the absorbance of graphene/water nanofluid dramatically reduces, and a new peak of large particle size emerges after a freeze/melt cycle, thereby indicating that graphenes are partially rejected by the ice-water front and aggregate together; and (2) with an electromagnetic field, the adsorption spectra and the particle size distributions of graphene/water nanofluid do not significantly change after a freeze/melt cycle, thereby indicating that the graphenes are captured by the freezing interface and are uniformly distributed in the frozen body of graphene/water nanofluid. The electromagnetic field effect is closely related to the electric current intensity. Good thermal cycling stability can be achieved for graphene/water nanofluid in the current range of 0.07-0.12 A. Mechanisms associated with surfactant adsorption, electromagnetic field, and possible gas evolution are proposed in this study to account for the behavior of graphenes in front of the ice-water interface.

Abstract: This study presents a scale-up production method for Ti including Ca/Al sorbents and their CO2 sorption test under warm gas conditions by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and fixed-bed reactor experiments. The Ca/Al/Ti-x sorbents are made by the precipitation-and-deposition method where Ca2+ and Al3+ ions are deposited via an alkaline solution of OH-/CO32- on TiO2 powder. The titanium dioxide binder facilitates CO2 capture and enhances the CO2 capacity and multicycle stability by adjusting the Ti/Ca ratio. The results showed that these sorbents exhibited excellent CO2 capture stability of 96-98% after ten cycles at 750 degrees C by TG analysis. Characterization by XRD indicated that the reduction in the deterioration of the sorbent during the cycle test could possibly result from the formation of an anti-sintering compound such as CaTiO3 along with calcium aluminate hydroxides related to katoite. Using a reactor as test rig, the amount of sorbent and total capture weight was significantly increased. This TiO2-coated sample of Ca/Al/O-TiO2 provides a feasible route for the manufacture of cheap CO2 sorbents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper investigates reactions of mercury (Hg) compounds in effluents of the wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process during waste water treatment. Hence, a concept for the controlled desorption and immobilization of Hg is introduced. The aim is to create a highly concentrated sink for Hg for further processing. Experiments are carried out with a continuously operated lab-scale wet FGD system and a batch-wise operated alkalization reactor for the treatment of synthetic and real waste water samples. By aeration of the liquid phase, the controlled desorption of Hg during the alkalization step of the waste water treatment process is enabled. The Hg-rich exhaust air is directed to an activated carbon fixed bed adsorber. It is demonstrated, that Hg is emitted in its elemental form (Hg-0). Thus, a chemical reduction of dissolved Hg2+ compounds takes place prior to Hg-0 desorption to the gas phase. Mechanisms for the reactions are proposed, identifying SO32- and OH- as electron donors. Linear dependency of Hg-0 formation on SO32- and OH- concentration indicate first order dependencies of reaction kinetics. Decreasing concentration of Hg-0 in the exhaust air for increasing Cl- concentration is observed. The results show exponential dependence of Hg-0 desorption on temperature and stirring speed. The mass flow of desorbed Hg-0 remains constant for variation in aeration flow rate. Thus, the application of low air flux is beneficial in terms of energy demand and for the purpose of creating a highly concentrated sink for Hg in the process. The concentration decrease of Hg2+ in the waste water is proportional to the savings in terms of precipitating agent consumption of further processing steps. Finally, the concept developed prevents unnoticed Hg desorption during waste water treatment and increases sustainability and plant safety. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Multi-zone structure is common in commercial office buildings, retail stores and supermarkets. Because there is no physical partition between zones, there could exist significant thermal impact among the adjacent zones than in other commercial buildings. It is critical to accurately analyze the energy interaction and reduce the modeling uncertainty for supporting advanced control. We propose a virtual partition surface temperature sensor for quantifying the variables and solve this challenge by using linear parametric models. The derived models based on physical law can be used as a guideline on selecting appropriate orders in mainly ARMAX (autoregressive moving average with exogenous variables) and/or ARX for improving the sensor's performance. Validation of the virtual temperature models is conducted by three validation criteria: goodness of fit (G), mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) under off-control conditions. The validation results show that the physical model based linear parametric model, ARX 211, performs well and similar to other system identification models, such as ARMAX 2111 and ARX 221, for estimating surface temperatures. The sensitivity analysis using three on-control conditions (under-sizing, proper-sizing and over-sizing condition) is conducted for analyzing and evaluating the performance and barriers of this virtual sensor. The proposed easy-to-implement model can be applied to support supervisory control of equipment in multi-zone buildings and other applications to supplement the measurements, like estimating the temperature of a structure integrated cooling or heating application in renewable energy areas.

Abstract: Different control techniques together with intelligent building technology (Building Automation Systems) are used to improve energy efficiency of buildings. In almost all control projects, it is crucial to have building energy models with high computational efficiency in order to design and tune the controllers and simulate their performance. In this paper, a set of partial differential equations are formulated accounting for energy flow within the building space. These equations are then solved as conventional finite difference equations using Crank-Nicholson scheme. Such a model of a higher order is regarded as a benchmark model. An optimization algorithm has been developed, depicted through a flowchart, which minimizes the sum squared error between the step responses of the numerical and the optimal model. Optimal model of the construction element is nothing but a RC-network model with the values of Rs and Cs estimated using the non-linear time invariant constrained optimization routine. The model is validated with comparing the step responses with other two RC-network models whose parameter values are selected based on a certain criteria. Validations are showed for different types of building construction elements viz., low, medium and heavy thermal capacity elements. Simulation results show that the optimal model closely follow the step responses of the numerical model as compared to the responses of other two models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper shows the performance curves obtained with an experimental campaign on the following different prime movers: a 100 kW microturbine, a 20 kW internal combustion engine, a 450 kW SOFC-based hybrid system and a 100 kW absorption chiller. While the size related to the microturbine and the engine are actual electrical power values, the hybrid system size is an electrical virtual power (an emulator rig was used for this plant) and the chiller value is a cooling thermal power. These experimental results were obtained with a smart polygeneration facility installed in the Innovative Energy Systems Laboratory by the Thermochemical Power Group of the University of Genoa. This facility was designed to perform tests on smart grids equipped with different generation technologies to develop and improve innovative control and optimization tools. The performance curves were obtained with two different approaches: tests on real prime movers (for the microturbine, the engine and the chiller) or measurements on an emulator rig (for the hybrid system). In this second case, the tests were carried out using an experimental facility based on the coupling of a second microturbine with a modular vessel. A real-time simulation software was used for components not physically present in the experimental plant. These results are a significant improvement in comparison with the available data, because experimental results are presented for different prime movers in different operative conditions (both design and part-load operations). Moreover, since both manufacturers and users are not usually able to control air inlet temperature, special attention was devoted to the ambient temperature impact on the 100 kW microturbine because this property has a strong influence on the performance of this machine. For this reason, empirical correlations on the ambient temperature effect were obtained from the experiments with the objective to perform an easy implementation of the optimization tools. Experimental performance curves (including several off-design conditions) are essential for smart grid management because (if they are implemented in optimization tools) they allow to find real optimal solutions (while tools based on linear or calculated correlations can obtain results affected by significant errors).

Abstract: Gas separation processes, including post-combustion carbon capture (PCCC) by chemical absorption using liquid solvents can be substantially enhanced using high performance micro-structured surfaces to enhance the surface area available for reaction. The present paper studies the hydrodynamics and mass transfer performance of gas-liquid absorption of CO2 into aqueous diethanolamine in a micro-structured reactor. The system was designed to comprise 15 straight parallel channels in a cross flow inlet configuration. The hydraulic diameter of each channel was 456 gm. The performance of the reactor was studied with respect to the absorption efficiency, mass transfer coefficient, acid gas loading ratio, and pressure drop. A flow pattern map was developed using available regime transition criteria. Parametric studies varying the gas and liquid flow rates, as well as their respective concentrations at the reactor inlet, were conducted. The two-phase pressure drop was compared against the predictions of a piecewise model and a reasonably good agreement was obtained. Absorption efficiencies close to 100% were observed under certain operating conditions. The presently achieved values of liquid-side volumetric mass transfer coefficients were between 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than those reported for most conventional gas-liquid absorption systems, which can be attributed to the inherent high specific interfacial area provided through micro-structured surfaces. The results reported here indicate the substantial levels of process intensification that can be achieved using microreactors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Investigation to evaluate axial wall heat conduction has been conducted for heat transfer in a laminar flow circular tube with two classical thermal boundary conditions at the outside wall. The tube ends are either adiabatic or with heat losses. The simulation is three-dimensional with various wall materials, wall thicknesses and tube lengths. A wide range of Peclet number from 7 to 14,000 is considered. Three evaluation criterion parameters including the axial conduction number, the modified axial conduction number, and the temperature gradient number are comprehensively studied to quantify the influence of axial wall heat conduction. Under the constant outside wall temperature boundary condition, the temperature gradient number is presented to assess the relevance of the axial wall heat conduction. The approximate range of the effect of axial wall heat conduction on the local Nusselt number for the fully developed flow is also obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The Calcium Looping (CaL) technology, based on the multicyclic carbonation/calcination of CaO in gas-solid fluidized bed reactors at high temperature, has emerged in the last years as a potentially low cost technology for CO2 capture. In this manuscript a critical review is made on the important roles of energy integration and sorbent behavior in the process efficiency. Firstly, the strategies proposed to reduce the energy demand by internal integration are discussed as well as process modifications aimed at optimizing the overall efficiency by means of external integration. The most important benefit of the high temperature CaL cycles is the possibility of using high temperature streams that could reduce significantly the energy penalty associated to CO2 capture. The application of the CaL technology in precombustion capture systems and energy integration, and the coupling of the CaL technology with other industrial processes are also described. In particular, the CaL technology has a significant potential to be a feasible CO2 capture system for cement plants. A precise knowledge of the multicyclic CO2 capture behavior of the sorbent at the CaL conditions to be expected in practice is of great relevance in order to predict a realistic capture efficiency and energy penalty from process simulations. The second part of this manuscript will be devoted to this issue. Particular emphasis is put on the behavior of natural limestone and dolomite, which would be the only practical choices for the technology to meet its main goal of reducing CO2 capture costs. Under CaL calcination conditions for CO2 capture (necessarily implying high CO2 concentration in the calciner), dolomite seems to be a better alternative to limestone as CaO precursor. The proposed techniques of recarbonation and thermal/mechanical pretreatments to reactivate the sorbent and accelerate calcination will be the final subjects of this review. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The main objective of the study was to investigate the temporal features of the wind speed in complex mountainous terrains that are important for the assessment and development of wind energy. Six high-frequency records of 10-min averages of wind speed measured in Switzerland are investigated in order to better characterize their inner time dynamics. All the wind speed time series are modulated by components periods of 1 day and 12 h, linked with the temperature and pressure daily variation due to the sunset and sunrise. Furthermore the time dynamics of the wind speed is characterized by the presence of two different timescale ranges, separated by a crossover at about 7 days: persistent and multifractal at larger timescales and antipersistent and monofractal (or weakly multifractal) at smaller ones. The-found features do not seem to depend on the altitude, because all the wind speed series share the same dynamical characteristics. The results of this comprehensive study can be utilized to better understand the mechanisms governing the time dynamics of wind speed and to perform a better wind energy assessment and management.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal control model to improve the operation energy efficiency of a vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushing process. The optimal control model takes the energy cost as the performance index to be minimized by accounting for the time-of-use tariff and process constraints such as storage capacity of the VSI crusher hopper, capacity of the main storage system, flow rate limits, cascade ratio setting, production requirement and product quality requirement. The control variables in the developed model are the belt conveyor feed rate, the material feed rate into the VSI crusher rotor, the bi-flow or cascade feed rate and the rotor tip speed of the crusher. These four control variables are optimally coordinated in order to improve the operation energy efficiency of the VSI crushing process. Simulation results based on a crushing process in a coal-fired power plant demonstrate a potential of a daily energy cost saving of about 49.7% and energy saving of about 15.3% in a high-demand season weekday.

Abstract: In this paper we study development patterns of Latvian electricity market. It is done based on a newly developed computer-aided simulation model. System dynamics approach was used to simulate long-term development of electricity sector in the region under the existing policy design. Results demonstrate that renewable energy sources have a high potential to integrate in the electricity generation balance. Important preconditions for this to happen are: presence of appropriate support measures, a continuous technological progress and fossil fuel price increase. Under such scenario around 70% carbon dioxide emission savings can be achieved by 2050. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The characteristics of catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPOM) under CO2 addition and excess enthalpy recovery are investigated where a rhodium-based catalyst is employed. The influences of O-2/CH4 and CO2/O-2 molar ratios, in the ranges of 0.4-0.7 and 0-2, respectively, on CPOM performance are emphasized. The energy efficiency of the Swiss-roll reactor is also studied. The results reveal that the O-2/CH4 ratio plays a crucial role in methane conversion, whereas it is insensitive to the CO2/O-2 ratio. The H2 contributed by steam reforming is pronounced at higher O-2/CH4 ratios; on the other hand, H2 produced from dry reforming is significant at lower O-2/CH4 ratios and high CO2/O-2 ratios. The H2/CO ratio in the product gas is between 1 and 2, and the values depends on the O-2/CH4 and CO2/O-2 ratios. Increasing CO2/O-2 ratio substantially increases CO2 consumption, but leads to a decrease in CO2 conversion. Within the investigated ranges of O-2/CH4 and CO2/O-2 ratios, at least 18.2% and up to 77.0% of CO2 in the feed gas is converted to CO. The energy efficiency of the reaction system with considering CH4 conversion is between 83.5% and 89.9%. Overall, CPOM performed at O-2/CH4 = 0.6 is recommended in that it provides higher CH4 conversion, syngas production, CO2 consumption, and system energy efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A transparent and comparable understanding of the energy efficiency, carbon footprint, and environmental impacts of renewable resources are required in the decision making and planning process towards a more sustainable energy system. Therefore, a new approach is proposed for measuring the environmental sustainability of anaerobic digestion green gas production pathways. The approach is based on the industrial metabolism concept, and is expanded with three known methods. First, the Material Flow Analysis method is used to simulate the decentralized energy system. Second, the Material and Energy Flow Analysis method is used to determine the direct energy and material requirements. Finally, Life Cycle Analysis is used to calculate the indirect material and energy requirements, including the embodied energy of the components and required maintenance. Complexity will be handled through a modular approach, which allows for the simplification of the green gas production pathway while also allowing for easy modification in order to determine the environmental impacts for specific conditions and scenarios. Temporal dynamics will be introduced in the approach through the use of hourly intervals and yearly scenarios. The environmental sustainability of green gas production is expressed in (Process) Energy Returned on Energy Invested, Carbon Footprint, and EcoPoints. The proposed approach within this article can be used for generating and identifying sustainable solutions. By demanding a clear and structured Material and Energy Flow Analysis of the production pathway and clear expression for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability the analysis or model can become more transparent and therefore easier to interpret and compare. Hence, a clear ruler and measuring technique can aid in the decision making and planning process towards a more sustainable energy system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel methodology for lifetime prognosis of Li-ion cells is presented, covering the validity and accuracy assessment of the predictions. It is especially focused on the procedures for the evaluation of semi-empirical ageing model development process. Combined calendar and cycle ageing is investigated with dynamic and realistic complex operation profiles, as part of the stepwise validation methodology that is proposed. The dynamic validation approach allows identifying the sources of model errors by analysing how the individual stress factors are adjusted under non-constant profiles. The results correspond to a LFP-based 26650-size cell. The presented model is suitable for different applications, such as elevator or vehicle combined with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) use, with 1.4% root-mean-square error accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study investigated zero emissions scenarios with following two originalities compared to various existing studies. One is that we based on A1T society of SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenario) of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) compared to existing studies on those of B1 or B2. The second one is that various innovative technologies were considered and incorporated, such as biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and advanced nuclear technologies including hydrogen or synfuel production. We conducted global modeling over the period 2010-2150 in which energy, materials, and biomass and foods supply costs were minimized by linear programming. We found following features of energy supply structure in A1T scenario. Since the electric demand in A1T scenario in 2100 is two times larger than the others, (1) renewable energy which solely produce electricity, nuclear, and fossil energy with CCS (FECCS) especially coal are main sources of electricity, (2) renewable which can supply heat, namely BECCS and geothermal, satisfies the sector, and (3) hydrogen from coal is introduced in transport sector. It can be concluded that the zero emission energy systems with global economic growth will be possible, by development and deployment of ambitious advanced energy technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A measurement system has been designed to characterize the radiant energy efficiency of infrared heating elements. The system also allows for measurement of the radiant heat flux distribution emitted from radiant heater assemblies. To facilitate these, a 6-axis robotic arm is fitted with a Schmidt-Boelter radiant heat flux gauge. A LabVIEW interface operates the robot and positions the sensor in the desired location and subsequently acquires the desired radiant heat flux measurement. To illustrate the functionality of the measurement system and methodology, radiant heat flux distributions and efficiency calculations are performed for a commercially available ceramic heater element for two cases. In the first, a spherical surface is traced around the entire heater assembly and the total radiant power and net radiant efficiency is computed. In the second, 50 cm x 50 cm vertical planes are traced parallel to the front face of the heater assembly at distances between 10 cm and 50 cm and the in-plane power and efficiencies are computed. The results indicate that the radiant efficiencies are strongly dependant on the input power to the element and, for the in-plane efficiencies, depend on the distance from the heater.

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of an autothermal membrane reformer within a micro-CHP system of 5 kWel based on PEM fuel cell. The system modeled is based on a prototype developed within Reforcell European project. The optimization of the micro-CHP system is performed from a thermodynamic point of view aiming at the target of 40% of net electric efficiency and 90% of total system efficiency comparing different configuration and operating conditions. In particular, two hydrogen permeate side options as vacuum or sweep steam are evaluated together with different combination of feed temperature and pressures. A good compromise between electric efficiency (40%) and membrane surface area (0.3 m(2)) was obtained for the sweep gas case at reaction side conditions of 8 bar, 600 degrees C and S/C of 2.5. Higher electric efficiency (40.5%) could be achieved by increasing the membrane surface area. The adoption of a vacuum pump simplifies the reactor design and manufacturing, but reduces the net electric efficiency by about 2% points with a membrane surface area of 0.15 m(2). Finally, the sensitivity analysis highlighted the influence of the main parameters and the design criteria for the definition of the CHP system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a multi-objective framework is proposed for the daily operation of a Smart Grid (SG) with high penetration of sensitive loads. The Virtual Power Player (VPP) manages the day-ahead energy resource scheduling in the smart grid, considering the intensive use of Distributed Generation (DG) and Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G), while maintaining a highly reliable power for the sensitive loads. This work considers high penetration of sensitive loads, i.e. loads such as some industrial processes that require high power quality, high reliability and few interruptions. The weighted-sum approach is used with the distributed and parallel computing techniques to efficiently solve the multi-objective problem. A two-stage optimization method is proposed using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a deterministic technique based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). A realistic mathematical formulation considering the electric network constraints for the day-ahead scheduling model is described. The execution time of the large-scale problem can be reduced by using a parallel and distributed computing platform. A Pareto front algorithm is applied to determine the set of non-dominated solutions. The maximization of the minimum available reserve is incorporated in the mathematical formulation in addition to the cost minimization, to take into account the reliability requirements of sensitive and vulnerable loads. A case study with a 180-bus distribution network and a fleet of 1000 gridable Electric Vehicles (EVs) is used to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The execution time to solve the optimization problem is reduced by using distributed computing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Lithium-ion storage capacitors were assembled using graphene/tantalum carbide/tantalum wire electrodes and carbon hollow spheres as electrolyte. The graphene/tantalum carbide layers were prepared by electron-assisted hot filament chemical vapor deposition; the carbon hollow spheres were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction and pyrolysis treatment. The specific capacitance of the capacitor was 593 F g(-1) at a current density of 10 A g(-1). The capacitor showed excellent cycling stability, retaining 91.2% of its initial capacitance after 8000 cycles. Moreover, the capacitor provided a high specific energy density of 132W h kg(-1) at a high power density of 3.17 kW kg(-1). The high energy density is attributed to the widened operation window ranging from 0 to 3.0 V. The graphene layer of the electrode and carbon hollow spheres in electrolyte synergistic affect influence on the electrochemical performance of the capacitor are discussed. In addition, the use of a low-cost lithium salt, lithium chloride, is also featured in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Transport sector significantly influences the decarbonization of the entire energy system. In this study, carbon tax scenario analyses with application of the TIMES model are carried out for China and USA to advance the understanding of the transport service demands, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions from a comparison perspective. Model results suggest that liquid fuels will keep dominating the transport energy consumption, while biofuels and electrification will facilitate the decarbonization of the transport sector both in China and USA. However, substantial differences exist between the two countries regarding the transport development pathways. FCEVs will be developed earlier and faster in USA and can fulfill 10% of the road passenger services in 2050 in USA, while less than 2% in China in TAX20 scenario; Carbon tax will raise the total energy system cost by 24% in China and 8% in USA in 2050 in TAX50 scenario and the additional cost of electricity in USA will be lower than that in China. It's also observed that the transport sector reacts to the carbon policy less and later than other sectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper compares the annual performance and economic feasibility of Integrated Solar Combined Cycles (ISCC) using two solar concentration technologies: parabolic trough collectors (PTC) and linear Fresnel reflectors (LFR). Integration of solar energy to the steam turbine of a combined cycle gives some advantages: the first one is the fuel saving due to the solar contribution and, additionally, the second one is that this contribution takes place especially in highly insolated periods with high ambient temperatures, when conventional combined cycles decrease their power rate and work with decreased efficiency. Previous works showed the convenience of ISCC using FTC and direct steam generation in locations with severe climatology. Besides, LFR technology is currently considered as a good option for reducing the cost of concentrating solar power. Thus, in the present work both concentrating technologies are studied and compared. Solar contribution is only used for evaporating water, increasing the production of the high pressure level of the steam generator. Two locations, Almeria and Las Vegas, are selected for the annual analyses. Results show that the proposed evaporative configurations increase the annual performance. Also, the thermal contribution is higher with PTC, but LFR may improve the economic feasibility of the plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The instantaneous performance ratio of thin-film photovoltaic modules of three different technologies is analyzed and characterized using contour graphs for different outdoor conditions. This parameter changes when modules are working in outdoor conditions depending on several variables. The most explanatory parameters we have found are the module temperature, the atmospheric clearness index and the solar spectral irradiance distribution; this latter has been included in the characterization using the average photon energy index as it has been identified as a good indicator of the solar spectral irradiance distribution. Moreover, the variance of instantaneous performance ratio for each studied technology has been analyzed. We can conclude that the joint use of all these parameters in contour graphs allows us to better characterize the performance of modules and to reduce the uncertainty observed in previous proposals that only use two of these parameters.

Abstract: The ratification of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 and the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 mark an environment protection era of the development of organic working fluid. Ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP) are two most important indices for the quantitative comparison of organic working fluid. Nowadays, more and more attention has been paid to GWP. The calculation of GWP is an extremely complicated process which involves interactions between surface and atmosphere such as atmospheric radiative transfer and atmospheric chemical reactions. GWP of a substance is related to its atmospheric abundance and is a variable in itself. However, radiative efficiency is an intermediate parameter for GWP calculation and it is a constant value used to describe inherent property of a substance. In this paper, the group contribution method was adopted to estimate the radiative efficiency of the organic substance which contains more than one carbon atom. In most cases, the estimation value and the standard value are in a good agreement. The biggest estimation error occurs in the estimation of the radiative efficiency of fluorinated ethers due to its plenty of structure groups and its complicated structure compared with hydrocarbon. This estimation method can be used to predict the radiative efficiency of newly developed organic working fluids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We designed, built and experimentally assessed the cooling power and the coefficient of performance (COP) of a chemisorption chiller that used a consolidated composite made of NaBr impregnated in expanded graphite as sorbent and ammonia as refrigerant. The influence of the operation conditions on the COP and the cooling power was calculated through the values of inlet and outlet water temperature and water mass flow across the chiller's heat exchangers. From the experimental results, we concluded that the utilization of mass recovery simultaneously to heat recovery improved the COP and cooling power up to 11.7% and 15.4%, respectively, when compared to the values obtained when only heat recovery was employed. Regarding the influence of the heat source temperature, maximum cooling power and COP were obtained when that temperature was, respectively, 75 degrees C and 65 degrees C As for the influence of the cycle time, the highest values of COP were obtained with an 88 min cycle, whereas the highest values of cooling power were obtained at different cycle time, depending on the value of other operation conditions. When the chiller was driven by hot water at 70 degrees C, and the inlet water temperature in the evaporator was not kept constant, it cooled water from 23 degrees C to 10 degrees C in 90 min with mean cooling power of 1400W and COP 0.33.

Abstract: Day-ahead electricity prices are generally used as reference prices for decisions done in energy trading, e.g. purchase and sale strategies are typically based on the day-ahead spot prices. Therefore, wellperforming forecast methods for day-ahead electricity prices are essential for energy traders and supply companies. In this paper, a methodology based on artificial neuronal networks (ANN) is presented to forecast electricity prices. As the performance of an ANN forecast model depends on appropriate input parameter sets, the focus is set on the selection and preparation of fundamental data that has a noticeable impact on electricity prices. This is done with the help of different cluster algorithms, but also by comparing the results of the pre-selected model configurations in combination with different input parameter settings. After the determination of the optimal input parameters, affecting day-ahead electricity prices, and wellperforming ANN configuration, the developed ANN model is applied for in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. The results show that the overall methodology leads to well-fitting electricity price forecasts, whereas forecast errors are as low as or even lower than other forecast models for electricity prices known from the literature.

Abstract: Strategies to increase profit from investments in crude oil futures markets are an important issue for investors in energy finance. This paper proposes an approach to generate dynamic moving average trading rules in crude oil futures markets. An adaptive moving average calculation is used to better describe the fluctuations, and trading rules can be adjusted dynamically in the investment period based on the performance of four reference rules. We use genetic algorithms to select optimal dynamic moving average trading rules from a large set of possible parameters. Our results indicate that dynamic trading rules can help traders make profit in the crude oil futures market and are more effective than the BH strategy in the price decrease process. Moreover, dynamic moving average trading rules are more favorable to traders than static trading rules, and the advantage becomes more obvious over long investment cycles. The lengths of the two periods of dynamic moving average trading rules are closely associated with price volatility. The dynamic trading rules will have outstanding performance when market is shocked by significant energy related events. Investment advices are given out and these advices are helpful for traders when choosing technical trading rules in actual investments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As the number of electric vehicles increases, the impact of their charging on distribution networks is being investigated using different load profiles. Due to the lack of real charging data, the majority of these load impact studies are making assumptions for the electric vehicle charging demand profiles. In this paper a two-step modelling framework was developed to extract the useful information hidden in real EVs charging event data. Real EVs charging demand data were obtained from Plugged-in Midlands (PiM) project, one of the eight 'Plugged-in Places' projects supported by the UK Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV). A data mining model was developed to investigate the characteristics of electric vehicle charging demand in a geographical area. A Fuzzy-Based model aggregates these characteristics and estimates the potential relative risk level of EVs charging demand among different geographical areas independently to their actual corresponding distribution networks. A case study with real charging and weather data from three counties in UK is presented to demonstrate the modelling framework. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Ground coupled heat pumps (GCHPs) have been widely applied in China due to its environmental friendliness and energy efficiency. However, it may not be appropriate in all geographical areas because a variety of factors (e.g. original soil temperature, peak cooling and heating load, and running time) vary significantly. Typical office buildings were selected from five cities that are located in different climatic regions. The QUick Energy Simulation Tool (e-QUEST) was utilized to simulate the cooling and heating load. Similarly, the Transient System Simulation Program (TRNSYS) was employed to simulate the 20-year variation of the average soil temperature and the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of GCHP units. Consequently, the feasibility of the GCHPs in different regions was analyzed. The results show that GCHP system is feasible in severe cold B regions such as Shenyang and cold regions such as Beijing as both cold and heat sources because of its energy efficiency. From the economy and operation performance's perspective, GCHP system is not feasible in severe cold A regions such as Harbin; hot-summer and cold-winter regions such as Nanjing; and hot-summer and warm-winter region such as Guangzhou. This is due to the poor energy efficiency of the system, mainly attributed to a large gap between cumulative energy consumption for cooling and for heating. Comprehensive analysis of experiment results showed that the GCHP system of case building in cold region can operate stably in long term with a high efficiency when the ratio of annual cumulative cooling energy consumption to annual cumulative heating energy consumption ranges from 0.2:1 to 5:1. In severe cold B regions, GCHP system can operate stably when the ratio of annual cumulative cooling energy consumption to annual cumulative heating energy consumption ranges from 1:1 to 7:1.

Abstract: To develop an advanced battery estimation unit for electric vehicles application, the state-of-charge (SoC) estimation is proposed with an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and realized with the RTOS mu COS-II platform. Kalman filters are broadly used to deploy various battery SoC estimators recently. Herein, an UKF algorithm has been employed to develop a systematic adaptive SoC estimation framework. Compared with traditional used extended Kalman filter, it uses an unscented transform to deal with the state estimation problem, thus it has the potential to achieve third order accuracy of the Taylor expansion for tracking posterior estimate of the inner inhabited state. Beneficial from it, the SoC estimation accuracy has been improved with higher tracking accuracy and faster convergence ability. To further evaluate and verify the performance of the proposed online SoC estimation approach, a battery-in-loop platform is built and the SoC estimation is calculated with a RTOS mu LCOS-II platform. The analog acquisition, communication system and SoC estimation algorithms were programmed, the performance of the proposed SoC estimation with UKF algorithm was finally investigated. The battery management system with UKF algorithm and RTOS mu COS-II platform has good performance and it can apply for electric vehicles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Spherical porous LiFePO4/C (LFP/C) composite materials were prepared by employing a solid-state (SS) method and a spray dry (SP) method. The surface modification was conducted on the spherical LFP/C composite using 1-5 wt.%Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) to improve the rate capability and the cycle stability properties at low temperature (0 degrees C) and elevated temperature (55 degrees C). The characteristic properties were examined through X-ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, an AC impedance method, and galvanostatic charge-discharge method. The characteristic properties of the SS-LFP/C, SP-LFP/C, and LTO-coated SP-LPF/C composites were studied and compared. The 3 wt.%LTO-coated SP-LFP/C composite exhibited the most favorable performance among the samples. It exhibited discharge capacities of 150, 141, 131, 110, 103, and 84 mA h g(-1), at rates of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 3 C, 5 C, and 10 C, respectively. It was also found that the 3 wt.%LTO-coated SP-LFP/C composite shows the best cycling stability performance at elevated temperature of 55 degrees C. The LTO-coated SP-LFP/C composite was demonstrated to be suitable for high-temperature and high-power application in lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a developing CO2 capture technology. CLC makes use of the repeated oxidation/reduction reactions of metal oxide (oxygen carrier, OC) to separate CO2 from fuel combustion and to obtain a pure CO2 stream suitable for compression and storage. Low cost materials, such as natural ores, are required for coal-fueled CLC because the lifetime of the oxygen carrier (OC) is lowered by side reactions with the fuel ash or carryover losses. In this study, five manganese ores were examined as oxygen carriers using CO as the fuel gas in a laboratory batch fluidized bed reactor. All five of the ores were impregnated by copper nitrate solution to evaluate the reactivity enhancement of copper impregnation. The period with full CO conversion can be enhanced 2-100 times for different ores in the single fluidized bed test, which indicated that the Cu impregnation may be a general method to enhance the reactivity of manganese ores. Finally, one manganese ore and the corresponding Cu-modified particles were tested in a dual fluidized bed reactor. The attrition rates of both materials were measured as 0.13 wt.%/h during the 88 h operation in the dual fluidized bed. Both the manganese ore and the Cu-impregnated ore exhibited stable and high reactivity during the continuous test in the dual fluidized bed reactor, even at a low temperature (similar to 310 degrees C). Copper impregnation had no obvious influence on the attrition property of the manganese ore. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Dual fuel low temperature combustion (LTC) strategies are attractive for future internal combustion engines due to their promise of very low engine-out emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter. In the present work, experimental results for diesel-ignited methane dual fuel LTC on a compression ignition single cylinder research engine (SCRE) are presented. Methane was fumigated into the intake manifold and diesel injection was used to initiate combustion. The engine was operated at a constant speed of 1500 rev/min, and diesel injection pressure was fixed at 500 bar. The start of injection (SOI) of diesel fuel was varied from 260 to 360 (i.e., TDC) to quantify its impact on engine performance and engine-out, indicated-specific emissions of NO (ISNOx), carbon monoxide (ISCO), and unburned hydrocarbons (ISHC), and smoke emissions. The SOI sweeps were performed at different net indicated mean effective pressures (IMEPs) of 4.1 and 12.1 bar. Intake manifold pressure and methane percent energy substitution (PES) were fixed at 1.5 bar and 80%, respectively, for 4.1 bar IMEP and at 1.8 bar and 95%, respectively, for 12.1 bar IMEP. For all loads, when SOI was advanced, the longer ignition delays caused the separation between the fuel injection and the combustion events to increase. This was accompanied by a change in the shape of the AHRR curve from a distinct two-stage profile to a smooth, single-stage (almost Gaussian) profile. Advancing SOI to 300 and beyond yielded minimal engine-out ISNOx, emissions (similar to 0.15 g/kW h at 4.1 bar IMEP and similar to 1.3-1.5 g/kW h at 12.1 bar IMEP). Smoke emissions were negligible (<0.05 FSN) for all loads and all SOIs. Very high ISHC and ISCO emissions were observed for near-TDC SOI at all loads. The lowest ISHC and ISCO levels occurred for SOIs near 310 and for more advanced SOIs, both emissions increased. High pressure rise rates and the tendency to knock prevented engine operation at intermediate SOIs between 310 and 340 for 12.1 bar IMEP. On the other hand, for both 4.1 bar and 12. 1 bar IMEPs, high coefficient of variation of IMEP (>5%) caused unstable engine operation for SOIs advanced beyond 280. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Demand response is viewed as a practical and relatively low-cost solution to increasing penetration of intermittent renewable generation in bulk electric power systems. This paper examines the question of what is the optimal installed capacity allocation of renewable resources in conjunction with demand response. We introduce an integrated model for total annual system cost that can be used to determine a cost-minimizing allocation of renewable asset investments. The model includes production, uncertainty, emission, capacity expansion and mothballing costs, as well as wind variability and demand elasticity to determine the hourly cost of electricity delivery. The model is applied to a 2024 planning case for British Columbia, Canada. Results show that cost is minimized at about 30% wind generation. We find that the optimal amount of renewable resource is as sensitive to installation cost as it is to a carbon tax. But we find the inter-hourly demand response magnitude is much less helpful in promoting additional renewables than intra-hourly demand elasticity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Treatment and subsequent use of biogas are garnering huge interest for both energy recovery and mitigation of environmental impact. However, separation process is pivotal for increasing its calorific value and removing CO2. This work presents the kinetic and separation efficiency study as well as microcosmic structure analysis for purifying simulated biogas (45.0 mol% CO2/CH4 binary mixture) through hydrate crystallization approach. Particularly, synergic additives comprise gas solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and traditional hydrate promoter (tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB)) were proposed to enhance the hydrate-based separation process. The promotion mechanism was explored through in-situ Raman spectroscopy. The residual gas phase and the decomposition gas phase from the hydrate slurry were sampled and analyzed. Based on the experimental data, the gas storage capacity, unit system gas consumed rate, gas selectivity and separation efficiency were calculated for evaluating the separation process. It was found that, the synergic additives could promote the mixture hydrate formation process due to DMSO (acid gas solvent) could improve both rate and selectivity of CO2 during the dissolution and diffusion processes. In addition, the Raman analysis reveals that the simulated biogas forms structure II hydrate and semiclathrate framework with THF-DMSO and TBAB-DMSO respectively, and CH4 molecules are only found in the smaller (5(12)) cages of the mixture hydrates. It is inferred that DMSO just performs as an acid gas solvent during the gas dissolution and diffusion processes but not participate in the hydrate framework formation. It will be of practical interest in relation to resolving the bottleneck of hydrate-based biogas purification technology and of potential importance for the industry application of gas hydrate.

Abstract: In future energy systems with high shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation, the storage of electricity will play a key role. Today, a number of different storage options are discussed to cover the fast growing demand for storage. One of these options involves federal waterways for pumped hydro storage plants. The paper analyses the concept and the results of achievable storage potentials for Germany. The total storage potential for Germany sums up to approx. 400 MWh of which the majority can be attributed to four flight of locks which have been identified as the most suitable sites.

Abstract: We explore the operations, balancing requirements, and costs of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council power system under a stringent greenhouse gas emission reduction target. We include sensitivities for technology costs and availability, fuel prices and emissions, and demand profile. Meeting an emissions target of 85% below 1990 levels is feasible across a range of assumptions, but the cost of achieving the goal and the technology mix are uncertain. Deployment of solar photovoltaics is the main driver of storage deployment: the diurnal periodicity of solar energy availability results in opportunities for daily arbitrage that storage technologies with several hours of duration are well suited to provide. Wind output exhibits seasonal variations and requires storage with a large energy subcomponent to avoid curtailment. The combination of low-cost solar technology and advanced battery technology can provide substantial savings through 2050, greatly mitigating the cost of climate change mitigation. Policy goals for storage deployment should be based on the function storage will play on the grid and therefore incorporate both the power rating and duration of the storage system. These goals should be set as part of overall portfolio development, as system flexibility needs will vary with the grid mix. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This research aims to investigate the effects of renewable energy consumption on the economic growth of major renewable energy consuming countries in the world. Using the Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index developed by the Ernst & Young Global Limited, we choose 38 top renewable energy consuming countries to explain the growth process between 1991 and 2012. With panel estimation techniques, our findings establish cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across the countries. We confirm the evidence of long-run dynamics between economic growth, and traditional and energy-related inputs. Findings from long-run output elasticities indicate that renewable energy consumption has a significant positive impact on the economic output for 57% of our selected countries. For robustness, we also carried out time-series analyses of long-run output elasticities. Our findings suggest that governments, energy planners, international cooperation agencies and associated bodies must act together in increasing renewable energy investment for low carbon growth in most of these economies.

Abstract: A combined heat and power (CHP) optimization model with heat storage is proposed to minimize the production cost and to maximize the revenue from power sales based on a sliding time window method. The model can be applied both for operating heat storage optimally and supporting investment planning for a new storage. Heat demand is forecasted based on a weather forecast. Each day the heat demand and power price forecasts are input to a generic CHP optimization model for a several-day time window to obtain a heat storage operation plan. Then only the first day of the plan is implemented with actual power price and heat demand using a single-day optimization model to compute the actual production amount, fuel costs and revenue from power sales. After that, the time window is slid one day forward, and the above-mentioned process is repeated. In the test runs, forecasts for power price and temperature are simulated by disturbing actual (historical) data by the Wiener process (random walk). To evaluate the benefit and validate the proposed method, the results are compared with the no-storage case and the theoretical optimum assuming perfect demand and price forecasts. The results show that the revenue from power sales can be significantly improved. The method is used to evaluate the benefit of different sized storages for the CHP system. Also the effect of the width of the time windows on the performance of the method is evaluated. The model was tested using real-life heat demand data for the city of Espoo in Finland, and NordPool spot market data for power price for a one year time horizon. The results indicate that considering the forecasting uncertainty, 5-day sliding time window method can obtain 90% of the theoretically possible cost savings that can be derived based on perfect forecasts.

Abstract: The rapid growth of energy consumption in China has led to increased emissions of CO2. As a response, the Chinese government has proposed a series of carbon mitigation strategies, such as switching the production structure and implementing energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies in energy-intensive sectors. In this paper, an integrated assessment approach was developed by combining the Stock-based model, the China-TIMES model and the co-benefits analysis model. The approach was applied to China's steel sector to simulate the trends of energy consumption and air emissions (CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM10) during 2010-2050, under a reference scenario and three alternative carbon mitigation scenarios. The model quantified the air emission reductions, water conservation, and associated co-benefits during the study period. The modeling results show that by switching the production structure and implementing energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies, China's steel sector can achieve significant co-benefits of carbon mitigation, water conservation, averted mortality and averted morbidity. Despite certain limitations and uncertainties associated with the elements of the integrated assessment approach, the results demonstrate that substantial social benefits and health effects could be realized through carbon mitigation strategies in China's steel sector.

Abstract: Energy recovery within processes via heat exchanger network (HEN) to minimise the external utilities has been well established. Due to the close energy interactions between HEN and the utility system, it is important to synthesise these two elements simultaneously. In this work, a novel systematic approach for synthesis of HEN with utility systems is presented. Multiple cascades automated targeting is applied to determine minimum total operating cost of the trigeneration system, minimum hot and cold utility targets for heat integration prior to detailed design. Besides, the selection and allocation of utilities, distribution of steam, and potential power generation can also be determined. Meanwhile, the types of boiler fuel for the trigeneration utility system is also identified. An illustrative example with two scenarios is solved to illustrate the proposed approach.

Abstract: Listed energy companies play an important role in both the energy financial market and energy commodity market. As owners of listed energy companies, shareholders can influence the stability of the energy stock market by increasing or decreasing their holdings. To analyze the evolutionary features and stability of shareholders' co-holding behavior, we constructed a derivative holding-based structural equivalence network of the shareholders (holding-based network) based on the primitive shareholding network of the listed companies and their shareholders. The main data used in this paper are the semi-annual reports from 2003 to 2012 that contain information about Chinese listed energy companies' top 10 shareholders. The holding-based network takes the shareholders as nodes, whether holding the same listed energy companies' stock at the same time as the edges, and the number of listed energy companies co-held as the weights. Due to the unique topological features of the holding-based network, we improved the Heuristic Algorithm to find the associated maximal connected sub-graph of the network, which is the main group of shareholders with shareholding consistency of the listed energy companies. This paper creates a new approach to analyze the relationships in the energy stock market, presenting a new method to analyze shareholder behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Large amounts of methane (CH4) exist in the earth in the form of natural gas hydrates, an ice-like substance with guest gas molecules trapped within. One proposed method to recover methane from marine natural gas hydrates is to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) as hydrates and produce methane. Fundamental understanding of CO2 hydrate in marine environments - the formation and dissociation behavior needs to be understood first in order to develop techniques to facilitate the exchange process. In this study, CO2 hydrate formation and dissociation was studied in Toyoura sand (100-500 mu m), pure water, saltwater of 1.5 wt%, 3 wt% and natural seawater at formation pressure of 3.5 MPa and driving force of 1.5 MPa. Slightly lower water conversions to hydrate were observed when comparing pure water to saline water, though initial gas uptake in saline water was higher than that in pure water. Multiple nucleation was observed in pure water systems, possibly explaining a slightly higher rate of gas uptake after extended periods of time. Dissociation behavior was investigated at two different temperature driving forces of 4 K and 10 K. The presence of NaCl might have a slight impact on dissociation kinetics, causing slightly quicker dissociation than in pure water systems at the lower driving force of 4 K. We did not observe evidence of kinetic inhibition during hydrate formation due to the presence of NaCl but as expected, we observed thermodynamic inhibition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In order to keep state's economical development and national security, it is necessary to secure integrity and functionality of energy infrastructure. Developed new criticality assessment method for the critical energy infrastructures is applicable to the assessment of mixed energy system infrastructures, taking into account functional relations between infrastructures and their elements. Component criticality assessment of critical energy infrastructures is performed taking into account the entire energy sector operation. Such assessment enables better quantitatively defining criticality of these components in terms of final energy consumers. The optimization methods were used to simulate a real system (to implement allocation of demands of district heating and electricity for generation technologies). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The SOC (state-of-charge) of Li-ion (Lithium-ion) battery is an important evaluation index in BMS (battery management system) for EVs (Electric Vehicles) and smart grids. However, the existing special OCV (open circuit voltage) characteristics of LiFePO4 batteries complicate the estimation of SOC. To improve the estimation accuracy and reliability for battery SOC and battery terminal voltage, an online estimation approach for SOC and parameters of a battery based on the IIM (invariant-imbedding-method) algorithm has been proposed. Firstly, by using the IIM algorithm, an online parameter identification method has been established to accurately capture the real-time characteristics of the battery, which include the OCV hysteresis phenomena. Secondly, a dual IIM algorithm is employed to develop a multi-state estimator for SOC of the battery. Note that the parameters of the battery model are updated with the real-time measurements of the battery current and voltage at each sampling interval. Finally, the proposed method has been verified by a LiFePO4 battery cell under different operating current conditions. Experimental results indicate that the estimation value based on the proposed IIM-based estimator converges to real SOC with an error of +/- 2%, and the battery model can simulate OCV hysteresis phenomena robustly with high accuracy.

Abstract: Chemical looping reforming (CLR) is a relatively new method to produce hydrogen (H-2) and is also used as an energy conversion method for solid, liquid or gaseous fuels. There are various advantages of this method such as inherent carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, minimal NOx emissions and the H-2 production. In this process, there is no direct contact between the fuel and oxidizer. This method utilizes oxygen from an oxygen carrier which may be a transition metal. The idea is to split the combustion process into three separate sub-processes by employing three separate reactors: air reactor where the oxygen carrier is oxidized by air, fuel reactor where natural gas is oxidized to produce a stream of CO2 and H2O and steam reactor where the steam is reduced to produce H-2.
In this study, a thermodynamic model with iron oxides as oxygen carrier has been developed using Aspen Plus by employing conservation of mass and energy for all the components of the CLR system. The developed model was employed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters such as mass flow rates of air, fuel, steam and oxygen carrier and fraction of inert material on H-2 and CO2 production and key reactor temperatures. The results show that the H-2 production increases with the increase in air, fuel and steam flow rates up to a certain limit and stays constant for higher flow rates. The CO2 production follows a similar trend. Similarly, the H-2 production also increases with the increase in oxide flow rate and fraction of inert material up to a particular value, but then decrease for higher oxide flow rates and inert fractions. Reactor temperatures were also observed in this study. The temperatures increase with the increase of steam and air flow rates till the stoichiometric values and decrease thereafter. Increase in the fuel flow rate shows a decreasing trend in all the reactor temperatures. The reactor temperatures increase with the increase in oxide flow rates and the decrease of the inert mass fraction. The data obtained from the simulations is also used for exergetic analysis of the system. The overall exergetic efficiency was found to decrease with steam, air and oxide flow rates and increase with the increase in the fuel flow rate and the fraction of inert material.

Abstract: A skeletal four-component biodiesel combustion mechanism comprising methyl decenoate, methyl-5-decenoate, n-decane and methyl linoleate is proposed in the present study. The motivation of this work is to develop a mechanism for accurate modeling on the effect of varying fatty acid methyl ester proportion on biodiesel ignition and combustion. The skeletal mechanism was generated by coupling an existed methyl decenoate, methyl-5-decenoate, n-decane skeletal mechanism with a new developed skeletal methyl linoleate mechanism, which was reduced from a penta-component detailed mechanism consisting of 5025 species and 20,163 reactions. The employed reduction strategies are directed relation graph error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA), isomer lumping, computational singular perturbation and reaction rate adjustment. The skeletal methyl linoleate mechanism consists of 92 species and 249 reactions, and the coupled biodiesel blend surrogates mechanism consists of 106 species and 263 reactions. In order to validate the feasibility of the new developed skeletal mechanism, zero-dimension ignition delay testing, reflected shock tube experiment validation and 3-dimensional engine testing about cylinder pressures, heat release rates and NOx emission trends were conducted at different conditions. And the new developed skeletal mechanism was compared with a biodiesel surrogates skeletal mechanism without double-bond species in the 3-dimensional engine testing. The results indicate that the new developed skeletal mechanism is suitable to predict ignition behavior, combustion characteristics, NO emission trends of biodiesel with varying fatty acid methyl ester, and it is more accurate than a biodiesel surrogates skeletal mechanism without double-bond species in the 3-dimensional engine testing.

Abstract: In order to pursue the low-carbon development around the world, a large scale of renewable generation will be connected to the power systems. Take the Great Britain (GB) as an example, the GB power system has a large wind energy integration potential. The intermittency of wind generation will have great impact on the system frequency stability. Electric vehicles (EVs) have a crucial role in decarbonizing the transport sector. To increase the utilization of wind energy, EVs are suggested to provide frequency response service to the power system due to their quick power reaction characteristic. This paper proposes a general dynamic EV frequency control strategy considering the travelling behavior of the EV users. A droop control method is used to regulate the EV charging/discharging power according to the frequency signal. A Forced-Charge Boundary (FCB) and a Forced-Charge Area (FCA) are proposed to guarantee sufficient energy in the EV battery for user's travel at the plug-out time. A dynamic Virtual Energy Storage System (VESS) is developed to evaluate the frequency response capacity of the EV clusters. In the case study, the model of the GB power system is used to investigate the frequency control effect of the control strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy provides effective EV frequency response to the power system and thus is able to facilitate the integration of wind energy.

Abstract: We present the design and optical analyses of an arrayed microfluidic tunable prism panel that enables wide solar tracking and high solar concentration while minimizing energy loss. Each of the liquid prism modules is implemented by a microfluidic (i.e. non-mechanical) technology based on electrowetting for adaptive solar beam steering. Therefore the proposed platform offers a low-cost, lightweight and precise solar tracking system while obviating the need for bulky and heavy mechanical moving parts essentially required for a conventional motor-driven solar tracker. In this paper, various liquid prism configurations in terms of design (single, double, triple and quad-stacked prism arrays) as well as optical materials are considered and their impact on optical performance aspects such as solar beam steering, reflection losses and beam concentration is studied. Our system is able to achieve a wide solar tracking covering the whole-day movement of the Sun and a reflection loss below 4.4% with a Rayleigh's film for a quad-stacked prism configuration. Furthermore, an arrayed prism panel is proposed to increase the aperture area and thus allows for the collection of large amounts of sunlight. Our simulation study based on the optical design software, ZEMAX, indicates that the prism panel is capable of high solar concentration up to 2032x factor even without conventional solar tracking devices. We also deal with dispersion characteristics of the materials and their corresponding effect on concentration factor. The proposed microfluidic platform has a potential for high solar energy harvesting and is not only economically viable, but also reliable and practical for various solar power applications.

Abstract: The economic feasibility of Biomass District Heating (BDH) networks in rural villages is largely unknown. A cost-effective evaluation tool is developed to examine the feasibility of BDH in rural communities using secondary data sources. The approach is unique in that it accounts for all the major capital expenses: energy center, distribution network, and energy transfer stations, as well as biomass procurement. BDH would deliver heat below #2 fuel oil in eight of the ten rural study villages examined, saving nearly $500,000 per year in heating expenses while demanding less than 5% of the forest residues sustainably available regionally. Capital costs comprised over 80% of total costs, illuminating the importance of reaching a sufficient heat density. Reducing capital costs by 1% lowers total cost by $93,000 per year. Extending capital payment period length five years or lowering interest rates has the next highest influence decreasing delivered heat price 0.49% and 0.35% for each 1% change, respectively. This highlights that specific building heat is a strong determinant of feasibility given the relative influence of high-demanding users on the overall village heat-density. Finally, we use a stochastic analysis projecting future #2 fuel oil prices, incorporating historical variability, to determine the probability of future BDH feasibility. Although future oil prices drop below the BDH feasibility threshold, the villages retain a 22-53% probability of feasibility after 20 years as a result of high #2 fuel oil price variability.

Abstract: An advanced cryogenic air separation process for oxy-combustion is proposed, based on self-heat recuperation technology. In contrast to double columns in the conventional cryogenic air separation process, a single distillation column only is used in the proposed process. By using self-heat recuperation technology, the heat of N-2 product gas from the top of the single distillation column is recirculated by exchanging heat with the liquid O-2 in the bottom and feed streams, largely reducing the energy requirement. The simulation results showed that the energy requirement of the proposed cryogenic air separation process was reduced by 20.2% compared with the conventional process when producing O-2 with low purity (95 mol%). The influence of compressor efficiency, minimum temperature difference in the main condenser and the O-2 product purity on the energy requirement were also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study presents a state-of-the-art overview on heat transfer characteristics of fluids (mainly water, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon fuels) flowing in smooth tubes and enhanced tubes at supercritical pressures and tries to obtain a fundamental understanding of the unique characteristics. Heat transfer in enhanced tubes is much better than that in smooth tubes with a larger pressure drop penalty at supercritical conditions. Thermo-physical properties of fluids at supercritical pressures and relevant parametric effects (e.g., effects of mass flux, heat flux, pressure and flow direction) on heat transfer performance are outlined. Inconsistencies in the literature on heat transfer are emphasized and evaluated. Possible reasons are suggested to explain those inconsistencies. Moreover, the mechanisms for heat transfer deterioration at supercritical pressures are discussed and different correlations for predicting heat transfer deterioration are compared and assessed with experimental data. These predictive correlations based on one working fluid cannot be applied directly to other working fluids. Besides, several common buoyancy criteria proposed in the literature to distinguish forced convection and mixed convection are evaluated and show large discrepancies with experimental data. There is no buoyancy criterion developed for hydrocarbon fuels. Future research needs are warranted for heat transfer of near-critical and supercritical fluids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Storing low-temperature surplus thermal energy from industries, power plants, and the like, using phase change materials (PCM) is an effective alternative in alleviating the use of fossil based thermal energy provision. Polyols; of some also known as sugar alcohols, are an emerging PCM category for thermal energy storage (TES). A review on polyols as PCM for TES shows that polyols have phase change temperatures in the range of 15 to 245 degrees C, and considerable phase change enthalpies of 100-413 kJ/kg. However, the knowledge on the thermo-physical properties of polyols as desirable PCM for TES design is presently sparse and rather inconsistent. Moreover, the phase change and state change behaviors of polyols need to be better-understood in order to use these as PCM; e.g. the state change glass transition which many polyols at pure state are found to undergo. In this work preliminary material property characterization with the use of Temperature-History method of some selected polyols, Erythritol, Xylitol and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 10,000 were done. Complex behaviors were observed for some of the polyols. These are: two different melting temperatures, 118.5-120 degrees C and 106-108 degrees C at different cycles and an average subcooling 18.5 degrees C of for Erythritol, probable glass-transition between 0 and 113 degrees C for Xylitol, as well as a thermally activated change that is likely an oxidation, after three to five heating/cooling cycles for Xylitol and Erythritol. PEG 10,000 had negligible subcooling, no glass-transition nor thermally activated oxidation. However a hysteresis of around 10 degrees C was observed for PEG 10,000. Therefore these materials require detailed studies to further evaluate their PCM-suitability. This study is expected to be an initiation of an upcoming extensive polyol-blends phase equilibrium evaluation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel emissions model for the prediction of spark ignition (SI) engine emissions at homogeneous combustion conditions, using post combustion analysis and a detailed chemistry mechanism. The novel emissions model considers an unburned and a burned zone, where the latter is considered as a homogeneous reactor and is modeled using a detailed chemical kinetics mechanism. This allows detailed emission predictions at high speed practically based only on combustion pressure and temperature profiles, without the need for calibration of the model parameters. The predictability of the emissions model is compared against the extended Zeldovich mechanism for NO and a simplified two-step reaction kinetic model for CO, which both constitute the most widespread existing approaches in the literature. Under various engine load and speed conditions examined, the mean error in NO prediction was 28% for the existing models and less than 1.3% for the new model proposed. The novel emissions model was also used to predict emissions variation due to cyclic combustion variability and demonstrated mean prediction error of 6% and 3.6% for NO and CO respectively, compared to 36% (NO) and 67% (CO) for the simplified model. The results show that the emissions model proposed offers substantial improvements in the prediction of the results without significant increase in calculation time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Accurate wind speed forecasting, which strongly influences the safe usage of wind resources, is still a critical issue and a huge challenge. At present, the single-valued deterministic NWP forecast is primarily adopted by wind farms; however, recent techniques cannot meet the actual needs of grid dispatch in many cases. This paper contributes to a new multi-step forecasting method for operational wind forecast, 96-steps of the next day, termed the CS-FS-WRF-E model, which is based on a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) ensemble forecast, a novel Fuzzy System, and a Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. First, the WRF ensemble, which considers three horizontal resolutions and four initial fields, using a 0.5 degrees horizontal grid-spacing Global Forecast System (GFS) model output, is constructed as the basic forecasting results. Then, a novel fuzzy system, which can extract the features of these ensembles, is built under the concept of membership degrees. With the help of CS optimization, the final model is constructed using this evolutionary algorithm to adjust and correct the results obtained based on physical laws, yielding the best forecasting performance and outperforming individual ensemble members and all of the other models for comparison.

Abstract: The methane storage of an activated carbon and two metal-organic frameworks (Cu-3(btc)(2) and Al(OH) Fumarate) are compared for laboratory scale (similar to 1 g of material) to pilot scale measurements (similar to-1.5 kg of material). Excess adsorption and volumetric storage capacity uptakes agreed well between the two measurements. By decomposing the volumetric storage capacity into the contributions from the gas and adsorbed phases, the volumetric storage was evidenced to be dominated by the excess adsorption up to 100 bar. The volumetric storage is a function of both the excess adsorption uptake and the material's bulk density. The AC shows higher heat transfer rates than the metal-organic frameworks upon adsorption indicating a superior thermal conductivity. The mean flow velocity has been estimated from the pilot scale measurements and is discussed as it will strongly influence the adsorbed natural gas technology performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Reliability evaluation of active distribution networks (ADNs) considering customer satisfaction is studied in this paper. Operation optimization model of ADNs is established, which aims to maximize the operation benefit of ADNs using demand response. However, according to optimization decisions, customers may have to change their electricity consumption habit, which affects customer satisfaction and the reliability of customers and ADNs. Two customer satisfaction indices are defined therefore as constraints in the operation optimization to quantify these effects. By a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) simulation, the optimization processes is innovatively integrated into the reliability evaluation, and thus the impacts of customer satisfaction constraints are incorporated in reliability evaluation. Further, four new reliability indices are defined in this paper to visibly reflect their impacts. The presented models and methods are validated by extensive studies conducted on a standard test system. Evaluation results accurately quantify the impacts of customer satisfaction constraints on load profiles, reliability and economic performance of ADNs. Conclusions drawn from evaluation results can provide helpful insights for distribution system operators (DSOs) to effectively improve the reliability and operation economy of ADNs using demand resources.

Abstract: The mass transfer of CO2 capture using ammonia solution in the bubbling reactor was studied; according to double film theory, the mass transfer coefficient models and interface area model were built. Through our experiments, the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients were obtained, while the interface areas in unit volume were estimated. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of ammonia escaping during the experiment were 1.39 x 10(-5)-4.34 x 10(-5) mol/(m(3) s Pa), and the volumetric mass transfer coefficients of CO2 absorption were 2.86 x 10(-5)-17.9 x 10(-5) mol/(m(3) spa). The estimated interface area of unit volume in the bubbling reactor ranged from 75.19 to 256.41 m(2)/m(3), making the bubbling reactor a viable choice to obtain higher mass transfer performance than the packed tower or spraying tower.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to assess the economic impact following as a result of the conversion of conventional stations to cogeneration plants connected to a system for distributing heat and refrigeration. The analysis will be carried out through a financial evaluation in order to assess yearly variations of the whole scheme expenditure.
In particular, yearly capital and operating costs of supplying cold and heat to urban areas that represent weather conditions in northern, central, and southern Europe (Oldenburg-Wilhelmshaven, Bristol, and Cartagena, respectively) were studied. In the base case scenario, today conditions are represented; they will be compared with alternative scenarios in which existing conventional thermal power stations will be converted into cogeneration plants.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to design feasible Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs for domestic customers from flat rate tariffs by clustering techniques. The method is dedicated to designing the fundamental window patterns of ToU tariffs rather than optimising exact prices for each settlement period. It makes use of Gaussian Mixture Model clustering technique to group half-hour interval flat rate tariffs within a day into clusters to determine ToU tariffs. Two groups of ToU are designed following the variations in energy prices and system loading demand respectively. With a number of price-oriented and load-oriented ToU tariffs, the investigation is further carried out to explore the effects of these ToU tariffs on domestic demand response (DR), especially in terms of energy cost reduction and peak shaving. The DR in this paper is assumed to be enabled by household storage battery and the objective of the DR in response to each ToU tariff is to ininimise the electricity bills for end customers and/or mitigate network pressures. An example study in the UK case is also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Wind catchers are natural ventilation systems based on the design of traditional architecture, intended to provide ventilation by manipulating pressure differentials around buildings induced by wind movement and temperature difference. Though the movement of air caused by the wind catcher will lead to a cooling sensation for occupants, the high air temperature in hot regions will result in little cooling to occupants. In order to maximise the properties of cooling by wind catchers, heat pipes were incorporated into the design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to investigate the effect of the cooling devices on the performance of the wind catcher, highlighting the capabilities of the system to deliver the required fresh air rates and cool the ventilated space. Qualitative and quantitative wind tunnel measurements of the airflow through the wind catcher were compared with the CFD data and good correlation was observed. Preliminary field testing of the wind catcher was carried out to evaluate its thermal performance under real operating conditions. A cooling potential of up to 12 degrees C of supply air temperature was identified in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide emission reduction is the most important challenge concerning on the road transportation. Stringent quantitative commitments have been set, both for automotive and for light and heavy duty vehicles. Future engine (and vehicle) technologies will consider a portfolio of new components, engine layouts, control strategies, integrated functions which will match also new comfort standards and fun to drive options, and complying fuel consumption savings.
Engine thermal management is an area of intervention aimed at reducing the warm up time: in Most part of the homologation cycle, both in passenger cars and in light duty vehicles, engines do not reach a stabilized thermal state. This produces a significant pollutants and fuel consumption increase. Engine thermal management can match also more effective cabin heating requirements, improving comfort, which is an important market advantage.
Basic idea of engine thermal management is to reduce or make nil the cooling fluid circulation inside the engine.
In this paper, the oil warm up is considered as the main focus: a faster temperature grow up decreases oil viscosity and improves mechanical efficiency and organic efficiency, during engine cold state. An experimental activity has been conducted on a dynamic test bench, testing the cooling fluid and oil dynamics of a widely known commercial engine, in fixed engine points and during the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).
A comprehensive mathematical model reproducing both the integrated circuits has been developed and validated: this required an overall engine and vehicle modeling whose input data was determined by the vehicle mission profile. By means of such model, three new technologies have been proposed and verified in terms of warm up time. They are: (a) by pass of the oil cooling, (b) oil heating using exhaust gases, and (c) a partial reduction of the oil quantity inside the sump.
All of them were applied during transients, which revealed they are able to reduce warm up time of about 65-70% with a significant benefit in terms of CO2 reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Use of properly calcined kaolinite rich clay (i.e., metakaolin) to offset part of CO2-intensive clinkers not only reduces CO2 footprint from cement industry but also improves the performance of concrete. However, calcination under inappropriately high temperatures or long retention times may deplete metakaolin into unwanted products (e.g., mullite), which limits the use of the calcines as a supplementary cementitious material. With this regard, a dynamic model of flash calcination of kaolinite rich clay particles is developed using gPROMS (general PROcess Modeling System) to predict the impacts of calcination temperature and residence time on the transformation of the clay particles and to derive a favorable production path that is able to achieve optimum amount of the desired product. Flash calcination tests of the kaolinite rich clay particles are also performed in a pilot-scale gas suspension calciner. The model is validated by the experimental data (e.g., the degree of dehydroxylation and the density of the calcines). Based on the model, the impacts of process conditions and feed properties on the quality of the calcination products are thoroughly examined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper deals with an optimum design of horizontal ground heat pump systems for spiral-coil-loop heat exchangers. A three dimensional numerical analysis model simulating the thermal behavior of a horizontal spiral-coil-loop heat exchanger was developed, and the accuracy of the model was verified through indoor thermal response tests. After that, a total of 160 parametric studies were conducted using numerical simulation models in order to grasp the degree of effects that key input parameters used in the model would have on the output. Then, an optimum design condition for horizontal ground coupled heat pump system was suggested using several economic analysis tools. Economic analysis factors, such as internal rate of return, savings to investment ratio, and simple payback period, show that certain design conditions (coil pitch: 0.08 m, setting depth: 2.5 m, circulating fluid velocity: 0.7 m s(-1)) provide the most economic feasibility. However, this condition also varies with the unit cost of operation and initial investment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Breaking the bounds of classical natural gas hydrate (NGH) production processes, a newborn concept based on the gas exchange mechanism provides an opportunity to catch two birds with one stone: simultaneously achieving the sequestration of CO2 for climate change mitigation and the enhanced recovery of CH4 for energy production. As a 'new paradigm' in NGH production schemes, the non-destructive gas exchange as one of the most stable and promising NGH recovery approaches has received much attention in the fields of physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, civil engineering, petroleum engineering and geology. In this review, we assess the state-of-the-art gas exchange concept for NGH production by understanding its principles and developments, with emphasis on another technical breakthrough using the CO2 + N-2 gas mixture injection. After establishing the fundamentals of the gas exchange process, we make a general survey of the NGH field production in the North Slope of Alaska in 2012, which practically adopted the gas exchange as a key technology. Several recent international NGH field production tests that basically use depressurization are also briefly analyzed for comparison. We suggest that the gas exchange method is ready to be tested in the NGH deposits with the valuable lessons learned from past pioneering tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) present good potential applications for the conversion of low level thermal energy into electrical power, especially applied to waste heat recovery systems. This paper presents an advanced mathematical model that uses multi-element thermoelectric components connected in series, and considers internal and external irreversibility and also the temperature gradients along the flow direction. A Fortran computation program was used for the numerical calculations. This paper focusses mainly on the thermoelectric performance study under four different types of cooling methods with temperature gradient modeling. The results showed that it is important in TEG system design to choose an optimal module area that is appropriate to the mass flow rate of the fluids, but this is not affected by the intake temperature of fluids. With the water cooling method, the coflow and counterflow methods did not need to be distinguished because of their small difference, but they should be distinguished for the air cooling method. The counterflow arrangement generally produced a small higher maximum power output, but needed a much larger module area compared to the coflow method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising technology for the conversion of a wide range of bio-feedstock into a biocrude; a mixture of chemical compounds that holds the potential for a renewable production of chemicals and fuels. Most research in hydrothermal liquefaction is performed in batch type reactors, although a continuous and energy-efficient operation is paramount for such process to be feasible. In this work an experimental campaign in a continuous bench scale unit is presented. The campaign is based on glycerol-assisted hydrothermal liquefaction of aspen wood carried out with the presence of a homogeneous catalyst at supercritical water conditions, 400 degrees C and 300 bar. Furthermore, in the experimental campaign a water phase recirculation step is incorporated to evaluate the technical feasibility of such procedure. In total, four batches of approximately 100 kg of feed each were, processed successfully at steady state conditions without any observation of system malfunctioning. The biocrude obtained was characterized using several analytical methods to evaluate the feasibility of the process and the quality of the product. Results showed that a high quality biocrude was obtained having a higher heating value of 34.3 MJ/kg. The volatile fraction of the biocrude consisted mostly of compounds having number of carbon atoms in the C-6-C-12 range similar to gasoline. In terms of process feasibility, it was revealed that total organic carbon (TOC) and ash significantly accumulated in the water phase when such is recirculated for the proceeding batch. After four batches the TOC and the ash mass fraction of the water phase were 136.2 [g/L] and 12.6 [%], respectively. Water phase recirculation showed a slight increase in the biocrude quality in terms on an effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, but it showed no effects on the product gas composition or the pH of the water phase. The successful operation demonstrated the technical feasibility of a continuous production of high quality biocrude. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Several commercial and potential adsorbents were investigated for the separation of CO2 from CH4, which is relevant for the upgrading of raw biogas. The main focus of the paper was on the working capacities and selectivities of the adsorbents for a generic vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) process. Zeolites 4A and 13X had good estimated CO2-over-CH4 selectivities and reasonably high working capacities for the removal of CO2. A variant of zeolite A - vertical bar Na12-Kx vertical bar-LTA (with 1.8 <= x <= 3.2), had at least the same working capacity as zeolite 4A but with a significantly improved selectivity. Hence, the environmentally important "CH4 slip" can be minimized with this vertical bar Na12-Kx vertical bar-LTA sorbent. If a high working capacity for CO2 removal is the most important characteristic for a VSA process, then silicoaluminum phosphate, specifically SAPO-56, appeared to be the best candidate among the studied sorbents. In addition, SAPO-56 had a substantially high estimated CO2-over-CH4 selectivity with a value between similar to 20 and 30. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Different quality, reserves and production force countries to import fossil fuels to advance their economic development. It is exergy of fossil fuels that is essentially important to economy. Thus, it forms an international exergy flow network embodied in the global fossil energy trade. Based on complex network theory, we built a global fossil energy exergy flow network with countries as nodes, the international exergy flows as edges and the exergy of each flow as the weight of the edges. We analyzed the distribution of countries, the overall structure, major countries and major exergy flow paths of the network from 1996 to 2012. The results show that even if the fossil energy trade becomes more frequent and larger, there are always a few trade relationships and countries that play critical roles in the fossil energy trade. The trade relationship intensity at the global level is relatively lower than the corresponding intensity at the regional level. There are four main fossil energy trade groups, and these groups have the Russian Federation, the United States, Japan and Saudi Arabia as their core countries. If an energy war, an energy crisis or other problems occur in the countries with more partners, their impacts are likely to spread to other countries and even affect the global fossil energy trade.

Abstract: An approach for a plan to meet the energy needs of the state of Greece in conjunction with assumed responsibilities to confront global warming is presented. Time series of climate indicators like average temperature and rain precipitation together with energy consumption and CO2 emissions are examined for stationarity and causality. Predictions of energy needs for the next 25 years and CO2 emissions are made. With these predictions, production of energy from renewable sources like wind turbines and photovoltaic panels as well as from lignite with CO2 capture and sequestration systems attached to power-generating units is formulated as an optimization problem with financial and environmental constraints.

Experiments were conducted on a laboratory laminar entrained flow reactor (LFR) using solid fuel feed rates on the order of 10-20 mg h(-1). Employing a simple single step first order (SFOR) mechanism with an Arrhenius type rate expression, the best fit of the pyrolysis kinetics was found to be: A = 18.9 X 10(3) s(-1), E-a = 21305 J mol(-1). The accuracy of the derived global kinetics was supported by comparing predictions to experimental results from a 15 kW furnace. The work emphasizes the importance of characterizing the temperature history of the biomass particles when deriving pyrolysis kinetics. The present results indicate faster kinetics than found in the literature, leading to predicted residence times required for full conversion one order of magnitude lower than when compared to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) derived kinetics.

Abstract: The activation of demand response (DR) potentials offered by electricity consumer flexibility is one promising option for providing balancing power and energy in supply systems with high share of variable renewable energy (VRE) power generation. In this paper, a model-based assessment of the economic DR potential in Germany is presented. It relies on the extension of the REMix energy system model by flexible electric loads. In a case study considering a future German power supply system with a VRE share of 70%, possible cost reductions achieved by investment in DR are quantified. The sensitivity of the results to changes in the assumed DR costs and characteristics are analyzed in additional simulations. The results show that the major benefit of employing DR is its ability to substitute peak power generation capacity, whereas the impact on the integration of VRE power generation is lower. This implies that the focus of DR is on the provision of power, not energy. Even at rather pessimistic cost DR assumptions, more than 5 GW of power plant capacity can be substituted. Consumer flexibility furthermore triggers an increase in the operation of back-up power plants, whereas it decreases the utilization of pumped storage hydro stations. In the model results, the reductions in annual power supply costs achieved by DR add up to several hundreds of millions of Euros. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Shape stabilised phase change materials (SSPCMs) based on a high density poly(ethylene)(hv-HDPE) with high (H-PW, T-m = 56-58 degrees C) and low (L-PW, T-m = 18-23 degrees C) melting point paraffin waxes were readily prepared using twin-screw extrusion. The thermo-physical properties of these materials were assessed using a combination of techniques and their suitability for latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) assessed. The melt processing temperature (160 degrees C) of the HDPE used was well below the onset of thermal decomposition of H-PW (220 degrees C), but above that for L-PW (130 degrees C), although the decomposition process extended over a range of 120 degrees C and the residence time of L-PW in the extruder was <30 s. The SSPCMs prepared had latent heats up to 89 J/g and the enthalpy values for H-PW in the respective blends decreased with increasing H-PW loading, as a consequence of co-crystallisation of H-PW and hv-HDPE. Static and dynamic mechanical analysis confirmed both waxes have a plasticisation effect on this HOPE. Irrespective of the mode of deformation (tension, flexural, compression) modulus and stress decreased with increased wax loading in the blend, but the H-PW blends were mechanically superior to those with L-PW.

Abstract: Sugar beet tails are a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production. This work discusses a new process to produce a fermentable juice of sugar beet tails using pulsed electric field (PEF) and solid-liquid expression. The impact of PEF intensity E and duration t(PEF) on the expression kinetics of solutes from sugar beet tails was investigated. The optimal PEF intensity and duration were respectively E = 450 V/cm and t(PEF) = 10 ms corresponding to an energy input Q= 1.91 W h/kg. At these PEF parameters, the yield of solutes was increased from 16.8% to 79.85% and the dryness of pressed cake was increased from 15% to 24% in comparison with the untreated tails. Moreover, the PEF expressed juice was more concentrated (10% vs. 5.2%) and had higher sucrose content (8.9 vs. 4.5 degrees S) than the juice expressed from untreated tails. Batch fermentation experiments with commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast were realized using raw juices expressed from untreated and PEF treated sugar beet tails. It was found that the higher content of fermentable sugars in PEF expressed juice leads to a higher ethanol content in distillate (6.1% vs. 2.95% v/v) and a higher CO2 weight loss (57.2 vs. 28.3 g/L) than that obtained from raw juice of untreated tissue. The obtained results are promising and open new opportunities for valorization of sugar beet by-products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As the world's largest CO2 emitter, China is a prominent case study for scenario analysis. This study uses two newly developed global top-down and bottom-up models with a regional China focus to compare China's future energy and CO2 emission pathways toward 2050. By harmonizing the economic and demographic trends as well as a carbon tax pathway, we explore how both models respond to these identical exogenous inputs. Then a soft-linking methodology is applied to "narrow the gap" between the results computed by these models. We find for example that without soft-linking, China's baseline CO2 emissions might range from 15-20 Gt in 2050, while soft-linking models results in 17 Gt. Reasons for the results gap between the models are discussed subsequently, such as model structure and statistical inputs. At a sectoral level, the gap can be mainly traced to China's future coal use in electricity production. The study finds that it is beneficial to soft-link complex global models under harmonized assumptions. Although this study fails to "close the gap" between the two models completely, the experiences and insights shared here will be beneficial for researchers and policy makers that are drawing conclusions from the results of China and global scenario studies.

Abstract: The Pilot-Scale Hydrate Simulator (PHS), a three-dimensional 117.8 L pressure vessel, is applied to study the methane hydrate dissociation below the quadruple point in the sandy sediment in this work. The hydrate dissociation behaviors below and above the quadruple point are compared. The influences of the production pressure, the initial reservoir temperature, and the water saturation on the hydrate dissociation below the quadruple point by depressurization are investigated. The results indicate that methane hydrate dissociation below the quadruple point causes ice formation, which can strongly enhance the dissociation rate of the hydrate. The water generated from hydrate dissociation below the quadruple point may immediately form ice and the pore water in the reservoir turns into ice at the same time. Meanwhile, the hydrate dissociation below the quadruple point consumes the latent heat released by ice formation. The lower production pressure causes the higher driving force for hydrate dissociation and ice formation, which results in the higher dissociation rate of the hydrate. In addition, when the production pressure is lower than the quadruple point, a lower initial reservoir temperature is favorable for ice formation, which leads to the higher hydrate dissociation rate. The experimental results from hydrate dissociation in the 'water-saturated' reservoir and 'gas-saturated' reservoir indicate that the rate of ice formation is slower in the 'water-saturated' reservoir.

Abstract: In this study, the eutectic mixtures of solid paraffin and liquid paraffin were selected as phase change materials (PCM) with the supporting material polypropylene (PP), to prepare the mixed paraffin/PP phase change materials. Furthermore, a novel triazine char forming agent (CFA) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) were introduced to prepare flame retarded PCM, which were rarely reported previously. Thermal properties of eutectic mixtures and PCM were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The results showed that flame retarded PCM had higher enthalpy (126.8 kJ/kg) and lower phase change temperature To (24.8 degrees C). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results revealed that CFA and APP could enhance the thermal stability of the mixed paraffin/PP and considerably increase the charring ability and PCM could pass a UL-94 V-0 rating when the APP/CFA loading reached 30%. The CONE data further confirmed that the peak heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), smoke produce rate (SPR) of PCM decreased obviously, indicating that the PCM had good flame retardancy.

Abstract: As various forms of renewable distributed generators (DGs) embedded in microgrids (MGs) often exhibit unstable characteristics, matching the generation to the demand whilst optimally utilizing the DGs is a non-trivial task. This paper investigates the optimal coordinated operation of multiple autonomous MGs and reveals the potential technical benefit. The proposed solution identifies the optimal network topologies and allocates the critical loads (CLs) to appropriate DGs based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm with power loss and reliability considerations. The non-critical loads (NLs) are determined to be supplied by the MGs based on the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach, which effectively improves the global utilization efficiency of DGs. Through the event-driven resource reallocation across multiple cooperative MGs, the dynamic balance between the power generation and demand can be attempted. The proposed approach is verified by using the IEEE 33-bus network model and its performance and scalability are further assessed through a large-scale IEEE 300-bus network scenario. The numerical results confirm that the suggested cooperative control of multiple MGs can effectively promote the capability of secure power supply to CLs, and simultaneously improves the global utilization efficiency of DGs significantly, even without any energy storage in the network.

Abstract: Thermoelectric power plants contribute 90% of the electricity generated in the United States. Steam condensation in the power generation cycle creates a need for cooling, often accomplished using large amounts of water. These large water requirements can lead to negative consequences of power plants dialing down or shutting down during times of low water availability. Consequently, water constraints can translate into energy constraints. Projected future population growth and changing climate conditions might also increase the competition for water in many areas, motivating a resource accounting analysis to both establish a baseline of current water requirements and simulate possible impacts from future water and energy management decisions. Our analysis of the current water demands for power generation, focused on the state of Illinois, combined existing digital spatial datasets with engineering basic principles to synthesize a geographic information systems (GIS) model of current and projected water demand for thermoelectric power plants. We evaluated two potential future cases based on water use implications: (1) a shift in fuel from coal to natural gas, and (2) a shift in cooling technology from open-loop to closed-loop cooling. Our results show that a shift from coal-generated to natural gas-generated electricity could decrease statewide water consumption by 0.10 billion m(3)/yr (32% decrease) and withdrawal by 7.9 billion m(3)/yr (37% decrease), on average. A shift from open-loop to closed-loop cooling technologies could decrease withdrawals by an average of 21 billion m(3)/yr (96% decrease), with the tradeoff of increasing statewide water consumption for power generation by 0.18 billion m(3)/yr (58% increase). Furthermore, we performed an economic analysis of retrofitting open-loop cooling systems to closed-loop cooling, revealing an annual cost between $0.58 and $1.3 billion to retrofit the 22 open-loop cooling plants considered, translating to an effective water price between $0.03 and $0.06/m(3). The synergies and tradeoffs between water resources and power generation yield interesting implications for integrated decision making and policy in Illinois and elsewhere. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Due to an expanding integration of renewable energy resources in the power systems, mismatches between electricity supply and demand will increase. A promising solution to deal with these issues is Demand Response (DR), which incentives end-users to be flexible in their electricity consumption. This paper presents a bottom up simulation model that generates office building electricity load profiles representative for Northern Europe. The model connects behavioral aspects of office workers with electricity usage from appliances, and physical representation of the building to describe the energy use of the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems. To validate the model, simulations are performed with respect to two data sets, and compared with real load measurements. The validation shows that the model can reproduce load profiles with reasonable accuracy for both data sets. With the presented model approach, it is possible to define simple portfolio office building models which subsequently can be used for simulation and analysis of DR in the power systems.

Abstract: Thermochemical heat storage is a promising technology towards efficient use of renewable energy resources. Materials based on salts and their hydrates have a high potential for a good energy storage density and the benefit of long-term storage ability. However, the process has not yet been successfully implemented due to limitations in mass and heat transfer. This paper investigates how to improve the less desil'able properties of CaCl2 and its hydrates such as low melting points, agglomeration, low cycle stability and low sorption rates. The optimization of CaCl2 properties was achieved by mixing with KCI and impregnation in carrier materials to obtain a composite material. The tests show at first that, with the admixtures of KCI, water uptake during hydration is 2 times higher than that of CaCl2. Water release during dehydration is 1.3 times higher than that of CaCl2. Secondly, the use of compacted expanded natural graphite (ENG) or activated carbon foam (ACF) increases the cycle stability, thermal conductivity and the water sorption performance. Due to their hydrophobic nature those matrices have no influence on the reaction scheme, thus the total amount of water molecules sorbed by the salt-in-matrix is close to the value of CaCl2. The degree of impregnation varies from 31 to 90 wt% depending on the host matrix and the impregnating medium used. The water vapour uptake is up to 0.61 g g(-1) and the water released ranges from 0.12 to 0.72 g g(-1). The thermal conductivity of CaCl2-in-matrixis is 3 times higher than that of sole CaCl2.

Abstract: In a medium term scenario hybrid powertrain and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) downsizing represent the actual trend in vehicle technology to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emission. Concerning downsizing concept, to maintain a reasonable power level in small engines, the application of turbocharging is mandatory both for spark ignited (SI) and compression ignited (CI) engines. Following this aspect, the possibility to couple an electric drive to the turbocharger (electric turbo compound) to recover the residual energy of the exhaust gases is becoming more and more attractive, as demonstrated by several studies around the world and by the current application in the F1 Championship.
The present paper shows the first numerical results of a research program in collaboration between the Universities of Pisa and Genoa. This first study is focused on the evaluation of the benefits resulting from the application of an ETC (Electric Turbo Compound) to a small twin-cylinder SI engine (900 cm(3)). Starting from the experimental maps of two turbines and one compressor, the complete model of a turbocharged engine was created using the AVL BOOST one-dimension code. The numerical activity then moves to the whole vehicle/powertrain modelling, considering three driving cycles and two different vehicle configurations, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ETC solution.
Results show that the adoption of ETC is not advantageous if used for a conventional turbocharger turbine, if the target is to optimize the overall efficiency in one specific operating point of the ICE, like in the case of range-extended electric vehicles. Besides, ETC can slightly improve the average overall efficiency when the ICE must provide variable power output, as in the case of conventional or hybrid vehicles. However, the major benefits coming from ETC are the boost range extension in the lowest engine rotational speed region and a possible reduction of turbo lag, which are key points in parallel-hybrid and especially in conventional vehicles.
Concerning the whole vehide/powertrain simulation, first results show that the ETC does not improve fuel economy of the smaller vehicle, especially when employed in urban cycles. The ETC is much more advantageous in the case of the larger vehicle, particularly when extra-urban roads or motorways are considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The upcoming emission legislation for sea-going vessels issued by the international marine organization requires drastic reduction in nitric oxides. A well-known approach for meeting these requirements is to reduce the in-cylinder temperature prior to combustion by using the so-called Miller cycle. However, the mere use of this technique presents the actual limits due to long ignition delay, which occurs when the compression temperature is very low. As a consequence, premixed combustion develops quickly, increasing the local temperature in the combustion chamber and favoring NOx formation. Splitting the fuel injection into a small pilot and a main injection can reduce the magnitude of the premixed combustion and the local in-cylinder temperatures. The work presented here is divided in two parts and is novel by being the first systematic study of split injection combined with Miller cycle in large-bore engines. In its first stage, an extensive study of the injection dwell with two intake valve closings and three timings of the main injection are analyzed. In the second stage, both injection events are shifted later in the power stroke with fixed injection dwell. Overall, the pilot injection reduced the ignition delay but dropped the peak of the premixed combustion only with the most advanced intake valve closing. This improved fuel economy, but provided no advantages as far as emissions are concerned. In addition, while increasing injection dwell reduced NOx emissions, it also increased fuel consumption. The highest achieved NOx reduction was close to 60%, with a small drawback in fuel economy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermoelectric radiant ceiling panel system (TE-RCP) is a novel and promising system which combines the advantages of thermoelectric cooling/heating and conventional radiant ceiling panel system. The experimental investigations and case studies of TE-RCP have been carried out. But there is short of theoretical analysis and heat transfer model to provide a basis for the deeper and further investigation about TE-RCP. By solving the governing equation of the TE-RCP and using virtual heat source method to simulate the boundary conditions, the surface temperature field of TE-RCP under constant heat source intensity can be calculated. The dynamic-state model under variable heat source intensity is developed by adopting the idea of superposition principle and step load theory. The calculated temperature on the surface of radiant panel and hot/cold side of TE modules are in agreement with the experimental values. A system coefficient of performance (COP) is proposed based on the steady state model of TE-RCP to analyze the impact of working current of TE modules on the system performance. The simulations indicate that in cooling mode the system cooling capacity ranges between 48.6 W/m(2) and 104.1 W/m(2) and the corresponding system COP ranges between 1.06 and 2.29 under the working current from 1 A to 2 A. In heating mode, the system heating capacity ranges between 165.6 W/m(2) and 343 W/m(2) and the corresponding system COP ranges between 1.51 and 1.8 under the working current from 2 A to 3 A. This proposed model can provide a solid foundation for the further design, optimization, and system control of TE-RCP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the critical contribution of the industry sector to long-term decarbonisation, efficiency and renewable energy policy targets. Its methodological novelty is the incorporation of a process-oriented modelling approach based on a comprehensive technology database for the industry sector in a national energy system model for the UK (UKTM), allowing quantification of the role of both decarbonisation of upstream energy vectors and of mitigation options in the industrial sub-categories. This enhanced model is then applied in a comparative policy scenario analysis that explores various target dimensions on emission mitigation, renewable energy and energy efficiency at both a national and European level. The results show that ambitious emission cuts in the industry sector of up to 77% until 2050 compared to 2010 can be achieved. Moreover, with a reduction in industrial energy demand of up to 31% between 2010 and 2050, the sector is essential for achieving the overall efficiency commitments. The industry sector also makes a moderate contribution to the expansion of renewable energies mostly through the use of biomass for low-temperature heating services. However, additional sub-targets on renewable sources and energy efficiency need to be assessed critically, as they can significantly distort the cost-efficiency of the long-term mitigation pathway.

Abstract: A three-dimensional CFD numerical simulation is successfully carried out on thermo-hydraulic characteristics of a new smooth wavy fin-and-elliptical tube (SWFET) heat exchanger with three new types of vortex generators (VGs), namely - rectangular trapezoidal winglet (RTW), angle rectangular winglet (ARW) and curved angle rectangular winglet (CARW). Several parameters have been examined in this study. There have a pronounced effect on the thermo-hydraulic performance. In addition the results are analyzed from the viewpoint of the field synergy principle which emphasizes that the reduction of the synergy angle between velocity and fluid temperature gradient is the principal mechanism for enhancement of heat transfer performance. These parameters include: Reynolds number (based on the hydraulic diameter, Re-Dh = 500-3000), geometric shape of VGs, attack angle of VGs (alpha(VG) = 15-75 degrees), placement of VG pairs (up- or/and downstream), tube ellipticity ratio (e = 0.65-1.0) and wavy fin height (H = 0.8-1.6 mm). The results demonstrate that with increasing Reynolds number and wavy fin height, decreasing the tube ellipticity ratio, the heat transfer performance of the SWFET heat exchanger is enhanced. The SWFET heat exchanger with the advantages of using CARW VGs and RTW VGs at smaller and larger attack angles, respectively, presents good thermo-hydraulic performance enhancement. Finally, new correlations are proposed to estimate the values of the average Nusselt number Nu, friction factor f and synergy angle theta based on the Reynolds number, attack angle of VGs, tube ellipticity ratio and wavy fin height.

Abstract: In future decarbonization scenarios, CCS with particular reference to post-combustion technologies will be an important option also for energy intensive industries. Nevertheless, today CCS systems are rarely installed due to high energy and cost penalties of current technology based on chemical scrubbing with amine solvent. Therefore, innovative solutions based on new/optimized solvents, sorbents, membranes and new process designs, are R&D priorities.
Regarding the CO2 capture through solid sorbents, a new reactor solution based on rotating fixed beds is presented in this paper. In order to design the innovative system, a suitable CFD model was developed considering also the kinetic capture process. The model was validated with experimental results obtained by the authors in previous research activities, showing a potential reduction of energy penalties respect to current technologies. In the future, the model will be used to identify the control logic of the innovative reactor in order to verify improvements in terms of sorbent exploitation and reduction of system energy consumption.

Abstract: Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) is a promising technology to reduce the specific energy consumption of a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant. In this study, it is projected that 25.6-40.7 million kW h/day of energy can be recovered globally, if the brines from SWRO are used as the draw solution and diluted to the seawater level in a PRO system. Detailed integrated SWRO-PRO processes are developed in this study with the option to form a closed-loop SWRO-PRO process that can substantially reduce the pretreatment cost of desalination. The governing mathematical models that describe both the transport phenomena on a module level and the energy flow on a system level are developed to evaluate the performances of the SWRO-PRO processes. The model aims to investigate the performance of the hollow fibers as dilution occurs and provides guidelines on hollow fiber module design and process operation. Determining the dilution factor and the corresponding operating pressure of PRO is the key to optimize the integrated process. The specific energy consumptions of three SWRO-involved processes; namely, (1) SWRO without a pressure exchanger, (2) SWRO with a pressure exchanger, and (3) SWRO with pressure exchangers and PRO are compared. The results show that the specific energy consumptions for the above three processes are 5.51, 1.79 and 1.08 kW h/(m(3) of desalinated water) for a 25% recovery SWRO plant; and 4.13, 2.27 and 1.14 kW h/(m(3) of desalinated water) for a 50% recovery SWRO plant, using either freshwater or wastewater as the feed solution in PRO.

Abstract: A scientific evaluation of the energy efficiency and CO2 emission performance of the thermal power industry could not only provide valuable information for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions but also serve as a tool to estimate the effectiveness of relevant policy reforms. Considering the opposite effects of energy conservation and carbon emission reduction on generation cost, this study respectively measures the energy and CO2 emission performance of the thermal power industries in China's 30 provincial administrative regions during the period 2005-2012 from both static and dynamic perspectives. We implement the bootstrap method for the directional distance function to correct the possible estimate bias and test the significance of productivity changes where the weak disposability of undesirable outputs is also integrated. The empirical analysis leads to the following conclusions. The bootstrapping results could provide us with much valuable information because the initial estimates might result from sampling noise rather than reveal the real variations. In addition, some differences do exist between the energy and CO2 emission performance of China's thermal power industry. Furthermore, technological progress is the main driving force for energy and CO2 emission productivity improvement and it works better for the former. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of daylight in buildings to save energy while providing satisfactory environmental comfort has increased. Integration of the daylighting and thermal energy systems is necessary for environmental comfort and energy efficiency. In this study, an integrated meta-model for a daylighting, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (IDHVAC) system was developed to predict building energy performance by artificial lighting regression models and artificial neural network (ANN) models, with a database that was generated using the EnergyPlus model. The design of experiments (DOE) method was applied to generate the database that was used to train robust ANN models without overfitting problems. The IDHVAC system was optimized using the integrated meta-model and genetic algorithm (GA), to minimize total energy consumption while satisfying both thermal and visual comfort for occupants. During three months in the winter, the GA-optimized IDHVAC model showed, on average, 13.7% energy savings against the conventional model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The smart grid paradigm implies flexible demand and energy storage in order to cope with the variability of renewable energy sources. Buildings are often put forward as a potential supplier of flexibility services through demand side management (DSM) and distributed energy storage, partly as thermal energy. This paper presents a bottom-up approach for the quantification of this flexibility service. Cost curves are computed from the solution of optimal control problems with low-order models. These curves show the amount of flexibility and their associated cost. The method is generic and can be applied to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) services, thermal energy storage (TES) and local electricity production. A case study is performed on a monitored office building in Brussels, Belgium. The results reveal a large variation in both flexibility and cost depending on time, weather, utility rates, building use and comfort requirements. The study shows that for the studied day, flexibility is not for free. The mean flexibility cost has the same order of magnitude as the imbalance price in the Belgian power system.

Abstract: The liberalization of the European energy markets combined with the rapid spread of unpredictable renewable energy sources have stressed the need of improving the traditional power units flexibility. Fast start-ups/shut downs and rapid load variations have become priority objectives because they guarantee high profits in the short term but cause a lifetime reduction due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion. To this purpose, in the present work, an innovative procedure, able to predict the power plant dynamic behaviour during load variations, identify the most stressed components and estimate their lifetime reduction is presented and tested. Being combined cycles the most efficient, flexible and widespread technologies, the selected test case is a 380 MW combined cycle unit. To predict the plant dynamic performance a dynamic model has been built in Modelica language and several transient conditions investigated. The high pressure steam drum and superheater are the most stressed components. Results show a 52.9% reduction in superheater collectors life if the load variation is 50% faster than the reference case. On the contrary, a 35.8% lifetime increase is observed if the load variation is 50% slower. For the same conditions the high pressure steam drum life is reduced by 31.9% and increased by 16.3%, respectively. Also the superheater tube bank lifetime reduction is computed. The proposed procedure can be considered a valuable innovative tool to assist power plant designers and operators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid between a tubular solar receiver and a combustor, called the Hybrid Solar Receiver Combustor (HSRC), and reports on the development and application of an analytical model to describe its performance. The analytical model accounts for the variability of the solar resource with a pseudo steady state balance of the mass and energy flow, which calculates the heat transfer throughout the device. A systematic investigation of the influence of variation in all controlling parameters on performance and weight is undertaken. The results provide new understanding of the performance of the device relative to the solar-only and combustion-only counterparts, and further justification for its ongoing development.

Abstract: This paper deals with the electricity generation capacity expansion problem to minimize cost and water withdrawal. Each solution prescribes locations and technologies for new power plants, and their designed capacities. A two-stage methodology is proposed to aid decision making by identifying the few alternatives from the many efficient solutions that are robust to uncertainties. The first stage finds solutions that are efficient in view of cost and water withdrawal objectives. The second stage finds the subset of first-stage solutions that are robust when the designed capacities of power plants are subjected to uncertainties at the time of their construction. The methodology is applied in a case study for the electrical grid in Texas, USA. The trade-off among technologies and locations, and the effect of uncertainty are considered to answer strategic questions for expansion planning. Experimental results suggest that the methodology prescribes locations, capacities and type of technologies for new power plants in Texas that tend to maintain their prescribed values of cost and water withdrawal when facing unforeseen implementation conditions, while satisfying the required generation capacity.

Abstract: In this work, a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion was developed using liquid water, mineral oil, Sorbitan monooleate (Span 80), and cyclopentane. It was employed to enhance gas hydrate formation for CH4 separation from a simulated coal mine methane (CMM) gas (30 mol% CH4, 60 mol% N-2, and 10 mol% O-2). The stability test at atmospheric pressure and at a high pressure of 3.5 MPa showed that stable W/O emulsions were obtained when the water-oil volume ratio (WOR) was below 80%. The emulsified droplets size was measured with WOR ranging from 10% to 70%. Then kinetic experiments of CH4 separation by hydrate formation in W/O emulsions were carried out at 273.6 K and (3.5-5.0) MPa in batch operation. The results indicated that water-oil volume ratio is a key factor that affects the kinetics of gas hydrate formation from the CMM gas mixture. Hydrate nucleation was observed to occur faster while WOR was decreased, and gas uptake increased significantly with the decrease of WOR CH4 concentration in the recovered gas mixture was increased to 52 mol% as compared to 30 mol% in the original gas mixture through one-stage hydrate formation in the W/O emulsions. It was found that the experimental conditions of 273.6 K, 3.5 MPa and WOR = 30% were favorable for CH4 recovery from the CMM gas. The CH4 recovery obtained under these conditions was 43%. It was higher than those obtained at WOR = 10% and 70%, and was greatly increased as compared with those obtained in the same reactor with the presence of TBAB (26%) and CP (33%).

Abstract: Russia is frequently referred to as a country with substantial energy efficiency and renewable energy potential. In 2000-2008 energy-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios were improved by 35%, however, the contribution of technological progress accounts for only 1% of the energy-GDP ratio reduction. At the same time, although new policy mechanisms to stimulate renewable energy development have been recently introduced, renewable technology deployment has not yet taken off. Economic theory suggests that there is no better incentive for industry development than cost signals. This paper adapts the leve-Used cost of energy methodology to examine the cost structures associated with electricity generation by conventional and new technology types for a Russian region (Moscow). The model, run for two fuel price scenarios, allowed us to conclude that the regional energy supply system is heavily dependent on the natural gas price and that the diversification provided by technology development will be beneficial for the energy security of the region. We conclude that new and renewable technologies become cost-effective for electricity generation as domestic natural gas prices reach parity with export prices. However, strong political and financial support is needed to boost technological development and renewables application in Russia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper we propose novel and more realistic analytical models for the determination of the peak demand under four power demand control scenarios. Each scenario considers a finite number of appliances installed in a residential area, with diverse power demands and different arrival rates of power requests. We develop recursive formulas for the efficient calculation of the peak demand under each scenario, which take into account the finite population of the appliances. Moreover, we associate each scenario with a proper real-time pricing process in order to derive the social welfare. The proposed analysis is validated through simulations. Moreover, the performance evaluation of the proposed formulas reveals that the absence of the assumption of finite number of appliances could lead to serious peak-demand over-estimations.

Abstract: Among the elements of a typical building envelope, windows are responsible for the greatest energy loss due to their high U-value. Conventional windows tend to have poor glazing properties, which causes significant heat loss during the winter season and undesirable heat gain during the summer season. Advanced window technologies are therefore required to mitigate the energy consumption of buildings. The key hypothesis in this study is that advanced windows become economically viable for end-users if the difference in life-cycle cost between advanced window types and the state-of-the-art (reference) window is equal to zero. To verify this hypothesis, we calculate the allowable additional investment costs (dIC) for three types of advanced windows over a given life span. Different advanced windows; electrochromic, PV and vacuum windows together with a self-cleaning feature were compared with a state-of-the-art window with excellent properties (reference window) in terms of energy performance and life-cycle cost for a conceptual residential house (i.e. townhouse) in Finland. By performing a whole-building simulation using IDA ICE, the impact of these windows on the total delivered energy needs of the townhouse were estimated. Among the alternatives, the vacuum window (lowest U-value) offers the highest dIC value, due to its maximum energy savings. With a generic efficiency of 6%, the PV window holds the intermediate position between the vacuum and reference window in terms of dIC value. Hypothetically, with a U-value of 0.6 W/m(2) K, the PV window would become the most energy efficient window alternative. The self-cleaning feature proved to be a dominant factor toward the increase of dIC value by avoiding maintenance costs. Electrochromic glazing is not economically feasible due to its negative dIC value as it doesn't offer life cycle cost savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes the use of state space models to generate scenarios for the analysis of wind power plant (WPP) generation capabilities. The proposal is rooted on the advantages that state space models present for dealing with stochastic processes; mainly their structural definition and the use of Kalman filter to naturally tackle some involved operations. The specification proposed in this paper comprises a structured representation of individual Box-Jenkins models, with indications about further improvements that can be easily performed. These marginal models are combined to form a joint model in which the dependence structure is easily handled. Indications about the procedure to calibrate and check the model, as well as a validation of its statistical appropriateness, are provided.
Application of the proposed state space models provides insight on the need to properly specify the structural dependence between wind speeds. In this paper the joint and marginal models are smoothly integrated into a backward-forward sweep algorithm to determine the performance indicators (voltages and powers) of a WPP through simulation. As a result, visibly heavy tails emerge in the generated power probability distribution through the use of the joint model-incorporating a detailed description of the dependence structure-in contrast with the normally distributed power yielded by the margin-based model.

Abstract: Natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and has been identified as a strong candidate for energy resource compared to oil and coal. Natural gas hydrate is an energy resource for methane that has a carbon quantity twice more than all fossil fuels combined and is distributed evenly around the world. Several field trials on energy production from hydrate resources have been conducted, and their outcomes revealed the possibility of energy production from hydrate resources. In this paper, we review various studies on resource potential of natural gas hydrate, the current research progress in laboratory settings, and several recent field trials. Possible limitation in each production method and the challenges to be addressed for large scale production are discussed in detail. Whilst there are no technology stoppers to exploit or produce methane from hydrates, specific technological breakthroughs will depend on the effective management of the sand and water during production, as well as the appropriate mitigation of environmental risks.

Abstract: Lithium combustion has been studied for several decades, with a primary focus on safety issues, such as lithium fires resulting from spills in nuclear reactors. Several studies have also considered the use of lithium as a fuel within propellants, or within propulsion systems that burn lithium in the atmospheric "air" of other planets. Lithium safety has typically been investigated through combustion of molten pieces of lithium or within pool fires. For propulsion applications, experiments were carried out using packed beds of lithium particles.
A novel approach that has recently been proposed is the use of lithium as a recyclable fuel, or energy carrier that can compactly store renewable energy. In this scheme, lithium is burned with air, or power-plant exhaust, to generate heat for thermal power systems when power is needed. The solid-phase combustion products would be collected and recycled, via electrolysis, back into elemental lithium when excess renewable power is available.
This paper summarizes the existing knowledge on lithium combustion. It presents the available findings on lithium combustion for large single pieces of lithium, on pool fires, reaction in packed beds, as well as the combustion of sub-mm sized particles and droplets which are needed for the use of lithium as an energy carrier. The combustion reactions of lithium with O-2, H2O, CO2 and N-2 are discussed. Modelling of lithium-particle combustion is at the early stages of development and available results are discussed.

Abstract: Natural convection is one of the major factors that affect phase transition processes of solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs). To optimize PCM-based latent thermal energy storage systems (TESS), a better understanding of the heat transfer interactions during these transitions is needed. In this paper the heat transfer rate enhancement caused by natural convection of PCMs undergoing melting is quantified based on experimental observations. For this, a heat transfer enhancement factor and an effective heat transfer coefficient were developed. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were run to measure latent heats of fusion and phase transition temperatures of the PCMs. It was found that the experimentally-obtained temperature ranges required for complete melting exceeded those produced by the DSC tests. The reason for this stemmed from the natural convection of the molten PCM. The effective heat transfer coefficients when natural convection was accounted for were greater than when only heat conduction was considered. The increases in effective heat transfer coefficient were 12% and 30% percent for vertical and horizontal heat transfer paths, respectively. The existence of natural convection reduced the time required for complete melting by approximately 45% for vertical heat transfer. However, the melting process time was longer than the solidification process under the same conditions for a horizontal heat transfer path. The reason for this was attributed to the widening of the temperature range required for melting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An interval type-2 fuzzy fractional programming (IT2FFP) method is developed for planning the renewable energy in electric power system for supporting sustainable development under uncertainty. IT2FFP can tackle output/input ratio problems where complex uncertainties are expressed as type-2 fuzzy intervals (T2FI) with uncertain membership functions. The IT2FFP method is then applied to planning Beijing electric power system, where issues of renewable energy utilization, electricity supply security, and pollutant/greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation are incorporated within the modeling formulation. The obtained results suggest that the coal-fired power would continue to decrease and the share of renewable energy in gross electricity supply would maintain an increasing trend. Results also reveal that imported electricity plays a significant role in the city's energy supply. A number of decision alternatives are also analyzed based on the interval solutions as well as the projected applicable conditions, which represent multiple options with sustainable and economic considerations. The optimal alternative that can give rise to the desirable sustainable option under the maximization of the share of renewable power generation has been suggested. The findings can help decision makers identify desired alternatives for managing such a mixed energy system in association with sustainable development. Compared with the conventional optimization methods that optimize single criterion, it is proved that IT2FFP is advantageous in balancing conflicting objectives and reflecting complicated relationships among multiple system factors as well as in tackling various subjective judgments of decision makers with different interests and preferences.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are capable to absorb massive heat during a phase transition in a narrow temperature range, which have great potential to be incorporated into building envelopes to prevent heat penetration into buildings and reduce cooling loads. The efficiency and selection of PCMs, however, are highly subject to the climate where they are applied. This study focused on the energy performance of building envelopes integrated with PCMs for cooling load reduction in tropical climate through numerical simulations. Studies were carried out to reveal the efficacy and factors that govern the performance of the PCM addition for cooling load reduction in Singapore. The results showed that PCM can effectively reduce heat gains through building envelopes throughout the whole year, indicating the significant advantage of the use of PCMs in tropics over other regions where PCMs are only effective in certain seasons. The selection of PCM with suitable phase change temperature is critical. PCMs applied to the exterior surfaces of walls showed better performance and the optimum phase change temperature is the lowest temperature allowing the full melting-solidification cycle of the entire PCM layer. A larger phase change temperature range improves the adaptivity of the PCMs to temperature variations, but may compromise the largest energy savings that the PCMs can achieve. While thicker PCM layer reduces heat gains through building envelope, thinner PCM layer shows higher efficiency and cost benefits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the development of the non-Emissions Trading Scheme for the district heating systems. To select indicators characterizing overall operation of the non-Emissions Trading Scheme district heating system, the article analyses various aspects (type of fuel, temperature regime, level of building energy efficiency) that impact the development of a district heating system model, which strives to reach 4th generation district heating system and to reduces greenhouse emission gases. To determine efficiency rating of the district heating system, a multi-criteria model is developed using selected indicators. The most suitable temperature regime of district heating systems is analyzed for a new buildings and exiting dwelling area depending on end-user heat energy consumption. Research methodology includes algorithm with several modules. The multi-criteria analysis evaluates different district heating systems and identifies optimal solution of 12 scenarios taking into account different criteria. The TOPSIS tool is integrated to find the optimal solutions.
Results of the multi-criteria analysis confirm that scenario that is the closest to the ideal solution from the point of view of district heating company, sharply differs from the best scenario of the developers. From the point of view of district heating company the optimal solution is the lowest temperature regime 60/30 and wood chips as energy source. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We already know, for energy-saving potential, the necessary architectural features in well-designed buildings: high performance building envelope, sufficient interior thermal mass, and hydronic-network activated radiant surfaces for cooling and heating. Buildings with these features may be referred to as architecturally homeostatic buildings (AHBs); such a building-system is thermally semi-autonomous in the sense that its temperature variation stays within a certain range even without conditioning equipment, and, with conditioning equipment in operation, its thermal regulation is handled by its hydronic heat-distribution-network for controlling the temperature level of the building. At the present time conventional HVAC equipment is used for maintaining the heat-distribution-network: this arrangement, however, has resulted in great energy saving only for AHBs with accessible natural water bodies. In operation of general AHBs, a case is made here for a new kind of mechanical equipment having the attribute of mechanical homeostasis (MH). MH is a new energy transformation concept in a triadic framework. Superlative energy efficiency is predicted as a result of combined improvements in higher triadCOPs and lower total (inducted + removed) heat rates evincing existence of synergy in architectural and mechanical homeostasis, which together will be referred to as the homeostasis solution.

Abstract: The study on immobilized titania (TiO2) nanoparticles semiconductor on stainless steel mesh for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and CH4 has been investigated. Properties of commercial and calcinated photocatalysts on mesh surface were characterized using UV-vis spectra, BET, FESEM and XRD. The photoreduction products were identified with FTIR and GC. The process conditions was optimized using experimental design and process optimization tools to determine the maximum desired response via Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in conjunction with central composite rotatable design (CCRD). The experimental parameters were stainless steel mesh size, amount of titania nanoparticles, calcination temperature, UV light power and initial ratios of CO2:CH4:N-2 in feed. Calcination of coated titania nanoparticles increased the absorption of UV-vis light while uniform photocatalyst structure commensurate with decreasing agglomeration. The optimal conditions for maximum CO2 conversion of 37.9% were determined as stainless steel mesh size of 140, coated titania nanoparticles on mesh of 4 g, calcination temperature of 600 degrees C, UV light power of 250 W and 10% of CO2 in feed. Correspondingly, the selectivity of products were 4.7%, 43%, 3.9%, 41.4% and 45.7% for ethane, acetic acid, formic acid, methyl acetate and methyl formate, respectively. The kinetic model, based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood, incorporated photocatalytic adsorptive reduction and oxidation reactions over the catalyst surface, and fitted-well with the experimental data.

Abstract: In this paper, lift-off length has been measured via both broadband luminosity and OH chemiluminescence. In addition, ignition delay has also been measured via broadband chemiluminescence and Schlieren imaging. A 3 orifice injector from the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) set, referred to as Spray B, and a single component fuel (n-dodecane) was used. Experiments were carried out in a constant flow and pressure facility, that allowed to reproduce engine-like thermodynamic conditions, and enabled the study to be performed over a wide range of test conditions with a very high repetition rate. Data obtained was also compared with results from a single orifice injector also from the Engine Combustion Network, with analog orifice characteristics (90 mu m outlet diameter and convergent shape) and technology as the injector used. Results showed that there is good correlation between the ignition delay measured through both methodologies, that oxygen concentration and injection pressure plays a minor role in the ignition delay, being ambient temperature and density the parameters with the highest influence. Lift-off length measurements showed significant differences between methodologies. Minor deviation was observed between injectors with different nozzle geometry (seat inclination angle), due to temperature variations along the chamber, highlighting the importance of temperature distribution along combustion vessels. Empirical correlations for lift-off and ignition delay were calculated, underlining the effect of the conditions on the parameters studied. Coefficients of the correlations were compared with results for the single orifice injector, this showed that variations of test conditions have the same impact on ignition delay and lift-off length regardless the nozzle orifice configuration.

Abstract: Low-enthalpy geothermal heat can be efficiently utilized for feedwater preheating in coal-fired power plants by replacing some of the high-grade steam that can then be used to generate more power. This study analyzes a hybrid geothermal-fossil power generation system including a supercritical 1000 MW power unit and a geothermal feedwater preheating system. This study models for parallel and serial geothermal preheating schemes and analyzes the thermodynamic performance of the hybrid geothermal-fossil power generation system for various geothermal resource temperatures. The models are used to analyze the effects of the temperature matching between the geothermal water and the feedwater, the heat losses and pumping power during the geothermal water transport and the resource distance and temperature on the power increase to improve the power generation. The serial geothermal preheating (SGP) scheme generally generates more additional power than the parallel geothermal preheating (PGP) scheme for geothermal resource temperatures of 100-130 degrees C, but the SGP scheme generates slightly less additional power than the PGP scheme when the feedwater is preheated to as high a temperature as possible before entering the deaerator for geothermal resource temperatures higher than 140 degrees C. The additional power decreases as the geothermal source distance increases since the pipeline pumping power increases and the geothermal water temperature decreases due to heat losses. More than 50% of the power decrease is due to geothermal water temperature decreases along the pipeline since less higher pressure extracted steam is replaced by the geothermal water. For geothermal resource temperatures of 140-160 degrees C, the additional power generated by the hybrid geothermal-coal power generation system is about 90% (at a geothermal source distance of 0 km) or 39-49% (at a distance of 20 km) greater than the power generated by an optimized organic Rankine cycle system using isopentane (R601a), the hybrid power generation system has little benefit over the ORC system when the distance increases to 40 km. However, the additional power generated by the hybrid power generation system is less than the power generated by the ORC system at distances over 20 km for geothermal resource temperatures of 100 degrees C.

Abstract: This study assesses the economic impacts and environmental co-benefits of large-scale development of renewable energy (RE) in China toward 2050 using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with distinguished improvements in the power sector. Two scenarios are constructed: a reference scenario assuming conventional development of RE and an REmax scenario assuming large-scale RE development by tapping China's RE potential. The results show that large-scale RE development would not incur a significant macroeconomic cost. On the contrary, it would have significant green growth effects that benefit the growth of upstream industries, reshape the energy structure, and bring substantial environmental co-benefits. If the share of RE reaches 56% in the total primary energy in 2050, then non-fossil power sectors will become a mainstay industry with value added accounting for 3.4% of the GDP, a share comparable to other sectors such as agriculture (2.5%), iron and steel (3.3%), and construction (2.1%). In RE max scenario, the large scale RE development will stimulate the output worth of $1.18 trillion from other RE related upstream industries and create 4.12 million jobs in 2050. In addition to economic benefits, it could substantially reduce the emissions of CO2 and air pollutants such as NOx, SO2. 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study develops thermofluidic pump technology that is powered by heat, rather than by electrical or mechanical power. The objective is to improve the performance of heat-recovery by Organic Rankine Cycles, by using a recently-proposed thermofluidic pump. The thermofluidic pump promises low-cost, high-reliability, and, since it does not consume any of the power produced by the expander, improved return on investment. No performance data for the new thermofluidic pump have been reported previously, therefore a thermodynamic model is derived and used to evaluate performance metrics that characterise pump operation and its impact on the overall cycle efficiency. Improved pump configurations are then developed and analysed. A two-stage pump configuration is presented that enhances the thermal efficiency of the cycle. An economiser is also proposed in order to obtain boiler efficiencies similar to those for mechanical feed pumps. It has been shown that the cycle efficiency with the two-stage pump is maximum when there is no net heat input in the intermediate evaporator. The resulting thermal efficiency exceeds the best-possible efficiency that could be obtained by using an ideal mechanical pump. The relative improvement in cycle efficiency achieved with the two-stage thermofluidic pump is greatest for low-temperature cycles operating below 100 degrees C, for which the back work ratio is usually higher and the efficiencies of electro-mechanical feed pumps are poorer - yielding a relative increase of the cycle efficiency by up to 30%.

Abstract: The newly designed Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) concept operating with high octane fuels like gasoline has confirmed the possibility to combine low NOx and soot emissions keeping high indicated efficiencies, while offering a control over combustion profile and phasing through the injection settings. The potential of this PPC concept regarding pollutant control was experimentally evaluated using a commercial gasoline with Research Octane Number (RON) of 95 in a newly-designed 2-Stroke poppet valves Compression Ignition (Cl) engine for automotive applications. Previous experimental results confirmed how the wide control of the cylinder gas temperature provided by the air management settings brings the possibility to achieve stable gasoline PPC combustion at low and medium speed conditions (1250-2000 rpm) for the whole load range (3.1-10.4 bar IMEP) with good combustion stability (Coefficient of Variation (Coy) of IMEP below 3%), high combustiOn efficiency (over 97%), and low NOx/soot levels.
In this context, present research focuses on the two main specific drawbacks of this concept. Firstly, the high Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) due to the work required by the mechanical supercharger since the turbocharging system does not provide the suitable pressure ratio at low speeds. Secondly, the high level of noise generated by the combustion process, especially at high loads. Therefore, a dedicated analysis has been carried out to fully exploit the benefits of the gasoline PPC concept combined with the innovative 2-Stroke engine architecture with the aim of identify and break the most relevant trade-offs.

Abstract: The piston motion of a free-piston diesel linear generator (FPDLG) is different from the traditional reciprocating engine (TRE). Here we focused on a numerical simulation for the research on the combustion process of an FPDLG by adopting coupled models of zero-dimensional dynamics and multidimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Piston dynamics model and CFD model to simulate the combustion process were set up based on the calculated results of free-piston motion, which were validated with tested data from a running FPDLG prototype. According to the coupled parameters of these two models, we studied the exothermic properties of the FPDLG during the combustion process through iterative computation, and compared the simulation results of a TRE to a FPDLG with comparable and similar structural parameters. The results' indicated that, combustion in the FPDLG lasted for a longer time compared with that in the TRE. While the heat release before top dead center (TDC), the isochoric heat release, and the heat release during the rapid combustion period were low, the post-combustion became more intense. Furthermore, the average temperature in the cylinder was generally lower, while became higher in the end of expansion stroke. In addition, the maximum combustion pressure was lower and lasted for a shorter time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An increasing concern on wind energy integration is the influence of associated uncertainty on the operation of electricity market. More specifically, correlated time-varying wind power production and electric load may change outcomes of the market operation. To this end, this paper develops a statistical simulation which allows to identify short-term impact of the correlation between the wind power production and the electric load on outcomes of the market operation. The correlation is captured from real-world data of the New England electricity market. A scenario generation technique is proposed to generate correlated scenarios of the wind power production and the electric load. The correlated scenarios are used as input data for simulating a fully competitive day-ahead market. Results show that we underestimate/overestimate the variability of daily operation cost by ignoring negative/positive correlation throughout day. Moreover, limited capacity of transmission lines can intensify underestimation and overestimation errors resulted from ignoring this correlation. These errors may mislead the policy makers about the market risks associated with operation and investment decisions of wind power, specially in the case with limited capacity of transmission lines.

Abstract: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a large-scale circulation pattern driving climate variability in north-western Europe. In recent years there has been an increasing deployment of wind-powered generation technology, i.e. wind farms, on electricity networks across Europe. As this deployment increases it is important to understand how climate variability will affect both wind-powered and non-renewable power generation. This study extends the literature by assessing the impact of NAO, via wind-power generation, on carbon dioxide emissions from the wider electricity system. A Monte Carlo approach is used to model NAO phases, generate hourly wind speed time-series data, electricity demand and fuel input data. A unit commitment, least-cost economic dispatch model is used to simulate an entire electricity system, modelled on the all-island Irish electricity system. Our results confirm that the NAO has a significant impact on monthly mean wind speeds, wind power output, and carbon dioxide emissions from the entire electricity system. The impact of NAO on emissions obviously depends on the level of wind penetration within an electricity system but our results indicate that emissions intensity within the Irish electricity system could vary by as much as 10% depending on the NAO phase within the next few years.

Abstract: Planned Communities (PCs) present a unique opportunity for deployment of intelligent control of demand-side distributed energy resources (DER) and storage, which may be organized in Microgrids (MGs). MGs require balancing for maintaining safe and resilient operation. This paper discusses the implications of using MG concepts for planning and control of energy systems within PCs. A novel tool is presented, based on decision trees (DTs), with two potential applications: (i) planning of energy storage systems within such MGs and (ii) controlling energy resources for energy balancing within a PC MG. The energy storage planning and energy balancing methodology is validated through sensitivity case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness. A test implementation is presented, utilizing distributed controller hardware to execute the energy balancing algorithm in real-time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy targeting and optimal utility placement are among the key steps in the cost-effective design of a process utility system. Composite Curves (CCs) and Grand Composite Curves (GCCs) are the popular Pinch Analysis tools for multiple utility targeting and placement. Although the CCs and GCCs can provide useful insights and yield acceptable utility targets, they could not be used to design a heat recovery network and to perform heat allocation involving the process and utility system. The Stream Temperature versus Enthalpy Plot (STEP) that was introduced in 2010 has the ability to overcome these limitations. Apart from giving the pinch points and energy targets, STEP can also graphically represent the maximum heat allocation (MHA) that can be converted into a maximum energy recovery (MER) network on a temperature versus enthalpy diagram. STEP has also been used for targeting closed-loop utilities having fixed supply and return temperatures that include steam, hot oil, refrigerants and cooling water circuits. However, the available STEP technique is unable to handle cases involving the "once-through" utility such as flue gas where the target temperature and flowrate needs to be simultaneously optimised in order to minimise fuel consumption. This paper presents a new approach to further extend STEP's capability for the simultaneous energy targeting, optimal placement of process utility systems that include flue gas streams with variable-temperatures and flowrates, and design of heat recovery networks featuring such targeted utilities.

Abstract: We develop a sequential approach to link 4 bottom-up energy sector model to a detailed dynamic general equilibrium model of South Africa. The approach is designed to simultaneously address the shortcomings and maintain the attractive features of detailed energy sector and general equilibrium models. It also reflects common country-level energy planning processes. We illustrate the capabilities of this integrated bottom-up approach by analyzing the implications of (i) a carbon tax, (ii) liberalization of import supply restrictions in order to exploit regional hydropower potential, and (iii) a combined policy where both carbon taxes and import liberalization are pursued. For the combined scenario, our results suggest substantial emissions reductions relative to Baseline at essentially no cost to economic growth but about a one percent reduction in employment. We conclude that a regional energy strategy, anchored in hydropower, represents a potentially inexpensive approach to decarbonizing the South African economy. The strategy also has political economy attractions in that the combined approach reduces the burden of adjustment of politically sensitive sectors. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In earlier work (Herrando et al., 2014), a system model based on a PVT collector with water as the cooling medium (PVT/w) was used to estimate average year-long system performance. The results showed that for low solar irradiance levels and low ambient temperatures, such as those associated with the UK climate, a higher coverage of total household energy demands and higher CO2 emission savings can be achieved by the complete coverage of the solar collector with PV and a relatively low collector cooling flow-rate. Such a PVT/w system demonstrated an annual electricity generation of 2.3 MW h, or a 51% coverage of the household's electrical demand (compared to an equivalent PV-only value of 49%), plus a significant annual water heating potential of to 1.0 MW h, or a 36% coverage of the hot-water demand. In addition, this system allowed for a reduction in CO2 emissions amounting to 16.0 tonnes over a life-time of 20 years due to the reduction in electrical power drawn from the grid and gas taken from the mains for water heating, and a 14-tonne corresponding displacement of primary fossil-fuel consumption. Both the emissions and fossil-fuel consumption reductions are significantly larger (by 36% and 18%, respectively) than those achieved by an equivalent PV-only system with the same peak rating/installed capacity. The present paper proceeds further, by considering the economic aspects of PVT technology, based on which invaluable policy-related conclusions can be drawn concerning the incentives that would need to be in place to accelerate the widespread uptake of such systems. It is found that, with an electricity-only Feed-In Tariff (FIT) support rate at 43.3 p/kW h over 20 years, the system cost estimates of optimised PVT/w systems have an 11.2-year discounted payback period (PV-only: 6.8 years). The role and impact of heat-based incentives is also studied. The implementation of a domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) at a rate of 8.5 p/kW h in quarterly payments leads to a payback reduction of about I year. If this incentive is given as a one-off voucher at the beginning of the system's lifetime, the payback is reduced by about 2 years. With a RHI rate of 20 p/kW h (about half of the FIT rate) PVT technology would have approximately the same payback as PV. It is concluded that, if primary energy (currently dominated by fossil fuels) and CO2 emission minimisation are important goals of national energy policy, PVT systems offer a significantly improved proposition over equivalent PV-only systems, but at an elevated cost. This is in need of careful reflection when developing relevant policy and considering technology incentivation. Currently, although heat outweighs electricity consumption by a factor of about 4 (by energy unit) in the UK domestic sector, the support landscape has strongly favoured electrical microgeneration, being inclined in favour of PV technology, which has been experiencing a well-documented exponential growth over recent decades.

Abstract: An innovative solid-gas thermochemical multilevel sorption thermal battery is developed for cascaded solar thermal energy storage to enhance the versatility and working reliability of solar heat storage system by widening the working temperature range. Solar thermal energy can be stored in the form of bond energy of sorption potential at different cascaded temperatures resulting from solid-gas thermochemical multilevel sorption processes. The operating principle and working performance of the thermochemical multilevel sorption thermal battery for energy storage is described and analyzed. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the proposed thermochemical multilevel sorption thermal battery has the potential capacity for meeting the challenge of solar heat storage during the random variation of low and high solar insolation with time by using cascaded thermal energy storage technology. An energy density higher than 1200 kJ/kg of reactant can be attained from the advanced energy storage system. The promising method can enhance the versatility and working reliability of solar heat storage due to its distinct advantages of high energy density and a wide range of solar collection temperature when compared with conventional heat storage methods. It has potential applications for energy management of renewable energy utilization and waste heat recovery in large-scale industrial processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction in China is attracting increasing attention worldwide. At present, China is in the phase of rapid urbanization and industrialization, which is characterized by rapid growth of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. China's steel industry is highly energy-consuming and pollution-intensive. Between 1980 and 2013, the carbon dioxide emissions in China's steel industry increased approximately 11 times, with an average annual growth rate of 8%. Identifying the drivers of carbon dioxide emissions in the iron and steel industry is vital for developing effective environmental policies. This study uses Vector Autoregressive model to analyze the influencing factors of the changes in carbon dioxide emissions in the industry. The results show that energy efficiency plays a dominant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Urbanization also has significant effect on CO2 emissions because of mass urban infrastructure and real estate construction. Economic growth has more impact on emission reduction than industrialization due to the massive fixed asset investment and industrial energy optimization. These findings are important for the relevant authorities in China in developing appropriate energy policy and planning for the iron and steel industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There is a need to explore alternative energy sources to meet the future energy demand in a sustainable way. Algae could be a potential feed stock for biodiesel and other co-products such as animal feed and chemicals. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of such production system has to be assessed before any implementation at commercial scale. In this context, a prospective LCA of algae biorefinery considering selected multi-products (biodiesel, protein and succinic acid) was carried out to estimate the environmental impact compared to a reference system. LCA results revealed less CO2 emissions and land use for biodiesel, protein and succinic acid production system compared to that of only biodiesel and protein production system from algae. The impact reduction was even more when compared with conventional diesel, soy protein and fossil based succinic acid system. A higher carbohydrate composition in algae favors less CO2 emissions and fossil fuel consumption in the algae system compared to that of the reference system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: An improved rate-based model of the typical CO2 capture process by aqueous MonoEthanolAmine (MEA) solution is built within Aspen Plus V8.0 software in this study. The improved model is built on the basis of an example model coming along with Aspen Plus V8.0, and thermodynamic model of ENRTL-RK is adopted. Improvements include the washing section of the absorption column is strictly modelled by a separate column, and the error on mass balance of MEA is greatly reduced. The new model is validated by the recently published pilot-scale experimental results of the absorption of CO2 by MEA solution, in which both absorption and desorption columns are equipped with the structured packing Sulzer Mellapak 250.Y (TM). It predicts the experimental profiles of the temperature and the concentration of CO2 in the liquid phase with an accuracy of 4%, and obviously much better than recently reported model with an accuracy of 8%. Important insights have been obtained on the function of washing sections on the top of both absorber and desorption column, the factors to determine the flowrates of make-up water and recycle water around the washing section of the absorber are first analyzed.

Abstract: A novel application of powders relies on their use as heat transfer medium for heat capture, conveying and storage. The use of powders as heat transfer fluid in concentrated solar systems is discussed with respect to current technologies. The specific application reported upon is the use of powder loops in Solar Power Tower plants. In the proposed receiver technology, SiC powder is conveyed as a dense particle suspension through a multi-tube solar receiver in a bubbling fluidization mode, the upwards flow being established by pressurizing the powder feed. Tests were conducted with a single-tube receiver unit at the 1 MW solar furnace of CNRS (Odeillo Font-Romeu, F). The measured wall-to-suspension heat transfer coefficient is a function of operating temperature, applied air velocity and imposed solid circulation flux: values increased with increasing solids flux from similar to 430 to 1120 W/m(2) K. Empirical approaches and a heat transfer model were applied to compare experimental and predicted values of the heat transfer coefficient, with a fair agreement obtained. The research moreover provides initial data concerning the overall economy of the system. The high temperature of the circulating powder leads to an increased power cycle efficiency, an increased storage density, reduced thermal power requirements, reduced heliostat field size, reduced parasitic power consumption and increased plant capacity factor.

Abstract: Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are energy-intensive and thus cost-intensive facilities; therefore, it is crucial to increase energy production directly at the WWTP. Enhancement of biogas production by addition of external substrates is one of the solutions to increase energy self-sufficiency of the WWTPs with an additional benefit of cutting down the greenhouse gas emission. The main aim of the work was to investigate full utilization of the capacity of full-scale digesters at the municipal WWTP by addition of poultry industry waste. At first, laboratory trials were conducted in order to identify the most suitable dose for co-digestion with primary and waste activated sludge and finally, based on the achieved laboratory results, full-scale trials were carried out directly at the municipal WWTP. Poultry industrial waste yielded between 0.39 and 0.88 m(3) of methane per kg of volatile solids during laboratory trials, depending on the added concentration. During full-scale investigation yield of 0.81 m(3)/kg VS was achieved. Enhanced biogas production improved WWTP energy self-sufficiency bringing closer to the aim of increasing the share of self-produced energy up to 80%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of urban vegetation in cities is a common landscape planning strategy to alleviate the heat island effect as well as to enhance building energy efficiency. The presence of trees in street canyons can effectively reduce environmental temperature via radiative shading. However, resolving shade trees in urban land surface models presents a major challenge in numerical models, especially in predicting the radiative heat exchange in canyons. In this paper, we develop a new numerical framework by incorporating shade trees into an advanced single-layer urban canopy model. This novel numerical framework is applied to Phoenix metropolitan area to investigate the cooling effect of different urban vegetation types and their potentials in saving building energy. It is found that the cooling effect by shading from trees is more significant than that by evapotranspiration from lawns, leading to a considerable saving of cooling load. In addition, analysis of human thermal comfort shows that urban vegetation plays a crucial role in creating a comfortable living environment, especially for cities located in arid or semi-arid region.

Abstract: Few studies have evaluated the overall life cycle energy demand of residential buildings, including their embodied, operational and user-transport requirements. To our knowledge, none has quantified the life cycle cost associated with reducing each of the aforementioned energy demands. It is critical to evaluate both energy and financial requirements in order to provide effective energy saving solutions for actors of the built environment.
This study quantifies the life cycle energy and cost requirements associated with 22 different energy reduction measures targeting embodied, operational and user-transport requirements. It evaluates a case study apartment building in Sehaileh, Lebanon. Embodied, operational and transport energy requirements are calculated over 50 years using a comprehensive approach. Life cycle costs are quantified using the net present value technique.
Results identify the most cost effective energy reduction measures and discard some others which are financially prohibitive, namely the installation of photovoltaic panels and the use of hybrid cars. A number of recommendations for building designers, occupants, urban designers and planners and decision makers are provided based on the quantified benefits of each measure. This demonstrates the need for assessments with a broad scope and their potential to inform energy reduction strategies in the built environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this article, four different numerical models for the investigation of phase change processes within latent heat storage are described and compared concerning accuracy, convergence behavior and computational efficiency. The models are based on different types of discretization, make use of different ways to model phase change and are implemented with C, MATLAB or ANSYS CFX. After a brief introduction into each investigated numerical model, the experimental reference setup is described. It consists of a flat plate latent heat storage with the eutectic mixture NaNO3 (46 wt%)-KNO3 (54 wt%) with a measured melting temperature of 219.5 degrees C as storage material. Based on the corresponding simulation model developed in this paper, the comparison of the numerical models is achieved. This methodology allows the investigation of the numerical performance of different software tools in the context of high temperature latent heat storage that was not achieved thus far. All four numerical models show good agreement to experimental results but differ significantly in speed and convergence behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As a result of depleting reserves of fossil fuels, conventional energy sources are becoming less available. In spite of this, energy is still being wasted, especially in the form of heat. The energy efficiency of process sites (defined as useful energy output per unit of energy input) may be increased through waste heat utilisation, thereby resulting in primary energy savings.
In this work, waste heat is defined and a methodology developed to identify the potential for waste heat recovery in process sites; considering the temperature and quantity of waste heat sources from the site processes and the site utility system (including fired heaters and, the cogeneration, cooling and refrigeration systems). The concept of the energy efficiency of a site is introduced - the fraction of the energy inputs that is converted into useful energy (heat or power or cooling) to support the methodology. Furthermore, simplified mathematical models of waste heat recovery technologies using heat as primary energy source, including organic Rankine cycles (using both pure and mixed organics as working fluids), absorption chillers and absorption heat pumps are developed to support the methodology. These models are applied to assess the potential for recovery of useful energy from waste heat.
The methodology is illustrated for an existing process site using a case study of a petroleum refinery. The energy efficiency of the site increases by 10% as a result of waste heat recovery. If there is an infinite demand for recovered energy (i.e. all the recoverable waste heat sources are exploited), the site energy efficiency could increase by 33%. The methodology also shows that combining technologies into a system creates greater potential to exploit the available waste heat in process sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Concerns over global climate change have led to strong research emphasis worldwide on reducing the emission of greenhouse gases like CO2. One avenue for carbon emission reduction is using CO2 capture and storage from industrial sources. Having low toxicity and low vapor pressure and being resistant to oxidation, natural amino acids could be a better choice over current carbon capture materials. In this study, we pioneered a unique phase change amino acid salt solvent concept in which amino acid salt solution was turned into a CO2-rich phase and a CO2-lean phase upon simple bubbling with CO2 and most importantly, this solution captured the most CO2 (similar to 90%) in the CO2-rich phase. Bicarbonate was found to be dominant in the CO2-rich phase, which had a high CO2 loading capacity and good regenerability and cycling properties. Such a phase change amino acid salt solvent may provide unique solutions for industries to reduce CO2 and other harmful emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Here, an oxygen carrier consisting of 60 wt% CuO supported on a mixture of Al2O3 and CaO (23 wt% and 17 wt% respectively) was synthesised by wet-mixing powdered CuO, Al(OH)(3) and Ca(OH)(2), followed by calcination at 1000 degrees C. Its suitability for chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) was investigated. After 25 repeated redox cycles in either a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) or a laboratory-scale fluidised bed, (with 5 vol% H-2 in H-2 as the fuel, and air as the oxidant) no significant change in either the oxygen uncoupling capacity or the overall oxygen availability of the carrier was found. In the TGA, it was found that the rate of oxygen release from the material was controlled by intrinsic chemical kinetics and external transfer of mass from the surface of the particles to the bulk gas. By modelling the various resistances, values of the rate constant for the decomposition were obtained. The activation energy of the reaction was found to be 59.7 kJ/mol (with a standard error of 5.6 kJ/mol) and the corresponding pre-exponential factor was 632 m(3)/mol/s. The local rate of conversion within a particle was assumed to occur either (i) by homogeneous chemical reaction, or (ii) in uniform, non-porous grains, each reacting as a kinetically-controlled shrinking core. Upon cross validation against a batch fluidised bed experiment, the homogeneous reaction model was found to be more plausible. By accurately accounting for the various artefacts (e.g. mass transfer resistances) present in both TGA and fluidised bed experiments, it was possible to extract a consistent set of kinetic parameters which reproduced the rates of oxygen release in both experiments.

Abstract: PV installations in buildings can utilize different on-site flexibility resources to balance mismatch in electricity production and demand. This paper studies cost-optimal and rule-based control for buildings with PV, employing a heat pump, thermal and electrical storage and shiftable loads as flexibility sources to increase the value of PV for the prosumer. The cost-optimal control minimizes variable electricity cost employing market data on electricity price and optionally constrains grid feed-in to zero; the rule-based control aims at maximizing PV self-consumption. The flexibility strategies are combined into a simulation model to analyze different system configurations over a full year.
The applicability of the new model is demonstrated with a case study with empirical data from a real low-energy house in Southern Finland. Compared to inflexible reference control with a constant price for bought electricity, cost-optimal control employing hourly market price of electricity achieved 13-25% savings in the yearly electricity bill. Moreover, 8-88% decrease in electricity fed into the grid was obtained. The exact values depend on PV capacity and the flexibility options chosen. Limiting grid feed-in to zero led to less energy efficient control. The most effective flexibility measures in this case turned out to be thermal storage with a heat pump and a battery, whereas shiftable appliances showed only a marginal effect.

Abstract: The use of Zinc-coated steel (e.g. galvanized steel) in melting cycles based on Electric Arc Furnaces can increase the production of harmful dust and hazardous air emissions. This article describes a novel process to simultaneously preheat and remove the coating from the scrap surface before the melting phase. The zinc in coating is removed in the gas phase by chloride containing syngas combustion and collected in a dedicated recovery system. Two possible innovative process routes are described, which involve plastic waste pre-treatment, shredded plastic gasification/pyrolysis, steel scrap preheating and zinc recovery processes. The routes have been modeled in an integrated flowsheet, in order to allow a comprehensive simulation and optimization of the pretreatment processes. The process optimization results in possible energy savings of over 300 MJ/t of preheated scrap charged in the Electric Arc Furnace for steel production. Moreover, a comparison among different scenarios according to economic and environmental criteria has been carried out. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Producing electricity from wind is attractive because it provides a clean, low-maintenance power supply. However, wind resource is intermittent on various timescales, thus occasionally introducing large and sudden changes in power supply. A better understanding of this variability can greatly benefit power grid planning. In the following study, wind resource is characterized using metrics that highlight these intermittency issues; therefore identifying areas of high and low wind power reliability in southern Africa and Kenya at different time-scales. After developing a wind speed profile, these metrics are applied at various heights in order to assess the added benefit of raising the wind turbine hub. Furthermore, since the interconnection of wind farms can aid in reducing the overall intermittency, the value of interconnecting nearby sites is mapped using two distinct methods. Of the countries in this region, the Republic of South Africa has shown the most interest in wind power investment. For this reason, we focus parts of the study on wind reliability in the country. The study finds that, although mean Wind Power Density is high in South Africa compared to its neighboring countries, wind power resource tends to be less reliable than in other parts of southern Africa namely central Tanzania. We also find that South Africa's potential varies over different timescales, with higher reliability in the summer than winter, and higher reliability during the day than at night. This study is concluded by introducing two methods and measures to characterize the value of interconnection, including the use of principal component analysis to identify areas with a common signal.

Abstract: This study highlights the forthcoming problem with diminishing environmental benefits from heat demand reducing energy conservation measures (ECM) of buildings within district heating systems (DHS), as the supply side is becoming "greener" and more primary energy efficient. In this study heat demand profiles and annual electricity-to-heat factors of ECMs in buildings are computed and their impact on system efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions of a Swedish biomass fuelled and combined heat and power utilising DHS are assessed. A weather normalising method for the DHS heat load is developed, combining segmented multivariable linear regressions with typical meteorological year weather data to enable the OHS model and the buildings model to work under the same weather conditions. Improving the buildings' envelope insulation level and thereby levelling out the DHS heat load curve reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves primary energy efficiency. Reducing household electricity use proves to be highly beneficial, partly because it increases heat demand, allowing for more cogeneration of electricity. However the other ECMs considered may cause increased greenhouse gas emissions, mainly because of their adverse impact on the cogeneration of electricity. If biomass fuels are considered as residuals, and thus assigned low primary energy factors, primary energy efficiency decreases when implementing ECMs that lower heat demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Steam is the main byproduct of flue gas recirculation in the oxy-coal combustion system. Coal particles are commonly surrounded and burned under the steam-rich atmosphere. In terms of the distinct physical and chemical properties of steam, the high-concentration steam would substantially affect the oxy-coal flame by changing the heat capacity, radiation and gasification. This work aims to numerically investigate how these properties affect the oxy-coal flame under a steam-rich atmosphere at a pilot-scale furnace. The results show that the flame temperature is controlled by both the heat capacity and radiation and is dependent on the oxygen and steam volume concentration. Char consumption by the steam-char gasification reaction increases as the steam volume concentration increases. In turn, char consumption by the oxidation reaction decreases. The temperature gradient in the in-flame region gradually decreases as the steam volume concentration increase due to the enhancement of the gasification reactions. Under steam-rich atmosphere, the occurrence of the steam-char gasification occurs much earlier than the CO2-char gasification. Increasing the oxygen volume concentration can lead to an incremental increase in char burnout time due to the enhancement of the gasification reactions under steam-rich atmosphere.

Abstract: The present study develops a reliability assessment method of wind resource using optimum reservoir target power operations that maximizes the firm generation of integrated wind and hydropower. A combination of water resources model for a system of reservoirs that implements a demand-priority based linear programing algorithm and a single node power grid system model is implemented on hourly time step. This model was accompanied by a global genetic algorithm solver to determine optimum operation targets for each storage reservoir aiming at maximizing the 90th percentile power generation produced by the integration of wind and hydro over the entire simulation period.
This model was applied on the reservoir storages and hydropower system in the Zambezi river basin to test if the storage reservoirs could be efficiently be used to offset wind power intermittence in South Africa subjected to the different physical and policy constraints. Based on the optimized target operation and hourly annual real data for the year 2010, the water resources system and power interconnection system were simulated together to assess the maximum firm generation of power as a result of the new wind and hydro combination target for storage hydropower plants.
The result obtained indicates that high regulation of wind and hydro can be achieved as a result of combined operation and showed 45% increase in the level of wind penetration in South Africa's power system over the reference scenario. The result also indicated a reduced level of coal power utilization and less cycling requirement. This will have a positive outcome in terms contributing to South Africa's goal toward reducing greenhouse gas emission and the efforts to build green energy supply and resilience to the impacts of climate change.

Abstract: Reverse cycle defrosting is the most widely used standard defrosting method for air source heat pump (ASHP) units. It was suggested in previous experimental studies that downwards flowing of the melted frost over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit has negative effects on reverse cycle defrosting performance. To quantitatively study the negative effects, an experimental study and a modeling study on draining away locally the melted frost for an experimental ASHP unit with a three-circuit outdoor coil were carried out and separately reported. However, for exiting ASHP units, it is hardly possible to install water collecting trays between circuits. To alleviate uneven defrosting for a vertical multicircuit outdoor coil in an existing ASHP unit, an effective alternative is to vary the heat supply to each refrigerant circuit by varying the opening values of modulating valves installed at an inlet pipe to each circuit. In this paper, a modeling study on varying heat (via refrigerant) supply to each refrigerant circuit in a three-circuit outdoor coil to alleviate uneven defrosting is reported. Finally, in the designed three study cases, defrosting energy use could be decreased to 94.6%, as well as a reduction of 7 s in defrosting duration by fully closing the modulating valve on the top circuit when its defrosting terminated.

Abstract: Waste heat recovery and utilization represents a missed opportunity to reduce China's total energy use, decrease carbon dioxide emissions, and improve air quality. Currently, China does not have a standardized or transparent methodology to quantify the waste heat potential in the industrial sector, which accounts for more than two thirds of China's primary energy consumption. This paper presents the results of thermal energy modeling to quantify the technical maximum waste heat potential in three energy-intensive industrial sectors: cement, iron and steel, and glass. In addition, this paper identifies the practical potential for producing electricity from waste heat in these sectors. The analysis finds that the glass sector has the highest waste heat to power generation potential per unit of production basis among the studied sectors. This paper provides key principles for managing waste heat in the industrial sector and key sector characteristics for implementing waste heat to power generation technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The evaluation of energy conservation projects involving steam savings requires that the cost of steam be known. While it is straightforward in principle to calculate the heat load and steam flowrate corresponding to an energy conservation project, it is much less straightforward to calculate the cost of steam saved for the economic evaluation of projects. Various simplified methods for steam costing used in practice can be grossly misleading and lead to incorrect evaluation of the economics of energy conservation projects. This paper demonstrates the complexity of costing steam for complex utility systems. It shows that true steam costs can only be evaluated by an optimization model of the whole utility system. Two plots of marginal steam cost profiles and cumulative cost profiles for different steam savings are developed to help understand the cost reduction of steam savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In the field of electricity distribution networks and with the advent of smart grids and microgrids, the use of Distribution Locational Marginal Price (D-LMPs) in a Real Time (RT) distribution market managed by a Distribution System Operator (DSO) is discussed in presence of empowered residential end-users that are able to bid for energy by a demand aggregator while following Demand Response (DR) initiatives. Each customer is provided by a transactive controller, which reads the locational market signals and answers with a bid taking into account the user preferences about some appliances involved in DR activities and controlled by smart plugs-in. In particular, Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) appliances and shiftable loads are controlled so that their consumption profile can be modified according to the price of energy.
In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of energy and cost saving, an innovative probabilistic methodology for evaluating the impact of residential DR choices considering uncertainties related to load demand, user preferences, environmental conditions, house thermal behavior and wholesale market trends has been proposed. The uncertainties related to the stochastic variations of the variables involved are modeled by using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. The combination of MCS and RT distribution market simulation based on D-LMPs are used to assess the operation and impact of the DR method over one month. Simulations results on an 84-buses distribution network confirmed that the proposed method allows saving costs for residential end-users and making the distribution network much reliable against network congestions thanks to the use of D-LMPs.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing world energy demand requires the development of deep earth energy extraction methods such as unconventional oil and gas production, including coal bed methane recovery (CBM) and utilisation of hot pore fluid in deep geothermal reservoirs. However, all these deep earth energy production methods are associated with huge wastewater (brine) production. Disposal of this brine has become a major challenge in the energy industry, as direct disposal is highly undesirable due to its organic and inorganic pollutant content and its high salinity. Re-injection of brine into deep aquifers is therefore a feasible option to overcome this issue and the flowability through the sedimentary formation or its permeability plays a major role in this process. However, most of previous works mainly focus on the homogenous formations and therefore the brine permeability of deep heterogeneous sandstone aquifers is still not well understood. This study intends to obtain a comprehensive knowledge of this process by conducting a series of core flooding experiments for brine injection into two types of clay rich sandstone, WWS and WGS, obtained from Marburg formation, Queensland, Australia along different bedding orientations and under different reservoir conditions. A series of core flooding tests were conducted on 38 mm diameter and 150 mm long cylindrical core samples and the pressure developments along the samples were recorded over time for a range of confining pressures (10-25 MPa), temperatures (30-60 degrees C), and injection over-pressures (4-20 MPa). According to the results, brine permeability in clay rich sandstone increases with increasing injection over-pressure and reduces with increasing depth and aquifer temperature. Furthermore, the flow characteristics of sandstone aquifers are largely dependent on their heterogeneous nature, and the presence of authigenic quartz, clay depositions, low permeable beddings and their orientation have significant influences on reservoir permeability. A stepped pattern was observed in the pore pressure development along the tested sandstone cores which depicts a possible pore structure variation during the fluid injection. A rapid pressure development occurs throughout the sample at the initial stage of injection may be due to the flux tends to pass through the preferable flow paths in the rock mass and then over the time this pressure development diminishes, possibly due to the gradual building of flow barriers by grain particles extracted from the initial rapid flux. These flow barriers obstruct the expected flow towards the downstream and cease the flow for some time until the pressure builds up steadily up to a certain level as it can break the flow barrier by re-arranging the pore structure. The existence of beddings further delays the demolishment of this barrier and beddings perpendicular to the flow direction creates a greater permeability reduction in the aquifer than parallel beddings, because the influence of these low permeable zones on permeability depends on the extent to which they Emit the flowability across the rock mass. The experimental results reveal that the brine permeability in sandstone can be reduced significantly up to 7 and 40 times respectively for parallel and perpendicular beddings in this study compared to no-bedding types.

Abstract: Attempts to use many types of biofuel have been tried throughout the past. Waste cooking oils (WCO) represent attractive alternatives to edible fat and oils for the production of biodiesel fuel from different points of view: they are inexpensive feedstock for biodiesel production. At the same time, using this kind of feedstock eliminates food versus fuel competition. Finally, Their use supposes an environmentally friendly approach.
Internal combustion engines operate correctly on a wide range of speeds and loads. However, only few studies on biodiesel fueled engines are undertaken for performance mapping. In the present study, the effects of entire operational range of speed/load on engine performance and emission levels of an engine are investigated when neat WCO biodiesel (B100) and its blends (B25) and (B50) are used. The obtained results are compared to those of conventional diesel (B0).
The suitability of WCO biodiesel has been established by many researchers. However their results report a wide disparity on emission levels. Combustion characteristics, performance and emission maps will be performed to give appropriate indications explaining the divergence reported in literature. The map indicates that B50 and B25 exhibit similar trends of BSFC to diesel fuel, across the speed variation albeit with difference in response levels. Contrariwise B100 shows an inverse behavior with speed increase. Results show also that Unburned Hydro-Carbons (UHC) emissions are highly correlated with engine speed. However, CO and PM emissions are extremely correlated with load and they are less sensitive to engine speed. NOx emissions are generally higher with biodiesel except some extreme zones of the map.

Abstract: Using biomass for partial or complete replacement of coke breeze in iron ore sintering process is an attractive technique for reducing emissions of greenhouse gas and gaseous pollutants. But one drawback of this technique is that low or medium grade charcoal may lead to the failure in achieving proper sintering performance. In this paper, the behaviors of coke combustion versus charcoal combustion in sintering bed were compared. The results of thermal profile and exhaust gas composition indicated that the sinters quality was deteriorated at high charcoal proportion. Lacking heat release in melting zone and the excessively high combustion rate were the reasons to weak sinters. In order to ensure the sintering performance when using medium grade charcoal in sintering bed, the effects of three improving measures (proposing the equivalent fixed carbon substitution approach, increasing charcoal particle size and adopting coated charcoal combustion) were experimentally tested. The results showed that equivalent fixed carbon substitution approach was more effective to produce sufficient heat in melting zone at medium grade charcoal combustion. Additionally, it was also found that increasing charcoal particles size and applying coated charcoal combustion method could reduce combustion rate to achieve a proper matching condition between flame front speed and heat transfer front speed. Consequently, with the help of equivalent fixed carbon substitution approach, coarse charcoal and coated charcoal particles, the peak temperature, holding time above 1100 degrees C, melting quantity index and combustion efficiency were increased in the charcoal sintering process.

Abstract: In this paper, the optimization of a real Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant and a slurry drying process is proposed. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFISs) are used to generate predictive models of the process. A dataset collected over a one-year period, with variables for the whole plant, is used to generate the predictive models. First, data mining techniques are used to obtain a representative dataset for the process as well as the input and target parameters for each model. Subsequently, models are used to optimize the plant performance in order to maximize the effective electrical efficiency of the process. For this purpose, 12 input parameters are selected as decision variables, i.e., variables which can change their values to optimize the plant. Plant performance optimization is a multi-objective problem with three goals: to maximize electrical production, minimize fuel consumption and maximize the amount of heat used in the slurry process. The optimization algorithm calculates the values of the decision variables for each time-step using Gradient Descent Methods (GDM). The simulation results show that optimization using a multi-objective function increases the CHP plant's effective electrical efficiency by around 3% on average. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) has been increasingly used as a good indicator for the instantaneous power demand on engines for real world driving in the field of vehicle emission and fuel consumption modeling. A fixed vehicle mass is normally used in VSP calculations. However, the influence of passenger load was always been neglected. The major objective of this paper is to quantify the influence of passenger load on diesel bus emissions and fuel consumption based on the real-world on-road emission data measured by the Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) on urban diesel buses in Nanjing, China. Meanwhile, analyses are conducted to investigate whether passenger load affected the accuracy of emission and fuel consumption estimations based on VSP. The results show that the influence of passenger load on emission and fuel consumption rates were related to vehicle's speed and acceleration. As for the distance-based factors, the influence of passenger load Was not obvious when the buses were driving at a relative high speed. However the effects of passenger load were significant when the per-passenger factor was used. Per-passenger emission and fuel consumption factors decreased as the passenger load increased. It was also found that the influence of passenger load can be omitted in the emission and fuel consumption rate models at low and medium speed bins but has to be considered in the models for high speed and VSP bins. Otherwise it could lead to an error of up to 49%. The results from this research will improve the accuracy of urban bus emission and fuel consumption modeling and can be used to improve planning and management of city buses and thus achieve energy saving and emission reduction.

Abstract: Around 21% of the world's power production is based on natural gas. Energy production is considered to be the significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This has a significant effect on the global warming. Improving power plant efficiency and adding a CO2 capture unit into power plants, have been suggested to be a promising countermeasure against global warming. This paper presents a new insight to the application of energy efficient technologies in retrofitting natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants with CO2 capture. High fidelity models of a 420 MW NGCC power plant and a CO2 capture plant with CO2 compression train have been built and integrated for 90% capture level. These models have been then validated by comparisons with practical operating data and literature results. The novelty of the paper is to propose optimal retrofitting strategies to minimize the efficiency penalty caused by integrating carbon capture units into the power plant, including (1) implementing heat transfer intensification techniques to increase energy saving in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) of the power plant; (2) extracting suitable steam from the HRSG to supply the heat required by the capture process, thus on external heat is purchased; (3) employing exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to increase the overall energy efficiency of the integrated process, which can benefit both power plant (e.g. increasing power plant efficiency) and capture process (e.g. reducing heat demands). Compared with the base case without using any integrating and retrofitting strategies, the optimal solution based on the proposed approaches can provide sufficient heat to CO2 capture process, and keep the same power generation. The optimal solution shows that, the flue gas flow-rate is reduced 33% in the inlet of CO2 capture process, heat demand in CO2 capture decreases 43%, heat output from the power plant increases from 0 MW to 133 MW, and more than 22% of profit is obtained in the integrated system. This demonstrates the validity and efficiency of the proposed approaches in retrofitting existing NGCC power plants with CO2 capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to assess via techno-economic and environmental metrics the production of methanol (MeOH) using H-2 and captured CO2 as raw materials. It evaluates the potential of this type of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) plant on (i) the net reduction of CO2 emissions and (ii) the cost of production, in comparison with the conventional synthesis process of MeOH Europe. Process flow modelling is used to estimate the operational performance and the total purchased equipment cost; the flowsheet is implemented in CHEMCAD, and the obtained mass and energy flows are utilised as input to calculate the selected key performance indicators (KPIs). CO2-based metrics are used to assess the environmental impact. The evaluated MeOH plant produces 440 ktMeOH/yr, and its configuration is the result of a heat integration process. Its specific capital cost is lower than for conventional plants. However, raw materials prices, i.e. H-2 and captured CO2, do not allow such a project to be financially viable. In order to make the CCU plant financially attractive, the price of MeOH should increase in a factor of almost 2, or H-2 costs should decrease almost 2.5 times, or CO2 should have a value of around 222 (sic)/t, under the assumptions of this work. The MeOH CCU-plant studied can utilise about 21.5% of the CO2 emissions of a pulverised coal (PC) power plant that produces 550 MWnet of electricity. The net CO2 emissions savings represent 8% of the emissions of the PC plant (mainly due to the avoidance of consuming fossil fuels as in the conventional MeOH synthesis process). The results demonstrate that there is a net but small potential for CO2 emissions reduction; assuming that such CCU plants are constructed in Europe to meet the MeOH demand growth and the quantities that are currently imported, the net CO2 emissions reduction could be of 2.71 MtCO(2)/yr.

Abstract: This review focuses on the separation of carbon dioxide from typical power plant exhaust gases using the adsorption process. This method is believed to be one of the economic and least interfering ways for post-combustion carbon capture as it can accomplish the objective with small energy penalty and very few modifications to power plants. The review is divided into three main sections. These are (1) the candidate materials that can be used to adsorb carbon dioxide, (2) the experimental investigations that have been carried out to study the process of separation using adsorption and (3) the numerical models developed to simulate this separation process and serve as a tool to optimize systems to be built for the purpose of CO2 adsorption. The review pointed the challenges for the post combustion and the experiments utilizing the different adsorption materials. The review indicates that many gaps are found in the research of CO2 adsorption of post-combustion processes. These gaps in experimental investigations need a lot of research work. In particular, new materials of high selectivity, uptake for carbon dioxide with stability for water vapor needs significant investigations. The major prerequisites for these potential new materials are good thermal stability, distinct selectivity and high adsorption capacity for CO2 as well as sufficient mechanical strength to endure repeated cycling.

Abstract: If occupants of buildings are offered possibilities to interact with the building's equipment elements such as with windows - in order to optimize their individual environment, these interactions will influence the energy consumption of the building. Therefore, during the design of the building, e.g. by building simulations, these interactions need to be predicted if the energy consumption of the building is to be optimized.
These interactions are partly motivated by the need for thermal comfort. A precondition for the prediction of interaction is therefore the prediction of the individual evaluation of the thermal environment. Although 'sensation' is not an optimal conceptualization of 'satisfaction with the thermal environment', it is frequently used as a measure for the evaluation of thermal comfort. However, the prediction of thermal sensation is currently not satisfactorily possible. Therefore, this article examines the potential of artificial neural networks to improve the predictability of thermal sensation. The data base used for this research derives from the RP-884 Adaptive Model Project.
Results show that the designed neural network performs excellently in the prediction of the distribution of individual ASHRAE votes under defined conditions, and that it outperforms the classical PMV index in terms of prediction quality and the range of information contained in the prediction.

Abstract: Demand Response (DR) as an option for electric utility peak load management has gained significant attention in the recent past as it helps to avoid stress conditions and possibly defer or avoid construction of new power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructures. DR in commercial buildings can play a major role in reducing peak load and mitigate network overloading conditions. Small and medium-sized commercial buildings have not historically played much role as a DR resource both due to lack of hardware and software tools and awareness. This paper presents a peak load reduction computing tool for commercial building DR applications. The proposed tool provides optimal control of building's cooling set points with the aim to reduce building's peak load, while maintaining occupant comfort measured by the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index. This is unlike other studies which use global cooling set point adjustment resulting in an uneven distribution of occupant satisfaction across the building. The approach is validated by experimentation conducted on a simulated medium-sized office building, which reflects an existing commercial building in Virginia, USA. Research findings indicate that the proposed methodology can effectively reduce the simulated building's peak load and energy consumption during a DR event, while maintaining occupant comfort requirements. The paper also addresses the issue of rebound peaks following a DR event, and offers a means to help avoid this situation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The offshore extraction of oil and gas is an energy-intensive process leading to the production of CO2 and methane, discharged into the atmosphere, and of chemicals, rejected into the sea. The taxation of these emissions, in Norway, has encouraged the development of more energy-efficient and environmental-friendly solutions, of which three are assessed in this paper:. (i) the implementation of waste heat recovery, (ii) the installation of a CO2-capture unit and (iii) the platform electrification. A North Sea platform is taken as case study, and these three options are modelled, analysed and compared, using thermodynamic, economic and environmental indicators. The results indicate the benefits of all these options, as the total CO2-emissions can be reduced by more than 15% in all cases, while the avoidance costs vary widely and are highly sensitive to the natural gas price and CO2-tax.

Abstract: Implementing heat transfer intensified techniques are now recognised as an efficient retrofit way of improving energy saving in heat exchanger networks (HENs). This not only increases heat recovery, but also prolongs exchanger operating time due to its effect on fouling mitigation. Compared with most of the existing work of HENs based on very simple assumptions for fouling effect, this paper addresses more accurate and complex fouling models reported recently (Yang et al., 2012). Due to the dynamic features of fouling, integration of dynamic equation of fouling rate is used to estimate fouling resistance at different operational times. The novelty of this paper is to present new insights to implementation of heat transfer intensified technologies for HEN retrofitting. It is the first study to implement hiTRAN (R) (one commercial tube-insert technology) into heat exchangers to increase HEN heat recovery with the consideration of detailed exchanger performances including heat transfer intensifications, pressure drop constraints, and fouling mitigation. The overall retrofit profit is maximized based on the best trade-off among energy savings, intensification implementation costs, exchanger cleaning costs, and pump power costs. To solve such complex optimization problems, a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been developed to consider fouling effects in retrofitting HENs with heat transfer intensification. An efficient iterative optimization approach is then developed to solve the MILP problem. In case studies, the new proposed approach is compared with the existing methods on an industrial scale problem, demonstrating that the new proposed approach is able to obtain more realistic solutions for practical industrial problems.

Abstract: The mitigation of potential climate change while sustaining energy resources requires global attention and cooperation. Among the numerous strategies to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions is to decommission carbon intensive electricity production while increase the deployment of renewable energy technologies - such as wind and solar power generation. Yet the generation capacity, availability, and intermittency of these renewable energy sources are strongly climate dependent - and may also shift due to unavoidable human-induced change. In this study, we present a method, based on previous studies, that estimates the risk of climate-change on wind and solar resource potential. The assessment combines the risk-based climate projections from the Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM), which considers emissions and global climate sensitivity uncertainty, with more regionally detailed climate information from 8 GCMs available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3). Southern Africa, specifically those in the Southern African Development Countries (SADC), is used as a case study. We find a median change close to zero by 2050 in the long-term mean of both wind speed and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), both used as indicators of changes in electricity production potential. Although the extreme possibilities range from about -15% to +15% change, these are associated with low probability. The most prominent effect of a modest climate mitigation policy is seen in the doubled likelihood of the mode of the distribution of wind power change. This increased likelihood is made at the expense of decreased likelihood in the large changes of the distribution, but these trade-offs with the more extreme likelihoods are not symmetric with respect to the modal change.

Abstract: In this paper, the melting and solidification behaviours of the PCM in an indirect contact mobilized thermal energy storage (ICM-TES) container were numerically investigated to facilitate the further understanding of the phase change mechanism in the container. A 2D model was built based on the simplification and assumptions of experiments, which were validated by comparing the results of computations and measurements. Then, three options, i.e., a high thermal conductivity material (expanded graphite) addition, the tube diameter and the adjustment of the internal structure of the container and fin installation, were analyzed to seek effective approaches for the improvement of the ICM-TES performance. The results show that the optimal parameters of the three options are 10 vol.% (expanded graphite proportion), 22 mm (tube diameter) and 0.468 m(2) (fin area). When the three options are applied simultaneously, the charging time is reduced by approximately 74% and the discharging time by 67%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The design criteria for modern sustainable development of vehicle powertrain are the high energy efficiency of the conversion system, the competitive cost and the lowest possible environmental impacts.
In this article a multi-objective optimization methodology is applied on hybrid electric vehicles study in order to define the optimal powertrain configurations of the vehicle, estimate the cost of the powertrain equipment and show the environmental impact of the technical choices on the lifecycle perspective of the vehicle. The study illustrates optimal design solutions for low fuel consumption vehicles - between 2 L/100 km and 3 L/100 km.
For that a simulation model of a hybrid electric vehicle is made. This model is coupled with a cost model for the vehicle. The techno-economic optimizations are performed for two case studies, illustrating the possibilities of the optimization superstructure. Firstly the life cycle inventory is written as a function of the parameters of the techno-economic model. In this way, the obtained environmental indicators from the life cycle assessment are calculated as a function of the decision variables for the vehicle design. In the second example the parameters of the energy distribution function are included as decision variables in the techno-economic optimization and are simultaneously optimized.

Abstract: The standard mathematical approach used to calculate photovoltaic (PV) array spacing contains a number of assumptions that limits its use to PV arrays installed on horizontal surfaces. This paper utilises vector analysis to develop a new method to calculate array spacing and potential system size for any combination of PV array and surface tilt and orientation. This approach is validated by comparing the vector results with ray-tracing shadow visualisations utilising the Ecotect software package. The vector method is presented as an approach compatible with online solar/PV mapping tools after a review of the existing online tools indicated that rack mounted array functionalities were rarely included. The methodology is further demonstrated via results from the Australian PV Institute's (APVI's) Solar Potential Tool which utilises the array spacing method presented. This paper also applies the methodology to a general analysis of array spacing and power density (installed capacity/unit area) for an optimally tilted equator facing array on roof surfaces of a variety of tilts and orientations.

Abstract: Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a well known technique for suppressing knock and reducing nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions in spark-ignition engines, and this technique is now receiving more attention because of the negative effect of EGR on engine particulate emissions. This paper investigates the effect of EGR on engine combustion (in-cylinder pressure and temperature, mass fraction burned (MFB), knock limited maximum brake torque (KLMBT) spark timing, net indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFCnet), exhaust gas temperature) and emissions (NOx, unburned hydrocarbon (HC), particulate matter (PM)) in a direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engine. The tests were carried out in a single-cylinder DISI research engine with engine loads between 5.5 and 8.5 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and various EGR ratios of up to 13%. The results show that by adding 12% EGR, the KLMBT spark timing could be advanced by 8 crank angle degrees (CAD) which resulted in a 4.1% fuel consumption reduction at 7.0 bar IMEP. EGR addition generally increased the accumulation mode particles and reduced the nucleation mode particles. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Early detection of an internal short circuit (ISC) in lithium ion batteries has become a crucial task for battery management, as ISC is believed to be the root cause of several large format lithium ion battery fire accidents. In this paper, a scheme of on-line detection of ISC is proposed, and the online ISC detection problem is addressed from a model parameterization and parameter estimation perspective. Using a 3D electrochemical-thermal-ISC coupled model, we explore the correlation between the measured voltage, current, and temperature data and the ISC status. It is identified that the abnormal depletion in the state-of-charge (SOC) and excessive heat generation associated with ISC affect the voltage and temperature responses, and that the correlation can be captured by a properly parameterized phenomenological model. The ISC detection is then recast as a parameter estimation problem, for which a model-based estimation algorithm is proposed and evaluated. It is shown that the estimation algorithm can track the parameter variations in real-time, thereby making it feasible to track ISC incubation status or to detect instantaneously triggered ISC. Moreover, it is observed that the recorded temperature profile is not affected by the location where the ISC occurs, due to the oval shape of the temperature distribution caused by anisotropic heat conduction of the battery core. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can detect the ISC, regardless of its physical location within the battery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work describes and evaluates a new simulation model for direct steam generation in parabolic-trough solar collectors. In direct steam generation, water is heated and evaporated through a solar field to feed a steam Rankine cycle or an industrial process. However, the behaviour of the involved multi-phase fluid poses some challenges to simulation models. The model explained in this work is based on a steady-state approach but deals with transient conditions such as start-up, shutdown and clouds in a reasonable-computing time. A new simulation tool is implemented in the TRNSYS software environment by means of new components that are suitable to be integrated into a whole solar plant model in order to carry out long-term energy production analyses with low computational resources. The main advantages of the new quasi-dynamic approach include fast computation with satisfactory accuracy; consideration of thermal inertia when addressing transient conditions; and flexibility to use different types of collector or solar field configurations. The performance of the model is validated with real experimental data obtained from the DISS solar test loop in Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain. This paper describes the modelling approach and summarizes the comparison of simulation results with measurements taken at the DISS facility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The dynamic behavior of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system is a crucial factor to ensure the safe and effective operation of fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs). Specifically, water and thermal management are critical to stabilize the performance of the PEMFC during severe load changes. In the present study, the FCHV dynamic model is developed. The dynamic model of the PEMFC system developed by Matlab-Simulink (R) is integrated into the electric vehicle model embedded in the Amesim (R). The dynamic model of the PEMFC system is composed of a PEMFC stack, an air feeding system, and a thermal management system (TMS).
The component models of PEMFC, a shell-and-tube gas-to-gas membrane humidifier, and a heat exchanger are validated via a comparison with the experimental data. The FCHV model is simulated during a federal test procedure (FTP)-75 driving cycle. One system configuration and control strategy is adopted to attain optimal water and thermal management in the PEMFC system. The vehicle speed obtained from the FCHV model aptly tracks the target velocity profile of the FTP-75 cycle within an error of +/- 0.5%. The dynamic behavior and correlation of each component in the PEMFC system is investigated. The mass and heat transfer in the PEMFC, a humidifier, and a heat exchanger are resolved to determine the species concentration and the temperature more accurately with discretization in the flow's perpendicular direction. Discretization in the flow parallel direction of humidifier and heat exchanger model makes it possible to capture the distribution of the characteristics. The present model can be used to attain the optimization of the system and control design for the PEMFC system in FCHVs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Negative environment impacts and security issues from fossil fuel based resource lead to the search of alternative sustainable resources, such as biomass. Biomass technology is limited by the complex biomass element characteristic and properties, and as well as high transportation cost. Unique property of biomass creates a gap in selection of biomass feedstock for each technology. Most of the technology developments are based on particular biomass species. This creates problems to implement the same technology in area without respective biomass, thus require more work to be done on specific biomass species available in that system. A novel technique Biomass Element Life Cycle Analysis (BELCA) is introduced to tackle these problems. BELCA acts as a platform to study the element characteristic of each biomass from plantation site and biomass generated from process plant. This study allows better understanding of respective biomass characteristic for higher level of biomass utilisation and applications. The new approach integrates biomass resources with process feedstock via biomass element characteristic and optimised supply chain network for optimum biomass utilisation and application. Biomass characteristic is presented in a simple graphical approach to enhance the understanding and highlight their potential value. Combination of this method with biomass characteristic data bank will make the biomass selection easier. Biomass characteristic study enable integration of underutilised biomass into existing system, hence biomass industry can be improved. A biomass supply chain case study incorporated with BELCA approach is conducted. The result shows significant improvement of BELCA supply chain model over the existing system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, we attempted to analyze CO2 sequestration and oil production in the environment of gravity segregation, and ultimately making a relationship between them during the CO2 flooding. In order to utilize the depleted oil field after finishing the CO2 flooding as CO2 storage, quantitative characteristics of CO2 storage efficiency to be possible in that oil field should be understood for preventing a leak through fractures generated by high-pressured CO2 of free gas state prior to the injection of CO2. As an experimental system, we designed a two dimensional CO2 flooding apparatus equipped with sandstone plate. The apparatus had dip angles of O degrees (horizontal system) and 900 (vertical system) to simulate gravity segregation condition. Experimental results for the vertical system showed that oil production was heavily influenced by gravitational effects for immiscible condition. This situation is analogous to thick reservoirs in which gravity dominates over viscous forces. However, for, near-miscible condition, the gravity override phenomenon was not significant, and these results suggest that reservoir thickness should not be a criterion when using CO2 flooding. CO2 storage efficiency for near-miscible system was found to be much better than that for immiscible system regardless of the gravitational effect. For designing the CO2 EOR scheme in terms of relationship between CO2 storage and oil production, particularly in the case of high permeable homogeneous sandstone, we found out that the trapped CO2 as free gas state and oil recovery during the CO2 flooding were monotonically decreased without critical value of inflection point corresponding to CO2 injection rate increase.

Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are important for applications related to both microgrids and electric vehicles. If BESS are used as the main energy source, then it is required to include adequate procedures for the estimation of critical variables such as the State of Charge (SoC) and the State of Health (SoH) in the design of Battery Management Systems (BMS). Furthermore, in applications where batteries are exposed to high charge and discharge rates it is also desirable to estimate the State of Maximum Power Available (SoMPA). In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach to the estimation of SoMPA in Lithium-Ion batteries. This method formulates an optimisation problem for the battery power based on a non-linear dynamic model, where the resulting solutions are functions of the SoC. In the battery model, the polarisation resistance is modelled using fuzzy rules that are function of both SoC and the discharge (charge) current. Particle filtering algorithms are used as an online estimation technique, mainly because these algorithms allow approximating the probability density functions of the SoC and SoMPA even in the case of non-Gaussian sources of uncertainty. The proposed method for SoMPA estimation is validated using the experimental data obtained from an experimental setup designed for charging and discharging the Lithium-Ion batteries.

Abstract: To meet the stringent gas emissions legislation in marine industry achieving green shipping, the ship operational behavior in actual sailing condition is one of the major concerns for designers and ship owners. In this study, the assessment of fuel consumption and pollutant gas emissions during a container ship operating scenarios was carried out by a hydrodynamic vessel movement model capable of representing the vessel propulsion behavior. The marine engine equipped with turbocharger as well as shafting system and fixed pitch propeller was included in vessel propulsion model by separated sub models connecting the required variables to each other. The propulsion system performance in calm water was well validated by a container ship seakeeping test published in 2003. When sailing encounters heavy weather, the severe ship motion induced by irregular waves bring the thruster very close to water surface, making propeller susceptible to ventilation and causing huge thrust loss. Step modulation strategy of power management system has been employed to save thrust loss and improve fuel efficiency in this study. It manages to save large thrust degeneration and along with benefit of thrust efficiency and emission mitigation, but at the expense of shortened sailing distance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Energy consumption represents a significant part of the operative costs of a wastewater treatment plant but, with a correct design and a careful management model, there are important possibilities for its limitation. The proposed research presents a multi-step methodology for the evaluation of the energetic aspects of wastewater treatment, which was implemented on the largest facility in Italy (2.7 M population equivalents as organic load), managed by Societa Metropolitana Acque Torino (SMAT). The study initially took into account each phase of the process scheme, in order to obtain specific electricity consumption values for all the electro-mechanic devices. Data from tele-control system and direct measurements in field have both been acquired. The total electric energy demand of the plant was evaluated (66.78 GW h/y, about 50% from aeration in oxidation tanks). In account of large contribution the energy efficiency of the blowers was verified with positive results. Four specific energy consumption indexes were considered to carry out a critical analysis of SMAT wastewater treatment plant with other facilities performing biological oxidation processes and of a different order of magnitude about design capacity, and congruent values were obtained. The considered indexes related the electric energy demand to the equivalent population, to the volume of treated water and to the amount of removed COD and total Nitrogen. Furthermore the thermal energy demand of the plant was estimated (49.15 GW h/y, more than 93% from sludge line). An energy balance for the whole plant was finally evaluated, and some energy optimization solutions to decrease the corresponding costs were suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Capacity planners in developing countries frequently use screening curves and other system-independent metrics such as levelized cost of energy to guide investment decisions. This can lead to spurious conclusions about intermittent power sources such as solar and wind whose value may depend strongly on the characteristics of the system in which they are installed, including the overall generation mix and consumption patterns. We use a system-level optimization model for Kenya to evaluate the potential to use grid-connected solar PV in combination with existing reservoir hydropower to displace diesel generation. Different generation mixes in the years 2012 and 2017 are tested with a unit commitment model. Our results show that the value of high penetrations of solar in 2012 exceeds expected payments from the national feed-in-tariff. Under two 2017 generation mix and demand scenarios, the value of solar remains high if planned investments in low-cost geothermal, imported hydro, and wind power are delayed. Our system-scale methodology can be used to estimate the potential for intermittent renewable generation in other African countries with large reservoir hydro capacities or where there is a significant opportunity to displace costly diesel generation.

Abstract: Lithium ion batteries have attracted wide attention due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and environmental friendliness and are widely used in electrical vehicles. An accurate and reliable battery model is needed in battery management systems (BMS) to monitor battery operating conditions, including state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), etc. This paper presents a state-space model with non-integer order derivatives for electrochemical batteries with a constant phase element (CPE) in order to accurately describe battery dynamics. The proposed model is a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the 1-RC model. The Oustaloup recursive approximation was selected for model parametric identification and potential implementation. A particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to identify three model parameters by using time-domain test data. The model accuracy and robustness were validated by using datasets from different driving cycles, aging levels and cells of the same chemistry. The proposed FOM showed good accuracy and robustness. It is suitable for research on battery reliability, including issues like SOC estimation, SOH prediction, and charging control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Large power sector CO2 emission reductions are needed to meet long-term climate change targets. Intermittent renewable energy sources (intermittent-RES) such as wind and solar PV can be a key component of the resulting low-carbon power systems. Their intermittency will require more flexibility from the rest of the power system to maintain system stability. In this study, the efficacy of five complementary options to integrate intermittent-RES at the lowest cost is evaluated with the PLEXUS hourly power system simulation tool for Western Europe in the year 2050. Three scenarios.to reduce CO2 emissions by 96% and maintain system reliability are investigated: 40%, 60% and 80% of annual power generation by RES. This corresponds to 22%, 41% and 59% of annual power generation by intermittent-RES. This study shows that higher penetration of RES will increase the total system costs: they increase by 12% between the 40% and 80% RES scenarios. Key drivers are the relatively high investment costs and integration costs of intermittent-RES. It is found that total system costs can be reduced by: (1) Demand response (DR) (2-3% reduction compared to no DR deployment); (2) natural gas-fired power plants with and without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (12% reduction from mainly replacing RES power generation between the 80% and 40% RES scenarios); (3) increased interconnection capacity (0-1% reduction compared to the current capacity); (4) curtailment (2% reduction in 80% RES scenario compared to no curtailment); (5) electricity storage increases total system costs in all scenarios (0.1-3% increase compared to only current storage capacity). The charging costs and investment costs make storage relatively expensive, even projecting cost reductions of 40% for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and 70% for batteries compared to 2012. All scenarios are simulated as energy only markets, and experience a "revenue gap" for both complementary options and other power generators: only curtailment and DR are profitable due to their low cost. The revenue gap becomes progressively more pronounced in the 60% and 80% RES scenarios, as the low marginal costs of RES reduce electricity prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the aerodynamic performance of a Savonius vertical axis wind rotor to be used in an innovative lamppost. The wind generator studied is the main part of a public lighting system (a street lamp) powered by both aeolian and solar renewable energy sources. This study is aimed to analyze the effects of different construction solutions on rotor performance. Experimental dynamic tests were carried out on a 1:1 rotor model in the Environmental Wind Tunnel (EWT) of University "Politecnica delle Marche" (UNIVPM); tests were performed at different wind velocities and for different construction combinations. The results obtained confirmed that, in the tested range 2-3.3 x 10(5), rotor performance does not depend on the Reynolds number. Tests also showed that the presence of end plates and blade overlap increases the power coefficient C-P,C-max while the presence of external grids and structural posts has negative effects on rotor performance. The best results were obtained for a configuration having a helical rotor with a 105 degrees twist, open blade overlap and end plates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
