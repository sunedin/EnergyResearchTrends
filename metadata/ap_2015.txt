Abstract: Two-phase cooling systems (e.g., pump-loops, vapor compression cycles) present a promising approach to the cooling of modern high power electronic systems. Such systems can achieve high coefficient of heat transfer but may incur dangerously high temperature when the imposed heat flux exceeds the critical heat flux (CHF). This paper presents a new control strategy that provides robust CHF avoidance in two-phase cooling for multiple evaporators under dynamic heat loads. This approach operates near the CHF to allow reduced coolant flow rates and greater system efficiency compared with the typical, and more conservative, open-loop or worst-case control strategies. The control architecture consists of two loops: an outer loop to determine evaporator mass flow rate demand, and an inner loop to supply and distribute the coolant using system actuators. Each control loop is implemented with feedforward based on static models as well as proportional integral (PI) feedback controllers, and the decentralized approach allows scalable control design without the need for high fidelity nonlinear dynamic models. Simulations and corresponding experimental controller validations were conducted using a three-evaporator vapor compression cycle (VCC) testbed with transient imposed heat flux. The full closed-loop system is shown to be able to operate near CHF while avoiding CHF under transient heat flux, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This work deals with the effects of the heat dumping on the operation of four residential micro-CHP (combined heat and power) systems, each composed of a prime mover producing electricity and heat, a thermal energy storage system and an auxiliary boiler. The micro-CHP systems differ from one another on the prime mover, while the same multi-apartment housing situated in Italy has been considered as user. Four natural gas fueled commercial prime movers have been considered, two internal combustion engines and two microturbines, characterized by different electric and thermal powers. For each micro-CHP system, two heat-driven operation strategies, one with heat dumping and one without have been implemented by means of a home-made numerical code developed in Matlab environment, and in both the cases the economic optimization of the operation has been performed using the pattern search algorithm. For each analyzed case, the results are reported in terms of prime mover operating hours, thermal and electrical energy production, natural gas consumption, primary energy and economic savings with respect to separate generation of electricity and heat, and pollutants emission. The results of an economic analysis are also reported. The effects of the variation of the maximum capacity of the thermal energy storage system, and of the auxiliary boiler efficiency on the optimization results are analyzed, and the results relative to the two different operation strategies are compared and discussed. The major result of this study is that, for all the analyzed micro-CHP systems, an optimized application of heat dumping in the micro-CHP system operation permit to considerably reduce the size of the thermal energy storage system with respect to the heat-driven operation strategy without heat dumping.

Abstract: A two-dimensional, single-phase model is developed to study high temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cell with poly(2,5-benzimidazole) (ab-PBI) membrane. In this model, simulation region not only includes the cathode and anode, but also includes ab-PBI membrane; the continuity boundary condition at the interface between the catalyst layer (CL) and the gas diffusion layer (GDL) at each side of the cell is omitted by including the catalyst layers in the respective unified domains for the cathode and the anode. The flows, species, energy, current density are all coupled in the model. Experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed numerical simulations, and it is found that there is a good agreement between the modeling results and those obtained experimentally. By this simulation, not only the oxygen and water fraction distribution in the cathode, but also the temperature distribution and resistance distribution in the ab-PBI membrane are obtained, and the effects of the cell temperature, the porosity in the diffusion layer and its thickness on the current density are analyzed. The innovative researching results are that the temperature distribution is uneven in the ab-PBI membrane and its resistance is greatly affected by the operating temperature. Other results show that the increase of the cell temperature and the porosity in the diffusion layer, and the decrease of the diffusion layer thickness all improve the performance of HT-PEM fuel cells by promoting its internal mass transfer.

Abstract: Double reheat ultra-supercritical power plants have been receiving an increasing amount of attention because of their high thermal efficiency. However, the superheat degree of extraction steam in double reheat power plants is relatively high and results in a large temperature difference in the heat transfer process of the regenerative system. As a result, this impedes further improvement of the thermal efficiency of double reheat power plants. This paper presents two superheat utilization schemes of extraction steam in a double reheat ultra-supercritical power plant, where one scheme adopts outer steam coolers and the other employs a regenerative turbine. A comparative study of the two proposed schemes is conducted. Thermodynamic and techno-economic analyses are performed to reveal the energy saving effects of the proposed schemes. Thermodynamic analyses under partial load operation conditions are also presented. The results reveal the following. The power generation efficiency of the outer steam cooler scheme and the regenerative turbine scheme increases by 0.16 percentage points and 0.67 percentage points compared with a reference double reheat power plant, respectively. When the load is reduced, the energy saving effects of the proposed schemes become more obvious. The power generation efficiency increments of the outer steam cooler and the regenerative turbine schemes can reach 0.19 and 0.79 percentage points, respectively, at a 50% turbine heat acceptance load. The net annual revenues of the two schemes are 0.29 and 1.59 million USD, respectively. The results indicate that the two proposed schemes can both effectively utilize the superheat of extraction steam for double reheat ultra-supercritical power plants. In comparison, the regenerative turbine scheme is superior to the outer steam cooler scheme in terms of thermodynamic and techno-economic performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The technical and economic analysis of generating biochar together with electricity and/or heat from poultry litter (PL) waste is the subject of this study. To carry out this study, the process simulation software ECLIPSE is used. Modelling and simulation have been conducted over the selected system: the pyrolysis/gasification process integrated with an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The facility will be capable of processing 1500 kg of PL every hour. The simulation shows that when a reference PL is used the yield of biochar from the process is around 398 kg/h with a 38% carbon content. Electricity generated by the ORC system is 388 kW h(e). Recovered low grade heat for space heating is estimated at 1831 kW h(th). The results of the economic analysis suggest that when paying 20 pound/tonne for handling and storing the feedstock without any options of selling either heat or electricity, the break-even selling price (BESP) of biochar is around 218 pound/tonne. If the sale of electricity and heat produced is considered to be around 60 pound/MW he and 5 pound/MW h(th), the BESP will decrease to 178 pound/tonne. The case studies also indicate that when a gate fee of 10 pound/tonne is introduced the BESP can be further reduced to 65 pound/tonne, equivalent to a 63% reduction. On the other hand if biochar generated has an average price of 150 pound/tonne in the market and the plant receives one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) from the Government, the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for the electricity generation will be 46 pound/MW h(e), which is compatible with electricity generated by fossil fuel power plants.

Abstract: Traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator has drawn increasing attention due to its great prospect in energy conversion. In this work, a traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator capable of generating about 500W electric power is studied numerically and experimentally. The performances and the operating characteristics of the system under different working conditions are tested and analyzed. The maximum electric powers can be obtained with electric load resistance around 100-120 Omega, and the highest thermal-to-electric efficiencies can be achieved at much larger load resistances. The efficiency at low load resistance is relatively small due to the large pressure amplitudes inside the thermoacoustic system, which increases the dissipations. The variation trends of the electric power and the thermal-to-electric efficiency with the load resistance intrinsically result from the changes of the corresponding acoustic impedance of the linear alternators, which determines the output performance of the thermoacoustic engine meanwhile. The distributions of the acoustic power losses are then calculated and firstly illustrated quantitatively. It is shown that the resonator causes most of the acoustic power losses, and the losses in hot heat exchanger, thermal buffer tube, and feedback tube are also significant. The output performance of the system can be improved by increasing the heating temperature and the mean pressure. A maximum electric power of 473.6 W and a highest thermal-to-electric efficiency of 14.5% are achieved experimentally when the mean pressure, is 2.48 MPa and the heating temperature is 650 degrees C. A pair of linear alternators with a larger swept volume and appropriate acoustic impedances is finally designed to couple with the thermoacoustic torus directly. Numerical results show that the maximum electric power can be increased to 718 W and 1005W when the mean pressures are kept at 2.48 MPa and 3.20 MPa, corresponding to the improvements of 42.6% and 29.4% compared with those of the original system.

Abstract: A battery fuel gauge (BFG) helps to extend battery life by tracking the state of charge (SOC) and many other diagnostic features. In this paper, we present an approach to validate the SOC and time-to-shutdown (US) estimates of a BFG. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing under realistic usage scenarios provides a means for BFG algorithm evaluation and provides insights into practical implementation and testing of BFG algorithms in battery management systems. We report the details of a HIL system that was designed to validate the SOC and US estimation capability of BFG algorithms; different current load profiles were synthesized to replicate typical battery usage in portable electronic applications; the HIL system is automated with the help of programmable current profiles and is designed to operate at various controlled temperatures; three performance validation metrics are formulated for an objective assessment of SOC and ITS tracking algorithms. The HIL setup and the performance validation metrics are used to evaluate a BFG developed by the authors using three different batteries at temperatures ranging from -20 degrees C to 40 degrees C.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the carboxylic acid functionalized molecules, namely, benzoic acid (BZA) and C-61-dicarboxylic acid (CDCA) as interfacial modifiers to form self-assembled monolayers (SAM) in polymer hybrid solar cell (HSC) consisting of poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and zinc oxide (ZnO). We found that the short circuit current density (J(sc)) and the open circuit voltage (V-oc) of the device could be drastically increased by using CDCA-SAM and BZA-SAM, respectively. On the other hand, the optimized mixture of CDCA-SAM and BZA-SAM showed better improvement in both the J(sc) and V-oc. The devices modified with mixed SAMs in an optimized ratio showed significant increment in the overall conversion efficiencies compared to unmodified devices consisting of both bi-layer and nanorod (NR) structured HSC. In particular, almost 1.2-fold improvement could be achieved on the NR device with the efficiencies of 033%. We attribute the improvement of J(sc), and V-oc to higher carrier mobility of CDCA-SAM and work function modulation of ZnO by BZA-SAM, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As a natural working fluid, CO2 has been widely applied in refrigeration systems where heat is conventionally released to ambient through external airflow. Owing to its extraordinary thermophysical properties, especially a low critical temperature, the CO2 heat release through a high-pressure side heat exchanger will inevitably undergo either supercritical or subcritical processes, depending on ambient air temperatures and head pressure controls. Correspondingly, the heat exchanger will act intermittently as either a gas cooler or condenser within the system during an annual operation. Such evidence should therefore be taken into account for an optimal design of the heat exchanger and head pressure controls in order to significantly enhance the performance of both components and the associated system. To achieve these targets, two CO2 finned-tube gas coolers/condensers with different structural designs and controls have been purposely built, instrumented and connected with an existing test rig of a CO2 booster refrigeration system. Consequently, the performance of the CO2 gas coolers/condensers with different structure designs, controls and system integration at different operating conditions can be thoroughly investigated through experimentation. In the meantime, models of the finned-tube CO2 gas coolers/condensers have been developed using both the distributed (detailed model) and lumped (simple model) methods. The former is employed to give a detailed prediction of the working fluid temperature profiles, localised heat transfer rates and effects of pipe circuitry anangements, while the latter is suitable for the simulation and optimisation of system integration with less computation time. Both models have been validated with measurements, and moreover the simple model has been integrated with other component models so as to create a system model. The effects of the CO2 gas cooler/condenser sizes and controls on the system performance can thus be compared and analysed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: China has adopted an ambitious plan for wind energy deployment. This paper uses the theory of the learning curve to investigate financing options to support grid parity for wind electricity. First, relying on a panel dataset consisting of information from 1207 wind projects in China's thirty provinces over the period of 2004-2011, this study empirically estimates the learning rate of onshore wind technology to be around 4.4%. Given this low learning rate, achieving grid parity requires a policy of pricing carbon at 13 (sic)/ton CO2e in order to increase the cost of coal-generated electricity. Alternatively, a learning rate of 8.9% would be necessary in the absence of a carbon price. Second, this study assesses the evolution of additional capital subsidies in a dynamic framework of technological learning. The implicit average CO2 abatement cost derived from this learning investment is estimated to be around 16 (sic)/ton CO2e over the breakeven time period. The findings suggest that climate finance could be structured in a way to provide up-front financing to support this paradigm shift in energy transition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the impact of methane on performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine fueled by biodiesel. A combined chemical reaction model was developed including the reaction kinetics of biodiesel and methane with CO, NOx and soot formation mechanisms embedded. The developed skeletal reaction mechanism was first validated by performing ignition delay calculations against the detailed biodiesel reaction mechanism, then it was subject to 3D numerical simulations of combustion process in a diesel engine against the experimental results under various operating conditions, good agreement has been obtained. After the validation, it was used to investigate the effect of different methane percentage on the performance of the engine. The results indicate that under various engine load conditions, with the increase of methane addition, both CO and soot emissions are significantly reduced with negligible NOx emission change.

Abstract: Steam gasification of petroleum coke catalyzed by black liquor (BL) was conducted in a micro fluidized bed to investigate the reaction characteristics and kinetics, including the effects of temperature, particle size, BL loading amount and oxygen content in steam on product gas composition and reaction rate. The completion time of petroleum coke steam gasification at 900 degrees C decreased from 120 min for pure coke to about 40 min for the coke blended with 10 wt.% BL The corresponding hydrogen fraction in the produced syngas increased by 9 vol.%. The gasification reaction was further enhanced by introducing a small amount of oxygen into the steam. The shrinking core model (SCM) and homogenous model (HM) were used to calculate the kinetics of petroleum coke gasification, finding that SCM enabled the better correlation with experimental data than HM did. Using SCM the activation energy was 77 kJ.mol(-1) for coke gasification with 10 wt.% BL as catalyst, which was much lower than 120 kJ.mol(-1) for the case without BL blended. The activation energy was further reduced to about 63 kJ-mol(-1) by adding 5% oxygen into the steam, showing a synergistic effects of BL and O-2 on petroleum coke gasification. The study also justified the feasibility of syngas production from petroleum coke via fluidized bed gasification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Compact fuel cell system was developed for a portable power generator. The power generator features a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) using a chemical hydride as a hydrogen source. The hydrogen generator extracted hydrogen using a catalytic hydrolysis from a sodium borohydride alkaline solution. A novel concept using an all-in-one reactor was proposed in which a catalyst, hydrogen chamber and byproduct separator were combined in a volume. In addition, the reactor as well as a pump, cooling fans, valves and controller was integrated in a single module. A 100W PEMFC stack was connected with the hydrogen generator and was evaluated at various load conditions. It was verified that the stable hydrogen supply was achieved and the developed system can be used to drive fuel cell-powered unmanned autonomous systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: When removing biomass residues from the agriculture for bioenergy utilization, the nutrients and carbon stored within these "residual resources" are removed as-well. To mitigate these issues the energy industry must try to conserve and not destroy the nutrients. The paper analyses a novel integration between the agricultural system and the energy system through the Low Temperature Circulating Fluidized Bed (LT-CFB) gasifier from the perspective of wheat grain production and electricity generation using wheat straw, where the effects of removing the straw from the agricultural system are assessed along with the effects of recycling the nutrients and carbon back to the agricultural system. The methods used to assess the integration was Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with IPCC's 2013 100 year global warming potential (GWP) as impact assessment method. The boundary was set from cradle to gate with two different functional units, kg grain and kW h electricity produced in Zealand, Denmark. Two cases were used in the analysis: 1. nutrient balances are regulated by mineral fertilization and 2. the nutrient balances are regulated by yield. The analysis compare three scenarios of gasifier operation based on carbon conversion to two references, no straw removal and straw combustion. The results show that the climate effect of removing the straws are mitigated by the carbon soil sequestration with biochar, and electricity and district heat substitution. Maximum biochar production outperforms maximum heat and power generation for most substituted electricity and district heating scenarios. Irrespective of the substituted technologies, the carbon conversion needs to be 80-86% to fully mitigate the effects of removing the straws from the agricultural system. This concludes that compromising on energy efficiency for biochar production can be beneficial in terms of climate change effect of an integrated wheat production and bioenergy system.

Abstract: Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) systems coupled with direct steam generation (DSG) are more promising in terms of system efficiency and electricity cost than current solar-only power generation systems, as ISCC-DSG offers the advantages of higher net thermal efficiency and lower cost. However, the ISCC systems usually have to be operated at part-load conditions with low system efficiency when no or lower insolation than that at design point is available as most of state-of-the-art such systems have no thermal storage equipped. In order to improve system performance and prolong the system full-load operation hours, a proper solar field size represented as the solar multiple is a prime parameter to be determined during the design stage of the ISCC system. A too large solar multiple might cause the collected solar thermal energy to become partially useless without thermal storage and high investment cost, while a smaller one might worsen the part-load performance of the system.
This paper presents the thermodynamic and economic analysis for an ISCC system with two pressure level DSG solar fields (ISCC-2DSG), aiming to study the impacts of solar multiples on system performance with or without consideration of thermal storage. In the ISCC-2DSG system, the solar thermal energy produced from two solar fields is only used to supply latent heat for low- and high-pressure water vaporization, respectively. Feedwater preheating and steam superheating are achieved in a HRSG. The annual thermodynamic performance of several such ISCC-2DSG systems, with different solar multiple values but with identical design parameters in the power subsystem, is characterized. Based on these features, the LEC for each system is calculated and compared. An optimum solar field size (solar multiple), which gives the minimum LEC, for the ISCC-2DSG system can be finally obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The present investigation examines the impact of seeding the intake of an HCCI engine with ozone, one of the most oxidizing chemical species, on the combustion of three alcohol fuels: methanol, ethanol and n-butanol. The research was performed through engine experiments and constant volume computations. The results showed that increasing the ozone concentration led to an improvement in combustion coupled with a combustion advance. It was also observed, by comparing the results for each fuel selected, that n-butanol is the most impacted by ozone seeding and methanol the least. Further analyses of the experimental results showed that the alcohol fuel combustion can be controlled with ozone, which presents an interesting potential. Finally, computation results confirmed the experimental results observed. They also showed that in presence of ozone, alcohol fuels are not initially oxidized by molecular oxygen but by O-atoms coming from the ozone decomposition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A theoretical study on a combined power and ejector refrigeration cycle using zeotropic mixture isobutane/pentane is carried out. The performances of different mixture compositions are compared. An exergy analysis is conducted for the cycle. The result reveals that most exergy destruction happens in the ejector, where more than 40% exergy is lost. The heat exchange in generator causes the second largest exergy loss, larger than 28%. As the mass fraction of isobutane changes ranges from 100% to 0%, the relative exergy destruction of each component is also changing. And mixture isobutane/pentane (50/50) has the maximum exergy efficiency of 7.83%. The parametric analysis of generator temperature, condenser temperature and evaporator temperature for all the mixtures shows that, all these three thermodynamic parameters have a strong effect on the cycle performance.

Abstract: Ethanol direct injection has the potentials to increase the engine compression ratio and thermal efficiency by taking advantages of ethanol fuel such as the high octane number and latent heat. In this study, CFD modelling and experiments were carried out to investigate the charge cooling effect and combustion characteristics of ethanol direct injection in a gasoline port injection (EDI + GPI) engine. Experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder spark ignition engine equipped with EDI + GPI over a full range of ethanol ratio from 0% (GPI only) to 100% (EDI only). Multidimensional CFD simulations to the partially premixed dual-fuel spray combustion were performed to understand the experimental results. The simulations were verified by comparing with the experimental results. Simulation results showed that the overall cooling effect of EDI was enhanced with the increase of ethanol ratio from 0% to 58%, but was not enhanced with further increase of ethanol ratio. When the ethanol ratio was greater than 58%, a large number of liquid ethanol droplets were left in the combustion chamber during combustion and fuel impingement on the cylinder wall became significant, leading to local overcooling in the near-wall region and over-lean mixture at the spark plug gap. As a consequence, the CO and HC emissions increased due to incomplete combustion. Compared with GPI only, the faster flame speed of ethanol fuel contributed to the greater peak cylinder pressure of EDI + GPI condition, which resulted in higher power output and thermal efficiency. Meanwhile, the mixture became leaner with the increase of ethanol ratio. As a result, the IMEP was increased, combustion initiation duration and major combustion duration were decreased when ethanol ratio was in 0-58%. The combustion performance was deteriorated when ethanol ratio was greater than 58%. Experimental and numerical results showed that the IMEP, thermal efficiency and emissions of this EDI + GPI engine can be optimised in the range of ethanol ratio of 40-60%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The price consumers are willing to pay (WTP) extra for green electricity (GE) is one of the uncertainties possibly impacting on the overall feasibility of its market introduction. In the literature, several measurements of WTP are used. However, the number of studies comparing WTP measures is limited. This study investigates the construct validity (convergent and theoretical) of two widely used WTP measures (double-bounded dichotomous choice (DC) and open-ended (OE)). A model informed by the well-known theory of planned behaviour was applied to survey data from 890 South African domestic energy users. It was found that convergent validity among the WTP measures was fairly low. Moreover, results from Tobit regressions showed that a grounded theoretical model yields statistically significant results. However, different independent variables emerge in the DC and OE models. Therefore, the theoretical validity of one of the WTP measures seems to be low. The paper proposes a number of explanations for the low construct validity observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Varying fuel injection strategies is one of the promising methods to reduce engine out emissions and improve its performance as injection characteristics have great influences on combustion process. Out of various injection strategies, injection rate shaping is potentially an effective technique to reduce emission from engines. Injection rate shaping helps in reducing NOx emissions and reduces combustion noise. This work investigates the effect of injection rate shaping on combustion and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine fueled by biodiesel. The CFD simulations were performed using multidimensional KIVA-4 code coupled with CHEMKIN chemistry solver. A detailed chemical kinetics of methyl decanoate (MD) and methyl-9-decenoate (MD9D) with 112 species and 498 reactions were used as surrogate fuel for biodiesel. The injection rate shapes were varied in terms of boot length (long, medium and short boot length) and boot pressure (low, medium and high boot pressure) and it was found from the results that a trade-off between NOx and soot emissions were obtained for long boot length, and high boot pressure injection rate profiles.

Abstract: Self-heat recuperation (SHR) technology has been proven to reduce exergy loss in different process systems, which lead to large energy savings due to its non-combustion process. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel self-heat recuperative heat circulation system using thermoelectric (TE) device as a heat circulator for gaseous and non-gaseous systems. The small Delta T usage of TE heat circulator enables the use of the high efficiency region of TE devices. A mathematical simulation of the performance of a TE heat circulator considering the effects of surface area, heat transfer coefficient and pellet height is presented in this study. Using a TE heat circulator with a surface area of 1 m(2) to boil 1 kg of HFE-7100 (R) an energy reduction of 82% was calculated compared to the conventional fired heater case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, 838 representative animal manure samples were collected from 552 sites across China. Chemical analyses of 19 parameters, including the proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, heating values and some essential mineral elements, were conducted on the samples. The energy potential of animal manure in China was quantified based on the chemical analysis. The results showed that the chemical characteristics of the different types of animal manure were highly variable. Principal component analysis results demonstrated that the closest compositional characteristics were between dairy manure and beef manure. Several strong and important associations, namely phosphorus-magnesium, phosphorus-copper, phosphorus-zinc, copper-zinc, calcium-potassium, fixed carbon-calcium, volatile matter-iron and ash-volatile matter-fixed carbon-carbon-hydrogen-higher heating value-lower heating value, were identified. The calculated outputs of total potential annual thermal energy, syngas and methane yields from the five types of animal manure in China were 4400.63 TJ, 983.40 x 109 m(3) and 188.89 x 10(9) m(3), respectively. The air gasifier energy conversion efficiency (t = 850 degrees C, equivalence ratio (ER) = 0.3) for different animal manures was in the range of 66.80-83.22%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Experimental investigations were conducted on a 4-cylinder natural-aspirated direct-injection diesel engine with naturally aspirated hydrogen, focusing on the effects of hydrogen addition on the physicochemical properties of the diesel particulate. Diesel particulates were sampled for off-line analysis, with the aid of TEM and TGA facilities. Hydrogen addition promotes particle oxidation at low engine load and speed due to the increase of exhaust temperature, resulting in smaller particles, but it inhibits particle oxidation at high engine load due to the competition of oxygen between hydrogen and diesel fuel which results in larger primary particles. The replacement of injected diesel fuel by hydrogen inhibits the formation of soot nuclei and decreases its volume density, hence reduces the size of aggregate particles which are more spherical as indicated by an increase of fractal dimension and a decrease of radius of gyration. With increase of engine load, primary particles exhibit more graphitic structure, changing from "onion like" to "shell-core" structure. Hydrogen addition promotes and inhibits primary particle oxidation at low and high engine loads, respectively, and the corresponding primary particles are "turbostratic interlayer" and "shell-amorphous" in structure, respectively. The results of recognized fringe length, tortuosity and fringe separation distance are consistent with the observed morphology. The oxidation reactivity is related to equivalence ratio, being higher at low engine load and speed, which is indicated by the variation of activation energy and ignition temperature. The oxidation reactivity is validated to be related to the nanostructure of primary particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Algae-sourced feedstocks remain confined to commercialization because of the high cost and energy consumption of biomass cultivation and feedstock extraction. In this study, to reduce the energy consumption required for algae extraction, experiments with Chlorella vulgais extraction by ionic liquids (ILs) combined with CO2 capture were conducted considering that captured CO2 by ILs can compensate the energy consumption of extraction. The results showed that the addition of CO2 to [BMIM][BF4] increased the lipid yield of Chlorella vulgaris from 68.0% to 75.6%. The properties of synthesized biodiesel from C vulgaris lipids met the UNE-EN 14214 European biodiesel standard except for oxidative stability. Protein denaturation and degradation were found during the lysis of algae cells. Approximately 82.2 wt.% of the total extracted proteins could be precipitated during both algae lysis and supernatant liquid drying. A microalgae-to-biofuel route including C vulgaris extraction and CO2 capture was proposed that involves wet algae input and delivery outputs of water, biodiesel, pyrolysis oil, proteins, sugars, biogas and glycerol. Fossil energy ratios (FER) based on the overall energy balance were 3.30 (n = 1, n is the volume ratio of IL to wet algae) and 3.84 (n = 2) for [BMIM][BF4] with CO2 capture, approximately 2.5 times those based on commercially available technologies. The possibilities of synthesizing novel ILs that show both high CO2 absorption and good abilities in cell wall breakage are discussed. More progress is greatly needed to reduce IL recovery loss.

Abstract: Two-phase thermosyphon loops (TPTLs) are beginning to be extensively used in the field of air conditioning and heat recovery, where they have quite different flow characteristics compared with the traditional TPTLs used in cooling of electronics. However, in the existing studies, the flow features in the downcomer were ignored, and most researchers simply thought the downcomer was always full of liquid. In this study, a visual experimental setup was established, the flow features in the downcomer were observed and measured. And the influencing factors including temperature difference, liquid charge, height difference, and circulation flow resistance on the liquid head have been identified and investigated experimentally. The results show that, different from the conventional understandings, the downcomer can be partially liquid filled. At this time, the upper part of downcomer is a static saturation gas blockage, surrounded by a layer of liquid film, which does not provide the driving force. The liquid head in the downcomer, which provides the driving force, shows great self-regulation ability with different working conditions. Increasing the refrigerant charge, temperature difference, circulation flow resistance, and decreasing the height difference drives the liquid head to rise, and the downcomer tends to be fully liquid filled.

Abstract: This paper studies the influence of the load type on the fault performance of the standalone Micro Grid (MG). Different load types (static and dynamic) are considered to show their effects on the standalone MG fault behavior. Specifically, the effects of constant power static loads, constant impedance static loads, and constant current static loads are analyzed. Also, effects of dynamic (rotating) loads are highlighted. Results show, that the rotating loads have dominant effects on the fault performance of the MG during the standalone (islanded) mode. Furthermore, rotating loads cause fault currents and touch voltages three times the values associated with the static loads. Consequently, the employed protective devices with the rotating loads MG must be rated three times larger than the employed protective devices with the static loads MG. Also, the time settings of the MG protection devices are highly influenced with the load type. For static load MG, it is equal to 250% of the rotating loads MG protection devices time settings. The three types of static load show different impacts on islanded MG fault performance. Constant power static load has the highest effect compared to the other two static load types (namely, constant impedance and constant current static loads). The results obtained in this study provide a guide for the MG protection designers and planners to consider the effects of load type on the MG protection devices rating and setting.

Abstract: A three-dimensional CFD model was developed to simulate the full-loop of a dual fluidized-bed biomass gasification system consisting of a gasifier, a combustor, a cyclone separator, and a loop-seal. This full-loop simulation includes the chemical kinetic modeling of biomass drying and pyrolysis, heterogeneous char reactions, and homogeneous gas-phase reactions. In the model, the gas phase is described using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and the particle phase is described with the Multiphase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) method. The simulation was performed using the CPU-accelerated computing and the simulation results were compared with the gas composition and temperature measurements from a pilot-scale biomass gasification power plant (1 MWth, 6 tons biomass/day). The independence of the accuracy of the model on mesh resolution and computational particle number was determined. The impacts of the particle size distributions (PSD) and drag models on the reactive flows were also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The micro-combustor is a major component of the micro thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system. In order to improve the stability of combustion and efficiency of the micro-TPV conversion device, porous media combustor was designed. Porous media combustion can increase flame stability and gain higher conversion efficiency compared with the free flame combustor. In this work, the influence of several major parameters on micro combustion, namely material of porous media, hydrogen to oxygen equivalence ratio, porosity of porous media and mixture flow rate were investigated using the numerical simulation method. Results indicate that, even though at three different equivalence ratio conditions, SiC is still one of the most suitable porous media materials. Besides, high flow velocity and big porosity both induce high temperature gradient and big pressure drop. The interaction between these two parameters plays an important role in external wall temperature. Analyses in this paper reveal that with the appropriate parameters: phi = 0.8, v = 6 m/s, porosity is 0.5 and porous media material is SiC, micro combustor with porous media structure could greatly increase combustion efficiency. Present research will facilitate the optimization and improvement of micro-TPV conversion device. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Direct HDO process for difurfurylidene acetone dimer (F2A) conversion to liquid alkanes (C8 C14) at 260 degrees C in a batch reactor was investigated over different material supported 1 wt%Pt catalysts, including SAPO-11, HZSM-5, SiO2-Al2O3, MCM-22, and home-made SiO2-ZrO2. CS-Cm alkanes of 55.8% was obtained over the optimized I wt%Pt/SiO2-ZrO2 due to its proper pore size of 9.0 nm and moderate acidic centers, together with more than 10% carbon yield of the oxygenated hydrocarbons, including C11-C13 chain alcohols 82 ketones and the hydrogenated F(2)A dimers with furan ring (H-F(2)A dimers). To improve the liquid alkane yield, a two-step process for F(2)A conversion was also investigated, which included low-temperature hydrogenation at 50 C over Raney Ni catalyst in a batch reactor and the subsequent high-temperature hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) at 280 degrees C over 1 wt%Pt/SiO2 ZrO2 in a fixed-bed reactor. The selectivity of 1,5-di(tetrahydro-2-furany1)-3-pentanol (II-c) was the highest of 83.0% among the hydrogenated intermediates of H-F2A dimers due to the protonation effect of methanol as the solvent and the hydrogenation of C=C bonds by Ni active centers. In the same time, the high content of this saturated alcohol H-dimer of II-C increased the solubility and stability of the intermediates in methanol solvent. High carbon yield of C-8-C-14 alkanes of 82.9%(mol) was obtained after oxygen atom removal from H-F(2)A dimers via, the second-step HDO reaction. Long time operation showed the stability of 1 wt%Pt/SiO2-ZrO2 as HDO catalyst, deduced from the steady phase structure, acidity of SiO2 ZrO2 support and Pt active centers by catalyst characterization.

Abstract: The use of a single chamber fuel cell with an iron anode and air cathode is a new and innovative concept in electrocoagulation. In this study, we investigated the predominant reactions that contribute to the production of electricity and iron hydroxides in solution. Solutions composed of 0.06 M NaHCO3 and 0.05 M NaCl at an initial pH of 5 were determined to be optimal for producing the maximum power density of 1997 mW/m(2) after 24 h. Increases in the bicarbonate concentration and ionic strength of the solution induced a corresponding decrease in the anode potential and increase in the cathode potential, which resulted in an increase in the cell potential and power density. Further, increasing the NaHCO3 concentration to 0.1 M and the ionic strength of the solution to 0.56 M induced an increase in the maximum power densities to 2436 and 4343 mW/m(2), respectively. Initial pH values of 7.5 and 8.5 in solutions containing 0.06 M NaHCO3 and 0.05 M NaCl were employed to synthesize magnetic iron hydroxides including magnetite and maghemite. These results suggest that this fuel cell technology can be used not only for electrocoagulation with the removal of contaminants, but also for producing useful products such as electricity and magnetic iron hydroxides. Advances in waste water air-metal fuel cells will enable more efficient power generation and systems suitable for scale-up. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Coal-direct chemical-looping combustion (CD-CLC) is a next generation combustion technology that shows great promise as a solution for the need of high-efficiency low-cost carbon capture from fossil fueled power plants. To realize this technology on an industrial scale, the development of high-fidelity simulations is a necessary step to develop a thorough understanding of the CLC process. In this paper, simulations of multiphase flow in a CD-CLC process with chemical reactions are performed using the ANSYS Fluent CFD software. Discrete Element Method (DEM) provides the means for tracking the motion of individual metal oxide particles in the CD-CLC system as they react with the fuel and combine with CFD for capturing the solid-gas multiphase hydrodynamics. The overall results of the coupled CFD/DEM simulations using Fe-based oxygen carriers reacting with gaseous CH4 demonstrate that chemical reactions have been successfully incorporated into the CFD/DEM approach. The simulations show a strong dependence of the fluidization performance of the fuel reactor on the density of bed material and provide important insight into selection of a right oxygen carrier for the enhanced performance. This work provides the foundation for future simulations of CD-CLC systems using solid coal as fuel, which will be crucial for successful deployment of CD-CLC technology from the laboratory scale to pilot and industrial scale projects.

Abstract: The recovery of heat has long been a key measure to improving energy efficiency and maximising the heat recovery of factories by Pinch analysis. However, a substantial amount of research has been dedicated to conventional heat integration where low grade heat is often ignored. Despite this, the sustainability challenges facing the process manufacturing community are turning interest on low grade energy recovery systems to further advance energy efficiency by technological interventions such as heat pumps. This paper presents a novel heat integration framework incorporating technological interventions for both simple and complex factories to evaluate all possible heat integration opportunities including low grade and waste heat. The key features of the framework include the role of heat pumps to upgrade heat which can significantly enhance energy efficiency; the selection process of heat pump designs which was aided by the development of 'Heat Pump Thresholds' to decide if heat pump designs are cost-competitive with steam generation combustion boiler; a decision making procedure to select process or utility heat integration in complex and diverse factories; and additional stream classifications to identify and separate streams that can be practically integrated. The application of the framework at a modified confectionery factory has yielded four options capable of delivering a total energy reduction of about 32% with an economic payback period of about 5 years. In comparison, conventional direct and/or indirect heat integration without heat pumps showed an energy reduction potential of only 3.7-4.3%. Despite the long payback, the role of heat pumps combined with an integrated search by direct and indirect heat exchange from zonal to factory level can provide the maximum heat recovery. The framework has the potential to be applied across the process manufacturing community to inform longer-term energy integration strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Clustering methods are often used to model energy consumption for two reasons. First, clustering is often used to process data and to improve the predictive accuracy of subsequent energy models. Second, stable clusters that are reproducible with respect to non-essential changes can be used to group, target, and interpret observed subjects. However, it is well known that clustering methods are highly sensitive to the choice of algorithms and variables. This can lead to misleading assessments of predictive accuracy and mis-interpretation of clusters in policymaking.
This paper therefore introduces two methods to the modeling of energy consumption in buildings: clusterwise regression, also known as latent class regression, which integrates clustering and regression simultaneously; and cluster validation methods to measure stability. Using a large dataset of multifamily buildings in New York City, clusterwise regression is compared to common two-stage algorithms that use K-means and model-based clustering with linear regression. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using 20-fold cross validation, and the stability of the perturbed clusters is measured using the Jaccard coefficient. These results show that there seems to be an inherent tradeoff between prediction accuracy and cluster stability. This paper concludes by discussing which clustering methods may be appropriate for different analytical purposes. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The paper presents the preliminary operational performance results of the of two 3.5 kWp Concentration PhotoVoltaic (CPV) devices. Each system consists of eight modules installed on a chassis for a total number of 1152 triple junction PV cells whose active area is 5.5 x 5.5 mm. The optics has a total geometrical concentration ratio of 476x. Two solutions for the primary PMMA Fresnel lens were tested, one with constant Fresnel pitch and one with variable pitch. The secondary optics is the same for both systems and consists of a truncated pyramid made of high reflective material. The two-axis tracking system is an azimuth-elevation device driven by two electrical motors and controlled by a sun sensor. Results allow to evaluate the efficiency of the plant as well as significant operational parameters under real outdoor operating conditions. The overall AC electrical efficiency is up to 31% and the power production peak is 2.54 kW. Electric power output has a linear dependency with the available Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) while the Air Mass (AM) spectrum has a negligible effect on the performance. The system equipped with a variable pitch Fresnel lens performs slightly better (about 3.5% more power) with respect to the one with a constant pitch. The effect of lens fouling has a much higher impact: with a dirty lens the system generates over 12% less power and efficiency decreases by 3-5%, at equal solar irradiation. The performance ratio of the CPV system peaked at 82% and it has a monthly value over 70% in spring and summer months. The tracking mechanism has showed, in the worst scenario, an inaccuracy of 0.26 which is lower than the acceptance angle of the optics (0.4). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: For the utilization of renewable energy from sources widely distributed in low-density non-urban areas the grid augmentation for its transmission to urban areas of high population density is often discussed under the premise that the present demand distribution remains invariant. Instead of grid augmentation, this study examined an alternative option of creating a power demand close to renewable sources and inducing population movements (i.e., Renewable Energy Exodus). First, the capacity of renewable energy to maintain populations in hilly and mountainous farming areas of japan was evaluated from two perspectives: Task (1) a challenging nationwide balance based on possible energy demand saving scenario for the future, and Task (2) a conservative nationwide balance based on the current per capita energy demand and on the region-by-region generation-consumption matching concept. Because Task (2) indicated that Hokkaido, the northern-most island, has a huge capacity, Task (3) was conducted for Hokkaido by examining both energy balance and economic evaluation including job creation for the following two scenarios: (A) a supply to Tokyo scenario and (B) a local demand generation scenario, keeping the same conservativeness as Task (2) by using the current data for energy consumption per capita. The nationwide Renewable Energy Exodus estimates gave 48 million people for Task (1) (with the future per capita energy demand) and 10 million people for Task (2) (with the current per capita energy demand and region-by-region self-sustained balance), respectively. For Hokkaido Task (3) (with an additional economic assessment) gave 1 million people. The Renewable Energy Exodus concept combined with the green economy promotion was found to have a significant merit for a sustainable future of countries like Japan where economic and social disparities are serious between urban areas and non-urban areas.

Abstract: A catalytic gasification technology has been proposed for tar in situ conversion using the rice husk char (RHC) or rice husk ash (RHA) supported nickel-iron catalysts. Biomass tar could be converted effectively by co-pyrolysis with the RHC/RHA supported nickel-iron catalysts at 800 degrees C, simplifying the follow-up tar removal process. Under the optimized conditions, the tar conversion efficiency could reach about 923% by the RHC Ni-Fe, which exhibited more advantages of easy preparation and energy-saving. In addition, the tar conversion efficiency could reach about 93% by the RHA Ni. Significantly, partial metal oxides (e.g., MO, Fe2O3) in the carbon matrix of RHC could be in-situ carbothermally reduced into the metallic state (e.g., Ni-0) by reducing gases (e.g., CO) or carbon atom, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of tar conversion. Furthermore, mixing with other solid particles such as sand and RHA Ni, can also improve biomass (e.g., RH) fluidization behavior by optimizing the operation parameters (e.g., particle size, mass fraction) in the mode of fluidized bed gasifier (FBG). After the solid-solid mixing simulation, the RH mass fraction of 0.5 and the particle diameter of 0.5 mm can be employed in the binary mixture of RH and RHA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is considered an environmentally friendly energy source because it generates electrical power by digesting organic substrates in the wastewater. However, it is still challenging for MFC to become an economically affordable and highly efficient energy source due to its relatively low power output and coulombic efficiency. The aim of this study is to increase the performance of anode by using polyelectrolyte microparticles to facilitate the accumulation of microorganisms and the collection of electrons. The polyelectrolyte microparticle is subjected to microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and continuous electricity generation in an air-cathode mu-Liter MFC (mu MFC) to validate its biocompatibility, ability in retaining redox species, reduced electron transfer resistance, and sustained energy generation. During the 168-hour operation, microorganisms proliferate inside the microparticle and generate around 250% power output and 200% limiting current of those from microorganism biofilm. The polyelectrolyte microparticle also decreased charge-transfer resistance of anode electrode in air-cathode pMFC by 56% compared with biofilm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper introduces an original approach for the evaluation of the cooling load due to the solar radiation incident on the glazed surface of a building. This approach is based on a newly introduced parameter called Solar Response Factor, defined as the overall convective heat flux released by the building envelope to the indoor space per unit radiant heat flux acting on the outer surface of the glazing.
The Solar Response Factor is a complex number, and can be calculated as a combination of the thermal and the optical properties of walls and glazing. In particular, the paper discusses how the Solar Response Factor depends on the optical properties of the envelope, on the size of the windows and on the type of walls delimiting the enclosed space.
Furthermore, under steady-periodic conditions, the use of the Solar Response Factor allows an easy analytical estimation of the cooling load due to solar gains. The reliability of this approach is successfully proven by comparison with a series of simulations carried out with EnergyPlus. The results provide very useful information for optimizing the thermal response of an enclosure to periodic solar heat gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In recent years popularity of plug-in electric (PEV) vehicles has grown significantly. Charging of such vehicles is typically done at home from a standard outlet or at corporate car locations and thus adds extra load on the distribution grid. Due to high power consumption of PEV charging, the utility industries face enormous challenges to provide this extra demand. The identification of charging patterns of PEV is thus of paramount importance to balance the electric load and assure coordinated charging. More specifically, there is a need to identify users with PEVs to better manage the load distribution. In the present research, an analysis based on energy envelopes of the usage patterns is performed. A set of well-known data mining algorithms are used to identify the best classifier to help identify customers with PEVs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The main purpose of this study is to estimate the energy price equivalence of carbon taxes and emissions trading in an energy market. To this end, both the carbon tax and emissions trading systems are designed in the theoretical model, while alternative market structures are taken into consideration. The theoretical findings show that the economic effects of these two schemes on energy prices depend on the market structures. Energy prices are equivalent between these two schemes given the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) reduction when the market structure is characterized by perfect competition. However, energy prices will be lower when a carbon tax is introduced than when emissions trading is implemented in an imperfectly competitive market, which implies that the price effects of a carbon tax and emissions trading depend on the energy market structure. Such a theoretical basis is applied to the market for gasoline in Taiwan. The empirical results indicate that the gasoline prices under a carbon tax are lower than under emissions trading. This implies that the structure of the energy market needs to be examined when a country seeks to reduce its GHGE through the implementation of either a carbon tax or emissions trading.

Abstract: Compared with the conventional engine, the special characteristic of hydraulic free piston diesel engine decides its differences in the aspects of piston displacement, velocity, acceleration, etc. These differences lead to more complex fluid flow, and particular intrinsic energy distribution in-cylinder. Moreover, the mean velocity of the combustion gas is enhanced and the velocity of vortex in-cylinder is decided by the piston speed and the scavenging process. All these factors bring about the differences of heat transfer and air-fuel mixture. Fortunately all of them can be simulated and calculated by the CFD package. Therefore the rate of heat transfer in-cylinder can be obtained. Then the rate of heat release can be easily calculated. What is more, the calculated result is compared with the heat release regularity of Wiebe, and the fitted formula is used to analyze the heat release regularity of hydraulic free piston diesel engine. Further, polytropic exponent n is quoted to describe the condition of diffusion combustion. And then we analyze the working process of HFPDE based on the characteristics of the curves. Finally, the optimum proposals are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: n-Butanol produced from renewable resources has attracted increasing interest, mostly for its potential use as liquid biofuel for transportation. Process currently used in the industry (Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation - ABE) faces major technical challenges, which could be overcome by an alternative production through ethanol catalysis. In this study, both routes are evaluated by means of their financial viabilities and environmental performance assessed through the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery methodological framework. Comparative financial analysis of the routes integrated to a first and second generation sugarcane biorefinery shows that, despite the drawbacks, ABE process for fermentation of the pentoses liquor is more attractive than the catalysis of ethanol to n-butanol and co-products. n-Butanol use as fuel demonstrated favorable environmental results for climate change as figures showed over 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emission compared with gasoline.

Abstract: Among the many types of alternative fuels, biodiesel has emerged as an eco-friendly fuel for the compression-ignition engines. Investigations into biodiesel combustion have been performed with various aspects and methodologies. In this study, the effects of the pilot injection strategies on the flame temperature and soot distribution were investigated experimentally and numerically using an optical Cl engine fueled with biodiesel. The endoscopy system captured the spray development and combustion processes in the cylinder. In addition, obtained pictures were used to estimate the flame temperature and soot distribution using a post-processing program. Furthermore, the KIVA/CHEMKIN code was used to enhance the analysis of the pilot combustion characteristics. These numerical results allowed information that cannot be obtained from physical experiments. The experimental conditions were composed of various pilot injection timings and quantities. In the present experiment, the experimental conditions were fixed with the exception of the injection strategy that was used. The experimental results showed that the flame temperature decreased as the pilot fuel mass increased. Additionally, it was also found that biodiesel combustion generated a higher flame temperature and lower soot concentrations compared to neat diesel combustion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The effect of groundwater flow on the heat transfer performance of pile geothermal heat exchanger (PGHE) with spiral coils was simulated by a 3-D simulation model using finite element method. Different groundwater flow conditions were taken into consideration by applying different hydraulic gradients. Based on the moving ring-coils model and simulation results, an improved analytical model is developed by introducing a key parameter of effective dimensionless velocity. The calculation results shows that the improved model can better describe the heat transfer performance of PGHE with spiral coils. Both numerical and analytical results indicated that the groundwater flow has an enhancing effect on the heat transfer performance of the PGHE with spiral coils and can accelerate the heat transfer process into stability. When the groundwater flow mean velocity equal to 6.98E-06 m/s, the amount of heat exchange is higher than 26.72% than it of non-advection situation. The improved ring-coils analytical model can be used as a reliable tool for the design of pile geothermal heat exchanger with spiral coils under groundwater flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Thermoacoustic instability occurs in many practical combustion systems. These systems are non-normal and associated with transient growth of acoustic disturbances. If the transient growth is large enough, then thermoacoustic instability may be triggered. In this work, transient energy growth analysis of a thermoacoustic system with a choked outlet is conducted. The effect of the choked boundary is studied by using an analytical and a linearized Euler equation (LEE) method. To quantify the transient growth, two energy measures are defined and calculated. One is associated with the acoustical energy. The other is the total energy of both entropy and acoustic fluctuations. Comparison is made between the transient growth results obtained from the analytical method and those from the LEE method. It is found that the transient growth analysis of the total energy by using the analytical model with the expression of the choked outlet is consistent with that by using the LEE method. However, when only acoustical energy is considered, the analytical model may leads to a wrong prediction of transient growth. The present work opens up new applicable way to predict transient stability behaviors of a practical engine system ended with a choked outlet. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews literature on passive heating and cooling of buildings using roof ponds. The main aims were to gain a detailed understanding of different roof pond configurations and their performance, compare effectiveness of different roof pond variants, evaluate performance of different roof pond variants relative to other passive design techniques, explore effects of climatic conditions and various design configurations on the performance of roof ponds, and identify gaps in knowledge and data. Overall, 19 roof pond cooling and 4 roof pond heating systems were identified. This review suggests that, in some cases, roof ponds can provide year-round thermal comfort while reducing demand for active heating and cooling systems. Therefore, they can be utilized in efforts towards the goal of carbon-neutral design. Roof ponds with wet gunny bags, shaded roof ponds, ventilated roof ponds, and roof ponds with movable insulation proved to be more effective relative to other variants of roof pond cooling systems. Comparing performance relative to other passive strategies showed that, in many cases, roof pond cooling systems are about equally effective in maintaining indoor thermal comfort. Meteorological conditions, water depth, roof deck material, and thickness of the insulating panel are the main factors affecting performance of roof ponds. Several areas of weakness in the literature are identified. Future research should, among other things, provide more detailed knowledge on performance of all roof pond variants, further explore suitability of roof ponds relative to other passive design measures, examine effectiveness of roof ponds when combined with other passive design measures, analyze life-cycle costs of roof ponds, and provide more knowledge on their real-world application.

Abstract: Several Northern European countries are facing an incineration plant capacity larger than national generation of waste, mainly caused by a reduced availability of waste, economic crisis and over-investments. This is causing several WTE power plants to operate at reduced or under-utilized waste input capacity. In the aforementioned context, this paper focuses on two repowering options to improve waste conversion efficiency of an existing under-utilized Waste-To-Energy (WTE) power plant with a Gas Turbine (GT). In particular, this study investigates the feasibility of middle pressure repowering strategies: additional steam is produced in a simplified Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) fed by the GT exhaust gas. The proposed repowering options are quite simple and easy to adapt to mid-size under-utilized types of WTE power plant.
A thermodynamic evaluation of the system feasibility is presented for a typical WTE. For each investigated repowering option, minimum GT size is identified along with optimum plant match condition in terms of plants capacity.
A complete thermodynamic simulation of the steam cycle is performed and different plant configurations are examined under different GT commercial units. Detailed modifications to the WTE cycle and the resulting performance improvements are presented for both analyzed repowering options.
Furthermore, different key performance indicators have been taken into account to evaluate, for each investigated configuration, the integrated dual-fuel system performance enhancement in comparison with the under-utilized and the original WTE plant.
Both power output and efficiency of the repowered WTE plant compare favorably with those of the original stand-alone system: repowered system power output rise up to three times the original one and first law efficiency can reach up to 36%. Furthermore, the integration with GT can enhance the waste utilization, achieving positive synergy effects, as quantified in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: High intensity colorless distributed combustion (CDC) provides high efficiency combustion with stable operation and ultra-low emissions. The role of internal entrainment of hot reactive gases requires further investigation in order to obtain minimum requirements for distributed combustion. In this paper, the impact of internal entrainment of reactive gases on the flame behavior and structure is investigated with focus on fostering distributed combustion. A mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide was introduced to the air stream prior to mixing with the fuel to simulate the recirculated product gases from within the combustor. Increase dilution with nitrogen or carbon dioxide increased the reaction zone volume to result in uniform distribution of CH* and OH* chemiluminescence signal and uniform equivalence ratio (measured optically). These conditions replaced the normally present blue flame with a uniform almost invisible faint bluish flame. The increased entrainment also decreased NO chemiluminescence significantly for the same amounts of fuel burned. The chemiluminescence data suggested that lowering oxygen concentration from 21% to 15% resulted in improved distributed combustion conditions with the reaction volume occupying most of the combustor. These conditions provide the minimum entrainment requirement and reduction of oxygen concentration for achieving distributed combustion. Results obtained at different equivalence ratios and entrained gas temperatures showed similar behavior at oxygen concentration of 15%. The reaction distribution was further enhanced at lower oxygen concentration (similar to 11%) with further reduction in pollutants emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Current global resources of fossil fuels are gradually depleting and the energy crisis induces increasing concerns on the research of new effective substitution of these fossil fuels by renewable energy, especially bio-fuels from biomass such as bio-oils. However, bio-oils, generally originated from the pyrolysis of biomass, contain a great deal of carboxylic acids such as acetic acid and these acids can easily decrease the stability and the quality of oil. Meanwhile, these acids are highly corrosive to reaction equipments. Bio-oil could be upgraded before its utilization in the feedstocks of fuels and chemicals. In this work, the removing of these carboxylic acids was investigated by esterification in supercritical ethanol. The effects of reaction temperature, the ratio of ethanol to bio-oil, and reaction time on the conversion of acids were studied as well as the addition of external acid such as H2SO4, H3PO4 or zeolite. The results showed that carboxylic acids in crude bio-oil easily esterified with ethanol in the supercritical system. More ethyl acetate was formed at higher volume ratio of ethanol to bio-oil and 100% of the selectivity was achieved at the volume ratio of 5:1 after 2 h reaction, whereas more side reactions were present in lower or higher ratio of ethanol to bio-oil. The addition of external acid decreased distinctly the formation of esters, indicating that these carboxylic acids could be effectively removed under the acidic system arising from the internal ionization of ethanol. These would be very useful in the upgrading of bio-oil into high quality fuels in the future biorefinery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The aim of increasing the share of renewable energy sources to the total energy production has brought a significant increase of the interest in marine energies over the last years. Within them, tidal currents resources have been gaining ground for their advantages in terms of predictability, nonexistence of extreme flows, high load factor, minimal land occupation and visual impact. The authors, working in this field since many years, have been designing a new turbine able to work in the water like a kite, with no support structures, easily connected to the coast by a rope. The constructive easiness, and the lower installation costs are the main machine characteristics, together with the ability to overturn itself when the tidal current changes direction. The turbine equilibrium and mainly the transients related to the sink and surface phases, machine overturning, represent a critical aspect of the design. In the present work, starting from a phenomenological analysis, a simulation of the transients has been carried out in Simulink (R) environment. The floating stabilizer is a critical component which influences the motion behavior of the machine in the vertical plane and so the trend on the transients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Mediatorless cellulose-fed microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a bioelectrochemical system that converts cellulose into energy through cellulose-hydrolyzing and electrogenic activity of bacteria. In the paper it has been presented that Enterobacter cloacae isolated from termite gut exhibited both cellulose-degrading and exoelectrogenic activities that make it a valuable strain to be used in a cellulose-fed MFC. The maximum power and current densities obtained from the cellulose-fed MFC were 185 mW/m(2) and 2.4 A/m(2), respectively. SEM micrographs of the anode showed that E. cloacae formed an expanded fibria system bounding bacteria cells into network attached to the electrode surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The air-breathing proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is of great interest in mobile power sources because of its simple system design and low parasitic power consumption. Different from previous low-temperature air-breathing PEMFCs, a high-temperature PEMFC with a phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane as the polymer electrolyte is designed and investigated under air-breathing conditions. The preliminary results show that a peak power density of 220.5 mW cm(-2) at 200 degrees C can be achieved without employing any water managements, which is comparable to those with conventional Nafion (R) membranes operated at low temperatures. In addition, it is found that with the present cell design, the limiting current density arising from the oxygen transfer limitation is around 700 mA cm(-2) even at 200 degrees C. The short-term durability test at 200 mA cm(-2) and 180 degrees C reveals that all the cells exhibit a gradual decrease in the voltage along with a rise in the internal resistance. The degradation rate of continuous operation is around 58.32 mu V h(-1), which is much smaller than those of start/stop cycling operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimised resorption cogeneration using mass and heat recovery to improve the performance of a novel resorption cogeneration fist proposed by Wang et al. This system combines ammonia-resorption technology and expansion machine into one loop, which is able to generate refrigeration and electricity from low-grade heat sources such as solar energy and industrial waste heat. Two sets of resorption cycle are designed to overcome the intermittent performance of the chemisorption and produce continuous/simultaneous refrigeration and electricity. In this paper, twelve resorption working pairs of salt complex candidates are analysed by the first law analysis using Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The optimal resorption working pairs from the twelve candidates under the driven temperature from 100 degrees C to 300 degrees C are identified. By applying heat/mass recovery, the coefficient of performance (COP) improvement is increased by 38% when the high temperature salt (HTS) is NiCl2 and by 35% when the HTS is MnCl2. On the other hand, the energy efficiency of electricity has also been improved from 8% to 12% with the help of heat/mass recovery. The second law analysis has also been applied to investigate the exergy utilisation and identify the key components/processes. The highest second law efficiency is achieved as high as 41% by the resorption working pair BaCl2-MnCl2 under the heat source temperature at 110 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Micro-cogeneration Stirling units are promising for residential applications because of high total efficiencies, favorable ratios of thermal to electrical powers and low CO as well as NO emissions. This work focuses on the experimental and the numerical analysis of a commercial unit generating 8 kW of hot water (up to 15 kW with an auxiliary burner) and 1 kW of electricity burning natural gas. In the experimental campaign, the initial pressure of the working fluid is changed in a range from 9 to 24 bar(g) - 20 barg being the nominal value - while the inlet temperature of the water loop and its mass flow rate are kept at the nominal conditions of, respectively, 50 degrees C and 0.194 kg/s. The experimental results indicate clearly that the initial pressure of the working fluid - Nitrogen - affects strongly the net electrical power output and efficiency. The best performance for the output and efficiency of 943 W and 9.6% (based on the higher heating value of the burnt natural gas) are achieved at 22 bar(g). On the other hand, the thermal power trend indicates a maximum value of 8420W at the working pressure of 24 bar(g), which corresponds to a thermal efficiency of 84.7% (again based on higher heating value). Measurements are coupled to a detailed model based on a modification of the work by Urieli and Berchowitz. Thanks to the tuning with the experimental results, the numerical model allows investigating the profiles of the main thermodynamic parameters and heat losses during the cycle, as well as estimating those physical properties that are not directly measurable. The major losses turn to be the wall parasitic heat conduction from heater to cooler and the non-unitary effectiveness of the regenerator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Renewable energy, particularly solar and wind power integrated with microgrid technology, offers important opportunities for remote communities to provide power supply, improve local energy security and living conditions. The combination of solar, wind power and energy storage make possible the sustainable generation of energy for remote communities, and keep energy costs lower than diesel generation as well. The purpose of this study is to optimize the system design of a proposed hybrid solar-wind-pumped storage system in standalone mode for an isolated microgrid of a scale of a few hundred kW. The initial design process of the system's major components is presented, and then optimized based on a techno-economic evaluation. The optimal system configuration under zero loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is further examined. In addition, the system performance of hybrid solar-wind, solar-alone and wind-alone systems with pumped storage under LPSP from 0% to 5% is investigated and compared. Results demonstrate that addition of wind turbine can result in a lower cost of energy (COE) and help reduce the size of energy storage. Sensitivity analysis on several key parameters is also performed to examine their effects on system COE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) incorporates a Packed Bed Thermal Energy Storage (PBTES) represents a promising larger scale storage technology. The heat storage performance of compressed air (CA) in PBTES is presented and numerically analyzed in this paper. Phase change material (PCM) particles are used as the filler. The unsteady two-phase energy conservation equations considering the phase change phenomena inside the PCM particles are developed and solved numerically by finite difference method. This model has been validated with Izquierdo-Barrientos' experimental data. Then, the effects of porosity (epsilon), PCM particle diameter (d(p)), CA inlet pressure (P) and filling approach on PBTES thermal behaviors (such as temperature profiles, heat storage capacity and charge efficiency) are investigated.
It was found that increasing particle diameter results in a decrease in the charge efficiency, and the charge efficiency increases with an increase in CA inlet pressure. The PBTES filled with three kinds of materials has better charge efficiency compared with the packed bed filled with single PCM or rock. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The complete utilization of sweet sorghum stalks including the fermentable sugars and the lignocellulosic faction is necessary to decrease the bioethanol production cost. Moreover, bioethanol yields from lignocellulosic resources depend on the saccharification efficiency of cellulose. Lignin has been considered as an important factor influencing enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose. In this study, the impact of lignin removal on enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated using fermented sweet sorghum bagasse (FSSB) delignified by NaOH or Ca(OH)(2) pretreatments. For NaOH pretreated samples, a positive correlation between cellulose conversion rate and lignin removal was found when the lignin removal was from 8.96% to 65.61%. Further delignification of FSSB did not increase the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. For Ca(OH)(2) pretreatment, there was no obvious correlation between lignin removal and cellulose conversion rate. More interestingly, the cellulose conversion rate of FSSB pretreated with Ca(OH)(2) was significantly higher than that of FSSB pretreated with NaOH when the same amount of lignin was removed. The surface lignin coverage of FSSB pretreated with 10% NaOH was 1.52 times higher than that of FSSB pretreated with Ca(OH)(2). These results demonstrated that the impact of lignin removal on enzymatic hydrolysis of FSSB pretreated with NaOH and Ca(OH)(2) was different. The lignin removal was the main factor influencing the enzymatic hydrolysis of FSSB pretreated with NaOH, while Ca(OH)(2) was more capable of removing surface lignin when the lignin content of the samples was similar.

Abstract: Due to the presence of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and thermostatically control loads, heat, natural gas, and electric power systems are tightly coupled in community areas. However, the coordination among these systems has not yet been fully researched, especially with the integration of renewable energy. This paper aims to develop a hierarchical approach for an integrated community energy system (ICES). The proposed hierarchical framework is presented as day-ahead scheduling and two-layer intra-hour adjustment systems. Two objectives, namely the operating cost minimization and tie-line power smoothing, are integrated into the framework. In the intra-hour adjustment, a master-client structure is designed. The CUP and thermostatically controlled loads are coordinated by a method with two different time scales in order to execute the schedule and handle uncertainties from the load demand and the renewable generation. To obtain the optimal set-points for the CHP, an integrated optimal power flow method is developed, which also incorporates three-phase electric power flow and natural gas flow constraints. Furthermore, based on a time priority list method, a three-phase demand response approach is proposed to dispatch thermostatically controlled loads at different phases and locations. Numerical studies confirm that the ICES can be economically operated, and the tie-line power between the ICES and external energy network can be effectively smoothed.

Abstract: There is growing recognition of the need to understand public attitudes to energy sources, such as shale gas, and to feed these into decision-making. This study represents the first detailed UK experimental survey of public perceptions of shale gas fracking, including analysis of the effects of different messages and the relative influence of different audience, message and contextual factors on support and risk perceptions in respect of shale gas fracking. Using an online survey (N = 1457) of the UK public, we find considerable ambivalence about shale gas, but also greater awareness of potential risks than benefits. Prior knowledge is associated with more favourable attitudes, although demographics, political affiliation and environmental values are strongest influences on perceptions. When provided with environmental or economic information about shale gas, participants became more positive irrespective of their prior values or whether information is framed in terms of losses or gains. As expected, prior attitudes predict how information is received, with more attitude change amongst the most ambivalent respondents. We conclude that additional information about shale gas is more likely to be effective changing attitudes if focussed on this 'undecided' group. Studies of this type are important for policy makers and industry alike. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Reduction and carburization behaviors of iron phases over a precipitated iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalyst were investigated by some techniques of Massbauer effect spectroscopy (MES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) as well as H-2&CO temperature-programmed desorption (H-2&CO-TPD). It was found that in H-2 atmosphere phase transformation of iron phases involved alpha-Fe2O3 -> Fe3O4 -> FeO -> alpha-Fe, both occurring in the bulk and on the surface layers. All of reduced iron species took place the carburization reaction, whereas carburizing ability was following the order alpha-Fe > FeO > Fe3O4. During FTS both iron carbides and Fe(II) oxide species reached a balance state without appearing the intermediate alpha-Fe. The conversion of reduced iron phases to iron carbides (especially for x-Fe5C2) on the surface layers played a positive role in promoting the formation of hydrocarbons species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A novel heat input process that is optimized for use with multi-effect desalination technology has been analyzed. The system proposes the use of heat pumps combined with photovoltaic thermal solar collectors, such that a renewable energy-based desalination process can be developed to distill ocean water. The proposed system implements an additional heat pump loop, compared to existing heat input systems, such that an optimal use of electrical and thermal power from the solar collector can be achieved. The system is anticipated to be used in remote locations where clean drinking water is often scarce, and a lack of existing infrastructure and highly trained labor do not allow for conventional desalination methods. A case study is then given that shows how the operating parameters of the system can be optimized such that the distillate output per unit of solar collector area is maximized. Finally, the model predicts that the proposed system produces distillate at a rate of 30.7 kg/m(2)/day given a case study location of Phoenix Arizona. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Integrating solar energy into conventional fossil-fuel fired power plant has been proven to be an efficient way to use solar energy for power generation purpose. In a solar-aided power generation (SAPG) system without storage system, owing to the instability of solar radiation, the turbine and the boiler work under off-design conditions most of time. In this paper, a modified simulation model is established to analyze the off-design performance of SAPG system. In order to speed up the calculations of the model, improved Matrix Thermal Balance Equation (MTBE) approach is used. A solar-aided feedwater heating of a 330 MW coal-fired power generation unit in fuel-saving operation mode is discussed as a case study. The results show that, in a SAPG system, when HP extraction steam is partly replaced, with the increasing solar energy being introduced, the temperature of exhaust flue gas decreases; boiler efficiency improves and standard coal consumption rate decreases. With more solar heat introduced the temperature of superheated and reheated steam keep constant at first and then decrease rapidly. However, in real project, the temperature drop should be no more the permissible limits, which should be considered. The results obtained in the current study could provide a promising approach to find the balance between coal saving and safe operation of the SAPG system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Solid and liquid products from bamboo (Bambusa sinospinosa) torrefaction were analyzed in the present study. Three different torrefaction temperatures of 250, 300, and 350 degrees C and three torrefaction durations of 30, 60, and 90 min are taken into consideration. The properties of both solid and liquid products are sensitive to the torrefaction temperature, whereas the influence of duration is relatively slight. Among the torrefaction temperatures of 250, 300, and 350 degrees C, 300 degrees C is recommended for upgrading bamboo in that it gives a more appropriate operation to enhance the higher heating value of the biomass while the solid yield is not too low. In the liquid products or condensable liquids, acids, alcohols, ketones, phenols, aldehydes, esters, etc. are detected. The contents of acids and alcohols in the liquids are richer, and acid formation is especially significant at the torrefaction temperature of 250 degrees C. The pH value of the condensable liquid is in the range of 2.27 and 2.60 which is close to that of bio-oil. The water content in the liquid product is around 50% and an increase in torrefaction temperature lowers the content. After undergoing dewatering, the calorific value of the liquid product is enlarged in a significant way. The results show that dewatering is an important process to upgrade the liquid product as a fuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The continuous increase in energy demand and the integration of a large number of renewable energy sources with intermittent production require an advanced energy management to guarantee an uninterrupted supply. Deployment of smart meters in wide areas of power networks and availability of affordable storage systems encourage development and implementation of local energy management systems. Local energy management is considered a feasible and inexpensive approach to reduce the impact of load variations and intermittent generation. Demand response and load shaping techniques provide customers with the facility to contribute to system balancing and improve power quality. This paper presents a building energy management which determines the optimal scheduling of the components of the local energy system. The developed two-stage optimization is based on a receding horizon strategy and minimizes the energy costs under consideration of the physical system constraints. The proposed building energy management has been implemented and tested with a medium-size hotel emulated in a microgrid testbed using power-hardware-in-the-loop techniques. The obtained results underline that energy management strategies can be validated under realistic conditions using flexible power scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The primary goal of this paper is to investigate the catalyst characterization and biodiesel yield of a biodiesel converted from a used cooking oil source via heterogeneous catalysts derived from very rare type of eggshell: ostrich-eggshell (ostrich-eggshell derived CaO). It also aims to compare the performance of CaO catalyst derived from both waste ostrich-eggshell and the conventional chicken-eggshell, and to find the optimum conditions for biodiesel production. The prepared catalysts were then characterized by using XRD, FT-IR, BET, SEM, TGA and CO2-TPD. The parametric effects on the biodiesel production, such as catalyst concentration, molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction temperature, reaction time, speed and reusability of the catalyst were investigated. The experimental result showed that 1.5 wt.% catalyst, 12:1 M ratio of methanol to oil, 65 degrees C reaction temperature, 2 h reaction time with speed of 250 rpm gave the best results. It was found that the ostrich-eggshell derived CaO catalyst shows higher surface area, higher basicity and smaller particle size. The maximum biodiesel yield is 96% and 94% for calcined ostrich-eggshell and chicken-eggshell, respectively. The CaO catalyst derived from waste calcined ostrich and chicken-eggshell maintained a good catalytic activity even after being repeatedly used for 5 cycles with yield around 70%, which implies potential saving and affordable biodiesel production possibilities.

Abstract: A novel concept of improved configuration of lignite pre-drying using a supplementary steam cycle incorporated in a lignite fired supercritical power plant was proposed in this study. Differing from the conventional lignite pre-drying power plant configuration, in this lignite pre-drying power plant (LPDPP) concept, the steam bleeds for the dryer and some regenerative heaters (RHs) are redirected from the high pressure turbines and low pressure turbines through a separate turbine named the Regenerative-turbine (R-turbine). With the R-turbine in place, the degree of super-heating of the bleeds for the dryer and for RH3-RH5 is significantly reduced, thus leading to a reduction in the heat transfer temperature difference and exergy destruction rate. The net energy efficiency and the economic benefits of the proposed LPDPP are also enhanced as compared to the conventional configuration. The analysis showed that, for a 600 MW supercritical LPDPP, the exergy destruction of the dryer could be reduced from 14.23 MWth in the conventional configuration to 13.25 MWth in the proposed design. The net energy efficiency could be further improved by 0.3 percentages points with a heat rate reduction of approximately 59.4 kJ/kW h. The net economic benefit of the proposed LPDPP could reach $47.6 M per year, which is $0.9 M greater than that of the conventional lignite pre-drying unit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, a new paraffin/expanded vermiculite composite phase change material (PCM) was tailor-made as aggregate for developing lightweight thermal energy storage cement-based composites (LW-TESCCs). Vermiculite calcined at 800 degrees C for 1 h (EVM-800) can be considered as the optimum paraffin supporting matrix candidate, as it has the best expanded microstructure and crystallization. The composite PCM was fabricated at a paraffin-to-EVM-800 weight ratio of 0.6:1.0 by the vacuum impregnation method. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) show that the paraffin can be well vacuum drawn into the expanded interlayer spaces of EVM-800, and that the paraffin and EVM-800 are chemically inert. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results reveal that the composite PCM has an onset melting temperature of 27.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C and latent heat of 77.6 +/- 4.3 J/g, and good thermal stability is clearly suggested by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. Moreover, the LW-TESCCs with bulk densities below 1500 kg/m(3) were further developed by incorporating the composite PCM as sand replacement. It is found that the LW-TESCCs have significantly improved thermal resistance performance and well-endowed thermal storage capabilities. Thus, it can be expected that the potential applications of the LW-TESCCs in building envelopes would significantly contribute to reducing indoor air temperature fluctuations and in saving energy.

Abstract: In order to mitigate the fuel shortage in porous electrode of planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), this work presents a novel spiral-like SOFC interconnector which could achieve a tight gas sealing and sufficient electrical contact between the interconnector and electrode or gas supply line. A naphthalene sublimation mass transfer experiment at room temperature is applied to verify the superiority of the new structure. A 3-D model is set up by COMSOL 3.5A and the cell is operated with the mixture of H-2 and H2O as fuel at 1023 K. The experimental results and simulation results show that this new structure could improve the mass transfer performance of SOFC greatly. Comparing with traditional direct channel interconnector, this new design could not only improve the gas velocity in porous electrode which parallel to the triple phase boundary (TPB), but also enhance the gas velocity perpendicular to it. The H-2 molar fraction in porous anode with this spiral-like interconnector is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that with direct channel interconnector both at room temperature and high temperature. These improvements would be helpful to increase the fuel availability and enhance the electrical performance of SOFCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The management of energy and water is increasingly gaining attention among domestic end-users. In developing countries, potable water supply is unreliable leading to alternative strategies such as rooftop water harvesting (RWH), storage and pumping. Since urban garden irrigation is the highest outdoor water consumer, optimal scheduling is important to conserve energy and water over conventional lawn irrigation methods. A model to optimally control the lawn irrigation was developed with the simulation results showing 17.4% potential water savings when using water directly from municipal sources. With RWH of a 1-h event with 1-mm rainfall from a 120-m(2) roof, the model can potentially save 23.4% of water and 73.8% in energy costs per day. Such savings are important in reducing the demand for existing water and energy sources as well as greenhouse emissions. Further, this paper looks into two strategies to maximize the pump's life through minimizing the maintenance cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The energy efficiency and sustainability of an anaerobic green gas production pathway was evaluated, taking into account five biomass feedstocks, optimization of the green gas production pathway, replacement of current waste management pathways by mitigation, and transport of the feedstocks. Sustainability is expressed by three main factors: efficiency in (Process) Energy Returned On Invested (P)EROI, carbon footprint in Global Warming Potential GWP(100), and environmental impact in EcoPoints. The green gas production pathway operates on a mass fraction of 50% feedstock with 50% manure. The sustainability of the analyzed feedstocks differs substantially, favoring biomass waste flows over, the specially cultivated energy crop, maize. The use of optimization, in the shape of internal energy production, green gas powered trucks, and mitigation can significantly improve the sustainability for all feedstocks, but favors waste materials. Results indicate a possible improvement from an average (P) EROI for all feedstocks of 2.3 up to an average of 7.0 GJ/GJ The carbon footprint can potentially be reduced from an average of 40 down to 18 kgCO(2)eq/GJ. The environmental impact can potentially be reduced from an average of 5.6 down to 1.8 Pt/GJ. Internal energy production proved to be the most effective optimization. However, the use of optimization aforementioned will result in les green gas injected into the gas grid as it is partially consumed internally. Overall, the feedstock straw was the most energy efficient, where the feedstock harvest remains proved to be the most environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, transport distances of all feedstocks should not exceed 150 km or emissions and environmental impacts will surpass those of natural gas, used as a reference. Using green gas as a fuel can increase the acceptable transportation range to over 300 km. Within the context aforementioned and from an energy efficiency and sustainable point of view, the anaerobic digestion process should be utilized for processing locally available waste feedstocks with the added advantage of producing energy, which should first be used internally for powering the green gas production process.

Abstract: Ignition and burnout temperatures are important properties of solid fuels for their applications in industry. In this study, the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of bamboo and sugarcane bagasse at five different heating rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 degrees C min(-1) are performed. The intersection method (IM) and deviation method (DM) are employed to approach the ignition temperatures of the two biomass species, while IM and the conversion method (CM) are adopted to analyze their burnout temperatures. In IM and CM, both the ignition and burnout temperatures increase with increasing heating rate, as a consequence of the pronounced thermal lag in biomass particles at high heating rates. The measured ignition temperatures based on DM are lower than those based on IM, and there is no correlation between the temperature and heating rate. The determined burnout temperatures from IM are close to those obtained from CM, while the difference in the burnout temperatures of the two biomass samples is small. The ignition temperatures of the two biomass species measured from IM are between 250 and 300 degrees C, and their burnout temperatures are close to 500 degrees C. As a whole, IM is recommended for determining the ignition temperature of biomass, while CM is a feasible and simple route to approach the burnout temperature. The heating rates in TGA between 20 and 30 degrees C min(-1) are suggested because of their accurate and time-saving operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Distributed combustion has demonstrated significant performance gains, especially on combustion efficiency and near zero pollutants emission. Controlled mixture preparation between air, fuel and internal hot reactive gases prior to mixture ignition is a critical requirement to achieve distributed combustion condition. Though distributed combustion have been extensively studied using a variety of geometries, heat loads and intensities, and fuels, limited information is available on the role of hot reactive gas entrainment and the resultant thermal field uniformity. In this paper, the impact of internal entrainment of hot reactive gases on thermal field uniformity and pollutants emission is investigated. A mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide was introduced to the fresh air stream prior to mixing with the fuel and its subsequent combustion to simulate the product gases from within the combustor. Increase in the amounts of nitrogen and carbon dioxide (simulating increased entrainment) significantly reduced pollutants emission, enhanced thermal field uniformity, and increased the reaction volume to occupy larger portion of the combustor. This was evident through spatial temperature measurements in the combustor along with the enhanced distribution of the flame visible signature and OH* chemiluminescence signal. The temperature data demonstrated that lowering oxygen concentration from 21% to 15%, through increased entrainment, promoted distributed combustion conditions with lower overall temperature rise throughout the combustor. In addition, the peak temperature regions associated with swirl burners disappeared, eliminating most of the hot spots in the combustor. The enhanced thermal field uniformity and reduced temperature variation provided ultra-low emissions, demonstrating the impact of enhanced thermal flowfield uniformity on emissions. Experiments performed at different equivalence ratios and entrained gas temperatures demonstrated similar behavior of thermal field uniformity and ultra-low emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, the design and performance of a real 11.04 kWp grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system is investigated. This plant is composed of two types of 5.52 kWp common crystalline PV technology with almost similar characteristics. The PV power plant is established in an industrial sector of Kerman, Iran which experiences the same fluctuations in solar irradiance and ambient temperature for both types of monocrystalline silicon (mc-Si) and polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) PV modules. For experimental investigation of the plant, all meteorological and performance data of PV power plant are acquired by means of dedicated systems during July 2013 to June 2014. Thus, in this pioneer study, performance evaluations of two types of crystalline PV technology are studied, and as a part of considerations in the PV power plant design, the output power from p-Si PV modules is found greater. The annual average daily final yield (Y-f), performance ratio (PR), and capacity factor (CF) for mc-Si are found to be 5.24 kW h/kWp day, 80.81%, and 23.20%, respectively. Furthermore, Y-f, PR, and CF for p-Si are estimated as 5.38 kW h/kWp day, 82.92%, and 23.81%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The efficient utilization of the waste heat with mid-low temperature from the combined heating and power (CHP) system is crucial for the improvement of the energy efficiency. In the CHP system, the waste heat with mid-low temperature was directly used to generate domestic hot water or heat by the heat exchanger. Different from common methods, in this paper a new utilization approach of the waste heat with mid-low temperature by integrating the CHP system and the ground source heat pump (GSHP) was proposed, and a new coupling system was designed based on the integrating mechanism. Numerical simulations were implemented to investigate the performances of the proposed coupling system. The influence characteristics of the temperature of the warm water generated by the GSHP on system performances, including the coefficient of performance (COP) of the GSHP, the heat output and the total energy efficiency, were revealed. The results showed that with the same input and heat output, the proposed system can generate more power than the reference system, and the total energy efficiency and the COP of the GSHP were simultaneously improved.

Abstract: The integration of photovoltaic as a fluctuating renewable energy source has raised concerns about additional costs for the electricity system due to the variable nature of power output leading to more frequent and steeper ramping of conventional power plants and the need for backup capacity. One way to reduce those costs can be the variation of installation angles of PV panels at different locations to smoothen out the total production from PV in the whole system. To a certain extent steeper tilt angles can shift the production from summer months to winter months and the variation of the azimuth from east to west can partly shift production during the day increasing the production in morning or afternoon hours. However, for fixed mounted PV panels, there is one angle combination that maximizes the total output of the PV panel throughout the year and each deviation from this angle combination results in losses of total output. This paper evaluates the trade-off between annual energy losses and possible electricity generation cost reductions through adapting PV installation angles for the current electricity system and for potentially higher PV penetration levels in the future. A theoretical explanation why the annual maximum output of a PV system is not always the optimal solution from a system perspective is presented. To assess the effects of deviations from output maximizing angles at present, the wholesale market value of PV for various tilt angles and orientations in 23 regions of Austria and Germany using historic data on solar radiation and hourly electricity prices is calculated. For the analysis of future system states with potentially high shares of PV in the market, a linear optimization model representing the German and Austrian electricity wholesale market is applied. Furthermore the article provides additional insights on the market value of PV and CO2 emission reduction potential at high PV penetration levels from the model.
Both, the historic analyses and the model results for Austria and Germany suggest that at present PV penetration levels, the angle combination that maximizes the output of a PV system also provides the highest spot market value and consequently minimal total system costs. For higher shares of PV in the system the model suggests deviations from those angle combinations to be optimal. For additional PV capacity of up to 40 GW (72 GW in total) a slight shift to easterly orientated PV modules is observed. For very high penetration levels of more than additional 100 GW optimal deviation angles deviate strongly from the output maximizing angles and the model shows optimal angles to be up to 20 steeper and orientations from east to west. However, the impact on total electricity generation costs is very low even for extremely high shares of PV in the system (<1% change in total costs). It is also found that despite of optimized installation angles, the average market value of electricity production from PV drops significantly from 41 (sic)/MW h at the base year 2012 to below 24 (sic)/MW h for additional 40 GW which has strong implications for the competitiveness of PV in the future. Marginal CO2 emission reductions however decline slower than the market values as PV cuts into production from coal power plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Gasoline and diesel as fuels for internal combustion engines have been commonly available and used for decades. In this study, the performance and emission formation of a direct injection engine fueled with gasoline/diesel blend fuel are investigated numerically. Simulations are conducted on pure diesel and its blend fuels with 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% gasoline at an engine speed of 2800 rpm under 10%, 50% and 100% loads. A reduced PR? (primary reference fuel) mechanism which consists of 45 species and 142 reactions is used in coupled KIVA4-CHEMKIN code for detailed chemistry calculations. In this mechanism, gasoline and diesel are represented by iso-octane and n-heptane, respectively. Comparing the results among different blend conditions, it is found that the ignition delay time is extended by increasing the ratio of gasoline in blend fuels. However, this extended ignition delay has diverse effects on engine performance for different engine loads. At low load, pure diesel condition achieves a better performance; in contrast, a better performance could be realized by blend fuels at medium and high loads, though a slightly higher NOx emission level.

Abstract: Wheat bran, generated from the milling of wheat, represents a promising feedstock for the production of bioethanol. This substrate consists of three main components: starch, hemicellulose and cellulose. The optimal conditions for wheat bran hydrolysis have been determined using a recombinant cellulase cocktail (RCC), which contains two cellobiohydrolases, an endoglucanase and a beta-glucosidase. The 10% (w/v, expressed in terms of dry matter) substrate loading yielded the most glucose, while the 2% loading gave the best hydrolysis efficiency (degree of saccharification) using unmilled wheat bran. The ethanol production of two industrial amylolytic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, MEL2[TLG1-SFA1] and M2n [TLG1-SFA1], were compared in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for 10% wheat bran loading with or without the supplementation of optimised RCC. The recombinant yeasts. cerevisiae MEL2[TLG1-SFA1] and M2n[TLG1-SFA1] completely hydrolysed wheat bran's starch producing similar amounts of ethanol (5.3 +/- 0.14 g/L and 5.0 +/- 0.09 g/L, respectively). Supplementing SSF with RCC resulted in additional ethanol production of about 2.0 g/L. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the effectiveness of both RCC and engineered amylolytic strains in terms of cellulose and starch depolymerisation.
This study demonstrated that untreated wheat bran could be a promising ready-to-use substrate for ethanol production. The addition of crude recombinant cellulases improved ethanol yields in the SSF process and S. cerevisiae MEL2[TLG1-SFA1] and M2n[TLG1-SFA1] strains can efficiently convert wheat bran's starch to ethanol.

Abstract: The variety of available technical building equipment leads to increasingly complex heating systems with various requirements for efficient operation. Furthermore, in existing buildings the heating system is often historically evolved and contains parts having different ages. Those systems have limited capacity to suit the requirements of replaced components. This paper investigates the operational behavior of small-scale pellet heating systems in Austria and Germany, considering installations in new buildings and boiler replacements in existing buildings and how they are influencing the customer satisfaction.
This investigation was carried out by means of a comprehensive survey for residential customers using pellet fired heating systems. More than 2500 questionnaires were distributed between 2011 and 2013 in Austria, Germany, Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom. In total 293 returned questionnaires were evaluated. The efficiency of the monitored heating systems was estimated using surveyed boiler parameters. Successively, the influence of different operational parameters on the boilers efficiency was evaluated with a statistical analysis, using Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman correlation.
Results showed that the correct installation of the monitored pellet heating system is easier for new buildings compared to the replacement of old fossil boilers in existing buildings. Optimal operating conditions are characterized by less frequent ignitions and by higher operational loads. Pellet systems operated with a high efficiency in both building types, but for new buildings it is more likely to occur. More than 87% of the participating customers stated that they are highly satisfied with their pellet boiler. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate particle emission characteristics from a spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) engine fueled with ethanol-gasoline blends. Particulate matter (PM) from internal combustion engine is a complex mixture of substances deemed harmful for the human body. Consequently, they are regulated by stringent legislation. According to the Euro-6 regulation, the standard for particle number (PN) emissions of SIDI vehicles is 6.0 x 10(11) N/km. Recent studies have reported that SIDI engines, renowned for their feasibility in reducing CO2 emissions, could produce excessive amounts of PM due to its structural characteristics. For this reason, there have been many studies on reducing PM emissions from SIDI engines to satisfy strict emission standards. Because ethanol contains an oxygen atom in each molecule, it has a significant influence on combustion performance and characteristics of vehicular discharge, including PM. This study focused on the effect of intermediate ethanol blends from E0 (pure gasoline fuel) to E20 (gasoline fuel with 20% volume of ethanol) on engine performance, size-resolved particle emissions, and engine startability. Particle emission characteristics including particle number and size distribution at part-load test and start performance were investigated with operation points, fuel pressure and injection timing.

Abstract: This paper studies the combustion and emission characteristics of three low octane fuels: naphtha, the blend of gasoline and diesel (G70D30), and the blend of gasoline and n-heptane (G70H30) in Multiple Premixed Compression Ignition (MPCI) mode. A commercial diesel fuel is also tested in conventional diesel combustion mode and double injection mode as a comparison. The study is carried out in a single cylinder diesel engine with a compression ratio of 16.7. By varying the common rail pressure, the effect of injection pressure on combustion and emissions is investigated.
The results illustrate that the combustion delay of the gasoline-type fuels is extended with the increase of injection pressure. The soot emission decreases at high injection pressure with a penalty of higher CO and HC emissions. Increasing the injection pressure also reduces the particle number in accumulation mode, but produces more in nucleation mode. Among the test fuels, naphtha has the lowest NO emission due to low combustion temperature but the highest CO and HC emissions. There is no significant difference in particle size distribution for the three fuels. The indicated thermal efficiency of gasoline-type fuels increases with the rise of injection pressure and is higher than that of diesel at high injection pressure. Naphtha has the highest efficiency as a result of its low heat transfer and exhaust loss.
The diesel fuel has lower CO and HC emissions than the gasoline-type fuels do, but much higher pressure rise rate, NO and soot emissions due to high combustion temperature and poor premixing. Therefore, the low octane gasoline fuels are more suitable than the diesel for compression ignition engines in terms of the emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The present paper analyzes the feasibility of an exhaust gas driven jet-ejector cooling system for charge air cooling of turbocharged gasoline engines in addition to the conventional charge air cooler to increase the engine efficiency. Thereto, steady-state experiments of a jet-ejector cooling system and an exhaust gas heat exchanger prototype working with the refrigerant R134a are used to analyze the operation and control of the compound system and determine feasible cooling capacities, charge air temperatures, thermal COPth and hydraulic COPh. Moreover, the cooling system is rated regarding its power densities and engine backpressure. The exhaust gas waste heat recovery, system power densities, and engine back-pressure are acceptable. However, the hydraulic COPh and the amount of reject heat need to be improved, necessitating for instance a multi-staging of the jet-ejection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The reform of tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE) in China was implemented nationwide in July 2012. The main purpose of the policy is to promote reasonable resource allocation and utilization. Based on the micro household-level survey data, this paper investigates the effect of the TPHE on achieving the twin objectives of efficiency and equity respectively. Results demonstrate that under the current scheme of the TPHE, the incentives for electricity conservation are effective and the distortion of cross-subsidies in electricity tariffs in China has been reduced. However, price sensitivities of household electricity demand across different income groups are influenced by various factors. Future policy should concentrate on the design and improvement of the TPHE to establish a comprehensive pricing mechanism. Meanwhile, complementary policies should be enacted to support the TPHE, which will be helpful for further improvement of the TPHE and the establishment of other pricing mechanisms of resource-products in the residential sector.

Abstract: This study developed an online suboptimal energy management system by using improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) for engine/motor hybrid electric vehicles. The vehicle was modeled on the basis of second-order dynamics, and featured five major segments: a battery, a spark ignition engine, a lithium battery, transmission and vehicle dynamics, and a driver model. To manage the power distribution of dual power sources, the IPSO was equipped with three inputs (rotational speed, battery state-of-charge, and demanded torque) and one output (power split ratio). Five steps were developed for IPSO: (1) initialization; (2) determination of the fitness function; (3) selection and memorization; (4) modification of position and velocity; and (5) a stopping rule. Equivalent fuel consumption by the engine and motor was used as the fitness function with five particles, and the IPSO-based vehicle control unit was completed and integrated with the vehicle simulator. To quantify the energy improvement of IPSO, a four-mode rule-based control (system ready, motor only, engine only, and hybrid modes) was designed according to the engine efficiency and rotational speed. A three-loop Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) was coded as the best case. The simulation results revealed that IPSO searches the optimal solution more efficiently than conventional PSO does. In two standard driving cycles, ECE and FTP, the improvements in the equivalent fuel consumption and energy consumption compared to baseline were (24.25%, 45.27%) and (31.85%, 56.41%), respectively, for the IPSO. The CO2 emission for all five cases (pure engine, rule-based, PSO, IPSO, ECMS) was compared. These results verify that IPSO performs outstandingly when applied to manage hybrid energy. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) implementation and a real vehicle test will be conducted in the near future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The stability of output performance plays a very important role in the thermoelectric generation (TEG) system since the fluctuation problem of heat source widely exists in the industry which releases the waste heat, and the fluctuating process will cause the instability and low efficiency of the TEG system. In this article, a novel TEG system with thermal switch was proposed to address this serious problem. In order to obtain the detailed characteristics of the TEG system with thermal switch, experimental and dynamic modeling methods were employed. The experimental and modeling results show that the thermal switch can efficiently reduce the temperature fluctuation and increase the output power and efficiency of the TEG system; in addition, there is an optimal turning on/off temperature to maximally increase the output power and electricity efficiency of the TEG system. The comparison between the numerical data and the experimental results has further demonstrated the proposed model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was used as a catalytic solution and the solid-state sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were stored in a reacting chamber. The NaHCO3 solution was injected when the hydrogen is needed. The hydrogen generation rate was measured as various conditions such as the temperature, and the concentration and injection speed of NaHCO3 solution. The hydrogen generation was initiated immediately when the NaHCO3 solution was injected. The hydrogen generation rate and NaBH4 conversion increased with increasing the NaHCO3 concentration but decreased with increasing the injection speed of NaHCO3 solution. Based on above results, a prototype of hydrogen generation system was developed. The system consisted of a chamber containing solid NaBH4 particles, an aqueous NaHCO3 tank, a liquid pump, valves, cooling fans and sensors. The liquid pump supplied the NaHCO3 solution to the NaBH4 chamber through an injector. The temperature and pressure of the NaBH4 chamber were monitored during the reaction and maintained into 70 degrees C and 2 bar, respectively. The liquid pump was stopped when the pressure reached 2 bar, while it was restarted to generate hydrogen when the pressure was less than 2 bar because the fuel cell consumed hydrogen during the operation. The hydrogen generation system can provide the stable hydrogen to operate the fuel cell. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper describes the investigation of a hybrid power production system from biomass and solar energy. This paper suggests integration through heat exchanger network as a useful approach to obtain the synergy between biomass and solar. Biomass is first gasified in a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) gasifier, and then syngas is used in a gas turbine. Excess heat exists in this sub-system and concentrated solar thermal process (CSTP) while there is a demand of steam for generating gasifying agent. Steam Rankine cycle exploits the heat created by these thermal streams to generate power while satisfying the steam demands. Thermodynamic performance was analyzed by process modelling with a semi-kinetic model of BFB gasifier and pinch analyses. The composition and temperature of gasifying agent showed some effect on the overall efficiency of the system. Higher overall efficiency of the system was achieved at higher temperature and higher O-2 fraction in the O-2-steam mixture as gasifying agent. The increase in thermal input from CSTP had positive effect on overall efficiency of the hybrid system until thermal input from CSTP becomes dominant against thermal stream related to the gasifier and the gas turbine.

Abstract: The energy and environmental merits of three types of internal-combustion-engine primed trigeneration (ICEPT) systems were investigated when compared with a conventional chilled water system powered by the grid electricity for use in a high-rise office building in Hong Kong. With the employment of the ICE PT systems, the year-round total electricity demand from the building was reduced by at most 10.4% for the natural-gas-fueled one. However, the saving in the total primary energy consumption (PEC) only ranged from 1.7% to 6.8% with the diesel-oil-fueled system being the best although for all the three types of ICEPT systems more than 70% of the energy from the fuel had been utilized. The huge difference in the coefficient of performance (COP) between the absorption chiller and the vapor-compression chiller was the main cause which impaired the benefit of recovering the waste heat to provide space cooling. The total carbon dioxide emission (CDE) varied widely with the types of fuels adopted with a maximum of 26.7% for the natural-gas-fueled system which was due to the lower carbon dioxide emission index of natural gas as compared to other fuel types. The overall ranking of the ICEPT systems depended on the weighing between energy and environmental merits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient two stage stochastic optimal energy and reserve management approach is proposed for a microgrid. In the first stage, the optimal power schedule is determined based on the load, wind and solar power forecasts. The possible uncertainties in forecasts are expressed as perturbations in nodal power injections and the corresponding optimal spinning reserves are estimated using sensitivity analysis. Using this information system, the actual spinning reserve for the discrepancy between the measured and forecasted data is directly dispatched at stage-2, utilizing the remaining capacity of demand response, grid purchase and other non-renewable distributed energy resources (DERs). A stochastic perturbed optimal power flow COPE) based on affine arithmetic (AA) and stochastic weight tradeoff particle swarm optimization (SWT-PSO) is proposed and investigated on CIGRE LV benchmark microgrid. The approach is found to be better in terms of operational planning, real time computation and bounds of power flow & cost variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The commercial jet fuels usually contain about 40% aromatics and naphthene. However, conventional technologies on bio-jet fuels production by hydrodeoxygenation of plant oil and biomass gasification/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can't produce renewable aromatics. In this paper, the liquid fuels with high aromatics content were produced by aqueous phase catalytic conversion of biomass sugar/polyol over Ni@HZSM-5/MCM-41 catalysts. Liquid fuel yield of 32 wt% with aromatics content of 84.3% was obtained under the conditions of 300 degrees C, WHSV of 1.25 h(-1), GHSV of 2500 h(-1) and 4.0 MPa of hydrogen pressure with mixed polyol (60% sorbitol + 40% xylitol) as feedstocks. The produced bio-aromatics are substituted benzenes, naphthalenes, and aromatic olefins, which is a wonderful crude oil to be used as jet fuels after it was hydrogenated to improve quality (deep deoxygenation/chemical bond saturation).

Abstract: Pretreatment is a crucial processing step in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass (LB) into methane by anaerobic digestion. A physicochemical LB pretreatment method, i.e., using an extruder to reduce the biomass size prior to sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment, was reported. The optimal condition for economic feasibility and pretreatment efficiency was an alkaline loading rate of 3.0% at 35 degrees C for 48 h. Under this condition, the methane production from the rice straw that was processed by extrusion combined with NaOH pretreatment was 54.0% higher than that of a control sample. The energy recovery (ER) efficiency improved from 38.9% to 59.9% using the combination pretreatment. The mechanisms that caused the significant improvement in the methane production and ER efficiency in the extrusion-NaOH pretreatment were investigated. The pretreatment changed the physical properties (water-holding capacity, specific porosity, specific surface area and crystallinity index), the chemical composition (lignin, benzene-ethanol extractives and hot-water extractives) and the chemical structure, which increased degradation of holocelluloses and other difficulty biodegradable compounds.

Abstract: The study aims to evaluate the sugarcane biorefinery and molasses ethanol production in Thailand using the combined environmental and economic sustainability indicator, so called "Eco-efficiency". Four sugarcane biorefinery scenarios in Thailand are evaluated. The total output values (US$) and the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (kg CO(2)eq) are selected as the indicators for characterizing economic and environmental performance, respectively. The results show that the biorefinery system of mechanized farming along with cane trash utilization for power generation yields the highest eco-efficiency. The benefits come from the increased value added of the biorefinery together with the decreased GHG emissions of the biorefinery system. As compared to the base case scenario, the new systems proposed result in the eco-efficiency improvement by around 20-70%. The biorefinery concept induces reduction of GHG emissions attributed to molasses ethanol. Green cane production and harvesting results in further lowering of the GHG emissions. Integration of sugarcane biomass utilization across the entire sugarcane complex would enhance the sustainability of the sugarcane production system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: It is becoming widely recognized that our society must transition to low-carbon energy systems to combat global climate change, and renewable energy sources are needed to provide energy security in a world with limited fossil-fuel resources. While many clean power-generation solutions have been proposed and are being developed, our ability to transition to a low-carbon society is prevented by the present lack of clean and renewable energy carriers that can replace the crucial roles that fossil fuels play, due to their abundance, convenience and performance, in global energy trade and transportation. Any future low-carbon energy carriers that aim to displace or supplement fossil fuels must have high energy densities for convenient trade and storage, and should be consumable within efficient high-power-density engines for transportation, heavy machinery, and other off-grid energy applications.
Hydrogen and batteries have been widely studied but they are not suitable for use as international energy-trading commodities and they cannot provide the energy density and safety demanded by society. Metal fuels, produced using low-carbon recycling systems powered by clean primary energy, such as solar and wind, promise energy densities that are competitive to fossil fuels with low, or even negative, net carbon dioxide emissions. To date, however, few practical high-power-density end-use devices for generating heat or power from metal fuels have been proposed.
This paper proposes a novel concept for power generation in which metal fuels are burned with air in a combustor to provide clean, high-grade heat. The metal-fuel combustion heat can be used directly for industrial or residential heating and can also power external-combustion engines, operating on the Rankine or Stirling cycles, or thermo-electric generators over a wide range of power levels. A design concept is proposed for a metal-fuelled combustor that is based upon extensive experimental and theoretical studies of stabilized and propagating metal flames performed at McGill University. This paper also reviews the fundamental and applied aspects of metal-fuel combustion in order to provide the framework needed to assess any potential metal engine technologies. The energy and power densities of the proposed metal-fuelled zero-carbon heat engines are predicted to be close to current fossil-fuelled internal-combustion engines, making them an attractive technology for a future low-carbon society.

Abstract: A new jetting pre-oxidation fluidized bed gasification (JPFBG) process, mainly consisting of jetting pre-oxidation zone and char gasification zone, has been proposed and developed by Institute of Process Engineering (IPE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to utilize cohesive washing middling coal effectively for fuel gas production and thus replacing the valuable coke oven gas. This article is devoted to summarizing the results obtained in the fundamental studies and a pilot plant. The fundamental studies conducted on an externally heated laboratory JPFB gasification setup demonstrated that the appropriate operating conditions for the pre-oxidation zone and the char gasification zone were at temperature of 950 degrees C with an excessive air ratio (ER) of about 0.13, and at temperature of 1000 degrees C with an ER of 0.17 and a mass ratio of steam to coal of 0.09, respectively. Based on these condition data, an autothermal pilot system with a treating capacity of 150 kg/h for strong cohesive coal was built and tested to demonstrate the JPFB gasification process. Keeping the temperatures of the pre-oxidization zone and char gasification zone at about 950 degrees C and 1000 degrees C respectively, the higher heating value of the produced fuel gas was close to 4000 kJ/N m(3). The obtained typical results from the continuously steady operations of the pilot plant fully verified the technical feasibility and clarified the technical features of the tested new JPFB gasification process.

Abstract: Microfluidic fuel cell (MFC) is a promising energy source for portable applications, which draws lots of R&D attention. However, MFCs fed with hydrocarbon fuel like formic acid suffers low fuel utilization problem because of sluggish kinetics, complicate reaction condition and dilemma on cell control. In this work, a formic acid MFC based on counter-flow design is proposed. This counter-flow structure is verified a promising design for high Graetz number operation, which is especially beneficial for high fuel utilization manipulation of MFC. A breakthrough in fuel utilization is achieved and the highest fuel utilization of 91.4% is obtained at 1 mu L min(-1). It is revealed that counter-flow MFC is capable for low flow rate operation, which is significant for reduce the pump energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency of MFC system. Each potential loss involved in counter-flow MFC is categorized and it is found that potential loss caused by internal resistance hinders performance mostly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experiment and simulation study of a free piston linear engine based on operating conditions and structure of the linear engine for generating electric power. The free piston linear engine includes a two-stroke free piston engine, linear generators, and compressors. In the experimental study, the effects of key parameters such as input caloric value, equivalence ratio, spark timing delay, electrical resistance, and air gap length on the piston dynamics and electric power output are investigated. Propane is used as a fuel in the free piston linear engine, and it is premixed with the air to make a homogeneous charge before go into the cylinder. The air and fuel mass flow rate are varied by a mass flow controller. The experimental results show that the maximum generating power is found with the value of 111 W at the input caloric value of 5.88 kJ/s, spark timing delay of 1.5 ms, equivalence ratio of 1.0, electric resistance of 30 Omega, and air gap length of 1.0 mm. In order to check the durability of the linear engine, a durable test is conducted during 100 h. The experimental results show that there are no problems for the linear engine after about one hundred hours of the durable test. Beside experimental study, a simulation study is conducted to predict operating behavior of the linear engine. In the simulation study, the two-stroke free piston linear engine is modeled and simulated through a combination of three mathematical models including a dynamic model, a linear alternator model and a thermodynamic model. These mathematical models are combined and solved by a program written in Fortran. Besides, the effects of key parameters such as reciprocating mass, spark timing and spring stiffness on the piston dynamics and electric power output of the linear engine are also investigated. The simulation results show that the simulation and experimental data are nearly similar at the same initial conditions. In addition, a highest generating power of the linear engine can be easily found by optimizing the key parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The revolution of hydraulic fracturing has dramatically increased the supply and lowered the cost of natural gas in the United States driving an expansion of natural gas-fired generation capacity in many electrical grids. Unrelated to the natural gas expansion, lower capital costs and renewable portfolio standards are driving an expansion of intermittent renewable generation capacity such as wind and photovoltaic generation. These two changes may potentially combine to create new threats to the reliability of these interdependent energy infrastructures. Natural gas-fired generators are often used to balance the fluctuating output of wind generation. However, the time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying natural gas burn rates that impact the pressure in interstate transmission pipelines. Fluctuating pressure impacts the reliability of natural gas deliveries to those same generators and the safety of pipeline operations. We adopt a partial differential equation model of natural gas pipelines and use this model to explore the effect of intermittent wind generation on the fluctuations of pressure in natural gas pipelines. The mean square pressure fluctuations are found to grow linearly in time with points of maximum deviation occurring at the locations of flow reversals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An experimental study of thermal characteristics of a novel two-inlet air-based open-loop building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) system using a full-scale solar simulator is presented. Experimental prototypes of one-inlet and two-inlet BIPV/T systems were constructed for conducting comparative experiments. Variations of BIPV/T systems are also investigated including systems employing opaque monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) panels and systems employing semi-transparent mono-crystalline PV panels. Experimental results demonstrate that an equivalent two-inlet system with frameless PV panels can increase the thermal efficiency by 5% compared to a conventional one-inlet system, and that the BIPV/T system with semi-transparent PV panels achieves 7.6% higher thermal efficiency due to the absorption of some solar radiation at the bottom surface in the BIPV/T system cavity. Also, the two-inlet BIPV/T design is easily implemented and does not add significant cost. Detailed air temperature measurements reveal that the mixing of the warm outlet air from the first section and the cool ambient air drawn in from the second inlet contributes to the improved performance of the two-inlet system. Based on a thermal network model of the BIPV/T system and experimental data, correlations are developed for the convective heat transfer coefficients in the two sections. These are necessary for further analysis and development of BIPV/T system with multiple inlets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A new model is established to obtain the building energy with a gradual change process of VO2 optical properties. Based on this method, three types of existing VO2 films are employed to simulate the heating and cooling energy consumptions in five typical Chinese cities. The results show that the smart characteristic is not evident in VO2 glasses because these films are almost in the cold state or cold transition state in the entire year. To improve this situation, the concept of an ideal thermochromic intelligent glass is put forward. Unexpectedly, the level of energy consumption increases with the film phase transition temperature decreasing in the heating period. However, the energy-saving effects will be effectively improved both in the cooling and heating periods when the phase transition process interval is shortened. The cooling energy consumptions for the ideal glass decrease by at most 81.7% and 70.5% compared with white glass and Low-E glass, respectively. In the heating period, the level of energy consumption for the ideal glass is better than Low-E glass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Buildings account for approximately 32% of the total energy consumption globally and up to 40% in the developed countries, which makes buildings a prime target for energy conservation. Various energy conservation measures (ECMs) have been proposed to improve the energy efficiency in buildings, and these ECMs are usually designed and assessed using calibrated building energy models. However, there is empirical evidence that reveals noticeable discrepancies between simulated performances of ECMs reported in building energy models and their actual performances measured in buildings. This paper examines two possible causes of such discrepancies. Specifically, this paper tests the following two hypotheses: (1) using assumed occupancy data as opposed to actual occupancy data in building energy simulation reduces the reliability of estimated performance of demand-driven ECMs; and (2) using an energy model built for one ECM to cross estimate energy consumption of another ECM is statistically inaccurate. An educational building was used as a test bed. The results proved both hypotheses true, showing that estimations were more accurate and consistent for models calibrated using actual occupancy compared with those using assumed occupancy, and that cross-ECM estimation resulted in statistical inaccuracy. The findings indicated that current building energy modeling methods have limited reliability in ECM performance assessment, and need to be improved to better support the design and implementation of ECMs in buildings.

Abstract: Saving energy in greenhouses is an important issue for growers. Here, we present a method to minimize the total energy that is required to heat and cool a greenhouse. Using this method, the grower can define bounds for temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and the maximum amount of CO2 available. Given these settings, optimal control techniques can be used to minimize energy input. To do this, an existing greenhouse climate model for temperature and humidity was expanded to include a CO2 balance. Heating, cooling, the amount of natural ventilation, and the injection of industrial CO2 were used as control variables.
Standard optimization settings were defined in order to compare the grower's strategy with the optimal solution. This optimization resulted in a theoretical 47% reduction in heating, 15% reduction in cooling, and 10% reduction in CO2 injection for the year 2012. The optimal control does not need to maintain a minimum pipe temperature, in contrast to current practice. When the minimum pipe temperature strategy of the grower was implemented, heating and CO2 were reduced by 28% and 10% respectively.
We also analyzed the effect of different bounds on optimal energy input. We found that as more freedom is given to the climate variables, the higher the potential energy savings. However, in practice the grower is in charge of defining the bounds. Thus, the potential energy savings critically depend on the choice of these bounds. This effect was analyzed by varying the bounds. However, because the effect can be demonstrated to the grower, the outcome has value to the grower with respect to decision making, an option that is not currently available in practice today.

Abstract: The causes of uncertainty in wind farm power generation are not yet fully understood. A method for the scale division of wind power based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and Hurst analysis is proposed in this paper, which allows the various multi-scale chaotic characteristics of wind power to be investigated to reveal further information about the dynamic behavior of wind power. First, the time-frequency characteristics of wind power are analyzed using the HHT, and then Hurst analysis is applied to analyze the stochastic/persistent characteristics of the different time-frequency components. Second, based on their fractal structures, the components are superposed and reconstructed into three series, which are defined as the Micro-, Meso- and Macro-scale subsequences. Finally, indices related to the statistical and behavioral characteristics of the subsequences are calculated and used to analyze their nonlinear dynamic behavior. The data collected from a wind farm of Hebei Province, China, are selected for case studies. The simulation results reveal that (1) although the time-frequency components can be decomposed, the different fractal structures of the signal are also derived from the original series; (2) the three scale subsequences all present chaotic characteristics and each of them exhibits its own unique properties. The Micro-scale subsequence shows strong randomness and contributes the least to the overall fluctuations; the Macro-scale subsequence is the steadiest and exhibits the most significant tendency; the Meso-scale subsequence which possesses the greatest variance contribution rate and the maximum largest Lyapunov exponent, is the dominant factor driving the fluctuation and dynamic behavior of wind power; (3) the short-term predictions of these three subsequences based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) models have validated the above analysis results, which show that the number of steps of look-ahead predictability have pursued an ordinal trend in term of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the prediction error contribution rate of the Meso-scale subsequence is the maximum. Furthermore, the short-term wind power forecasting of 6-step-ahead based on the multi-scale analysis is performed by EMD-LSSVM + ELM and the normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) and normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) have been decreased by 49.45% and 44.30% compared with those of LSSVM, and 37.96% and 27.12% compared with those of EMD-LSSVM, respectively.

Abstract: The Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative system that presents good theoretical properties. These include a high thermodynamic efficiency, low emissions levels thanks to a controlled external heat source, and multi-fuel capability among others. However, the performance of actual prototypes largely differs from the mentioned theoretical potential. Actual engine prototypes present low electrical power outputs and high energy losses. These are mainly attributed to the complex interaction between the different components of the engine, and the challenging heat transfer and fluid dynamics requirements. Furthermore, the integration of the engine into decentralized energy systems such as the Combined Heat and Power systems (CHP) entails additional complications. These has increased the need for engineering tools that could assess design improvements, considering a broader range of parameters that would influence the engine performance when integrated within overall systems. Following this trend, the current work aimed to implement an analysis that could integrate the thermodynamics, and the thermal and mechanical interactions that influence the performance of kinematic Stirling engines. In particular for their use in Combined Heat and Power systems.
The mentioned analysis was applied for the study of an engine prototype that presented very low experimental performance. The numerical methodology was selected for the identification of possible causes that limited the performance. This analysis is based on a second order Stirling engine model that was previously developed and validated. The simulation allowed to evaluate the effect that different design and operational parameters have on the engine performance, and consequently different performance curves were obtained. These curves allowed to identify ranges for the charged pressure, temperature ratio, heat exchangers dimensions, crank phase angle and crank mechanical effectiveness, where the engine performance was improved. In addition, the curves also permitted to recognise ranges were the design parameters could drastically reduce the brake power and efficiency. The results also showed that the design of the engine is affected by the conditions imposed by the CHP interactions, and that the engine could reach a brake power closer to 832 W with a corresponding brake efficiency of 26% when the adequate design parameters were considered. On the other hand, the performance could also be very low; as the reported in experimental tests, with brake power measurements ranging 52-120W. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Real-time prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is an essential feature of a robust battery management system (BMS). In this work, a novel method for real-time RUL estimation of Li ion batteries is proposed that integrates classification and regression attributes of Support Vector (SV) based machine learning technique. Cycling data of Li-ion batteries under different operating conditions are analyzed, and the critical features are extracted from the voltage and temperature profiles. The classification and regression models for RUL are built based on the critical features using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification model provides a gross estimation, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used to predict the accurate RUL if the battery is close to the end of life (EOL). By the critical feature extraction and the multi-stage approach, accurate RUL prediction of multiple batteries is accomplished simultaneously, making the proposed method generic in nature. In addition to accuracy, the multistage approach results in faster computations, and hence a trained model can potentially be used for real-time onboard RUL estimation for electric vehicle battery packs.

Abstract: A three phase free piston type double acting Stirling engine model is proposed and validated using experimental results. The modeling strategy is based on a combination of two sub-models: a global thermal model of the engine to deal with heat sources coupling and a detailed equivalent electrical network model which accounts for the gas and mechanical dynamic physics of the engine. Derived features, such as the amplitude, the frequency, the compression and the expansion powers are then finally obtained. The model is experimentally validated with a prototype of a free piston Stirling engine. Mean error on the amplitude, the frequency, the internal temperatures and the compression and expansion powers is 9%, so the model is considered accurate enough to predict performances. For optimization purpose, a numerical analysis is performed selecting the three following critical parameters: (i) dead volume of the chambers, (ii) natural frequency of the mechanical oscillators and (iii) thermal conduction between hot and cold sides. Smaller dead volume, large oscillating mass and high insulation are to be sought for maximizing the performances. With a pressurization of 3 bar, a theoretical useful power of 18 W can be reach with conservative modification of the existing prototype. Moreover, energy and exergy analyses highlight the main losses in the system: thermal leakage, gas spring hysteresis as well as heat transfer and viscous dissipation in the heat exchangers.

Abstract: This paper presents the first combustion system, which has been designed for the use of biomass derived product gases in micro gas turbines. The operating performance of the combustion system and of the micro gas turbine Turbec T100 was analyzed experimentally with synthetically mixed fuel compositions. Reliable start-up procedures and steady-state operation were observed. The Turbec T100 reached an electrical power output of 50 to 100 kW(el) with a lower heating value of 5.0 MJ/kg. Compared to natural gas, the electrical power output was noticeably higher at constant turbine speeds. Therefore, operation was limited by the power electronic at low speeds, while a second limitation was compressor surging at high speeds. To avoid surging, the turbine outlet temperature had to be reduced at turbine speeds between 64,400 rpm and its maximum of 70,000 rpm. The pressure losses across the FLUX-combustion chamber remained below 4%, which corresponds to a reduction of 30% compared to the Turbec combustion chamber fired with natural gas. Low pollutant emissions, i.e. CO < 30 ppm, NOx < 6 ppm and unbumt hydrocarbons <1 ppm, were obtained over the whole operating range. Further optimization potential of the Turbec T100 was analyzed numerically. Neglecting compressor surging and the limitations of the power electronic, the numerical simulations predicted a maximum power output of 137 kW(el). The ability of the micro gas turbine to run with low calorific fuels is demonstrated and optimization potential is specified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, increasing the capacity, which has been a major focus of the chemical process industry, can cause an entrainment flooding or a bottleneck problem in the distillation column. This paper reports the results of a techno-economic feasibility study to retrofit and debottleneck side stream columns, as one of most popular industrial distillation columns, in order to maximize energy efficiency and column throughput by using a novel hybrid configuration - heat pump assisted dividing wall column. The heat pump technique was used to improve the energy efficiency of a dividing wall column in debottlenecking a side stream column. On the other hand, the dividing wall column was exploited to increase the performance of a heat pump while also to removing bottlenecking problems. Several industrial cases were examined to demonstrate the proposed configuration. A heat pump assisted dividing wall column was optimized using a response surface methodology. The results showed that the proposed heat pump assisted dividing wall column can remove the bottleneck problem effectively and achieve substantial energy saving and CO2 emission reduction as well. Notably, an 83.7%, 85.9% and 61.3% reduction in operating costs could be achieved in the ethylene dichloride, acetic acid and alkanes separation processes, respectively. The proposed configuration can be applied to both close-boiling and wide-boiling mixtures, and also employed to both retrofit and grass-roots designs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To further improve the operating efficiency of a dual-motor-driven electric bus, a simple and robust power-management strategy was proposed. This study is comprised of three parts. (i) A systematic modeling approach for the efficiency of a dual-motor propulsion system (DMPS), which contains a wet clutch, transmission gears, bearings and two driving motors, has been proposed and verified experimentally. The correlation coefficient between the experimental data and the model simulation data is approximately 0.9, which indicates the validity and reliability of the DMPS model. (ii) Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) was applied to optimize the control strategy under three different types of driving cycles. Based on the analysis of the PMP control strategy, a two-parameter-based mode switching control was proposed for determining the optimal working mode of the DMPS. Then, a broken line-based power split control was developed, and the turning point was determined according to the optimization results. (iii) By combining the mode switching control strategy and the power split control strategy, a new control strategy was formulated, and its robustness was verified through six driving cycles. The simulation results show that the new control strategy can significantly improve the DMPS efficiency performance in different types of driving cycles compared with the original control strategy.

Abstract: Price volatility and increasing renewable energy generation have raised interest in the potential opportunities for storage technologies in energy-only electricity markets. In this paper we explore the value of a price-taking storage device in such a market, the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia. Our analysis suggests that under optimal operation, there is little value in having more than six hours of storage in this market. However, an inability to perfectly forecast wholesale prices, particularly extreme price spikes, may warrant some additional storage. We found that storage devices effectively provide a similar service to peak generators and are similarly dependent on and exposed to extreme price events, with revenue for a merchant generator highly skewed to a few days of the year. As a consequence of this finding, and in contrast to previous studies, the value of storage was found to be relatively insensitive to the round trip efficiency. We also found that the variability of revenue and exposure to extreme prices could be reduced using common hedging strategies, such as those currently used by peak generators. We present a case study that demonstrates storage technologies using such strategies may have a competitive advantage over other peaking generators in the NEM, due to the ability to earn revenue outside of extreme peak events. Similar to traditional peak generators, a main driver for storage options in an energy-only electricity market is extreme prices, which in turn is dependent on capacity requirements. However storage technologies can receive additional revenue streams, which may be improved by increased integration of renewable energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper a simple and fast re-configuration algorithm which is suitable for a PV array with Series-Parallel architecture is presented and discussed. The main advantage of such an algorithm is represented by its capability to find a nearly optimal configuration by testing only a very small subset of all the possible configurations. In particular it is shown that, in an actual PV array composed by 24 PV modules which operate under mismatching conditions (which are quite common in urban environments due to chimneys, streets lighting poles, antennas, neighboring buildings, etc.), the proposed algorithm is able to lead to energetic performances which are more or less comparable with those ones which can be obtained by adopting a Monte Carlo based algorithm employing a much higher number of trials. Moreover, by means of a specific example, it is shown that maximization of extracted energy and absence of dangerous operating conditions, possibly leading to the premature aging of the PV field and/or to hot spot phenomena, are contrasting requirements. It is nonetheless possible to find proper configurations able to lead to a suitable compromise between such two contrasting requirements. Further work is needed and is in progress in order to design suitable re-configuration algorithms able to identify such compromise configurations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Renewable energy source (RES) is playing an increasingly important role to reduce fossil fuels in district heating (DH) and to alleviate the accompanying environmental impact. In this paper, a combined heat and power (CHP) based DH system with RES and energy storage system (ESS) is studied. A modelling and optimization method is developed for planning and operating such CHP-DH systems. The objective of the optimization is to minimize the overall costs of the net acquisition for heat and power in deregulated power market. A planning model consisting of energy balances and constraints for system control and operation is built and an efficient algorithm is developed. We demonstrate the method in a CHP-DH system with a solar thermal plant and a thermal energy storage (TES). Results indicate that the developed method is efficient and flexible for planning and operating CHP-DH systems. To simulate the future situation, we also optimize the same CHP-DH system with a higher share of RES and a bigger TES. Results show that TES is used more intensively in the future with more fluctuating CHP load and a higher share of RES. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Many proposed low carbon transitions of the transport system have focused on decarbonisation in terms of technological transformation; however, significant opportunities exist for behavioural or demand side orientated measures to play an important role. This paper explores how one such option, mode shift, can contribute to low-carbon energy systems. For the first time, endogenous mode choice is integrated into a whole energy systems model, ESME, by representing mode speed, travel time budgets, infrastructure costs, and maximum rates of modal shift. Results indicate that the cost-optimal model solution favours sustainable transport modes, although this is strongly contingent on financial disincentives for car travel and measures to make slower modes more attractive. This approach is relevant in many different country contexts, as the need to assess options for lower carbon, more sustainable urban transport systems increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study investigates the general concept of reduced firebed temperatures in residential wood pellet boilers. Residential wood pellet boiler development is more and more concerned with inorganic aerosols characterized by a temperature-dependent release from the firebed. Hence, different concepts are applied aiming to reduce firebed temperatures. Unfortunately, these concepts influence not only firebed temperatures, but also other important parameters like air flow rates which may cause unwanted side effects with respect to combustion quality or efficiency. Thus, a new approach was developed solely affecting firebed temperature by implementing a water-based firebed cooling in a 12 kW underfeed pellet boiler. The effectiveness of the cooling was monitored by comprehensive temperature measurement in the firebed. The cooling capacity ranged from 0.4 kW to 0.5 kW resulted in a significant decrease of firebed temperatures. Gaseous emissions remain stable showing no significant changes in major components (O-2, CO2, NOx). Furthermore, CO emissions were even reduced significantly by the activated cooling, which was supposedly caused by a stabilized devolatilization due to the firebed cooling. Moreover, the temperature-dependent release of aerosol forming elements was influenced at activated firebed cooling, which is proved by a decrease of 17 wt% of dust (Total Suspended Particles; TSP). At the same time the gaseous emissions of HCl increase, supposedly by a reduced potassium release from the firebed to the gas phase and a subsequently different particle formation. The general concept of reduced firebed temperatures proved to be successful decreasing overall aerosol emissions without impacting combustion quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Smart metering is providing spatially and temporally much more accurate and detailed customer level information about district heating (DH) consumption than before. Currently this information is mainly used for billing only, but it could be used to operate the system more efficiently. In this study we develop a new method for optimizing the heat production simultaneously at multiple heat plants at different locations of a DH network in order to minimize the combined production and distribution costs. Optimization determines the optimal supply temperatures at different heat plants and optimal load allocation between the plants. The method can be used to optimize the current heat production based on real-time customer measurements. The method can also be used for production planning based on more accurate and detailed customer level demand forecasts. Optimization is based on a static DH system model that can estimate the state of the entire DH network based on real-time measurements or demand forecasts. Because the objective function is a non-convex and non-smooth function of the decision variables, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the problem. The method can be applied to arbitrary DH networks with multiple heat plants. Optimization can result in savings in fuel and pumping costs. We illustrate the method with a sample district heating network with two parallel heat plants and real-life DH network segments. We also show extensive sensitivity analysis results for the two-plant case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We present a first principles study using periodic density functional theory on the reaction between alpha-Fe2O3 and CH4 during chemical looping process. The sequential processes of methane dissociation, hydrogen formation, water production and dissociation, and carbon selective oxidation on alpha-Fe2O3 (001) surface were explored. It was found that the sequential dissociations of CH4 were the dominant rate-determining process. Although H-2 production was less favorable than H2O production, the formed H2O can be dissociated facilely to increase the surface H concentration at chemical looping conditions. CO production is more favorable than CO2 production, while CO2 can also be produced in the high-temperature process. Subsequently, the oxygen migration in alpha-Fe2O3 (001) surface was also investigated, indicating the O migration from inner bulk to surface layer is inherently a high-temperature process. Our results are consistent with the kinetic experiments. In order to improve the CO selectivity in CH4 chemical looping process for syngas production, we need to find promoters which could decrease the activation barrier of CH4 sequential dissociation steps and increase the oxygen migration ability of oxygen-carriers.

Abstract: Coal-fired power plant (CPP) site identification and selection plays a significant role in the safe operation of a project and the sustainable development of a region. This study proposes a GIS-modelling methodology for CPP site identification and selection. Specifically, potential feasible sites are identified using a Geographical Information System (GIS) technique based on a spatial analysis of many factors, such as roads, available electric networks, fuel supplies and land use. Alternative sites are then ranked and the most suitable site selected. In contrast to previous studies, this study is among the first to rank and select sites based on the resolution of the conflicts between the local authority and the CPP owner, a vital consideration in the CPP site selection process. Instead of establishing a multi-criteria framework, a modelling technique is used, in which a bi-level model is established to resolve the conflicts and address the practical constraints. Subsequently, interactive fuzzy programming and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Version II (NSGA-II) are applied to solve the complex model to select the most suitable site. Finally, a practical application in China demonstrates the applicability, effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. By considering stakeholder interest and energy efficiency, this methodology provides a method for a better understanding of CPP site identification and selection to ensure sustainable development. This methodology could be used in many developing countries by making minor modifications to some parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The growing share of electricity production from variable renewable energy sources increases the stochastic nature of the power system. This has repercussions on the markets for electricity. Deviations from forecasted production schedules require balancing of a generator's position within a day. Short term products that are traded on power and/or reserve markets have been developed for this purpose, providing opportunities to actors who can offer flexibility in the short term. The value of flexibility is typically modelled using stochastic scenario extensions of dispatch models which requires, as a first step, understanding the nature of forecast uncertainties. This study provides a new approach for determining the forecast errors of wind power generation in the time period between the closure of the day ahead and the opening of the first intraday session using Spain as an example. The methodology has been developed using time series analysis for the years 2010-2013 to find the explanatory variables of the wind error variability by applying clustering techniques to reduce the range of uncertainty, and regressive techniques to forecast the probability density functions of the intra-day price. This methodology has been tested considering different system actions showing its suitability for developing intra-day bidding strategies and also for the generation of electricity generated from Renewable Energy Sources scenarios. This methodology could help a wind power producer to optimally bid into the intraday market based on more accurate scenarios, increasing their revenues and the system value of wind.

Abstract: This paper conducts research on the fuel accommodation control of a fuel-flexible engine. Blended fuels from gasoline and diesel are tested on a compression ignition engine. Two problems with the fuel-flexible engine are studied. One problem is that the engine brake torque output is different with different fuels, and the other problem is that the thermal efficiency deteriorates without recalibration. One open-loop control method and one closed-loop control method based on cylinder pressure sensor are proposed to deal with the fuel accommodation control problems. The open-loop control method features fuel blend ratio detection, which is a new dimension of input for the conventional MAP based engine management system. Gasoline and diesel blend ratio detection methods are studied, and the result also provides information for the closed loop control method as a feedforward controller. An indicated mean effective pressure based method is proposed for the engine brake torque difference problem, and a feedback controller with indicated mean effective pressure maximum seeking algorithm is used to optimize engine efficiency. The fuel injection amount and timing will be adjusted according to the fuel estimation result and the feedback control algorithms. Results show that the methods proposed could identify fuel blend ratio quite accurately, the engine brake torque output could follow the target value well, and the engine thermal efficiency could be optimized.

Abstract: Addition of iso-propanol in the aqueous electrolyte of 1.0 mol/L Na2SO4 was found to be most effective at about 8 vol.% to minimise electrolyte surface tension, and hence maximise electrolyte wetting on a commercial supercapacitor grade activated carbon powder. The wetting improvement was further studied on die-pressed cylindrical thin pellets of polytetrafluoroethylene bonded activated carbon powder at three different apparent densities (0.70, 0.55 and 0.35 g/cm(3)) using adsorption isotherm, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Enhanced charge storage performance of the activated carbon at 0.70 and 0.55 g/cm(3) in apparent density was observed in electrolyte containing iso-propanol. The effect of iso-propanol became more prominent at high polarisation potentials. However, at the lowest density (0.35 g/cm(3)) studied, the capacitance decreased in the presence of iso-propanol, which can be attributed to the iso-propanol molecules entering the nano-pores of the activated carbon particles. In symmetrical supercapacitors with the dense activated carbon electrodes, addition of iso-propanol to the aqueous electrolyte increased the cell voltage, specific energy and maximum specific power from 1.5 to 2.0 V, 7.34 to 12.44W h/kg, and 3.96 to 12.35 kW/kg, respectively, under comparable conditions.

Abstract: With the development of microgrid technology, for an energy intensive corporate such as an iron and steel plant energy consumptions and costs can be saved significantly by achieving the balance between self-generation and consumption. In this paper, we present a self-balancing and robust scheduling model with flexible batch loads for an energy intensive corporate. The model is a multi-level optimization model with the objective to minimize the unbalance cost in the worst case. Load following properties are given to determine whether the uncertain loads can be followed or not, and the self-balancing capability of an energy intensive corporate is analyzed. The problem is equivalently converted from the multi-level model to a single-level optimization model with a set of constraints. In this way, the iteration between the outer and inner level can be avoided. Case study based on an energy intensive corporate microgrid is tested and the results show that the unbalance cost can be significantly reduced by using the robust self-balancing model. In addition, compared the approach method with iterative solving method, computational efficiency can be improved and local optimum can be avoided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between compact development and energy consumption by simulating individual consumption behaviors in monocentric and polycentric urban structures in Kumamoto in 2030. A model is developed to estimate individual consumption behaviors and demand of mobility goods and non-mobility goods at micro level. By considering the economic factor of income, the energy consumption is calculated based on demand of goods under Business as usual scenario, Central Core City scenario, and Multi-pole structure scenario. Results indicate the urban structure influences individual consumption behaviors and energy consumption. Increased consumption of the non-mobility goods and mass transit trips is shown in Central Core City scenario and the Multi-pole structure scenario. Monocentric urban structures as shown in Central Core City scenario show less effect on energy consumption than the polycentric urban structure in Multi-pole structure scenario. The findings suggest that the multi-pole urban structure is a better choice for compact development in Kumamoto based on less energy consumption. The method in this study provides a new approach to analyze the influence of urban structure on energy consumption at micro level. Findings give good suggestions for planning policy making regarding to compact development in Kumamoto. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to allocate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that result from fuel combusted to produce electricity and heat to the end-use sectors (industry, buildings, transport, and agriculture) where the electricity and heat are actually consumed. Attributing these indirect emissions to the appropriate sectors results in a very different picture of CO2 emissions per sector than is seen when only direct emissions are characterized. With attribution to the demand side, the industrial and buildings sectors contribute the largest shares of CO2 emissions globally. When indirect emissions are allocated to their respective end-use sectors, the buildings sector's share of total emissions increases the most, from 9% (direct emissions only) to 31% (including indirect emissions), which reflects the large share of electricity and heat consumed in this sector. The share of CO2 emissions attributable to the industrial sector also increases significantly, from 18% to 37%. These increased values include emissions from both electricity and heat used in end-use sectors, in contrast to the traditional accounting method, which allocates all electricity and heat emissions to the transformation and energy sector. Allocating these emissions to end-use sectors makes it possible to assess the full potential impact of demand reduction of electricity and heat use.

Abstract: Suspended particle device (SPD) switchable glazing can change optical transmission from "opaque" state to "transparent" state in the presence of an alternating current (AC) power supply. It can be applied to control internal temperatures in buildings. Thermal characterisation of both SPD and same area of a double-glazing sample was accomplished using an outdoor test cell in Dublin, Ireland. The overall heat transfer coefficients (U value) were calculated for both systems from the experimental data. The average U values for SPD and double glazing samples were found to be 5.9 W/m(2) K and 2.98 W/m(2) K, respectively. Addition of double-glazing to this SPD switchable single glazing offered a U value of 1.99 W/m(2) K. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Understanding the current evolution and drivers behind regional sectors' growing energy-related CO2 emissions is critical for developing global climate policies and providing insights into how our emerging economies can target lower emissions in the future. We propose estimation and explanation models of sectors' energy-related CO2 emissions and present a novel scenario design, all of which are originally applied in the CO2 emissions of the third economic growth pole of China (i.e., the Bohai Rim region) during period 2002-2011. We can therefore track the evolution and cumulative change therein, identifying key drivers of CO2 emissions change, and performing scenario analysis and projection. The estimation results show that CO2 emissions on both regional and provincial scales are maintaining an upward trend. On the whole, Shandong has the largest emissions in absolute terms, followed by Hebei, Liaoning, Tianjin and Beijing during this period, while all sectors' CO2 emissions changes show a fluctuating trend. With the exception of the residential life sector, all sectors' cumulative changes have increased over time. In addition, the explanation of the results prove that changes in per capita GDP and energy intensity are, respectively, the most significant stimulator and inhibitor for emissions' current status. Similarly, whether changes in sectoral structure play a positive or negative role depends on the increase or decrease in each sectors' share in total GDP. Moreover, all sectors' emissions in the Bohai Rim region will increase significantly regardless of the scenario. We can therefore achieve our 2020 CO2 mitigation targets across all sectors only under a scenario whose annual average GDP growth rates and energy consumption are both set by the "12th Five-Year Plan."

Abstract: Small commercial buildings in the United States consume 47% of the total primary energy of the buildings sector. Retrofitting small and medium commercial buildings poses a huge challenge for owners because they usually lack the expertise and resources to identify and evaluate cost-effective energy retrofit strategies. This paper presents the Commercial Building Energy Saver (CBES), an energy retrofit analysis toolkit, which calculates the energy use of a building, identifies and evaluates retrofit measures in terms of energy savings, energy cost savings and payback. The CBES Toolkit includes a web app (APP) for end users and the CBES Application Programming Interface (API) for integrating CBES with other energy software tools. The toolkit provides a rich set of features including: (1) Energy Benchmarlcing providing an Energy Star score, (2) Load Shape Analysis to identify potential building operation improvements, (3) Preliminary Retrofit Analysis which uses a custom developed pre-simulated database and, (4) Detailed Retrofit Analysis which utilizes real-time EnergyPlus simulations. CBES includes 100 configurable energy conservation measures (ECMs) that encompass IAQ technical performance and cost data, for assessing 7 different prototype buildings in 16 climate zones in California and 6 vintages. A case study of a small office building demonstrates the use of the toolkit for retrofit analysis. The development of CBES provides a new contribution to the field by providing a straightforward and uncomplicated decision making process for small and medium business owners, leveraging different levels of assessment dependent upon user background, preference and data availability.

Abstract: In this research, two parallel hybrid- and two diesel-buses fitted with selective catalytic reduction systems were tested in real world conditions using portable emission measurement systems. The hybrid buses were chosen to operate in either hybrid mode or diesel mode. In hybrid mode, the buses consumed less fuel, but the brake specific fuel consumptions were higher. The hybrid buses produced less engine-out NOx emissions than diesel buses, but as a result of lower exhaust temperature and lower efficiencies of SCR systems, the tailpipe NOx emissions from hybrid buses were a little higher. The brake specific NOx emissions from hybrid buses were very high and beyond the limit value of Euro-IV standard. History effect was also important for the efficiency of SCR system. The CO emissions from hybrid buses were lower in the unit of g/s, but the fuel-based CO emissions were higher than diesel buses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In France, renovation of existing buildings has a high priority. The thickness of insulation layers becomes a major issue of concern especially in cities. In this study, we present a recently developed insulating rendering based on silica aerogels that can be applied to new buildings and to retrofit existing ones. A full scale experimental house is built near Chambery in France, with the rendering applied on its external facades. The results of a numerical model developed in EnergyPlus are compared to the on-site measurements. After validating the numerical model, the thickness of the rendering is optimized based on a cost analysis for different climates for the case of retrofitting an old building. Then, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the thickness dependency on annual heating load, present worth factor, rendering's cost, and heating set-point. Results show that the optimum rendering thickness is in the range of 1.7-4.4 cm and the payback period in the range of 1.4-2.7 years depending on the climate. The optimum thickness increases with the increasing heating set-point and increasing present worth factor; however, it decreases with the increasing rendering cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In the present work, an open-type thermoelectric heating system with multiple channels was developed. A mathematical model of heat transfer, based on one-dimensional treatment of thermal and electric power, is conducted. The heating coefficient and production are both correlated in terms of temperature difference, thermal conductivity, electric resistance and electric current. The looped air circulation was designed to simultaneously recycle heat and enhance heater system performance. Experimental investigations were conducted to identify thermal performance of the thermoelectric heater. Effects of airflow rates through the heating side and cooling side, temperatures of heating side and cooling side on the performance were investigated. The heating coefficient was calculated upon that surface temperatures of hot and cold sides were recorded. The results show that the average heating coefficient of the thermoelectric heating system could reach to 1.3, which is greater than that of a typical electric heater with heating coefficient of less than one. The optimal isolation thickness for this thermoelectric heater, i.e., 14 mm, is confirmed by the experimental rig system. Generally, heating coefficient was found to increase first and decrease afterwards when the current was continuously increasing. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the optimum performance of the thermoelectric heat recovery heater strongly depends on the intensities of these operating parameters.

Abstract: Urban marginal land can be used for growing high yield bioenergy crops such as miscanthus and poplar. Here, a GIS-based modeling framework was created to assess potential urban marginal lands in Boston that include vacant lands and under-utilized public and private areas with adequate soil quality and sunlight. Using ArcGIS model builder as a spatial analysis tool, land parcels were screened for typical urban features such as buildings, driveways, parking lots, water and protected areas. The resultant layer was subjected to bio-geophysical modeling that includes soil quality, slope analysis and finally shadow analysis. Approximately 2660 ha of potential marginal land was identified as suitable, representing 24% of total land area in Boston. Using crop yield information, it was estimated that this marginal land could be used to produce up to a total of nearly 42,130 tons of high yield short rotation poplar biomass in a regular growing season. Also, bioenergy potential calculation revealed that for short rotation poplar, this amount of biomass can potentially yield up to 745 TJ (LHV) to 830 (HHV) TJ of yearly primary energy for the city of Boston that can be used for heat or electricity production, particularly for microgrid or district heating applications. This is equivalent to similar to 0.6% of Massachusetts primary energy demand for 2012. Ongoing work will explore other urban regions of Massachusetts and the Eastern US that might be able to fulfill part of their energy demand locally while providing benefits in environmental quality, economic development, and urban resilience.

Abstract: With the introduction of CO2 emissions legislation or fuel economy standards in Europe and many countries, significant effort is being made to improve spark ignition gasoline engines because of their dominant market share in passenger cars and potential for better fuel economy. Amongst several approaches, the engine downsizing technology has been adopted by the automotive companies as one of the most effective methods to reduce fuel consumption of gasoline engines. However, aggressive engine downsizing is constrained by excessive thermal and mechanical loads as well as knocking combustion and low speed pre-ignition (also known as super-knock). In order to overcome such difficulties, a gasoline direct injection single cylinder engine was modified to run under the two-stroke cycle by operating the intake and exhaust valves around bottom dead centre (BDC) at every crankshaft revolution. The combustion products were scavenged by means of a reversed tumble flow of compressed air during the positive valve overlap period at BDC. The engine output was determined by the charging and trapping efficiencies, which were directly influenced by the intake and exhaust valve timings and boost pressures. In this research a valve timing optimisation study was performed using a fully flexible valve train unit, where the intake and exhaust valve timings were advanced and retarded independently at several speeds and loads. A supercharger was used to vary the load by increasing the intake pressure. The effects of valve timing and boost pressure in this two-stroke poppet valve engine were investigated by a detailed analysis of the gas exchange process and combustion heat release. Gaseous and smoke emissions were measured and analysed. The results confirmed that the two-stroke cycle operation enabled the indicated mean effective pressure to reach 1.2 MPa (equivalent to 2.4 MPa in a four-stroke cycle) with an in-cylinder pressure below 7 MPa at an engine speed as low as 800 rpm. The engine operation was limited by scavenging inefficiencies and short time available for proper air-fuel mixing at high speeds using the current fuel injector. The large amounts of hot residual gas trapped induced controlled auto-ignition combustion at high speeds, and thus the abrupt heat release limited higher loads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to systematically identify and assess critical factors, which foster or hinder the development of bottom-up initiatives in the diffusion of photovoltaics. Bottom-up initiatives are social innovations, which entail civil engagement in energy transition at a local or regional level, and are expected to play a growing role in the governance of local energy systems in Europe. A mixed design methodology is used to identify critical factors and assess their importance. This involves combining an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats with an analytic hierarchy process. The findings indicate that successful initiatives are those which are able to draw upon substantial local public interest and trust in the new technology, and which manage to combine financial attractiveness with environmental concerns. The results make clear that the political context is also an extremely important success factor. Given the appropriate circumstances, such initiatives may make a significant contribution in the transition to a sustainable energy system, and thus prove useful in reaching European energy targets.

Abstract: Current building energy and GHG emissions assessments do not account for the variable performance of the electric grid. Incorporating hourly grid variability into building assessment methods can help to better prioritize energy efficiency measures that result in the largest environmental benefits. This article proposes a method to incorporate GHG emissions intensity changes due to grid variability into building environmental assessment. The proposed method encourages building systems that reduce electricity use during peak periods while accounting for differences in grid GHG emissions intensity (i.e., peak shaving is more strongly encouraged in grids that have GHG intense peak generation).
A set of energy saving building technologies are evaluated in a set of building variants (office, residential) and grid types (hydro/nuclear dominated, coal/gas dominated) to demonstrate the proposed method. Differences between total GHG emissions calculated with the new method compared with the standard (which assumes a constant GHG emissions intensity throughout the year) are in the 5-15% range when the contribution of electricity to total GHG emissions is more significant. The influence of the method on the assessment of the relative performance of some energy efficiency measures is much higher. For example, the estimated GHG emissions savings with heat pumps and photovoltaics can change by 40% and +20%, respectively, using the new assessment method instead of the standard. These differences in GHG emissions estimates can influence building design decisions. The new method could be implemented easily, and would lead to better decision making and more accurate estimates of the emissions from buildings and building technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The estimated cost of reducing carbon emissions through the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power systems vary by a factor of five or more across studies published over the past 8 years. The objective of this paper is to understand the contribution of techno-economic variables and modeling assumptions to explain the large variability in the published international literature on cost of avoided CO2 (CACO2) using statistical methods. We carry out a meta-analysis of the variations in reported CACO2 for coal and natural gas power plants with CCS. We use regression and correlation analysis to explain the variation in reported CACO2. The regression models built in our analysis have strong predictive power (R-2 > 0.90) for all power plant types. We find that the parameters that have high variability and large influence on the value of CACO2 estimated are levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) penalty, capital cost of CCS, and efficiency penalty. In addition, the selection of baseline technologies and more attention and transparency around the calculation of capital costs will reduce the variability across studies to better reflect technology uncertainty and improve comparability across studies. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents a thermal analysis of a semi-active battery/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which is used in electric vehicles (EVs), at subzero temperatures. In subzero temperature environments, EVs suffer a dramatic driving range loss due to the energy and power capability reduction of LiFePO4 batteries, as well as severe battery degradation due to Li plating. This will increase the system operation cost because the battery pack needs to be changed frequently. Based on a novel degradation model of LiFePO4 batteries, which is validated over a wide temperature range, a near-optimal energy management strategy of the HESS for on-line use is proposed using the dynamic programming (DP) approach, which minimizes the operation cost (the electricity and the battery fade costs) over a typical China Bus Drive Cycle (CBDC). The convective heating method is integrated into the DP process. Finally, the required heating of the HESS at subzero temperatures over multi-CBDC is analyzed by evaluating the system operation cost. Simulation results show that the heating process becomes increasingly necessary with increased driving range, battery price, and heating efficiency, as well as decreasing environment temperature.

Abstract: This article presents the development of an advanced adsorption desalination system with quantum performance improvement. The proposed multi-effect adsorption desalination (MEAD) cycle utilizes a single heat source i.e., low-temperature hot water (as low as 55 degrees C). Passive heating of the feed water (no direct heating) is adopted using total internal heat recovery from the kinetic energy of desorbed vapor and water vapor uptake potential of the adsorbent. Thus, the evaporation in the MEAD cycle ensues at low temperatures ranging from 35 degrees C to 7 degrees C yet providing significantly high performance ratio. The energy from the regenerated vapor is recovered for multiple evaporation/condensation of saline water by a water-runaround circuit between the top brine temperature (TBT) effect and the AD condenser. The adsorbent material is the hydrophilic mesoporous silica gel with high pore surface area. Numerical simulation for such a cycle is developed based on experimentally verified model extending to multi-effect cycle. The system is investigated under several operation conditions such as cycle time allocation, heat source temperature and the number of intermediate effects. It is observed that most of the evaporating-condensing effects operate at low temperature i.e., below 35 degrees C as opposed to conventional multi-effect distillation (MED) cycle. For a MEAD cycle with 7 intermediate effects, the specific water production rate, the performance ratio and the gain output ratio are found to be 1.0 m(3)/h tonne of silica gel, 6.3 and 5.1, respectively. Low scaling and fouling potentials being evaporation at low temperatures yet high recovery ratio makes the cycle suitable for effectively and efficiently handling highly concentrated feed water such as produced water, brine rejected from other desalination plants and zero liquid discharge (ZLD) system.

Abstract: Reducing the energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions of urban areas is paramount in research and practice, encompassing strategies to both reduce energy consumption and carbon intensity in both energy supply and demand. Most methods focus on one of these two approaches but few integrate decisions for supply and demand simultaneously. This paper presents a novel model that endogenously simulates energy supply and demand at a district scale on an hourly time scale. Demand is specified for a variety of building uses, and losses and municipal loads are calculated from the number of buildings in the district. Energy supply is modeled using technology-specific classes, allowing easy addition of specific equipment or types of energy generation. Standard interfaces allow expansion of the model to include new types of energy supply and demand. The model can be used for analysis of a single design alternative or optimization over a large design space, allowing exploration of various densities, mixes of uses, and energy supply technologies. An example optimization is provided for a community near San Francisco, California. This example uses 21 building types, 32 combined heat and power engines, and 16 chillers. The results demonstrate the ability to compare performance trade-offs and optimize for three objectives: life cycle cost, annual carbon dioxide emissions, and overall system efficiency.

Abstract: We quantify carbon (CO2) savings in the demand side response (DSR) programmes. We consider Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR), Triad, Fast Reserve and Smart Meter roll-out, with various types of smart interventions involved (using diesel generators, hydro-pumped generation and use of tariffs). We model CO2 emissions in each of the DSR programmes with appropriate configurations and assumptions used in the energy industry. This enables us to compare carbon emissions between the business-as-usual (BAU) solutions and the smart intervention applied, thus deriving the carbon savings. Whether such DSR produces positive CO2 savings or not depends on the used technologies, as well as the scale of the interventions, which we illustrate in examples.

Abstract: Increasing the concentration ratio of parabolic troughs is one of the challenges to make this technology economically competitive against fossil fuels. Parabolic troughs with large concentration ratios face several problems such as difficulty capturing all the solar direct radiation and structural issues associated with thermal expansions and wind resistance amongst others. For larger mirrors it may be necessary to use a bigger absorber in order to capture all the radiation, thus increasing the thermal losses. A second stage reflector helps to increase the concentration ratio without increasing the primary mirror size. In this work, a theoretical analysis of a parabolic trough with a secondary flat reflector is developed and ray tracing is conducted in order to validate the equations obtained. A flat reflector will have a minimal economic impact in the cost of a parabolic trough and it allows larger concentration ratios for identical primary mirror areas compared to a standard parabolic trough. Increases of concentration ratio up to 80% are observed when a secondary flat reflector is inserted in a commercial system, while the shadow area introduced in the primary mirror is usually less than 15% of the primary mirror area. The increase in pumping power is offset by the increase in system efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is concerned with the application of photovoltaic diodes to harvest electricity from thermal radiation. This is achieved through the use of appropriately designed thermal emitters which are typically heated to temperatures of more than 800 degrees C. Merits of thermophotovoltaics include the prospect of delivering high power density compared to solar photovoltaics, fuel versatility, portability and capability of around-the-clock operation. The key challenges en route to commercialization of TPV technology include low heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency, mechanical and thermostructural reliability at high temperatures, and cost. Recent advances which include the development of photonic crystal emitters, miniaturization of TPV systems, and improvement of rare earth oxide emitters have contributed to enhancing the performance of TPV systems. Further, current research on ultra-low bandgap photovoltaic materials, thin film monolithic system design, and global system optimization promise additional advances. This article presents an overview of the fundamental principles of thermophotovoltaics followed by a review of the development of all the main components comprising combustion thermophotovoltaic systems. This review also scrutinizes state-of-the-art developments, discusses the fundamental and technical challenges facing commercial adoption of TPV, and prospects of TPV. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The diesel engine offers superior fuel and thermal efficiencies, greater power output, superior torque and better durability compared to the spark ignition engine. On the other hand, the diesel engine is a major source of both criteria and non-criteria air pollutants, which contribute to the deteriorating air quality further putting the health of mankind at risk. Thus, there is a need to find sustainable and environmental friendly fuel types for the diesel engine application. Therefore, in this review, we embark on a discourse on the application of oxygenated alternative fuels such as biodiesel, acet one-butanol-ethanol (ABE) solution and water-addition as green fuel reformulation strategies aimed at achieving engine pollutant reduction, while maintaining the integrity of the energy performance of the diesel engine. Furthermore, more research and study is recommended on these green fuels to gain more insight on their effect especially on the unregulated vehicle emissions such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), persistent organic compounds (POPs) and carbonyls. Compared with conventional fossil diesel, by using the biodiesel and/or ABE solution in the diesel blends do reduce the emissions of particulate matter (PM), CO, PAHs and POPs, while in the most cases, the NOx emission will be increased. However, due to the combination mechanisms of higher oxygen content, more complete combustion and cooling effect, if the diesel blend contains proper amount of biodiesel, ABE solution and a small amount of water (0.5%), it is a green fuel, which displays a excellent performance in both brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and NOx-PM trade-off and in significant emission reductions for PAHs and POPs, while, the emissions of both carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HCs) may elevated and therefore a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) is needed. This review article proposes a green diesel fuel blend not only for scientific study but also for future practical application. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper tests to what extent different types of variables (building factors, socio-demographics, attitudes and self-reported behaviours) explain annualized energy consumption in residential buildings, and goes on to show which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the problem of multicollinearity between predictors is recognised, and addressed using Lasso regression to perform variable selection.
Using data from a sample of 924 English households collected in 2011/12, four individual regression models showed that building variables on their own explained about 39% of the variability in energy consumption, socio-demographic variables 24%, heating behaviour 14% and attitudes & other behaviours only 5%. However, a combined model encompassing all predictors explained only 44% of all variability, indicating a significant extent of multicollinearity between predictors. Once corrected for multicellinearity, building variables predominantly remained as significant predictors of energy consumption, in particular the dwelling's size and type. Of the sociodemographic predictors, only the household size remained significant, and of the heating behaviours only the length of heating season was significant. Reported beliefs about climate change were also a significant predictor.
The findings indicate that whilst people use energy, it is physical building characteristics that largely determine how much is used. This finding, together with the relatively greater time-invariant nature of building characteristics underlines their importance when focusing on seeking to understand residential energy consumption at a stock level. Retrofitting and behaviour change initiatives remain important avenues to reduce consumption, as suggested through the lower energy consumption associated with full double-glazing and shorter heating season. However, the dominance of building size also indicates that living in appropriately sized buildings is of great importance for energy consumption. The results also indicate that more than half of the variability in energy consumption cannot be explained, even when using a wide range of predictors. The paper also discusses the need to collect better occupant-related variables to give a correct representation of the impact of behaviour, such as heating demand temperatures. Furthermore, choices about dwelling characteristics could also be seen as a type of behaviour, even though it cannot be modelled in a cross-sectional analysis as used in this study.

Abstract: The influence of leg dimensions and spacing on power-generation and thermo-mechanical performance of thermoelectric devices was investigated using numerical and statistical analyses tools. Bismuth-telluride based thermoelectric device models with rectangular-prism and cylindrical legs were simulated for a temperature range of 20-120 degrees C and various leg heights between 1 and 5 mm, widths/diameters between 1 and 2 mm, and spacing between 0.5 and 1.5 mm. Predicted power output, conversion efficiencies, and thermal stresses were validated with less than 8.9%, 1.2%, and 6.6% variations respectively. It is found that both leg width and height have a significant effect on power generation and thermal stresses: The relationship between power generation performance and thermal stress levels is inverse. Although leg spacing has effect on thermal stress and conversion efficiency, its effect on power output is negligible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and the characterisation of a high powered energy dense zeolite thermal heat storage system using water vapour sorbate. The specification requirements of the system are to supply a heating power of 2 kW during 2 h in order to shave the electricity peak loads in a house. The open reactor has been designed, built and instrumented with temperature sensors, chilled mirror hygrometer and airflow meter. Several tests have been carried out both during hydration - heat release - and dehydration - heat storage. Tests have also been carried out for different flow rates, relative humidity and temperatures of hydration. The results show that the reactor can supply a constant power of 2.25 kW during more than two hours, namely 27.5 W kg(-1) of material. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Appropriate design provides the cooling system to achieve good performance with low energy consumption and cost. Conventional design method in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) field usually selects the cooling system based on certain cooling load and experiences. The performance of the selected cooling system may deviate from the expectations due to cooling load uncertainty. This paper proposes a novel design method to obtain the robust optimal cooling systems for buildings by quantifying the uncertainty in cooling load calculation and equipment reliability in operation comprehensively. By quantifying the cooling load uncertainty with Monte Carlo method and chiller reliability using Markov method, the robust optimal cooling system is obtained with minimum annual total cost. By applying the new method in the design of the cooling system for a building, its function and performance as well as potential benefits are demonstrated and evaluated. Results show that the proposed method can obtain the optimal cooling systems with low cost and high robustness and provides a promising means for designers to make their best design decisions based on quantitative assessment according to their priority.

Abstract: In order to combat the threat of climate change, countries have begun to implement policies which restrict GHG emissions in the electricity sector. However, the development of national electricity mixes should also be sensitive to resource availability, geo-political forces, human health impacts, and social equity concerns. Policy focused on GHG goals could potentially lead to adverse consequences in other areas. To explore the impact of "climate-centric" policy making on long-term electricity mix changes, we develop two cases for Peru and Spain analyzing their changing electricity grids in the period 1989-2013. We perform a Life Cycle Assessment of annual electricity production to catalogue the improvements in GHG emissions relative to other environmental impacts. We conclude that policies targeting GHG reductions might have the co-benefit of also reducing air pollution and toxicity at the expense of other important environmental performance indicators such as water depletion. Moreover, as of 2013, both countries generate approximately equal GHG emissions per kWh, and relatively low emission rates of other pollutants compared to nations of similar development levels. Although climate-centric policy can lead to some positive environmental outcomes in certain areas, energy policy-making should be holistic and include other aspects of sustainability and vulnerability.

Abstract: Numerous design methods for the retrofit of heat exchanger networks have been proposed over the years, with most depending greatly on topology modification and additional heat transfer area. However, topology modifications and the installation of additional heat transfer area can lead to uneconomic retrofit in many cases, largely as a result of the expense of civil engineering work and pipework modifications. Retrofit of a heat exchanger network can be achieved without the need for topology modifications and additional heat transfer area by the use of heat transfer enhancement. This paper presents a methodology for heat exchanger network retrofit around a fixed network and without the need for additional heat transfer area and topology modifications. Heat transfer enhancement techniques are used to improve the energy performance of an existing heat exchanger network. A dominance ratio is explored to identify the best location to apply enhancement. Sensitivity analysis is used in finding the sequence of the most effective heat exchangers to enhance in order to improve the performance of the network. Sensitivity analysis introduced to study network flexibility is adapted to study heat transfer enhancement. Heat exchanger networks are complex systems with interactions between various components. A change in one component can have an effect on other downstream heat exchangers. Therefore, the proposed methodology presents a way of eliminating the need for additional heat transfer area after enhancement, while ensuring the stream target temperatures are met. This is based on a key optimisation strategy which depends on a trade-off between utility consumption and the need for additional heat transfer area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The energy and visual performances of the facades are defined by many parameters including fa ade size, properties of glazings and shadings, and their arrangements as well as control strategies. In this study, a number of combinations of internal woven roller shades and four double glazings have been proposed and assessed in integrated manner in order to improve the energy efficiency and visual comfort in new or existing office buildings. Office rooms facing south, east, north and west have been simulated for cold climate, by varying glazed areas and proposed glazing and shading alternatives. Results have been calculated, compared and analyzed in terms of the energy consumptions, energy saving potentials, daylight autonomy, useful daylight illuminance and discomfort glare free time, for each of the combinations. Simulation results show that the choice of glazing and shading alternatives can have substantial impact on energy and visual performances of the office space. Regardless of fa ade orientation, the maximum energy saving is achieved for a window-to-wall ratio (WWR) of 30%. Saving potential decreases significantly for larger glazed area and for each fa ade orientation. For all fa ade orientations and glazed areas (except for 30% WWR in the north wall), a bare low-e coated double glazing (U = 1.616 W/m(2) K, SHGC = 0.209, tau(v) = 0.301) is found to be the most energy efficient choice. For 30% north glazing, the energy efficiency can be maximized with a different bare low-e coated double glazing (U = 1.628W/m(2) K, SHGC = 0.370, tau(v) = 0.581). Moreover, glare affected time, daylight autonomy and useful daylight illuminance in the office spaces with these glazing choices are estimated >= 50%, between 46% and 99% and in the range of 53-88% respectively. Also, the visual comfort can further be improved just by deploying even a highly transparent fabric (50% transmittance, 20% reflectance, 45% average openness) as an interior roller shade with these glazing choices.

Abstract: Recycling of enzymes in production of lignocellulosic bioethanol has been tried for more than 30 years. So far, the successes have been few and the experiments have been carried out at conditions far from those in an industrially feasible process. Here we have tested continuous enzyme recycling at demonstration scale using industrial process conditions (high dry matter content and low enzyme dosage) for a period of eight days. The experiment was performed at the Inbicon demonstration plant (Kalundborg, Denmark) capable of converting four tonnes of wheat straw per hour. 20% of the fermentation broth was recycled to the hydrolysis reactor while enzyme dosage was reduced by 5%. The results demonstrate that recycling enzymes by this method can reduce overall enzyme consumption and may also increase the ethanol concentrations in the fermentation broth. Our results further show that recycling fermentation broth also opens up the possibility of lowering the dry matter content in hydrolysis and fermentation while still maintaining high ethanol concentrations.

Abstract: Recent trends in increased public environmental awareness coupled with the introduction of governmental incentives, has resulted in a remarkably rapid growth in rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations at a residential level in Australia. Despite the widely perceived economic and environmental benefits of rooftop PV, the economic and environmental performance of rooftop PV under Australian conditions are yet to be thoroughly examined. Whilst prior studies on the subject of rooftop PV are extensively overseas based, the conditions under which they are performed differ immensely from the Australian conditions. Consequently, this paper focuses on evaluating the life cycle economic and environmental merit of rooftop PV in Australia. By making use of component-wise costs and embedded emissions associated with each component of the rooftop PV generation system, the life cycle cost and emission models have been developed. For this to occur, the Australian costs and, energy and emission intensities have been used. All the life cycle factors relating to the manufacturing, purchasing, installation and operation of rooftop PV are considered. A sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to electricity price, feed-in tariff, battery price, battery lifetime and emission intensities. The results of the cost and emissions analyses are collectively used to estimate the cost of emissions mitigation through the use of rooftop PV for current and potential future scenarios in Australia. The cost payback and the energy payback times are found to range between 11 to more than 25 years and 1.75 to 14 years, respectively. The study also reveals that local load profile can have a significant impact on payback times. For example, the cost payback without battery storage is found to be the least for Tasmania which hosts the least favourable solar insolation conditions and lowest feed-in tariff amongst the Australian states however possesses a high daily load and electricity price.

Abstract: Higher operating temperatures increase efficiency of the concentrating solar power plants but promote faster corrosion of the pipes and vessels made of Hastelloy or stainless steel materials for the molten-salt mixtures. Hastelloys C-276 and C-22 and stainless steel 304 coupons evaluated in the present study in a eutectic molten salt consisting of 13.4 mol% NaCl, 33.7 mol% KCl and 52.9 mol% ZnCl2 showed substantially lower corrosion rates in the absence versus presence of air from 200 to 800 degrees C as determined by electrochemical and gravimetric methods. In the presence of air, the corrosion rate for the Hastelloy C-276 in the molten salt was found to diminish with immersion time and converges around similar to 50 mu m per year after 4 weeks of immersion at 500 degrees C, which is close to the value similar to 40 mu m per year obtained using the electrochemical method at 500 degrees C. For anaerobic corrosion rate estimation, the corrosivity of an alloy sample was examined by immersing in molten salt inside a sealed quartz container without any contact with air, which is possible because the vapor pressure of the eutectic molten salt is only about 0.7 atm at 800 degrees C. The corrosion rate of the Hastelloy C-276 was only 10 mu m per year in the molten salt in the absence of air at 800 degrees C, which is extremely low compared to 500 mu m per year in conducting corrosion studies in the presence of air at 800 degrees C. The Hastelloy coupons after immersion testing in the absence of air have then been examined also by SEM, and the images did not show any significant changes in the surface. This behavior indicates that, from a corrosion standpoint, the eutectic molten salt in the absence of air is suitable as a heat transfer fluid in Hastelloy C-276 pipes and containers up to 800 degrees C.

Abstract: Conventional solar compound parabolic concentrators are normally fitted with one tubular receiver positioned along the axis of the two parabolas. This work investigates the potential of using either two tubular receivers in one compound parabolic concentrator or an elliptical single receiver. Using advanced ray tracing technique, the optical efficiency of a compound parabolic concentrator with two tubular receivers aligned horizontally and vertically was predicted. Results showed that the horizontal configuration outperforms both the single and the vertical configurations by up to 15%. Also, a horizontally aligned elliptical single tube showed an increase in the average daily optical efficiency by 17% compared to the single tube configuration. The thermal performance of the single and double horizontally aligned tubular receivers was determined using a thermosyphon heat pipe experimentally tested utilising the heat flux obtained from the optical simulation at different acceptance angles. Results show that double tube configuration thermally outperforms the single one in terms of heat transferred to the cooling water by 21%, 19.8% and 18.3% for acceptance angles of 30 degrees, 40 degrees and 60 degrees respectively. This work highlights the potential of using either two tubular receivers or single elliptical one aligned horizontally in one concentrator to improve the optical and thermal efficiencies of compound parabolic collectors.

Abstract: We investigated the integration of form-stable paraffin/nanosilica composites into vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) to improve the thermal mass. In total, six form-stable paraffin/nanosilica composites were produced by absorbing paraffin in different types of nanosilica with different surface characters, hydrophobic and hydrophilic. In view of cost, a phase change material (PCM) composite prepared by hydrophilic precipitated silica was chosen to produce the PCM-integrated VIPs. The microstructure and phase change behaviour of the PCM composites were investigated. The thermal mass of the PCM-integrated VIPs was found to be improved. With integration of PCM the thermal conductivity of the VIPs was increased, although it was still very low compared to normal foam insulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the modern diesel engine, with increasingly higher injection pressures, shock waves will appear with high velocity fuel jets. To better understand the effect of shock waves on the atomization of fuel sprays, diesel fuel injected at a pressure of 60 to 120 MPa was studied using a schlieren imaging visualisation system. The initiation and boundary conditions of the shock wave initiated by fuel jets were examined. A clear difference of spray penetration between the shock-wave state and the non-shock-wave state was recorded in a nitrogen (N-2) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas atmosphere. By eliminating the other potential explanations, such as pressure drop differences and the enhancement of gas density, it is shown that the shock wave itself had a predominant effect on the evolution of high-pressure fuel jets. Additionally, a computational model considering the Mach number was developed to predict the spray penetration. The model was found to have excellent agreement with the presented experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the last years, a growing interest about increasing the engine efficiency has led to the development of new engine technologies. The accurate determination of the heat transfer across the combustion chamber walls is highly relevant to perform a valid thermal balance while evaluating the potential of new engine concepts. Several works dealing with heat transfer correlations that consider the swirl motion are found in the literature; however, there is a lack of works dealing with heat transfer correlations which take into account the effect of the tumble movement. In this work, a heat transfer model accounting for the tumble motion is presented. A two stroke HSDI Diesel engine with high tumble and no swirl is used to perform the theoretical study, the model development and its final calibration. Initially, a theoretical analysis of the gas movement phenomena is carried out based on CFD results and then, a model is developed and calibrated based on a skip-fire testing technique. Finally, a sensitivity study focused on evaluating the model robustness is performed. The results confirm an average RMSE reduction of 70% with respect to the Woschni model, being this consistent improvement qualitatively evidenced in the instantaneous heat transfer evolution.

Abstract: At present there is no reliable approach to model and characterize thermal systems using renewable energy for building applications based on experimental data. The results of the existing approaches are valid only for specific conditions (climate type and thermal building properties). The aim of this paper is to present a generic methodology to evaluate the energy performance of such systems. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proved to be suitable to tackle such complex problems, particularly when the system to be modelled is compact and cannot be divided up during the testing stage. Reliable "black box" ANN modelling is able to identify global models of the whole system without any advanced knowledge of its internal operating principles. The knowledge of the system's global inputs and outputs is sufficient. The proposed methodology is applied to evaluate three different Solar Combisystems (SCSs) combined with a gas boiler or a heat pump (HP) as an auxiliary system. The results show that the best ANN models were able to predict with a satisfactory degree of precision, the annual energy consumption of the all systems except the SCS combined with air source HP, in different conditions, based on a learning sequence lasting only 12 days. In fact, the annual energy prediction errors were less than 10% in most cases. The methodology limitations appear in extreme boundary conditions (Barcelona climate) compared to those used during the ANN training process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In order to facilitate regional agricultural residue utilization for energy production through bioenergy technologies, a dynamic input-output model is developed to estimate and assess the energy, economic and environmental performances of industrialization of five bioenergy technologies within a 15-year time horizon. Electricity and solid, gaseous and liquid biofuels are energy products of bioenergy technologies. Bioenergy technologies are complemented into regional input-output framework and combined with socioeconomic activities aided by their bottom-up economic and energy parameters. The simulation results for the target area indicate that the agricultural residues available for bioenergy technologies could amount to 55.16 million t, facilitating to 8.38 million t coal-equivalent bioenergy production by 2025. A 3.1% net reduction in accumulative greenhouse gas emission compared with the "business as usual" case could be achieved owing to substitution of fossil energy with electricity and biofuels produced by bioenergy technologies. From energy production, economic benefits and greenhouse gas mitigation three aspects integratedly, direct-combustion power generation and briquette fuel are more advantageous in the target area. The quantified energy, economic and environmental performances of bioenergy technologies are expected to give recommendations for their industrial development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study presents a novel process for producing pipeline-quality biomethane by anaerobic digestion (AD) of sludge with in-situ biogas cleanup and upgrading using corn stover biochar. The biochar has high surface area (105 m(2)/g), high ash content (45.2% dry weight) and high concentrations of potassium, calcium and magnesium (14.2% K2O, 3.9% CaO and 4.2% MgO of the ash content, respectively). The biocharamended digesters produced near pipeline-quality biomethane (>90% CH4 and <5 ppb H2S), facilitated CO2 removal by up to 86.3%, boosted average CH4 content in biogas by up to 42.4% compared to the control digester, close to fungibility of natural gas. The biochar addition enhanced the methane yield, biomethanation rate constant and maximum methane production rate by up to 7.0%, 8.1% and 27.6%, respectively. The biochar addition also increased alkalinity and mitigated ammonia inhibition, providing sustainable process stability for thermophilic sludge AD. The biochar-amended digestate is enriched with nutrients such as potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus, and therefore has great potential for soil applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Energy-intensive enterprises (EIEs) are typical kinds of industrial loads. They consume large amounts of electricity, and are very sensitive to electricity prices. Moreover, they have very good schedulability: they own various adjustable devices and dispatchable self-owned generation units, and have great flexibility in making production decisions. The characteristics of EIEs make them potentially ideal for coordinating with power systems and gaining a win-win situation, especially when the renewable energy penetration rate is high. However, problems still remain as to how to organize this coordination. In this paper, we design a decomposed coordinative scheduling (DCS) approach in which independent EIEs and the system exchange information iteratively to achieve final settlements. Based on a general modeling of EIEs, we introduce a mathematical formulation for DCS. The corresponding algorithm is also provided. We compare DCS to other scheduling approaches in case studies. It shows that DCS can significantly improve the benefits of the two sides without harming the privacy of EIEs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Latent heat thermal storage (LHTS) systems can be applied to minimize the discrepancy between energy supply and demand in cold applications. Combining this system with night time generation of CO2 hydrate slurry can significantly reduce the investment costs for cooling purposes. These systems require hydrate generation temperatures around 8 degrees C and can, from an energetic point of view, contribute to significant energy savings. In this paper a numerical and experimental investigation is carried out for a shell- and-tube fluidized bed heat exchanger, combined with a hydrate slurry storage vessel. When required, heat can be removed from the storage by circulating the slurry through a heat exchanger which is part of the cold distribution system. The model of the fluidized bed heat exchanger is coupled with the model of the cold storage system. The phase change process is modelled by using a crystal growth model. The presented work provides experimental data for the thermal performance and hydrate generation of a fluidized bed based LHTS system for a CO2 hydrate cold storage system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Scenarios of future population at the grid level (e.g., 1 km(2)) is very important for various types of regional planning, including energy planning. Though the most often used method for population projection is the so-called cohort-component method, if our focus is world level, not country or finer level, we must rely on much simpler methods. In this study, we compare the performance of several typical simple population projection methods using the residential electricity demand derived from each population scenario, especially focusing on spatial patterns. We show that different projection methods may produce different spatial patterns such as "compact" or "dispersed" urban form, which is quantified using the Gini coefficient. Also, we show that the projection method for gravity-based residential electricity demand is very flexible in that it can create the most compact and the most dispersed urban form among the focused methods. Furthermore, we point out the usefulness of model ensemble in projection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Nowadays, EGR systems are being incorporated in the research focused on spark-ignition direct-injection engines as a solution to the problems presented by them; i.e. knock risk and high combustion temperature which produces high NOx emission. Since the major part of the investigations are centered on engine performance or engine simulation aside pollutants emission and aftertreatment evaluation, this paper focuses on these topics: gaseous and particle emission analysis and aftertreatment efficiency evaluation when cooled LP-EGR system is applied to a GTDi engine.
This work has been performed in a 4-cylinder, turbocharged, direct-injection gasoline engine with 2.0 L displacement. The equipment used in this study are TSI-EEPS for particle measurement and HORIBA MEXA 1230-PM for soot measurement being HORIBA MEXA 7100-DEGR with a heated line selector the system employed for regulated gaseous emission measurement and aftertreatment evaluation. A reduction around 50% of NOx with an increase of HC and CO emissions was found in medium-load operating points. At full-load conditions, the suppression of fuel enrichment including EGR leads in a drastically reduction in CO maintaining similar HC and NOx emissions. Furthermore, PN and soot emissions also decrease as EGR is included and spark timing advanced in all the tested conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of a scale-up pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) based osmotic power generator. Inspired by the well-known MPPT in photovoltaic (PV) array, two algorithms, perturb & observe (P&O) and incremental mass-resistance (IMR) method, are investigated. Using a series of simulations, both the algorithms are demonstrated to be capable of tracking the maximum power point (MPP) and capturing the transitions between varied MPPs due to the fluctuations of operating temperature. However, in both cases the trade-off between the rise time and the oscillation is found requiring further consideration on the selection of the step-size for perturbation pressure or incremental pressure. In order to improve the performance of the MPPT, furthermore, an optimum model-based controller (OMC) is used to estimate the initial optimum pressure for the MPPT in a scale-up PRO process. It is found that with OMC, the performance of the MPPT is improved significantly. Finally, a strategy to operate and coordinate the MPPT and OMC to deal with the rapid variations of the salinities are proposed and evaluated in terms of individual variation of the concentration or flow rate and co-variation of the both. The simulations demonstrate the preferred performance of the proposed strategy to adjust the operation subject to the rapid changes of the salinities.

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy management strategy for a residential microgrid comprising photovoltaic (PV) panels and a small wind turbine. The microgrid is connected to the main grid, allowing for a controlled power exchange through a battery system and its control strategy. As input data, the proposed control strategy uses the battery state of charge (SOC), the power at each microgrid node as well as the load and renewable generation forecasts. By using forecasted data and correcting any forecasting errors according to the SOC of the battery, the strategy manages to make a better use of the battery resulting in a better grid power profile. The simulation of the system using a one-year data period shows that the proposed energy management strategy results in a better grid power profile for a given storage system when compared with other state-of-the-art strategies. Finally, the proposed strategy was experimentally validated in the microgrid built in the Renewable Energy Laboratory at the UPNa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing rapidly. CO2 emissions may have an impact on global climate change. Effective CO2 emission abatement strategies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) are required to combat this trend. Compared with pre-combustion carbon capture and oxy-fuel carbon capture approaches, post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) using solvent process is one of the most mature carbon capture technologies. There are two main barriers for the PCC process using solvent to be commercially deployed: (a) high capital cost; (b) high thermal efficiency penalty due to solvent regeneration. Applying process intensification (PI) technology into PCC with solvent process has the potential to significantly reduce capital costs compared with conventional technology using packed columns. This paper intends to evaluate different PI technologies for their suitability in PCC process. The study shows that rotating packed bed (RPB) absorber/stripper has attracted much interest due to its high mass transfer capability. Currently experimental studies on CO2 capture using RPB are based on standalone absorber or stripper. Therefore a schematic process flow diagram of intensified PCC process is proposed so as to motivate other researches for possible optimal design, operation and control. To intensify heat transfer in reboiler, spinning disc technology is recommended. To replace cross heat exchanger in conventional PCC (with packed column) process, printed circuit heat exchanger will be preferred. Solvent selection for conventional PCC process has been studied extensively. However, it needs more studies for solvent selection in intensified PCC process. The authors also predicted research challenges in intensified PCC process and potential new breakthrough from different aspects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Since 2003, Mainland China has been promoting the public private partnership (PPP) procurement model in the waste-to-energy incineration sector to reduce the waste burying rate and improve environmental quality. Five critical risk factors (CRFs) that affect the construction and operation of waste-to-energy incineration projects have been identified from real-life risk events of 14 PPP waste-to-energy incineration plants through content analysis. These risk factors are insufficient waste supply, disposal of non-licensed waste, environmental risk, payment risk, and lack of supporting infrastructure. A recently completed PPP waste-to-energy incineration plant, the Shanghai Tianma project, was investigated to learn from the effective management of CRFs. First-hand data about the Shanghai Tianma project was collected, with a focus on project negotiation and concession agreement. Lessons learned about risk management were acquired. This paper presents a detailed study of the contractual structure, risk sharing scheme, risk response measures to CRFs, and project transfer of a PPP project. The study results will provide governments with management implications to prepare equitable concession agreements and benefit private investors by effectively mitigating and managing risks in future PPP waste-to-energy incineration projects.

Abstract: Energy storage is a cutting edge front for renewable and sustainable energy research. In fact, a massive exploitation of intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and sun, requires the introduction of effective mechanical energy storage systems.
In this paper we introduce the concept of a trigenerative energy storage based on a compressed air system. The plant in study is a simplified design of the adiabatic compressed air-energy storage and accumulates mechanical and thermal (both hot and cold) energy at the same time. We envisage the possibility to realize a relatively small size trigenerative compressed air energy storage to be placed close to the energy demand, according to the distributed generation paradigm. Here, we describe the plant concept and we identify all the relevant parameters influencing its thermodynamic behavior. Their effects are dissected through an accurate thermodynamic model. The most relevant technological issues, such as the guidelines for a proper choice of the compressor, expander and heat exchangers are also addressed. Our results show that T-CAES may have an interesting potential as a distributed system that combines electricity storage with heat and cooling energy production. We also show that the performances are significantly influenced by some operating and design parameters, whose feasibility in real applications must be considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this work, the performance of hydrate formation for CO2 removal from a simulated recovered shale gas (40 mol% CO2 and 60 mol% CH4) was evaluated in liquid water, and THF and THF/SDS solutions. Experiments were carried out at a fixed temperature of 277.15 K and in the pressure range of (2.8-6.7) MPa. The impact of driving force (overpressure) on hydrate growth and CO2 selectivity was studied both in liquid water and in THF solutions. It was found that higher driving force resulted in a reduction of the final gas uptake as well as a significant decrease of the CO2 recovery and separation factor. The results indicated that mass transfer for hydrate growth was greatly hindered at high driving force, and the competition between CH4 and CO2 molecules for the occupancy of hydrate cavities became stronger with the increase of driving force. Although the kinetics of hydrate formation with the CO2/CH4 gas mixture was improved by adding THF and SDS into liquid water, the selectivity for CO2 removal from the CO2/CH4 gas mixture was compromised as compared to that in liquid water. The highest CO2 recovery (52%) and separation factor (8.8) were obtained at a low driving force (2.5 MPa) in liquid water, which were much higher than those obtained in THF and THF/SDS solutions. As a result, enhancing the kinetics of hydrate formation without reducing CO2 selectivity is the key factor to improve the hydrate based gas separation process for CO2 removal from the CO2/CH4 gas mixture.

Abstract: Gasification is an attractive option for converting biomass into fuels and chemicals. Most biomass contains significant amounts of fuel-bound nitrogen (FBN), which partially converts into ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) during gasification. These nitrogen compounds are problematic as they can lead to NOX emissions or catalyst poisoning in downstream applications of syngas. FBN can convert to other products as well, including diatomic nitrogen (N-2), char-bound nitrogen (char-N), and tar-bound nitrogen (tar-N). Efforts to predict concentrations of NH3 and HCN have been hindered by a lack of accurate, comprehensive measurements of nitrogen partitioning among gasification products. The present study gasified switchgrass under allothermal, short residence time conditions and measured NH3, HCN, char-N, and tar-N as a function of temperature in the range of 650-850 degrees C with diatomic nitrogen determined by difference. It was found that a major portion of FBN was retained in the char and tar products. As temperature was increased, char and tar were consumed, releasing nitrogen as gaseous NH3 and HCN. This increase in undesirable nitrogen compounds is contrary to the predictions of most gasification models, which overlook the presence of significant nitrogen in char and tar even if they include tar cracking and char gasification reactions. The results of this study demonstrate that gas-phase reactions alone are not sufficient to predict the fate of nitrogen during gasification. In order for modeling efforts to obtain more accurate predictions of nitrogen partitioning, the reactions through which gaseous nitrogen-bearing species are released from char and tar must be considered.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dimensionless simplified mathematical model of a vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) system, in order to optimize the system dynamic response. The model combines principles of thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer applied to the system components with empirical correlations, assigning thermodynamic control volumes to each component, which yield a system of ordinary differential equations with respect to time that is integrated explicitly and accurately with low computational time. Appropriate dimensionless groups are identified, and the results are presented in the form of normalized charts for general application to similar systems. Experiments were conducted using an industrial chiller that was instrumented for real time data acquisition in order to determine model adjustment parameters through the solution of the inverse problem of parameters estimation (IPPE) for a 300 W thermal load. The model was then experimentally validated using the adjusted parameters by direct comparison of simulation results to the system measured thermal response for a 1200W thermal load with good agreement. After experimental validation, the study addressed the optimization of the heat exchangers heat transfer area inventory for minimum pull down time. A system performance comparison is conducted for three refrigerant fluids: (i) a banned refrigerant (R12); (ii) its original ozone depletion harmless substitute, but with a high global warming potential, GWP (R134a), and (iii) one of the current substitutes of R134a, i.e., R1234yf. The dynamic results show that, for a system originally designed for R12, substitution with R1234yf depicts a closer performance to R12 than R134a. The optimal configuration that leads to steady state maximum system first (or coefficient of performance, COP), and second law efficiencies is also pursued. The normalized results for refrigerants R12, R134a, and R1234yf show that an optimal heat transfer area distribution in both evaporator and condenser, represented by an evaporator to total system heat exchanger area ratio x(4,opt) congruent to 0.55, leads the system to minimum pull down time and maximum system 2nd law efficiency, whereas x(4,opt) congruent to 0.4 to maximum COP, when the heat exchangers global heat transfer coefficients are of the same magnitude. The difference in the optimum location when the objective function is the pull-down time (and second law efficiency) and COP is due to the fact that the first law analysis does not fully capture the thermodynamic losses due to changes in heat exchangers' areas, which stresses the importance of a system second law assessment for realistic results. However, changes in the optima location are observed when the ratio of heat exchangers global heat transfer coefficients departs from 1. The obtained maxima and minima are sharp in the searching interval (0.1. <= x(4) <= 0.9), showing up to a 189.6% and 93.37% variation, (f(max)-f(min)/f(max/min)) x 100, in which f is either the calculated system pull down time or second law efficiency, respectively, which was observed with refrigerant R1234yf, which points out their importance for actual HVAC R (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) vapor compression systems design.

Abstract: Hydrogen is a strong candidate as an alternative fuel and energy carrier which could address problems of environmental pollution, emissions, and geo-political tensions. The aim of this paper is to compare the performance of hydrogen fuel with other fuels and to investigate the power and performance penalty when adding different fractions of hydrogen fuel to the other fuels. A one-dimensional model is developed for an engine with hydrogen and gasoline-hydrogen and methane-hydrogen blends. These models have been calibrated and validated against experimental works and the findings of previous studies. The validation of the pressure trace and the torque showed the predictive capability of the model. Furthermore, the penalty and benefits from hydrogen enrichment were clarified. It was shown that adding small controllable mass factions of hydrogen (<10%) to gasoline enhances the burning velocity and combustion process in the low speed range. However, a small reduction in the output power (<6%) was documented. Adding hydrogen to methane showed greater advantages due to the extremely low burning velocity of methane. The benefits of hydrogen addition are considerably stronger than the limitations. Methane-hydrogen blend seemed more attractive than gasoline-hydrogen blends. It can be seen that the developed simulation codes are powerful tools for the H2ICE community. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Recently, there has been much interest in sustainable transport. However, few studies have examined the driving forces for household transportation emissions from the perspective of individual travel characteristic. This research examines the features and driving factors of CO2 emissions from household daily travel in Beijing from 2000 to 2012. It first investigates the changes in personal travel characteristics and CO2 emissions, and then discusses the effects of population, economic activity, transport capacity, vehicle emission intensity, and individual travel characteristic which includes the effects of transportation intensity, transportation mode share, and vehicle-use intensity on CO2 emissions based on decomposition analysis. Results show that: (1) CO2 emission due to urban traffic has increased from 4.34 Mt in 2000 to 18.58 Mt in 2012, following an annual growth rate of 13%; (2) the per capita disposable income, vehicle-use intensity, population and transport capacity effects are found to be the main drivers that increase household daily travel CO2 emissions; and (3) the transportation intensity, vehicle emission intensity, and transportation mode share have effects on the reduction of CO2 emissions over the study period.

Abstract: A real-time electricity emissions estimating tool, the Locational Marginal Price Emissions Estimation Method (LEEM), is assessed for its ability to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), global warming potential measured as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) on a residential scale. Through LEEK residential electricity use can be shifted to low emissions times of day. In the study area of Michigan, USA emissions from five types of appliances (hot water heater, refrigerator defrost, dishwasher, clothes washer, and clothes dryer) were calculated to be theoretically reduced by 21-35% annually through a "best-case" application of LEEM. Annual emissions of the five pollutants, SO2, NOx, CO(2)e, Hg, and Pb, can be reduced across the state by 429,000, 110,000, 87,240,000, 2.21, and 4.53 pounds, respectively - all without a reduction in the electricity used in the period of study. Despite different fuel mixes, similar emissions reductions were calculated for other regions of the country, as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The thermoelectric generator (TEG) is a promising device to convert waste heat into electricity. This work numerically simulates the performance of a TEG system in which a TEG module and heat sinks are considered. The heat transfer rate of the heat sinks is approximated by an analytical method. To maximize the efficiency of the system, the Taguchi method is employed. Six factors, including the length and width of heat sink, the height and thickness of fins, hot side temperature, and external load resistance, along with five levels are taken into account. The orthogonal array employed in the Taguchi method is able to significantly reduce the time for seeking the optimum operation. The analysis suggests that the hot side temperature is the most important factor in determining the output power and efficiency of the TEG system, whereas the heat sink width almost plays no role on them. The influences of the four geometric parameters on the heat transfer rate of heat sinks are also evaluated by the Taguchi method. The results indicate that the heat sink length has the largest effect on the heat transfer rate. Two-stage optimization for the performance of the TEG system is developed. The first-stage optimum operation is obtained from the Taguchi approach, and the second-stage optimization is performed from the power-current curve. After undergoing the second-stage optimization, the output power of the system in the first stage can be further improved by around 6%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The synergistic effect of alkaline pretreatment and Fe dosing on anaerobic digestion of maize straw was investigated using mesophilic batch reactors. Three straw treatments were investigated as follows: NaOH (4% and 6%) pretreatment, Fe dosage (50, 200, 1000 and 2000 mg/L), and combined NaOH pretreatment and Fe dosage. Compared to the control, NaOH pretreatment alone increased methane yield by 3.5% (313.3 mL CH4/gVS) and 22.5% (370.9 mL CH4/gVS) and shortened the technical digestion time (TDT) from 48 days to 19 days and 10 days in 4% NaOH and 6% NaOH pretreatment respectively. Moreover, Fe dosing (200-1000 mg/L) alone gave a methane yield higher (9.4%) than that obtained from 4% NaOH and 7.5% less than the methane yield from 6% NaOH pretreatment; however, the TDT was 10 days longer. Combining NaOH pretreatment and Fe dosage (200-1000 mg/L) significantly increased the methane yield even further to 21.8% (368.8 mL CH4/gVS) and 56.2% (472.9 mL CH4/gVS), and shortened TOT from 48 days to 13 days and 7 days in 4% NaOH and 6% NaOH pretreatment respectively. This synergistic effect may be attributed to the fact that the alkaline treatment improved accessibility of the biodegradable fraction of the straw while Fe contributed to increased microbial enzyme activity.

Abstract: This study explored the feasibility of biomass CO2 gasification as an effective method for implementing the concept of a carbon-negative power system through bioenergy with carbon capturing and storage. A CO2-recycling biomass gasification system was developed and examined using the thermal equilibrium model. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the gasifier temperature from 750 to 950 degrees C, and the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and turbine exit temperature (TET) of the gas turbine from 1000 to 1200 degrees C and from 900 to 1000 degrees C, respectively. The. gasifier efficiency was increased by an increase in the CO2 recycling ratio with the more significant trend shown at the lower gasifier temperature. The turbine efficiency decreased as the CO2 recycling ratio to the gasifier increased over a certain limit, a ratio of 0.55 in most cases. A pressure ratio of 2.3 was optimum in terms of turbine efficiency. Under the examined conditions, the optimum conditions for gaining the highest system efficiency, 39.03%, were a recycling ratio of 0.55 and a TET and TIT of 1000 and 1200 degrees C respectively. The proposed system had 7.57% higher efficiency and exhausted 299.15 g CO2/kW h less CO2 emissions than conventional air gasification. Combined with carbon capturing and storage, the system potentially generates carbon-negative power generation with intensity of around 1.55-kg CO2/kg wet-biomass and a maximum efficiency penalty of 6.89%.

Abstract: Under conditions of imperfect competition, the issue of asymmetric information, which has not been effectively managed and settled until now, has been one of the most significant problems of the pool-based electricity market, both in theory and practice. Electricity generation companies expect to maximize their profits and control the market price by strategically bidding and their offers will necessarily deviate from the true marginal costs. These practices would result in great losses of market efficiency and incur much more payments from the consumers than actually needed. Therefore, this paper uses the analytical paradigm of economic mechanism design theory to deduce and design a customized pool-based market mechanism, which simultaneously satisfies three major properties of mechanism design theory: incentive compatibility, individual rationality and payment cost minimization. Then, several issues associated with the operational principle and implementation of this innovative mechanism are discussed and examined in detail. Finally, the results of numerical examples and case study validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, which can encourage truthfulness and eliminate tacit collusion, even when there is a tight market or transmission congestion with pivotal suppliers.

Abstract: The background of this research is based on the commercialization trends of the H-2 vehicles and the upcoming legislation on the zero-energy building (ZEB). Regarding these two backgrounds, there is special research interest to investigate the technical feasibility of integrating a H-2 vehicle with an on-site renewable electrical (REe) system in the ZEB. Hereby, a hybrid system consisting of an on-site REe and a H-2 vehicle integrated H-2 system is proposed and set up in the TRNSYS simulation with novel control logics defined by the authors. The essential principle is to drive the electrolyzer with the surplus onsite REe, and to drive the fuel cell to cover the on-site electrical shortage, while the cogenerated heat from the H-2 system will be utilized for domestic heating purposes. The simulation 'results show that with the support of a 14 kW wind turbine, the building will be a nearly ZEB with full annual availability of the H-2 vehicle, whereas with the support of a 178 m(2) PV, the building will be a net ZEB with 48 days' annual unavailability of the H-2 vehicle. Via a seasonal matching analysis, it can be found that the H-2 vehicle integrated Hy system has a significant effect on alleviating the monthly surplus on-site REe generation. By relieving the condition of discharging the Hy storage by the fuel cell, both the on-site surplus REe and energy shortage will be further reduced and the cogenerated heat from the Hy system can be increased. Therefore, the research approves that it is technically feasible to simultaneously meet the zero-emission fuel requirement of the Hy vehicle, the convenient accessibility of the H-2 refuelling station, the fulfillment of the zero energy balance of the building, and the highest matching capability between generation and demand.

Abstract: Global energy consumption is expected to increase significantly due to the growth of the economy and population. The utilization of fossil resource, especially coal, will likely be constrained by carbon dioxide emissions, known to be the principal contributor to climate change. Therefore, the world is facing the challenge of how to utilize fossil resource without a large carbon footprint. In the present work, a nuclear coal hybrid energy system is proposed as a potential solution to the aforementioned challenge. A high-carbon energy such as coal is integrated effectively with a low-carbon energy such as nuclear in a flexible and optimized manner, which is able to generate the chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide emissions. The nuclear coal hybrid energy system is presented in this paper for the detailed analysis. In this case, the carbon resource required by the fuel syntheses and chemical production processes is mainly provided by coal while the hydrogen resource is derived from nuclear energy. Such integration can not only lead to a good balance between carbon and hydrogen, but also improve both energy and carbon efficiencies. More importantly, a significantly lower CO2 emission intensity is achieved. A systematic technoeconomic model is established, and a scenario analysis is carried out on the hybrid system to assess the economic competitiveness based on the considerations of various types of externalities. It is found that with the rising carbon tax and coal price as well as the decreasing cost of nuclear energy, the hybrid energy system will become more and more economically competitive with the conventional option, which make it a potential viable solution for the future carbon-constrained world.

Abstract: In this paper, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method that incorporated shading and failure conditions in photovoltaic (PV) module arrays is developed. This MPPT method was built using improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). The PSO algorithm enables PV module arrays to perform MPPT for multi-peak power-voltage (P-V) output characteristic curves when shading or failures occur. This facilitates the tracking of actual maximum power points in PV module arrays. The HIP 2717 PV module produced by SANYO Electric Co., Ltd. was used in this study to assemble various array configurations. The characteristic curves of these array configurations when partial module shading or failure occurred were investigated. Numerous working conditions were selected for dual-peak, three-peak, and four-peak characteristics. PIC microcontrollers were then used to apply both the traditional and the proposed PSO algorithms to enable MPPT. A comparison of the measurement results showed that the proposed PSO algorithm exhibited superior tracking speed, response, and accuracy, compared with those of the traditional PSO algorithm.

Abstract: Currently, CCHP systems are being used over a wide area as a key alternative for producing power, heat and refrigeration. Here, a sample residential building in Mashhad city (Iran) has been selected as a case study to investigate feasibility of employing CCHP systems to meet the energy demands for various buildings sizes. An optimization algorithm is developed to find the best operation point of the Power Generation Unit (PGU) at minimum energy cost. The algorithm optimizes the operation of the CCHP systems at first step. The results of the algorithm implementation for different PGU capacities and various buildings sizes, demonstrate the performance of the operationally optimized CCHP systems at second step. The results show that CCHP system has higher performance comparing to the separate production system considering different evaluation parameters. In small buildings, primary energy saving ratio is positive for PGU capacities between 1 kW and 15 kW, with a maximum amount of 17.24%. But in large buildings, it is positive for PGU capacities between 1 kW and 30 kW, with a maximum amount of 5.1%. The PGU with capacity of 350 kW in 30-units building by 51.18% has the highest amount of energy cost saving ratio. The CCHP system with 120 kW PGU capacity in 30-units building has the least simple payback ratio by 5.08 years. Considering each parameter individually, it is showed that there are some useful mathematical relationships between optimum PGU capacity and building size. Also it is found that there is an equation for best optimum PGU capacity, considering all of evaluation criteria simultaneously. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The success of a new technology (like carbon capture and storage (CCS)) not only depends on sound technical and engineering practice but also involves societal, political and economic factors. High public acceptance is viewed as one of the critical factors. To date, there has been little systematic research into public communication and engagement in regard to CCS in China. A national survey on public perception (but biased towards the views of the educated elite of the Chinese population) of CCS technology was conducted from July 2013 to December 2013. The objectives of the survey were to assess the following issues: public understanding of the climate sciences, society's knowledge and acceptance of low emission technologies (especially of CCS technology), public interests and concerns about the positive and negative impacts of CCS technology, and public attitudes towards CCS policies supported by the government. Finally, high-level suggestions for mechanisms to raise public understanding and frame the social acceptance on CCS technology in China are proposed based on a SWOT analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, Scenedesmus obliquus NIES-2280 was cultivated heterotrophically with acetate as the carbon source. The effects of nitrogen deficiency and different phosphorus supply levels on biodiesel production by S. obliquus were investigated. It was found that S. obliquus could make good use of assimilated acetate for fatty acid accumulation. Fatty acid contents of algae in nitrogen deficiency media increased to 38-48% after 6-day cultivation. Interestingly, the productivity of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) under nitrogen starved conditions increased fourfold than that under nitrogen sufficient conditions. Moreover, FAME productivity could be further enhanced by a sufficient phosphorus supply rather than under P limitation or P deficiency conditions, and the highest FAME productivity was 55.9 mg L-1 d(-1). Furthermore, the conversion yields of acetate to fatty acids (COD based) in nitrogen starvation media (18-28%) were much higher than those in nitrogen sufficient media (similar to 7%). This study indicates a great potential to combine wastewater treatment with biodiesel production via S. obliquus which can significantly improve biodiesel productivity and COD utilization under nitrogen starvation coupled with sufficient phosphorus supply.

Abstract: Urban form is increasingly being recognised by scientists for the potential role it might play in the coordination of sustainable urban development and the reduction of CO2 emissions. However, despite increasing interest in the morphology of cities in climate change science, few quantitative estimates have been made of the effects of urban form on CO2 emissions. The goal of this study is to quantify this relation, using panel data for China's 30 provincial capital cities from 1990 to 2010. In order to meet this aim, we first selected a series of urban form indicators, which we quantified by applying spatial metrics to remotely sensed data. We then estimated CO2 emission levels using a unified standard method recommended by the IPCC Guidelines, and subsequently performed a panel data analysis. The results of the study demonstrated a positive correlation between the growth of urban areas and CO2 emission levels. Further, it was also found that increased "urban continuity" led to reductions in CO2 emissions and that, conversely, increased "urban shape complexity" exerted a positive influence in relation to CO2 emissions. The findings of this study indicate that measures to make existing cities in China more compact may in fact help to reduce levels of CO2 emissions, just as increasing fragmentation or increased irregularity with respect to urban form may contribute to increased CO2 emissions. If serious about achieving meaningful reductions in CO2 emissions, decision makers and planners should take urban form into consideration when developing low-carbon cities in China.

Abstract: Recent studies in the field of renewable energies, and specifically in wind resource prediction, have shown growing interest in proposals for Measure-Correlate-Predict (MCP) methods which simultaneously use data recorded at various reference weather stations. In this context, the use of a high number of reference stations may result in overspecification with its associated negative effects. These include, amongst others, an increase in the estimation error and/or overfitting which could be detrimental to the generalisation capacity of the model when handling new data (prediction).
This paper analyses the benefits of feature selection for use with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure when the ANNs are used as MCP methods to predict mean hourly wind speeds at a target site. The features considered in this study were the mean hourly wind speeds and directions recorded in 2003 and 2004 at five weather stations in the Canary Archipelago (Spain).
The two feature selection techniques considered in the analysis were the Correlation Feature Selection (CFS), which is a correlation-based filter approach (FA), and an MLP-based wrapper approach (WA). The metrics used to compare the results were the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the index of agreement (IoA).
Evaluation of the mean errors obtained in the 10-fold cross-validation tests for the year used to represent the short-term wind data period resulted in several conclusions. These included, notably, that the WA gave lower mean errors than the FA in 100% of the cases analysed independently of the metric employed. However, the FA resulted in a significant reduction in computational load and considerable enhancement of model interpretability. When very good correlation coefficients were obtained between the target and reference stations, no significant statistical difference was observed at 5% level between the three models (FA, WA and the models constructed with all the variables) in most of the cases analysed.

Abstract: Daylight offers visual comfort and a healthy environment inside buildings. However, factors like changing sky luminance patterns, occupant behaviour influenced by age and eyesight, daily activity schedule, building location and orientation, building plan, interior design and other socioeconomic factors influence the requirement of artificial illumination during daytime. Therefore to understand the causes in greater detail, a primary survey of 707 households belonging to different housing typologies like bungalows, duplexes, twin houses, row houses and apartments of the linear and angular forms was carried out in the study site. To calculate the hours of low natural illumination within a room, LOWLUX, a MATLAB based code has been developed.
Sky classification for the site was done based upon the all weather model' by Perez. As revealed from the primary survey, factors identified as important in influencing artificial lighting during daytime are sky conditions, age, work hours, education, income and housing typology. A binary logistic regression applied to the database to predict whether people would switch on a light at daytime in the living room, revealed that the need was least in the Angular apartments and highest in the Bungalows. A similar model for kitchen revealed highest daytime artificial illumination requirement for duplexes with lowest for angular apartments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Previous vanadium redox flow battery models (VRFB) use the ion mobility deduced from the ion diffusivity measured at low ion concentrations, resulting in an overestimation of the ionic conductivity in VRFBs that virtually operate at much higher ion concentrations. To address this issue, we propose to use the Stokes-Einstein relationship to determine an ion concentration-dependent ion mobility. A two-dimensional, transient model that incorporates the effect of ion concentrations on ion mobility is developed for VRFBs. It is shown that the present model results in: (i) a more accurate estimation of ionic conductivity, (ii) a more accurate prediction of cell voltage particularly at high current densities, and (iii) a more realistic simulation of the concentration distributions and local current density distributions in the electrodes. Finally, the model is applied to the study of the effects of important electrode design parameters and operating conditions on cell performance. It is found that the local current density, being distributed across the electrode in a manner opposite to that predicted by previous models, is much lower at the current collector side than that at the membrane side. This fact suggests that the region away from the membrane is not well utilized in conventional electrodes, thus a thinner electrode is preferred. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As an environment-friendly and renewable energy source, biomethane plays a significant role in the supply of sustainable energy. To facilitate the decision-making process of where to build a biomethane production system (BMPS) and how to allocate the resources for the BMPS, this paper develops an analytical method to find the solutions to location and allocation problems by minimizing the supply chain cost of the BMPS. The BMPS consists of the local farms for providing feedstock, the hubs for collecting and storing feedstock from farms, and the reactors for producing biomethane from feedstock. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) is introduced to model the supply chain by considering building, transportation, and labor costs. An alternative heuristic is proposed to obtain an optimal/sub-optimal solution from the MINLP. The validity of the proposed heuristic is proven by numerical examples that are abstracted from practical scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Owing to the strict restrictions imposed by the Marine Pollution Protocol and the rapid development of renewable energy, the use of solar generation and energy storage systems in ship power systems has been increasingly attracting attention. However, the improper sizing of a hybrid power generation system in a ship power system will result in a high investment cost and increased greenhouse gas emission. This paper proposes a method for determining the optimal size of the photovoltaic (PV) generation system, the diesel generator and the energy storage system in a stand-alone ship power system that minimizes the investment cost, fuel cost and the CO2 emissions. The power generation from PV modules on a ship relies on the date, local time, time zone, longitude and latitude along a navigation route and is different from the conditions of power systems on land. Thus, a method, which takes the seasonal and geographical variation of solar irradiations and temperatures along the route from Dalian in China to Aden in Yemen into account, for correcting the output of PV modules is developed in this paper. The proposed method considers five conditions along the navigation route to model the total ship load. Four cases are studied in details to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In recent years, as a result of the continuous increase in energy demand, the use of energy storage has become increasingly important. To address this problem, the application of phase change materials (PCM) in buildings has received attention because of their high energy storage density and their ease of incorporation in building envelopes. Despite large experimental works conducted on the application phase change materials in buildings, there is very little work done on this application in combination with night ventilation. In this study, the application of night ventilation in combination with PCM-impregnated gypsum boards for cooling purposes was experimentally investigated. Two identical test huts equipped with "smart" control systems were used for testing the concept. One hut was constructed using impregnated gypsum boards, while the other hut was finished with ordinary gypsum board. Initially an air conditioning (AC) unit, without night ventilation, was used in both huts to charge the PCM during low peak period, showing very little savings in electricity. However, when night ventilation was used to charge the PCM instead, a weekly electricity saving of 73% was achieved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Desalination powered by renewable energy sources is an attractive solution to address the worldwide water-shortage problem without contributing significant to greenhouse gas emissions. A promising system for renewable energy desalination is the utilization of low-temperature direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) driven by a thermal solar energy system, such as a salt-gradient solar pond (SGSP). This investigation presents the first experimental study of fresh water production in a coupled DCMD/SGSP system. The objectives of this work are to determine the experimental fresh water production rates and the energetic requirements of the different components of the system. From the laboratory results, it was found that the coupled DCMD/SGSP system treats approximately six times the water flow treated by a similar system that consisted of an air-gap membrane distillation unit driven by an SGSP. In terms of the energetic requirements, approximately 70% of the heat extracted from the SGSP was utilized to drive thermal desalination and the rest was lost in different locations of the system. In the membrane module, only half of the useful heat was actually used to transport water across the membrane and the remainder was lost by conduction in the membrane. It was also found that by reducing heat losses throughout the system would yield higher water fluxes, pointing out the need to improve the efficiency throughout the DCMD/SGSP coupled system. Therefore, further investigation of membrane properties, insulation of the system, or optimal design of the solar pond must be addressed in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The effect of Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) on the decarbonation process during oxy-fuel combustion in a lime (and cement) rotary kiln is analyzed using an unsteady one-dimensional Eulerian-Lagrangian mathematical model. The model considers gas and limestone as continuous phases and the coal particles as the discrete phase. The model predicts limestone decarbonation, temperature and species distribution of gas and solid phases along the kiln. Simulation results of an air-combustion case are successfully validated with reported experimental data. This model is used to study and to compare the conventional air combustion process with oxy-fuel combustion with FGR ratios between 30% and 80% as controller parameter in this process. Changes in decarbonation process due to energy fluxes by convection and radiation with different FGRs were simulated and analyzed. Simulation results indicate a temperature increase of 20% in the gas and solid phases and a higher decarbonation rate of 40% in relation to the air-combustion case, for a given constant fuel consumption rate. However, for a given temperature, the increase of the CO2 partial pressure in the oxy-fuel case promotes a reduction of the decarbonation rate. Therefore, there is a compromise between FGR and decarbonation rate, which is analyzed in the present study. Simulation results of the decarbonation step in low FGR cases, compared to air-combustion case, shows that conversion takes place in shorter distances in the kiln, suggesting that the production rate can be increased for existing kilns in oxy-fuel kilns or, equivalently, shorter kilns can be designed for an equivalent production rate.

Abstract: When an air-source heat pump (ASHP) was operated in heating mode under certain ambient conditions, frost always accumulated on the fin surface of its outdoor coil. Frosting may increase the energy consumption and deteriorate the performance of the ASHP, and hence, periodic defrosting is necessary. In this study, a new defrosting method using intermittent ultrasonic vibration was investigated. First, the vibration attenuation characteristics of a double-row outdoor coil and the frost growth characteristics under different ambient conditions were determined. Next, the average frost thickness with and without the application of intermittent ultrasonic vibration was calculated using MATLAB software. Finally, the decrease in defrosting energy consumption, the increase in heating capacity, and the increase in the coefficient of performance were analysed. The experimental results indicate that intermittent ultrasonic vibration could effectively remove the frost accumulated on the fin surface, and the effective defrosting area of an single ultrasonic transducer was 0.165 m(2) for a double-row finned-tube evaporator on which an ultrasonic transducer with a rated power of 50 W and resonant frequency of 40 kHz was applied. The defrosting energy consumption of the ASHP unit with ultrasonic vibration was 3.14-5.46% lower than that without ultrasonic vibration, whereas the heating capacity increased by 2.2-9.03% and the COP increased by 6.51-15.33%. In addition, the thermal comfort of the indoor side was clearly improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (EU) wood was successively treated by a combined system based on steam explosion pretreatment (SEP) and alkaline hydrogen peroxide post-treatment (AHPP). In this case, SEP was to disrupt the lignocellulosic structure, and the subsequent AHPP process was to isolate the high-purity lignin and cellulose-rich substrates. Results showed that the lignin fractions obtained during the AHPP exhibited smaller molecular weights, narrow polydispersity, less phenolic OH groups and lower syringyl/guaiacyl ratios (S/G) than those of the milled wood lignin (SEMWL) obtained from the only steam exploded EU. NMR characterization of lignin revealed that the AHPP process has a slight effect on the composition and molecular characteristic of lignin, and the lignin isolated had lower amounts of substructures (aryl-beta-ether, resinol, and phenylcoumaran linkages) as compared to those in SEMWL. Moreover, the subsequent SEP followed by AHPP process enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose-rich substrates to a maximum value of 91.69%. It was found that the synergistic treatment removed most of lignin, degraded hemicelluloses, and incurred a higher crystalline index and surface area of the cellulose-rich substrates as compared to the only steam explosion pretreatment. The combination of the SEP and AHPP processes is an environmentally benign and advantageous scheme for the production of high-purity lignin and cellulose-rich substrates, which will be further transformed into the value-added biomaterials and bioethanol.

Abstract: Earth-air tunnel ventilation is an energy efficient means of preheating and cooling of supply air to a building. Due to changing soil and atmospheric conditions and the consequent changes in heating and cooling loads of a building during operation, an earth-air heat exchanger interacts with the environments and the performance varies with the conditions. A computer program has been developed for modelling of coupled heat and moisture transfer in soil and for simulation of the thermal performance of an earth-air heat exchanger for building ventilation, taking account of dynamic variations of climatic, load and soil conditions. The importance of dynamic interactions between the three media - heat exchanger, soil and atmosphere - is illustrated from the comparison of the heat transfer rates and supply air temperature through the heat exchanger under continuous and intermittent operation in heating seasons. It is shown that neglecting the interactions between any two or all three media would significantly over or under predict the heat transfer rate and air temperature. Neglecting the interactions between the heat exchanger, soil and ventilating air would over predict the thermal performance of an earth-air heat exchanger whereas neglecting the interactions between the soil surface and atmosphere would fail to produce reliable data for long term operational performance of the earth-air heat exchanger installed in shallow ground. The level of over-prediction could be larger for intermittent operation than for continuous operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The most successful peer-to-peer networks are based on the concept of supernode, which is an operating point of the network that provides services and advanced functionalities to other nodes. Inspired by this idea, this paper proposes to integrate nodes that provide intelligent advanced services in the future architecture of the electrical grid. Besides facilitating the access to data services such as demand estimations and weather forecasts, these nodes are especially meant to hold virtual environments in which software agents, after being contracted, negotiate on behalf of users in energy markets. This architecture is designed to be compatible with the Energy Interoperation OASIS standard. The capabilities and feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated through realistic experiments based on OpenADR programs, in which users exchange energy by using parallel auction markets. In addition, in order to have the roles of buyer and seller in demand-response programs, thus allowing the creation of markets, a conceptual model based on negative loads and critical loads is provided. The experiments have proven that the proposed architecture facilitates the implementation of advanced distributed management systems in order that smart metering infrastructures, in contrast with traditional agent-based solutions, are released to perform negotiation tasks and access data services, while users gain both autonomy and decision-making capacity.

Abstract: For the cost-effective control of unregulated CO2 emissions, its capture through modifications to adsorbents has recently gained much attention. In this respect, amination through basification of activated carbon (AC) surface is one of the practical approaches to separate CO2. To learn more about such mechanism, a number of key variables (e.g., the nature of the AC surface groups, their CO2 absorption enthalpy, and the effect of amination on adsorption) are reviewed. The potent role of amination is hence described with respect to the significance of pretreatment prior to amination technique by comparing the performance of diverse media (e.g., advanced oxidation processes (AOP), Ca(NO3)(2), and KOH) for such application. The analysis of collected adsorption data suggests that the efficiency of amination and eventual selective adsorption of CO2 can be improved by such pretreatment as KOH sintering in terms of inducing stronger surface CO2 binding energy.

Abstract: This work presents a generic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that integrates the unit commitment problem (UCP), i.e., daily energy planning with the long-term generation expansion planning (GEP) framework. Typical daily constraints at an hourly level such as start-up and shut-down related decisions (start-up type, minimum up and down time, synchronization, soak and desynchronization time constraints), ramping limits, system reserve requirements are combined with representative yearly constraints such as power capacity additions, power generation bounds of each unit, peak reserve requirements, and energy policy issues (renewables penetration limits, CO2 emissions cap and pricing). For modelling purposes, a representative day (24 h) of each month over a number of years has been employed in order to determine the optimal capacity additions, electricity market clearing prices, and daily operational planning of the studied power system. The model has been tested on an illustrative case study of the Greek power system. Our approach aims to provide useful insight into strategic and challenging decisions to be determined by investors and/or policy makers at a national and/or regional level by providing the optimal energy roadmap under real operating and design constraints.

Abstract: Selecting the most sustainable site plays an important role in the life cycle of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS), which needs to consider some conflicting criteria. Different from the previous studies which mostly utilize programming (optimization) models, this paper employed a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to consider some subjective but important criteria for EVCS site selection. To reflect the ambiguity and vagueness due to the subjective judgments of decision makers, fuzzy TOPSIS method was applied to select the optimal EVCS site. Based on academic literatures, feasibility research reports and expert opinions in different fields, the evaluation index system for EVCS site selection was built from sustainability perspective, which consists of environmental, economic and social criteria associated with a total of 11 sub-criteria. Then, the criteria performances of different alternatives and criteria weights were judged by five groups of expert panels in the fields of environment, economy, society, electric power system and transportation system. Finally, the EVCS site alternatives were ranked by employing fuzzy TOPSIS method. The result shows EVCS site A2 located at Changping district in Beijing obtains the highest ranking score and should be selected as the optimal site. Meanwhile, the environmental and social criteria are paid more attentions from decision makers than economic criteria. The sensitivity analysis results indicate the alternative A2 always secures its top ranking no matter how sub-criteria weights change. It is effective and robust to apply fuzzy TOPSIS method into EVCS site selection. This paper provides a new research perspective for site selection and also extends the application domains of fuzzy TOPSIS method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The implementation of CO2 capture systems in conventional processes has been proposed by the IPCC as an effective way to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, these capture systems may represent an important decrease in the global efficiency for conventional processes. Chemical Looping has already been demonstrated as a promising technology for more efficient CO2 capture. Novel reactor concepts have been proposed in the literature, in which the reactions take place at lower temperatures with increased overall energy efficiency. However, few investigations have been carried out regarding the behaviour of oxygen carriers at relatively low operating temperatures. In this work, an active Ni-based oxygen carrier supported on CaAl2O4 inert material has been tested and characterized. The oxygen carrier has shown a promising behaviour for low temperature applications. However, it has been demonstrated that the oxygen carrier has to be pre-treated because of an interesting activation process which takes place only at high reduction temperatures. Oxygen carrier activation is caused by a reorganization of superficial nickel. Fresh oxygen carrier is covered by a layer of nickel with a strong interaction with the support. However, once the sample is reduced at high temperatures Ni is reorganized into small grains with reduced interaction with the support. This results in an enhancement in the reactivity and a higher oxygen transport capacity. After about 200 redox cycles, a small decrease in the solid conversion is observed due to agglomeration of the NiO grains. Nevertheless, the redox kinetics is still sufficiently fast for low temperature applications, provided that the oxygen carrier is pre-activated. The kinetics rates for the gas solid reactions and gas-phase catalytic reactions have been determined, which can be used to predict the performance of the activated NiO/CaAl2O4 oxygen carrier for low temperature chemical looping applications.

Abstract: Several scenarios have been proposed recently for the future electricity generation approaches that include a substantial share of renewable technologies. The proposed increase in the market share of these technologies has led to increasing concern regarding the availability of the metals required for these technologies, as well as for the impacts associated with their production. In this regards, it is of interest that most of the metals that are essential for renewable technologies are coproduced with other metals: indium, germanium, and cadmium with zinc, and tellurium and selenium with copper, for example. An increase in the demand for the companion metals can be met either by increasing the recycling of these metals, the efficiency of their recovery, or their extraction from primary resources, the latter of which will lead to an increase in the production of the host metals with possible implications on their supply and demand.
In this paper we develop a "green energy" scenario to investigate these metal-related issues in detail. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) More Se and Te may require mining more copper than can be used, while extracting more arsenic than can conveniently be sequestered; (2) more In and Ge may require mining more zinc than can be used, while extracting more cadmium than can conveniently be sequestered; (3) oversupply mining of copper and zinc will decrease their virgin metal prices, and thereby discourage end of life recycling of those metals; (4) the greenhouse gases produced by mining oversupplies of the host metals zinc and copper will, in some case, exceed the greenhouse gases savings produced by a fossil fuel to solar cell transition; (5) these challenges can be minimized, but probably not avoided, by increasing the recovery rates of Se, Te, In, and Ge from the host metal ores, and by more efficient end of life recycling.

Abstract: Museums are dedicated to protect their artwork collection and to display the collection as safely as possible. Amongst other things, the indoor climate is of utmost importance to minimize collection degradation. Many museums employ tight climate guidelines, allowing only small fluctuations of indoor temperature and relative humidity, resulting in the following problems: huge energy consumption, the need for high-capacity HVAC systems, additional stress on historical buildings. This simulation study investigates the energy-saving potential of different setpoint strategies. Damage functions were used to assess the degradation risk of the collection and an Adaptive Temperature Guideline was used to assess thermal comfort. A state-of-the-art museum in the Netherlands was modeled and the indoor climate and energy consumption were simulated, including heating, cooling, humidification and dehumidification. Maximum savings, compared to a reference situation, of 82% may be achieved. However, the optimum strategy yields a saving of 77%, significantly improves thermal comfort and decreases chemical degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study aimed to analyze whether, and how, uncertainty influences the layout and costs of a CO2 transportation network. The case without uncertainty is modelled with a perfect foresight (PF) model and with uncertainty with the real option approach (ROA). In this study, uncertainties in the CO2 price, tariff received per tonne of CO2 transported, the willingness, probability and moment-that sources join the CO2 transportation network are incorporated in the analysis. The results show that uncertainty leads to higher required CO2 prices before investments in carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are made. With a volatility of 47% in the CO2 price, the required CO2 price almost triples in comparison with the net present value approach. Hence, under uncertainty less sources are retrofitted with CCS and less CO2 is captured and stored over time. For instance, for the analyzed case study 31 Mt and 137 Mt CO2 is projected to be captured in the base scenario of ROA and PF model, respectively, in the period 2015-2050. If the volatility of the CO2 price is reduced with 50%, 96 Mt is projected to be captured in the ROA, which is still about one third less than in the PF model.
Furthermore, the results show that uncertainty leads to less development of trunklines. All this leads to an increase in the transport and storage costs. For instance, for our case study, the average CO2 transport and storage costs in 2050 increase from 2.8 (sic)/t to 13 (sic)/t in the base scenario of the ROA compared to the PF model. If the volatility is reduced with 50%, the transport and storage costs decrease to 7.5 (sic)/t in the ROA, which is still 2.5 times as much as in the PF model.
Our findings indicate that the implementation of CCS can best be stimulated by reducing the volatility of the CO2 price, reducing capture costs and facilitating cooperation between nearby sources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Industrial loads in non-residential buildings have significantly contributed in total energy use throughout the world. This paper aims to develop a data-driven risk-based framework to predict and optimally control industrial loads in non-residential buildings. In the proposed framework, first, a set of predictive analytics tools are employed to identify the patterns of industrial loads over time. This also includes a high-dimensional clustering model to allocate industrial load profiles into smaller groups with less variability and same patterns. Once the patterns of industrial loads are identified, then a classification model is implemented to estimate the best class that matches with any new load profiles. Ultimately, the proposed framework provides a risk-based model to calculate and evaluate the total risk of energy decisions for the next day. This is coupled with a utility function structure to help decision makers to take best demand-side actions. The efficiency of the proposed model is investigated through a real world use case.

Abstract: Technology transfers through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol is one of the most important catalysts in the cooperation between developed (Annex I) and developing (non-Annex I) countries for climate change mitigation. With the large-scale implementation of CDM projects in recent years, it is important to timely and comprehensively analyze the effectiveness of technology transfers in these implemented projects on the level of individual countries. In this context, China is of particular significance as it is the biggest host country of CDM projects in the world; 50% of total CDM projects implemented from 2007 to 2012 have issued Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) to 60% of all of the CDM projects. In this study, we evaluated the performance of technology transfers in an exclusive database of 754 CDM projects hosted by China between 2007 and 2012 with issued CERs since CERs were first issued in China. In addition, we developed a logistic regression approach using 11-variables that include a series of extended technology transfer-based indicators from the perspectives of project design, economic level, and technology capability that have not been studied in detail in the past. The results show that technology transfers are more likely to occur in large-sized projects with higher CER incomes, in projects with international participants, and in projects involving types such as HFC-23 reduction, fuel substitute, and N2O decomposition, in comparison to projects involving renewable energy. We observed that over 90% of the technology transfer projects only include importation of equipment or training to China. In our findings of the regression results, it shows that technology transfers occurred more often in regions with lower technology capabilities, less energy consumption, and a lower GDP growth rate. Supported by high local technology capability and the governmental strategy with independent innovation, the advantages of introducing technology from other countries are offset by local technology diffusion. In a market view, financial incentives hinder CDM host parties from introducing new equipment or trainings for the high marginal cost, unless the high marginal cost of technology transfer can be offset by a large CDM with a high CER income. Technology transfer is more income-driven than sustainability-driven at the present stage in China. In our analysis, the drive out effect between HFC-23 and renewable projects in CDM suggests China government to publish more effective incentives to attract more sustainable types of CDM projects with a higher level of technology innovation. The results are also discussed in the context of policy issues, which can be helpful for the decision makers when formulating future sustainable strategic plans and policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Although many attempts to promote energy conservation by information provision implicitly assume that receivers of information make rational decisions based on deliberation, outcomes have been less than expected. To address this problem, use of normative messages to inform customers how other customers are behaving is being investigated as a means of promoting energy conservation behaviors. However, it remains unclear how such interventions increase customers' motivation to conserve electricity and which attributes of customers are most relevant. In this research, we conducted experiments using randomized controlled trials in Japan to investigate the effects of normative messages on motivational change for electricity conservation. The results show that normative messages significantly improved motivation for electricity conservation more than simple feedback did. We also investigated which types of respondents' attributes, including personality traits, were most affected by the normative messages provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Properties of facade materials should be considered to determine which of them strongly affect building energy performance, regardless of the building shapes, scales, ideal locations, and building types, and thus may be able to promote energy efficiency in buildings. In this study, the effects of four fundamental facade properties related to the energy efficiency of office buildings in Tokyo, Japan, were investigated with the purpose of reducing the heating and cooling energy demands. Some fundamental design factors such as volume and shape were also considered. It was found that the reduction in both the solar heat gain coefficient and window U-value and increase in the solar reflectance of the opaque parts are promising measures for reducing the energy demand. Conversely, the reduction in the U-value of the opaque parts decreased the heating energy demand, and this was accompanied by an increase in the cooling energy demand in some cases because the total energy demands were predominantly for cooling. The above-mentioned promising measures for reducing building energy demands are thus recommended for use, and an appropriate U-value should be applied to the opaque parts based on careful considerations. This study provides some fundamental ideas to adjust the facade properties of buildings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Industrial producers face the task of optimizing production process in an attempt to achieve the desired quality such as mechanical properties with the lowest energy consumption. In industrial carbon fiber production, the fibers are processed in bundles containing (batches) several thousand filaments and consequently the energy optimization will be a stochastic process as it involves uncertainty, imprecision or randomness. This paper presents a stochastic optimization model to reduce energy consumption a given range of desired mechanical properties. Several processing condition sets are developed and for each set of conditions, 50 samples of fiber are analyzed for their tensile strength and modulus. The energy consumption during production of the samples is carefully monitored on the processing equipment. Then, five standard distribution functions are examined to determine those which can best describe the distribution of mechanical properties of filaments. To verify the distribution goodness of fit and correlation statistics, the Kolmogorov-Smimov test is used. In order to estimate the selected distribution (Weibull) parameters, the maximum likelihood, least square and genetic algorithm methods are compared. An array of factors including the sample size, the confidence level, and relative error of estimated parameters are used for evaluating the tensile strength and modulus properties.
The energy consumption and N-2 gas cost are modeled by Convex Hull method. Finally, in order to optimize the carbon fiber production quality and its energy consumption and total cost, mixed integer linear programming is utilized. The results show that using the stochastic optimization models, we are able to predict the production quality in a given range and minimize the energy consumption of its industrial process.

Abstract: Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is considered to be the most promising and economically viable process for carbon dioxide capture. The oxygen carrier has a central role in the chemical-looping combustion process. Ilmenite, a natural mineral composed of FeTiO3, has been extensively used as oxygen carrier in CLC systems due to its availability, relatively low cost and demonstrated reactivity. During the looping process ilmenite undergoes a series of chemical and mechanical transformations that eventually lead to the break-down of particles into smaller fragments, which are unfit for use in circulated fluidized bed (CFB) applications.
In the present study a 100 kW chemical-looping system was operated with ilmenite particles as oxygen carrier and with biomass char as fuel. Ilmenite particles were collected at the end of the run. The collected particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Thermodynamic predictions of the expected compounds at the given conditions were also used to compare with the experimentally obtained results.
The aim of the study was to understand the change in morphology and chemical compositions of the collected ilmenite particles and to relate them to the exposure conditions in the CLC reactor.
It was found that the aging of the ilmenite particles could be distinguished based on the particle morphology. Furthermore, a possible mechanism for the transformation of the ilmenite particles during the cyclic chemical-looping process was proposed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The growing need for efficient vehicles has led many researchers to explore various ways to utilize waste heat from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) to improve vehicle fuel economy. Past efforts in Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) have focused primarily on recovering waste heat from Conventional Vehicles (CV), which dissipate more than two-thirds of the fuel energy as waste heat. In general, WHR has always been considered as a secondary component to the vehicle powertrain and as a result it has had little success, particularly in light-duty vehicles. This investigation explores WHR from a broader perspective to better understand the possibilities and limits of WHR from CVs to future highly hybridized vehicles. Fuel energy distribution in the ICE is used to evaluate the sources of waste heat and identify exhaust energy recovery as the most promising method for improving ICE thermal efficiency. Fundamental analysis of conventional and hybrid powertrain design is used to investigate how they impact the availability of exhaust energy from the ICE. Models and simulations of several engines and vehicles are used to validate the theory presented for effective WHR from light-duty vehicles. The analysis focuses on how available exhaust energy changes for different vehicles, how it varies with drive cycles, and how the induced back pressure from an exhaust energy recovery system affects ICE performance. The results indicate that effective WHR is difficult to achieve in light-duty conventional vehicles, but is viable in a highly hybridized vehicles, where ICE thermal efficiency can be increased by at least 15 percent over various drive cycles.

Abstract: Based on the piston force analysis of the hydraulic free piston diesel engine, a nonlinear vibration model is established. Then the solution of the nonlinear vibration model is given by the generalized harmonic KBM method. The reasons that affect the constant amplitude of the nonlinear vibration model are analyzed according to the expression of the constant amplitude. The constant amplitude is limited by many factors and the system will be unstable if the correlated variables are out of range. The influential factors, such as the fuel injection position and quality, are investigated. In addition, the fluctuation of pump chamber caused by the variation of response characteristics of check value also influences the constant amplitude. All these reasons may lead to the unstability of the oscillatory system. Because the combustion condition is influenced by the air intake and fuel injection, the selection of unstable region is decided by the scavenging and combustion. Therefore the scavenging influenced by the port opening is researched and the results are validated by experiment. In order to get the optimal design of HFPE, the stability range of the piston constant amplitude and judging in equation are proposed, and the parameters in the stable region are obtained. All these efforts establish the theoretical foundation for control strategy of stability improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Results from computational simulations of fuel economy and engine-out emissions are presented for light-duty conventional and hybrid vehicles powered by conventional and high-efficiency combustion engines, including use of port fuel-injected, lean gasoline direct injection, reactivity controlled compression ignition, and conventional diesel combustion. The results indicate that multimode operation with conventional diesel combustion plus reactivity controlled compression ignition, conventional diesel combustion only, and lean gasoline direct injection has the potential to significantly exceed port fuel-injected fuel economy. In all cases, hybridization is predicted to significantly improve fuel economy by permitting the maximum exploitation of high efficiency engine combustion states. Predicted engine-out emissions vary considerably with combustion mode, with reactivity controlled compression ignition generating the highest carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. On the other hand, reactivity controlled compression ignition is predicted to generate the lowest emissions of nitrogen oxides. Importantly, lean gasoline direct injection and reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion modes are expected to dramatically decrease exhaust temperatures, especially for reactivity controlled compression ignition, which can potentially limit aftertreatment performance. While all results presented are from simulations, the results provide prediction of important details and trends for advanced vehicles that are currently extremely difficult to experimentally study.

Abstract: Very little attention has been dedicated to the carrier re-oxidation in chemical looping systems. The work presented in this paper is for the re-oxidation of partially reduced hematite from a cyclic chemical looping fixed bed process. The underlying purpose of this work is to develop engineering rates and mechanisms for the re-oxidation of partially reduced hematite that can be included in CFD models for a chemical looping process. To this end, experiments were run using nominally 1000 g of hematite material in a fixed bed reactor cycling between reduction and re-oxidation. The cyclic processing began with the reduction step then proceeded to the oxidation step repeating this analysis for several cycles ranging from 5 to 10. The re-oxidation process was conducted at temperatures ranging from 745 degrees C to 825 degrees C and oxygen concentrations ranging between 9% and 11%. The reduction was carried out at the same temperature as the re-oxidation step at various CH4 concentrations from 5% to 9%. In this paper, cyclic induced variations in performance are presented as well as the kinetic parameters for the first cycle. The re-oxidation of the depleted hematite occurs through a 2 step parallel process in which oxygen reacts to fill the surface of each grain within the particles and then migrates through oxygen vacancy diffusion to the depleted cores of each grain.

Abstract: This paper contains an evaluation of the environmental performance of a comprehensive set of current and future mid-size passenger vehicles. We present a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based on a novel integrated vehicle simulation framework, which allows for consistency in vehicle parameter settings and consideration of future technological progress. Conventional and hybrid gasoline, diesel and natural gas cars as well as battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEV and FCV) are analyzed, taking into account electricity and hydrogen production chains from fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources.
Our results show that a substantial mitigation of climate change can be obtained with electric passenger vehicles, provided that non-fossil energy resources are used for electricity and hydrogen production. However, in terms of other environmental burdens such as acidification, particulate matter formation, and toxicity, BEV may in some cases and FCV are likely to perform worse than modern fossil fueled cars as a consequence of emissions along vehicle and fuel production chains. Therefore, the electrification of road transportation should be accompanied by an integration of life cycle management in vehicle manufacturing chains as well as energy and transport policies in order to counter potential environmental drawbacks.

Abstract: The production and end-of-life (EoL) processes for current and future proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for road passenger vehicle applications were analysed and quantified in the form of life cycle inventories. The current PEMFC technology is characterised by highly sensitive operating conditions and a high system mass. For each core component of PEMFC there are a range of materials under development and the research aimed to identify those considered realistic for a 2020 future scenario and according to commercial goals of achieving higher performance, increased power density, greater stability and a marked reduction of costs. End-of-life scenarios were developed in consideration of the materials at the focus of recovery efforts.
The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) addressed the production and EoL of the fuel cell systems with inclusion of a sensitivity analysis to assess influences on the results from the key fuel cell parameters. The second part to the LCIA assessed the environmental and human health burdens from passenger transport in a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) with comparison between the 2012 and 2020 fuel cell scenarios and referenced to an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) of Euro5 emission standard. It was seen that whilst the drivetrain (and therefore the fuel cell system) is a major contributor to the emissions in all the indicators shown, the hydrogen use (and therefore the efficiency of the fuel cell system and the method of hydrogen production) can have a far greater influence on the environmental performance. Overall, the results show inconclusive environmental benefits for using FCV instead of modern ICEV: a substantial reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions can only be achieved using hydrogen produced with non-fossil energy resources. However, even such "clean" hydrogen used in FCV will not lead to a reduction of several other environmental burdens from the life cycle perspective within the time frame considered.

Abstract: Chemical looping combustion is a very efficient CO2 capture technology utilizing two interconnected circulating fluidized beds. Despite promising results in basic research on chemical looping combustion at laboratory scale, the technical process has to be further developed, especially toward a potential industrial application. In order to accelerate this development, it is essential to simulate chemical looping combustion with process simulation software. In this study a process simulation model is validated using experimental data obtained from a 100 kW(th) pilot plant at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden). The targeted configuration of the process is created and all substances and boundary conditions are defined. The solids distribution and also the chemical conversion of gases and solids are simulated by a user defined model. This model is based on mathematical equations for fluidized beds and kinetic data of the chemical reactions is taken into consideration. The one-dimensional solids distribution is validated with experimental measurements using empirical correlations according to Kunii and Levenspiel. Conversions in the dense and the lean zone of the fluidized bed are determined using kinetic data from literature. The elaborated model is validated against the concentrations of gases at the fuel reactor exit. The calculated results are in very good agreement with experimental data. Sensitivity analyses are performed to optimize the operational conditions of the pilot plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the heat transfer and X-ray diffraction patterns of solidified molten salt droplets in heat recovery processes of a thermochemical Cu-Cl cycle of hydrogen production. It is essential to recover the heat of the molten salt to enhance the overall thermal efficiency of the copper-chlorine cycle. A major portion of heat recovery within the cycle can be achieved by cooling and solidifying the molten salt exiting an oxygen reactor. Heat recovery from the molten salt is achieved by dispersing the molten stream into droplets. In this paper, an analytical study and experimental investigation of the thermal phenomena of a falling droplet quenched into water is presented, involving the droplet surface temperature during descent and resulting composition change in the quench process. The results show that it is feasible to quench the molten salt droplets for an efficient heat recovery process without introducing any material imbalance for the overall cycle integration.

Abstract: The success of a Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process for solid fossil fuel combustion is critically affected by the performance of the oxygen carrier and by proper design and operation of the fuel reactor.
In this study, a novel configuration of the fuel reactor for chemical looping combustion with oxygen uncoupling of solid fossil fuels is proposed. The configuration is based on a two-stage reactor with the aim of overcoming the main drawbacks of the single-stage design: limited conversion, slip of unburnt volatiles, extensive elutriation of char fines. The two stages of the configuration operate in series and accomplish different tasks. The bottom bed is mainly devoted to conversion of the char, taking advantage of the full oxidative power of the oxygen carrier coming from the air reactor. The top reactor exploits the residual oxidative power of the oxygen carrier to oxidize volatile matter and gasification products as well as the unconverted char issuing from the bottom bed.
A mathematical model has been developed with the aim of assessing the performances of the two-stage fuel reactor varying operating conditions in comparison with a benchmark case consisting of a single-stage fuel reactor. Two options were considered in the benchmark, depending on whether the single stage fuel reactor is or is not equipped with a carbon stripper at the exhaust. The operation of the fuel reactor has been simulated by considering chemical looping combustion of a bituminous coal with an oxygen carrier consisting of CuO supported on zirconia.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental investigation of the starting process of a prototype free piston engine generator (FPEG). Experimental test results show that during the motoring stage, the peak in-cylinder pressure and compression ratio increase in a non-linear manner and trend to reach a stable state after a number of cycles. The motoring force is suggested to be within a reasonable range. With a fixed starting force of 125 N, the in-cylinder air fuel mixture was successfully ignited at the fourth cycle with a compression ratio of over 9:1. The peak in-cylinder pressure for the first combustion cycle reached over 40 bar. The piston ran at high and relatively constant speed at the middle portion of the stroke. The peak piston velocity increases significantly to around 4.0 m/s. Cycle-to-cycle variation of the piston movement was significant and the engine misfired frequently. During the misfire cycles, the peak piston velocity decreased to nearly 2.5 m/s; and the piston dynamics were similar to the motoring process. Based on these, discussion on misfire and further stable running control, as well as the linear electric machine mode switch were presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To meet increasingly stringent emission legislation, electric vehicles are expected to offer promising sustainable mobility in the future. However, the driving range of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is limited as compared with hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Additionally, the grid power supply in China is highly dependent on coal-based thermal power generation, which leads to high grid-carbon intensity and increased well-to-tank (WTT) emission for BEVs. Therefore, the tradeoff between electric vehicle driving range and environmental impact has become a critical problem in BEV development in China.
In this study, a BEV model is built and validated. The energy consumption and well-to-wheel (WTW) CO2 emission rates of different driving ranges and test cycles are simulated. To determine the impact of driving patterns on BEV energy consumption, the distribution of vehicle energy consumption is analyzed and an analytical model is proposed to generalize the energy consumption of BEVs in standardized driving cycles to real-world driving with only two statistical characteristics: the average and the variance of the speeds. It is found that BEVs have a great advantage in terms of energy saving only at driving cycles with low average speeds and frequent stops. While driving at highway speeds, the energy consumption of BEVs can be very high. With an understanding of driving pattern impact, parameter variation analysis of the BEV WTW CO2 emission rates for different driving ranges is simulated. Simulation results show that the rolling coefficient and battery energy density have a significant impact on driving range, followed by the drag area. However, grid-carbon intensity is more efficient for reducing WTW CO2 emissions. Currently, optimization of the rolling coefficient and drag area is the most viable option for increasing the battery range and decreasing the WTW CO2 emission rate.
Finally, to reduce the energy and environmental impact of BEVs in China, short driving ranges (<250 km) and low driving speeds (<80 km/h) are suggested for current BEVs, and optimization of the vehicle design and reduction of grid-carbon intensity are considered to be the most critical issues for the future application of BEVs.

Abstract: After almost three years of preparation, the tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE) was implemented across China in July 2012. The feedbacks of household electricity consumption to the new pricing policy are investigated in this paper based on the micro household-level data from China's Residential Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS). We document that electricity consumption of 82% surveyed households did not affected by the TPHE, which is in conformity with the principle that the TPHE policy based on. More importantly, factors that influence elasticity of household electricity consumption are examined by empirical model in this paper. Results indicate that factors such as the energy price, household income, and demographic attributes have significant impacts on residential electricity consumption. Further discussion outcomes show that the publicity of the TPHE, energy price and some other factors are strongly correlated with the probability that households change the inefficient and lavish pattern of electricity consumption. Future directions for the design and improvement of residential electricity pricing reform are thus suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Quantitative measurements of historic improvements in fuel efficiency technology help to illuminate the feasibility of future fuel economy standards. Past investigations have produced widely varying estimates of this rate of improvement, though all seem to indicate that fuel consumption reductions implied by the 2025 U.S. CAFE standards cannot be met solely through technological improvements at historic rates. In this paper, we use the characteristics of U.S. cars between 1975 and 2009 to estimate that holding all else equal, a 1% increase in weight increases a car's fuel consumption by 0.69%, and a 1% reduction in 097 km/h acceleration time increases fuel consumption by 0.44%. These tradeoff parameters are combined with the results of related work by the authors and others, yielding a more comprehensive measure of technological improvements than has been previously reported. When accounting for all of these sources of improvement, we conclude that the per-mile (or per-kilometer) fuel consumption of new cars in the U.S. could have been reduced by 5% per year from 1975 to 1990, if acceleration, features, and functionality had remained at their 1975 levels. Approximately 80% of this potential was realized as actual reductions in fuel consumption. Between 1990 and 2009, in contrast, technological improvement averaged just 2.1% per year, only 34% of which was realized as actual fuel consumption reductions. To meet the 2025 CAFE standards for cars without sacrificing capabilities that consumers have come to expect, technology must improve quickly enough to reduce fuel consumption by 4.3% per year for 14 years considerably faster than has occurred since 1990, but consistent with the pace of improvements observed between 1975 and 1990.

Abstract: Chemical looping technologies have the potential to reduce the natural-gas conversion cost in a carbon-constrained scenario. Given the increasing importance of natural gas to global energy supply, this work investigates the application of an iron oxide based chemical looping technology for natural gas conversion. A thermodynamic criterion for selecting iron oxide based oxygen carrier material and designing the reaction system is developed using an adapted Ellingham diagram. Equilibrium modeling for detailed thermodynamic analysis is conducted for verifying the Ellingham diagram analysis. The thermodynamic equilibrium model also establishes a system baseline performance, and experimental proof of concept bench-scale demonstration is investigated. The bench-scale testing is used to characterize the effect of parameters like solids to gas ratio and temperature of the reactor on system performance. An optimal set of operating conditions is identified for further testing on a larger scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Integrating solar energy into a conventional fossil-fuel fired power plant through solar-aided coal-fired power generation (SACPG) mechanism has been proven to be an efficient way to use solar energy for power generation purposes. However, due to the rather intermittency of solar radiation, SACPG systems always work under off-design conditions. In this paper, hourly based annual performances of a SACPG system was simulated and analyzed with various solar field sizes and thermal energy storage (TES) capacity under different (plant) load conditions in a 330 MW power plant case study. The results indicate that, TES system could stabilize the solar thermal output and improve the stability of the SACPG system at different loads. And it could also improve solar contribution in the power generation and annual peak solar-to-electricity efficiency. Through case study, the minimum levelized energy of costs and corresponding aperture area in this case are $0.0629/kW h, 1.413 x 10(5) m(2) for 100% load, $0.0654/kW h, 9.42 x 10(4) m(2) for 75% load, and $0.0730/kW h and 5.89 x 10(4) m(2) for 50% load, respectively. And the corresponding optimized TES hour with different loads is found to be 0.5 h. The values are relatively lower than the reference trough plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In order to enhance the power performance for the diesel engines working at plateau, the method to adjust fuel injecting parameters had been adopted. However, the diesel engine is considered as a complicated nonlinear multiple-inputs and multi-boundary system. Hence, it is difficult to find out the appropriate value for fuel injecting parameters for all conditions, this is the reason why we study the Genetic Algorithm method for optimization. Firstly, the numerical model of a turbocharged diesel engine with the predictable combustion model was established and then verified by experimental data. Base on the engine model, the relation between injecting parameters and performance was studied. Secondly, the optimization model is constructed, including the objective and the boundary conditions with a novel parameter introduced, measuring the surge margin of the operating points. Then, the Fitness function is proposed employing penalty functions to express constraints. Based on the impact of injecting parameters on constraint conditions, the method was put forward about how to choose the penalty parameter values, named "Fitness Equal to Zero at the Worst Point". In order to explain this method, 4500 m rated operation point was illustrated and four schemes with different plenty values were compared. After the comparison of the population distributions and the optimizing processes, the Scheme II is proofed to be accurate and efficient, which adopted the plenty value chosen method (Fitness (w) = 0). Finally, this GA model was used for the fuel supply parameters optimization of full-load operation at 4500 m altitude. The result demonstrates that the rated engine power is enhanced by 22.7% and the fuel consumption reduces by 6.4%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The energy produced by photovoltaic farms has a variable nature depending on astronomical and meteorological factors. The former are the solar elevation and the solar azimuth, which are easily predictable without any uncertainty. The amount of liquid water met by the solar radiation within the troposphere is the main meteorological factor influencing the solar power production, as a fraction of short wave solar radiation is reflected by the water particles and cannot reach the earth surface. The total cloud cover is a meteorological variable often used to indicate the presence of liquid water in the troposphere and has a limited predictability, which is also reflected on the global horizontal irradiance and, as a consequence, on solar photovoltaic power prediction. This lack of predictability makes the solar energy integration into the grid challenging. A cost-effective utilization of solar energy over a grid strongly depends on the accuracy and reliability of the power forecasts available to the Transmission System Operators (TSOs). Furthermore, several countries have in place legislation requiring solar power producers to pay penalties proportional to the errors of day-ahead energy forecasts, which makes the accuracy of such predictions a determining factor for producers to reduce their economic losses. Probabilistic predictions can provide accurate deterministic forecasts along with a quantification of their uncertainty, as well as a reliable estimate of the probability to overcome a certain production threshold. In this paper we propose the application of an analog ensemble (AnEn) method to generate probabilistic solar power forecasts (SPF).
The AnEn is based on an historical set of deterministic numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecasts and observations of the solar power. For each forecast lead time and location, the ensemble prediction of solar power is constituted by a set of past production data. These measurements are those concurrent to past deterministic NWP forecasts for the same lead time and location, chosen based on their similarity to the current forecast and, in the current application, are represented by the one-hour average produced solar power. The AnEn performance for SPF is compared to a quantile regression (QR) technique and a persistence ensemble (PeEn) over three solar farms in Italy spanning different climatic conditions. The QR is a state-of-the-science method for probabilistic predictions that, similarly to AnEn, is based on a historical data set. The PeEn is a persistence model for probabilistic predictions, where the most recent 20 power measurements available at the same lead-time are used to form an ensemble. The performance assessment has been carried out evaluating important attributes of a probabilistic system such as statistical consistency, reliability, resolution and skill.

Abstract: Efficient conversion of lignin depolymerization products to more stable chemicals has attracted increasing attention during last few years. Here, we reported a novel and efficient method for lignin depolymerization products valorization on the simple and economic catalyst NixMg1-xO. In which, the unsaturated ingredients were converted to thermal and chemical stable products, resulting in the obvious decreasing of the unsaturated degree of the products and the repolymerization of the phenolic oligomer. The results showed that more than 98% of phenol, a model chemical of lignin depolymerization products, could be converted to cyclohexanol with 100% selectivity. Further investigation demonstrated that it was also efficient for the real lignin depolymerization products, where a significant decrease on the oxygen content and the average molecular weight were shown. Moreover, the NixMg1-xO catalyst was recyclable, and no significant loss of the catalytic activity was exhibited even after 5 runs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work uses a probabilistic method to combine two unique datasets of real world electric vehicle charging profiles and residential smart meter load demand. The data was used to study the impact of the uptake of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on electricity distribution networks. Two real networks representing an urban and rural area, and a generic network representative of a heavily loaded UK distribution network were used. The findings show that distribution networks are not a homogeneous group with a variation of capabilities to accommodate EVs and there is a greater capability than previous studies have suggested. Consideration of the spatial and temporal diversity of EV charging demand has been demonstrated to reduce the estimated impacts on the distribution networks. It is suggested that distribution network operators could collaborate with new market players, such as charging infrastructure operators, to support the roll out of an extensive charging infrastructure in a way that makes the network more robust; create more opportunities for demand side management; and reduce planning uncertainties associated with the stochastic nature of EV charging demand.

Abstract: An empirical investigation was carried out in a compression ignition engine to characterize the effect of the post injection timing on the post injection power production, the exhaust temperature, and the exhaust gas composition. Due to the potential emission reduction benefits of alternative fuels, numerous fuel injection strategies were investigated, including direct injection diesel, dual fuel diesel and ethanol, dual fuel diesel and butanol, and direct injection butanol. For all of the tested fuel injection strategies, the results indicated that the engine power output, the exhaust gas temperature, and the exhaust gas composition were very sensitive to the post injection timing. For producing additional power output, a relatively early post injection timing was the most suitable and the power output gradually declined when the post injection timing was delayed. A relatively early post injection timing was also preferable for raising the exhaust gas temperature. For generating highly reactive species, such as hydrogen and reactive light hydrocarbons, the results suggested that an intermediate post injection timing was the most suitable. Furthermore, a late post injection timing was the least desirable due to a very low contribution to power output, a minimal increase in the exhaust gas temperature, and a very low amount of reactive species in the exhaust gas. In general, the alternative and dual fuel injection strategies resulted in reduced nitrogen oxide emissions, reduced smoke emissions, and reduced exhaust gas temperatures compared to the traditional diesel fuel injection. For the alternative and dual fuel tests, it was found that an early post injection was able to reduce the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions relative to the quantity without a post injection.

Abstract: Application of the best practice of setting minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) in technically disadvantaged countries (TDCs) faces many barriers. The best practice of determining MEPS has a comprehensive analytical framework including engineering-economic analysis, life-cycle cost-benefit analysis, as well stakeholders' and market impact assessments. However, TDCs usually are lack of reference product classes, market data, and other necessary inputs data. This study demonstrated how to overcome those barriers to apply the best practice to TDCs using the actual experience in setting initial MEPS for Air Conditioners (ACs) in Brunei from scratch with limited secondary data as an example. The series of application works include definition of the product classes and the baseline group; collection of market data; formulation of cost-efficiency relationship from the market data; examination of the economic, environmental, and financial impacts of various MEPS options; revealing of the consumers' willingness to pay; and analysis of the impacts and responses from the industry and consumers. The coordination with the compliance of the Montreal Protocol was also considered. The methodology should also be applicable to setting MEPF for other appliances in any TDCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The conceptual design of a 100 MWth unit for coal combustion with CO2 capture by in-situ Gasification Chemical Looping Combustion (iG-CLC) was done. Ilmenite was considered the oxygen carrier and a highly reactive sub-bituminous coal was the fuel. The main components of the iG-CLC unit were a fuel reactor, a carbon stripper and an air reactor. Mass and enthalpy balances were performed to determine the solids circulation flow rate, temperature of the reactors, steam and air requirements, and heat duty of heat exchangers. Fluid dynamics considerations and cyclones sizes were taken into account for the conceptual design and the dimensioning of these devices. In addition, optimized operating conditions obtained with a mathematical model were considered in the design procedure. Then, the performance of the iG-CLC unit was estimated with the model. Some benefits were identified when recirculated CO2 was used to fluidize the carbon stripper and fuel reactor, regarding both fuel reactor performance and energy integration of the iG-CLC system. Thus, a CO2 capture value of 95% with a carbon stripper with 98% efficiency and an oxygen demand in exit gases from the fuel reactor of 7% was predicted with a solids inventory in the fuel reactor of 750 kg/MWth. Moreover, the energy penalty related to steam generation was minimized when H2O was replaced by CO2. Results presented in this work can be used to estimate the net efficiency of the plant in future works. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of diesel-driven traction is an intrinsic part of the functioning of railway systems and it is expected to continue being so for the foreseeable future. The recent introduction of more restrictive greenhouse gas emission levels and other legislation aiming at the improvement of the environmental performance of railway systems has led to the need of exploring alternatives for cleaner diesel rolling stock. This paper focuses on assessing energy storage systems and the design of hybrid system architectures to determine their potential use in specific diesel-driven rail duty cycles. Hydrostatic accumulators, flywheels, Lithium-ion batteries and double-layer capacitors have been assessed and used to design hybrid system architectures. The potential of the different technology combinations has been analyzed using standardized duty cycles enhanced with gradient profiles related to suburban, regional and shunting operations.
The results show that double-layer capacitors and Lithium-ion batteries have the highest potential to be successfully integrated into the system architecture of diesel-driven rail vehicles. Furthermore, the results also suggest that combining these two energy storage technologies into a single hybridisation package is a highly promising design that draws on their strengthens without any significant drawbacks.

Abstract: The chemical looping reforming (CLR) process converts methane into syngas through cyclic redox reactions of an active lattice oxygen (O2-) containing redox catalyst. In CLR, methane is partially oxidized to CO and H-2 using the active lattice oxygen of a redox catalyst. In a subsequent step, the oxygen-deprived redox catalyst is regenerated by air. Such a process can eliminate the need for steam and/or oxygen in reforming, thereby improving methane conversion efficiency. A number of perovskite-structured mixed metal oxides are known to be active for CLR. However, the oxygen storage capacity of perovskites tends to be low, limiting their practical application in chemical looping. In contrast reducible metal oxides such as cobalt and iron oxides can store up to 30 wt.% lattice oxygen but are less selective for syngas generation. We explore oxygen carriers that utilize the advantages of both perovskites and first-row transition metal oxides by integrating a transition metal oxide core with a mixed ionic-electronic conductive (MIEC) perovskite support/shell. MIEC perovskites facilitate countercurrent conduction of O2- and electrons, allowing facile O2- transport though the solid. It is proposed that this conduction allows rapid oxygen transport to and from the transition metal oxide cores irrespective of the porosity of the redox catalyst. In this work, we show that MeOx@LaySr1-yFeO3 can be an excellent model catalyst system for CLR. The activity, selectivity, and coke resistance of the core-shell system can be tuned by changing the ratio of La to Sr in the perovskite shell and the type of transition metal oxide in the core. Our studies indicate that lower Sr loadings can improve activity and selectivity of the catalyst for methane partial oxidation, but make the LSF shell less resistant to decomposition during the reduction step.

Abstract: A hematite, which has been operated in CH4-fuelled Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) for more than 200 h, was used as oxygen carriers for in-situ gasification chemical looping combustion (iG-CLC) of Chinese Bituminous coal in this study. The thermal power was varied between 2.0 and 6.0 kW(th). The total operation time was more than 100 h in the hot mode. Hematite displayed high reactivity with this bituminous coal attaining up to 9633% of combustion efficiency. The carbon capture efficiency ranged from 72.84% to 89.36% as only CO2 was used as coal gasification agent gas in the fuel reactor during the first tests. The CO2 yield in the fuel reactor was up to 92.82% under the operational temperature was 1000 degrees C and the average coal feeding rate corresponding to the 2 kW(th) of thermal power. The effect of operational parameters, such as the fuel reactor temperature, thermal power and the mass flow rates of the fluidization gas agent on three factors - combustion efficiency, carbon capture efficiency and CO2 yield-were investigated. The results illustrated that higher operating temperature and bed inventory per unit of thermal power in the fuel reactor were found to positively affect all the three factors. Upon completion of the experiment, the used samples were collected and analysed using electron microscopy, Xray diffraction and surface area analysis. The results showed no appreciable sintering and agglomeration in the used sample. It was found that the reactivity of fresh and used samples did not differ significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The growth of China's road transport sector has driven huge increases in China's oil demand and CO2 emissions over the last two decades, and these trends are likely to continue in the absence of specific measures to reduce the average carbon intensity of road vehicles. This paper describes a model, provided in full online, to undertake scenario analysis on the cost and CO2 emissions impact of substituting current vehicle drivetrain types with alternatives during the period 2010-2050. A detailed decomposition of the additional costs and CO2 emissions savings of each low-carbon vehicle type into their component parts is undertaken to calculate the marginal abatement cost of each vehicle and drivetrain type in 2050. The results indicate that passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks constitute the majority of future CO2 emissions savings potential, but that, using the central cost assumptions, alternative vehicle drivetrains are significantly more cost-effective for trucks than passenger cars. The low-carbon scenario sees demand for oil products (gasoline and diesel) more than 40% below the business-as-usual scenario in 2050. The total mitigation cost in 2050 is (US2010)$64 billion per year, or 1.3% of the total annual expenditure on road transport in China in 2050, using a discount rate of 5% to annualise vehicle purchase costs, although this cost increases with higher discount rates. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that measures in addition to those assumed in the low-carbon scenario could achieve further emissions reductions, in some cases at negative costs. The availability and transparency of the model allows testing and development of a range of further scenarios and sensitivities, to aid in planning an optimal decarbonisation strategy for this highly carbon-intensive sector.

Abstract: Iron oxide has been widely used as an oxygen carrier material (OCM) for hydrogen production by chemical looping due to its favourable thermodynamic properties. In spite of this, iron oxide loses much of its activity after redox cycling mainly due to sintering and agglomeration. Perovskites, such as La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-delta (LSF731), have been suggested as potential candidate OCMs for hydrogen production due to their excellent oxygen transport properties and stability under cycling. However, hydrogen production per cycle for a similar carrier weight is lower than with iron oxide. This work proposes the use of composite OCMs made of iron oxide clusters embedded in an LSF731 matrix. The perovskite matrix facilitates oxygen transport to the iron oxide clusters while preventing agglomeration. Two preparation methods, mechanical mixing and a modified Pechini method, were used to obtain composite materials with different iron oxide weight fractions, 11 and 30 wt.%. The reactivity of these OCMs was studied in a thermogravimetric analyser. Hydrogen production and carrier stability were investigated in a microreactor over 25 redox cycles while periodically feeding carbon monoxide and water in order to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen in separate streams. Hydrogen production was stable over 25 cycles for LSF731 and the composite OCM with 30 wt.% iron oxide produced by the modified Pechini method but iron oxide particles alone underwent a decrease in the hydrogen production with cycling. The hydrogen production during the 25th cycle was eight times higher for the composite material than for iron oxide alone and four times higher than for LSF731. The hydrogen production was therefore also higher than that expected from a simple combination of the iron oxide and LSF731 alone, indicating a synergetic effect whereby the LSF731 may have a higher effective oxygen capacity when in the form of the composite material.

Abstract: A Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) unit for solid fuels has been designed, erected and operated. The design was based on a thermal power of 20 kW(th) for in-situ Gasification Chemical Looping Combustion (iG-CLC) or 50 kW(th) for Chemical Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU). Fuel and air reactors are two interconnected circulating fluidized beds reactors, with the coal being fed at the bottom of the fuel reactor to maximize the contact between the volatile matter and the oxygen carrier particles. A carbon stripper has been included between fuel and air reactors to increase the CO2 capture rates. In this unit, the char particles are separated from the oxygen carrier particles and recirculated to the fuel reactor. The solids flow exiting from the fuel reactor is split into two different streams by using a double loop seal down the fuel reactor cyclone. One goes to the carbon stripper and the other is recirculated to the fuel reactor. In this way it is possible to have an independent control of solids inventory in the fuel reactor and the global solids circulation flow rate between fuel and air reactors. First operational results at steady state have been obtained with stable operation in iG-CLC mode during combustion of a bituminous coal with ilmenite being the oxygen carrier. A CO2 capture value of 88% at 991 degrees C and a total oxygen demand value of 8.5% were obtained with a solids inventory in the fuel reactor of 470 kg/MW. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Converting abundant fossil resources of coal to alternative transportation fuels is a promising option for countries heavily dependent on petroleum imports if plants are equipped with carbon capture for sequestration and cofed with biomass (30% by weight of the total feed on a dry basis), an essentially carbon neutral fuel, without penalizing the process economics excessively. A potential exists to improve both thermal efficiency and economics of such plants by taking advantage of the synergies of coproducing electricity using advanced technologies under development. Three types of transportation fuels are considered. Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) liquids consisting predominantly of waxes could be processed in existing refineries while displacing petroleum and the refined products introduced into the market place at the present time or in the near term without requiring changes to the existing infrastructure. Ethanol could potentially serve in the not so distant future (or phased in by blending with conventional liquid fuels). Hydrogen which could play a dominant role in the more distant future being especially suitable to the fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV). Two types of coal along with biomass cofeed are evaluated; bituminous coal at $42.0/dry tonne, lignite at $12.0/dry tonne, and switchgrass at $99.0/dry tonne. The calculated cost for F-T liquids ranged from $77.8/bbl to $86.6/bbl (or $0.0177 to 0.0197/MJ LHV) depending on the feed-stock, which is comparable to the projected longer term market price of crude oil at similar to$80/bbl when supply and demand reach a new equilibrium [Lafakis. Moody's Analytics. <http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/09/investing/oil-price-bottom/index.html>(accessed on 12.01.15)] [32] (or $0.0172/MJ LHV). It should be noted, however, that F-T liquids contain no sulfur or nitrogen compounds and no inorganics. The calculated cost of fuel grade ethanol ranged from $4.84 to 4.91/gal (or $0.0566 to 0.0582/MJ LHV), while the price of gasoline in the U.S. amounted to $0.0240 to 0.0279/MJ LHV when crude oil was at similar to$80/bbl. Ethanol coproduction may not appear to be as attractive as the other options at these scales, primarily due to the much lower plant efficiency. However, from a life cycle greenhouse gas emissions standpoint, ethanol produced with biomass cofeeding and CCS, have a lower carbon footprint than gasoline or diesel, especially when derived from petroleum. The calculated cost of hydrogen ranged from $1.87 to 2.13/kg (or $0.0156 to 0.0177/MJ LHV), which is significantly lower than the DoE announced goal of $3.00/kg in 2005. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Hybridisation of diesel-driven rail vehicles is already possible and promises significant reductions in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions (nitrogen oxides and particulate matter). However, current performance can be significantly improved by introducing technologies such as energy storage systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate the energy management strategies and technical life cycle cost aspects of railway-specific hybridisation architectures. To do so, twelve promising combinations of system architectures, energy storage systems and railway duty cycles have been selected, described and analyzed.
A method based on a MATLAB/SIMULINK model has been used with three different approaches for the energy management strategy optimization (i) the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy as baseline optimization; (ii) dynamic programming to determine the global optimum and (iii) a sensitivity analysis approach for the energy storage systems. Based on these boundary conditions, a hybridisation life cycle cost analysis has been carried out. As part of this analysis three different fuel price scenarios have been considered (i) low price of 0.78 (sic)/l; (ii) medium price of 1.12 (sic)/l; (iii) high price of 1.64 (sic)/l.
The results show that different energy storage technologies achieve diverse life cycle costs, triggering a range of investment, replacement and maintenance costs, as well as significantly reduced operational costs due to lower fuel consumption. In addition, the simulation results show that fuel consumption can be reduced up to 20%, in some cases rising to approximately 25% if energy management strategies are applied. Of these, Start/Stop and downsizing of the internal combustion engine are the most promising strategies for the emission reduction. Both require auxiliaries' electrification and appropriate integration of energy storage systems. LCC results also indicate that operational conditions with high annual mileage are most beneficial when a hybrid consisting of an internal combustion engine and an energy storage system is used in a high fuel price scenario.

Abstract: Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are important for reducing fuel consumption and vehicle operating cost, and have the potential to reduce GHG and pollutant emissions. However, the range limits and long recharging times serve as obstacles to mass deployment. Well planned Level 3 DC fast charging stations are a potential solution to satisfy long distance travel demand instead of an expansive Level 2 non-home charging infrastructure. This paper identifies candidate charging routes and uses freeway exits and highway intersections as approximate candidate charging locations, and consequently solves a set covering problem to minimize the number of charging stations. Results show that 290 Level 3 charging locations are required for the State of California based on the 2000 California Travel Survey and BEVs with 60 mile range. With this optimized station network, electric light duty vehicle miles travelled (VMT) can reach 92% and BEVs can be used by 98% of drivers. If BEVs with 100 or 200 mile range are used, 126 or 31 Level 3 charging locations are required, respectively. This study also assesses the temporal utilization of charging stations. Congestion at several stations suggests extra chargers are required. A reservation system can benefit both the BEV drivers and station operators by reducing the wait times, decreasing the extra chargers needed, and more evenly utilizing all the stations. Related policies are also discussed to better deploy fast charging stations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) is conventionally carried out in circulating fluidized bed systems involving various kinds of fluidized beds and solid handling devices. Scale-up of these systems is a research and development challenge associated with various risks and uncertainties. Gas bypassing, poor gas-solid contact and poor performance of solid circulation control devices are among the major considerations in this regard.
This paper presents impacts of temperature on the fluidization properties in CLC application. Impacts of temperature on the minimum fluidization velocity and the onset of turbulent regime are studied in various temperatures up to 900 degrees C. Increase of temperature decreases the minimum fluidization velocity and increases the onset of transition to turbulent regime.
Impact of size and temperature on the performance of pneumatic valves (L-valve and loop-seal) are investigated using valves in a range of 2-24 cm in a temperature range of 25-750 degrees C. Geldart group B particles of 100-300 gm and density of 2600-4750 kg/m(3) are used in these experimental tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A typical topology of a proton electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell electric vehicle contains at least two power sources, a fuel cell system (FCS) and a lithium battery package. The FCS provides stationary power, and the battery delivers dynamic power. In this paper, we report on the multi-objective optimization problem of powertrain parameters for a pre-defined driving cycle regarding fuel economy and system durability. We introduce the dynamic model for the FCEV. We take into consideration equations not only for fuel economy but also for system durability. In addition, we define a multi-objective optimization problem, and find a quasi-optimal solution using a two-loop framework. In the inside loop, for each group of powertrain parameters, a global optimal energy management strategy based on dynamic programming (DP) is exploited. We optimize coefficients for the DP algorithm to reduce calculating time as well as to maintain accuracy. For the outside loop, we compare the results of all the groups with each other, and choose the Pareto optimal solution based on a compromise of fuel economy and system durability. Simulation results show that for a "China city bus typical cycle," a battery capacity of 150 Ah and an FCS maximal net output power of 40 kW are optimal for the fuel economy and system durability of a fuel cell city bus.

Abstract: Chemical-looping reforming (CLR) of biomass, which utilizes active lattice oxygen from oxygen carrier (OC), provides a novel route to convert biomass into synthesis gas. This research utilized Cu-based OC rather than commonly-used Fe- or Ni-based DC in the process. The possible advantage is the exothermic reactions between CuO and gasification products are beneficial to auto-thermal reforming of biomass in fuel reactor. Batch fluidized bed experiments with different carriers (silica sand, Fe-based or Cu-based OCs) were conducted at different temperatures. It was found that when using Cu-based OCs, the gas yield and carbon conversion efficiency increased sighificantly, but the gasification efficiency and low heating value decreased accordingly, which are ascribed to the high-reactivity Cu-based OCs prompt the carbon conversion and also consume more reducible gases. The presence of Cu-based OCs help reduce C(2)Hm and tar in syngas. Additionally, the tar content decreased with temperature increase, while C2Hm content first increased then decreased.

Abstract: Hybrid thermochemical processes show promise to increase plant performance with respect to fungible hydrocarbon production as a substitute to petroleum-based transportation fuels. Biomass, methane, and steam were reacted in a high temperature, indirectly heated reactor to determine the effects of biomass type (microalgae, rice hulls, cotton stalk), temperature (1600-1800 K), and reactant ratios (alpha = 0-2.0; beta = 1.0-4.8) on carbon conversion, cold gas efficiency, and syngas composition. This hybrid co-feed system was shown to achieve high H-2-content syngas with CO selectivity >0.90 and carbon conversion of both biomass and methane >0.90. Temperature was the dominant factor on the yields of CO, CO2, and CH4, while reactant ratios could be used to fine-tune the syngas composition. H-2 yield was only slightly dependent on temperature and excess steam. CO formation was highly kinetically-limited for this temperature range. Biomass type slightly affected gasifier performance, most likely due to total char and soot yield from devolatilization. Allothermal reactor design results in comparable gasifier efficiencies depending on steam input and thermal efficiency; a solarthermal reactor would negate 1.3-1.6 kgCO(2)/kgC processed and represents the recommended configuration for this type of process operation.

Abstract: Low temperature combustion (LTC) in diesel engines offers the benefits of ultra-low NOx and smoke emissions but suffers from lowered energy efficiency due to the high reactivity and low volatility of diesel fuel. Ethanol from renewable biomass provides a viable alternate to the petroleum based transportation fuels. The high resistance to auto-ignition (low reactivity) and its high volatility make ethanol a suitable fuel for low temperature combustion (LTC) in compression-ignition engines.
In this work, a Premixed Pilot Assisted Combustion (PPAC) strategy comprising of the port fuel injection of ethanol, ignited with a single diesel pilot injection near the top dead centre has been investigated on a single-cylinder high compression ratio diesel engine. The impact of the diesel pilot injection timing, ethanol to diesel quantity ratio and exhaust gas recirculation on the emissions and efficiency are studied at 10 bar IMEP. With the lessons learnt, successful ethanol-diesel PPAC has been demonstrated up to a load of 18 bar IMEP with ultra-low NOx and soot emissions across the full load range. The main challenge of PPAC is the reduced combustion efficiency especially at low loads; therefore, the authors have presented a combustion control strategy to allow high efficiency, clean combustion across the load range. This work entails to provide a detailed framework for the ethanol-fueled PPAC to be successfully implemented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objective: The aim of the present article is to conduct an integrated assessment in order to explore whether CCS could be a viable technological option for significantly reducing future CO2 emissions in China. Methods: In this paper, an integrated approach covering five assessment dimensions is chosen. Each dimension is investigated using specific methods (graphical abstract). Results: The most crucial precondition that must be met is a reliable storage capacity assessment based on site-specific geological data. Our projection of different trends of coal-based power plant capacities up to 2050 ranges between 34 and 221 Gt of CO2 that may be captured from coal-fired power plants to be built by 2050. If very optimistic assumptions about the country's CO2 storage potential are applied, 192 Gt of CO2 could theoretically be stored as a result of matching these sources with suitable sinks. If a cautious approach is taken, this figure falls to 29 Gt of CO2. In practice, this potential will decrease further with the impact of technical, legal, economic and social acceptance factors. Further constraints may be the delayed commercial availability of CCS in China; a significant barrier to achieving the economic viability of CCS due to a currently non-existing nation-wide CO2 pricing scheme that generates a sufficiently strong price signal; an expected life-cycle reduction rate of the power plant's greenhouse gas emissions of 59-60%; and an increase in most other negative environmental and social impacts. Conclusion and practice implications: Most experts expect a striking dominance of coal-fired power generation in the country's electricity sector, even if the recent trend towards a flattened deployment of coal capacity and reduced annual growth rates of coal-fired generation proves to be true in the future. In order to reduce fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions to a level that would be consistent with the long-term climate protection target of the international community to which China is increasingly committing itself, this option may require the introduction of CCS. However, a precondition for opting for CCS would be finding robust solutions to the constraints highlighted in this article. Furthermore, a comparison with other low-carbon technology options may be useful in drawing completely valid conclusions on the economic, ecological and social viability of CCS in a low-carbon policy environment. The assessment dimensions should be integrated into macro-economic optimisation models by combining qualitative with quantitative modelling, and the flexible operation of CCS power plants should be analysed in view of a possible role of CCS for balancing fluctuating renewable energies.

Abstract: Electric buses (EBs) are undergoing rapid development because of their environmental friendliness. Different from private electric vehicles, EBs are scheduled by a public transport company and required to be charged as soon as possible during operation hours. Consequently, the implementation of fast charging stations (FCSs) is essential to support the operation of EBs. Usually, the size of an FCS is constrained by the residual capacity of the connected distribution network and the investment budget. An energy storage system (ESS) is considered as a potential supplement not only to reduce the network integration cost for FCSs but also to reduce the charging cost of EBs through electricity price arbitrage. To quantify the value of ESS in an electric bus FCS, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for optimal sizing and control of FCS and ESS is built. A simplification method is proposed to convert the MINLP problem to a linear one without any loss in optimality, which accelerates the solving process. Simulations are performed based on historical data of a practical FCS. Numerical results indicate that ESS can significantly help reduce the overall investment and charging cost of the FCS. Meanwhile, the parameters of investment cost, lifespan and time-of-use electricity price have significant influences on the overall value of ESS for an FCS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Electricity transmission and distribution (T&D) plays a vital role in society by connecting electricity producers and consumers. We present a life cycle assessment case study of electricity delivery to consumers in Nord-Trondelag county in Norway. We use a coherent framework for assessing electricity transfer via all the main segments of the Norwegian T&D system (local distribution, regional transmission and main national transmission grids). The assessment covers impacts associated with production, transport, and installation of components, power grid losses, and losses of sulphur hexafluoride. The results indicate that for electricity that is transmitted through the three main T&D grid segments, and assuming a Norwegian electricity mix when modelling the effects of power losses, the total carbon footprint of electricity T&D is 7.8 kg CO2-eq/MW h. Local distribution holds the largest share of this total (-60%), while regional transmission and national transmission both make smaller but significant contributions (-20% each). When classifying impacts as being attributable to either power grid losses or to other processes (e.g., materials and component manufacturing), both power losses and other processes contribute significantly to total impact potentials. Power losses are responsible for 30-43% of the combined electricity T&D impact potentials for climate change, particulate matter, smog-creation and acidification, 21-28% for toxicity and eutrophication, and 14% for metal depletion. For all categories except metal depletion, the relative importance of power losses increases appreciably if Nordic or particularly European electricity is assumed, however. Finally, we compare the environmental impacts of electricity T&D with that of electricity generation. The results of the comparison show that electricity T&D causes fewer impacts than electricity generation, but T&D impacts are not negligible; this is true regardless of what electricity mix is assumed when modelling power losses.

Abstract: This study assesses the energy reduction associated with Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) compared to conventional vehicles (CVs) for real-world driving conditions in a specific geographic region (Beijing, China). To understand the driving patterns in Beijing, a passenger car travel survey has been conducted since 2012, including over 1000 vehicles. The initial results from driving range distribution have been calculated. In this study, first, a Utility Factor and the typical driving cycles based on 2000 days' worth of Global Position System (GPS) data are analyzed. Next,the real-world energy consumption of CVs, HEVs, PHEVs and BEVs are simulated. Finally, the fuel consumption of vehicles under different driving patterns is compared to provide data on the optimal electric vehicles and reliable test cycles for Beijing. We find that electric vehicles in Beijing, including HEVs, PHEVs and BEVs, yield more fuel reduction benefits than in the U.S. because of the severe driving conditions and short driving ranges. For PHEVs in Beijing, smaller batteries, corresponding to a 30-50 km Charging Depleting (CD) range, are preferred to meet the demands of most drivers and add less extra cost to the vehicle. We also confirm that the Chinese current suggested label values based on NEDC cycle underestimate the fuel consumption of vehicles and fuel reduction benefits of electric vehicles in Beijing. This study addresses the importance of developing and using the real-world driving cycles in designing and evaluating electric vehicles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Fuel cell cars powered by hydrogen enable CO2-emission free mobility. A main requirement for the success of this technology is the availability of an area-wide and affordable hydrogen supply. A significant cost factor in the hydrogen supply chain is the multi-stage gas compression to provide the mandatory filling pressure for the pressurized tanks. One way to address this issue is to perform the hydrogen production process at elevated pressure. In this paper the feasibility of compressed hydrogen production without additional gas compression based on the steam iron process is discussed. Experiments were performed in a lab-scale test rig using fixed bed reactor technology. The focus was to evaluate the influence of pressurized hydrogen production on the cycle stability, on the conversion efficiency and on the structural integrity of a Fe2O3-Al2O3 (90 + 10 wt%) oxygen carrier. The oxidations were performed at different pressure levels of 7-22 bar (g) at a temperature of 750 degrees C with steam. The steady steam supply was ensured by a HPLC pump which delivered 0.03 g min(-1) (at room temperature) of water, which was evaporated in the heated inlet section. The water was introduced for approximately 100 min until the oxygen carrier was fully oxidized. The iron oxide was reduced in the subsequent reaction steps at 750 degrees C and ambient pressure with 25 Nml min(-1) H-2 as reducing agent. The reduction reactions were analyzed to evaluate possible influences of its prior oxidations. The results revealed no signs of negative repercussions. The oxygen carrier conversion of initially 84% remained at a steady behavior between the 15 performed cycles. Only small losses of 0.8% per cycle caused by thermal sintering of the contact mass were observed, which was independent from the different pressure levels of the prior oxidations. The evaluation of the pressurized oxidations did not reveal any performance decrease as well. The rise of pressure in each oxidation showed a consistent characteristic throughout the complete test series. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the oxygen carrier sample after the experiment revealed some structural changes, which are related to thermal sintering but the structural integrity of the sample stayed intact. The oxidations yielded an average of 18 mmol g(Fe)(-1) hydrogen with a maximum hydrogen pressure of 22 bar (g). The conducted experiments showed that the steam iron process is very suitable for the production of compressed hydrogen and that the process is not negatively influenced by the elevated system pressure.

Abstract: Future vehicles for clean transport will require new powertrain technologies to further reduce CO2 emissions. Mobile organic Rankine cycle systems target the recovery of waste heat in internal combustion engines, with the exhaust system identified as a prime source. This article presents a design methodology and working fluid selection for radial turbo expanders in a heavy-duty off-road diesel engine application. Siloxanes and Toluene are explored as the candidate working fluids, with the latter identified as the preferred option, before describing three radial turbine designs in detail. A small 15.5 kW turbine design leads to impractical blade geometry, but a medium 34.1 kW turbine, designed for minimum power, is predicted to achieve an isentropic efficiency of 51.5% at a rotational speed of 91.7 k min(-1). A similar 45.6 kW turbine designed for maximum efficiency yields 56.1% at 71.5 k min(-1). This emphasizes the main design trade-off - efficiency decreases and rotational speed increases as the power requirement falls but shows reasonable radial turbine efficiencies and thus practical turbo expanders for mobile organic Rankine cycle applications are realizable, even considering the compromised flow geometry and high speeds imposed at such small scales.

Abstract: Thermal chemical processing of biomass is expected to provide renewable and clean energy and fuels in the future. Due to the nature of endothermic reactions, microwave and conventional heating have been applied to this technology. However, more studies need to be carried out to clarify the difference between these two heating technologies. In this work, we investigated two bio-char samples produced from conventional pyrolysis of wood biomass (yield of bio-char: 38.48 and 59.70 wt.%, respectively) and one bio-char produced from microwave pyrolysis with a yield of 45.16 wt.% from the same biomass sample at different process conditions. Various methodologies have been used to characterise the bio-chars. CO2 gasification of bio-char has also been studied using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) and a fixed-bed reaction system. The results show that volatile and carbon contents of the bio-char derived from microwave pyrolysis were between the two conventional bio-chars. However, the microwave bio-char is more reactive for CO2 gasification, as more CO was released during TGA experiments, and the CO release peak was narrower compared with the CO2 gasification of the conventional bio-chars. It is suggested that the conventional bio-char is less reactive due to the presence of more secondary chars which are produced from secondary reactions of volatiles during the conventional biomass pyrolysis. While the microwave pyrolysis generates more uniform bio-chars with less secondary char, and therefore, has advantages of producing bin-char for downstream char gasification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, torrefied sawdust produced from pine sawdust in a fixed bed reactor was mixed with different binders in a ratio of 5-30 wt.%, and then compressed into pellets in a single die press to explore the feasibility of making torrefied pellets from torrefied powders. The quality of torrefied pellets was examined based on pellet density, higher heating value, hardness, saturated moisture uptake, and energy density. Results showed that torrefied sawdust particles prepared under typical torrefaction conditions (280-300 degrees C for 10-30 min) could be made into strong pellets by compression at a die temperature higher than 220 degrees C or by introducing biomass binders such as untreated sawdust, starch or lignin at a lower die temperature. The pellets density and bulk density made at a low die temperature with binders were slightly lower than those made at a die temperature of 220 degrees C or higher without the binder, and the energy density of torrefied pellets was similar to the control pellets made from untreated sawdust. Since the raw sawdust is abundantly available and much cheaper than lignin and starch, it is recommended as a low-cost and effective binder for densifying torrefied sawdust into torrefied pellets.

Abstract: Vehicle manufacturers are required to reduce their European sales-weighted emissions to 95 g CO2/km by 2020, with the aim of reducing on-road fleet fuel consumption. Nevertheless, current fuel consumption models are not suited for the European market and are unable to account for uncertainties when used to forecast passenger vehicle energy-use. Therefore, a new methodology is detailed herein to quantify new car fleet fuel consumption based on vehicle design metrics. The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is shown to underestimate on-road fuel consumption in Spark (SI) and Compression Ignition (Cl) vehicles by an average of 16% and 13%, respectively. A Bayesian fuel consumption model attributes these discrepancies to differences in rolling, frictional and aerodynamic resistances. Using projected inputs for engine size, vehicle mass, and compression ratio, the likely average 2020 on-road fuel consumption was estimated to be 7.6 L/100 km for SI and 6.4 L/100 km for CI vehicles. These compared to NEDC based estimates of 5.34 L/100 km (SI) and 4.28 L/100 km (Cl), both of which exceeded mandatory 2020 fuel equivalent emissions standards by 30.2% and 18.9%, respectively. The results highlight the need for more stringent technological developments for manufacturers to ensure adherence to targets, and the requirements for more accurate measurement techniques that account for discrepancies between standardised and on-road fuel consumption.

Abstract: Sustainability is an urban development priority. Thus, energy and carbon dioxide emission reduction is becoming more significant in the sustainability of urban transportation systems. However, urban transportation systems are complex and involve social, economic, and environmental aspects. We present solutions for a sustainable urban transportation system by establishing a simplified system dynamics model with a timeframe of 30 years (from 1995 to 2025) to simulate the effects of urban transportation management policies and to explore their potential in reducing vehicular fuel consumption and mitigating CO2 emissions. Kaohsiung City was selected as a case study because it is the second largest metropolis in Taiwan and is an important industrial center. Three policies are examined in the study including fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Simulation results indicate that both the fuel tax and motorcycle parking management policies are suggested as potentially the most effective methods for restraining the growth of the number of private vehicles, the amount of fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. We also conducted a synthetic policy consisting of all policies which outperforms the three individual policies. The conclusions of this study can assist urban transport planners in designing appropriate urban transport management strategies and can assist transport operation agencies in creating operational strategies to reduce their energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The proposed approach should be generalized in other cities to develop an appropriate model to understand the various effects of policies on energy and CO2 emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: With increasing air traffic, rising fuel costs and tighter environmental targets, efficient airport ground operations are one of the key aspects towards sustainable air transportation. This complex system includes elements such as ground movement, runway scheduling and ground services. Previously, these problems were treated in isolation since information, such as landing time, pushback time and aircraft ground position, are held by different stakeholders with sometimes conflicting interests and, normally, are not shared. However, as these problems are interconnected, solutions as a result of isolated optimisation may achieve the objective of one problem but fail in the objective of the other one, missing the global optimum eventually. Potentially more energy and economic costs are thus required. In order to apply a more systematic and holistic view, this paper introduces a multi-objective integrated optimisation problem incorporating the newly proposed Active Routing concept. Built with systematic perspectives, this new model combines several elements: scheduling and routing of aircraft, 4-Dimensional Trajectory (4DT) optimisation, runway scheduling and airport bus scheduling. A holistic economic optimisation framework is also included to support the decision maker to select the economically optimal solution from a Pareto front of technically optimal solutions. To solve this problem, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is adopted and tested on real data from an international hub airport. Preliminary results show that the proposed approach is able to provide a systematic framework so that airport efficiency, environmental assessment and economic analysis could all be explicitly optimised.

Abstract: Thermal and acid hydrolysates of oil palm empty fruit bunch and other lignocellulosic substrates contain glucose, xylose, and acetic acid as the main components. In using such hydrolysates for photofermentive production of biohydrogen, the gas yield is highly dependent on the composition of the mixed carbon substrate. Batch photofermentation experiments were used to investigate the effect of the composition of the mixed carbon (glucose G, xylose X, and acetic acid A) on growth and hydrogen production by the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides S10. Anaerobic fermentations were carried out at 35 degrees C under an incident light level of 14.6 W/m(2). The mixed carbon composition strongly influenced hydrogen and biomass production. Depending on the composition of the mixed substrate; the cumulative hydrogen volume ranged from 0.99 to 2.33 L H-2/L medium; the conversion efficiency ranged from 21% to 45%; and the biomass yield on substrate ranged from 0.28 to 0.47 g DCW/g (G + X + A). Based on the conversion efficiency, the optimal substrate for hydrogen production was a mixture of 5 mM glucose, 18 mM xylose and 7 mM acetic acid. This combination gave a cumulative hydrogen volume of 2.33 L H-2/L medium. The hydrogen yield was 3.56 mol H-2/mol mixed substrate and the substrate specific hydrogen production rate was 7.26 mL H-2/g mixed substrate h. The conversion efficiency and the lag period of hydrogen production were 45% and 13 h, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Chemical looping gasification (CLG) is viewed as a promising gasification technology because gas phase oxygen of gasifying medium can be replaced by lattice oxygen of oxygen carrier. In the present work, the reactivity of biomass char with Fe2O3 oxygen carrier under different atmospheres was detailed investigated through the thermodynamic and thermo-gravimetric analysis. The Fe2O3 was almost completely reduced into metallic iron when the reaction temperature exceeded 1000 degrees C, but the carbon conversion of char only attained to 40.80% due to the lack of oxygen source under inert atmosphere. However, the carbon conversion of char apparently increased and the oxygen conversion of oxygen carrier dramatically decreased under oxidizing atmosphere (CO2, or H2O). It is attributed to the fact that oxidizing agents can supply oxygen sources to promote char conversion as well as to alleviate the reduction of oxygen carrier. These thermodynamic predictions were confirmed by TGA tests, where the char was fully converted into gas under CO2, or H2O atmosphere because of enough oxygen sources but a low carbon conversion was obtained under inert atmosphere. TGA results further indicated that the reactivity of char with oxygen carrier under steam atmosphere is much higher than that under CO2 atmosphere and the Fe2O3 phase is mainly reduced into Fe3O4 phase in all the tests. Additionally, several other different carriers (Al2O3, NiO-modified iron ore and NiO) were employed to compare the reactivity of iron ore as well. The order of reactivity is speculated as follows: Pure oxygen approximate to NiO > H2O > Iron ore > CO2 > Al2O3. The reduced oxygen carrier can recover entire lattice oxygen [O] to its initial state under air atmosphere. Therefore, it suggests that the Fe2O3 material used as an oxygen carrier can be recycled in the process of char CLG. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: More than 2000 h of solid-fuel CLC operation in a number of smaller pilot units clearly indicate that the concept works. A scale-up of the technology to 1000 MWth is investigated in terms of mass and heat balances, flows, solids inventories, boiler dimensions and the major differences between a full-scale Circulating Fluidized-Bed (CFB) boiler and a Chemical-Looping Combustion CFB (CLC-CFB). Furthermore, the additional cost of CLC-CFB relative to CFB technology is analysed and found to be 20 (sic)/tonne CO2. The largest cost is made up of compression of CO2, which is common to all capture technologies. Although the need for oxygen to manage incomplete conversion is estimated to be only a tenth of that of oxy-fuel combustion, oxygen production is nonetheless the second largest cost. Other significant costs include oxygen-carrier material, increased boiler cost and steam for fluidization of the fuel reactor. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Combined oxides of iron, manganese and silicon have been used as oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion. Three materials with varying composition of iron, manganese and silicon have been evaluated in oxygen release experiments and during continuous operation with syngas and natural gas as fuels. The concentration of oxygen released increased as a function of temperature and the highest concentrations of oxygen were measured with the material with the highest fraction of manganese. It was also this material which gave the best conversion of both syngas and natural gas; essentially full conversion of syngas and above 95% conversion of natural gas above 900 degrees C. The other two materials showed similar performance, albeit with higher syngas conversion for the material with the lowest manganese fraction and the lowest conversion of natural gas for the same material. The materials lasted for 1014 h of operation with fuel addition before circulation disruption occurred, which was likely caused by particle attrition in all three cases. A phase diagram of the iron-manganese-silicon-oxide system was constructed and the possible relevant phase transitions were identified. This analysis showed that more phase transitions could be expected for the materials with higher manganese content which could explain the superior performance during fuel operation of the material with the highest manganese content. It should however be noted that this material was operated with the highest fuel reactor inventory per thermal power which could also be a contributing factor to the better performance of this material. The study shows that it is possible to achieve very high fuel conversion with combined oxides of iron, manganese and silicon as oxygen carrier. The mechanical stability of the particles was rather poor though and would need to be improved. On the other hand the findings relating to material stability is not necessary valid for natural materials containing a number of additional elements. The results are also of interest as an indication of how natural materials with similar composition, i.e. manganese ores, would perform as oxygen carriers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Biomass, such as agricultural straw, can be converted into briquette fuel using technology to expand the possible applications of biomass and improve biomass utilization efficiency. The major machines required in a briquette fuel system, such as those used for drying, chopping, briquetting, and cooling, have become more efficient. However, a biomass briquetting fuel system requires special machines to reach a high character index, and all units in the system must match and be combined to produce an optimum system that satisfies multiple objectives, such as economy, environmental protection, stability, and large-scale operation. In this paper, a mathematical model for a synthesized evaluation was established according to theories of grey relational analysis (GRA) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This model was used to select a biomass briquette fuel (BBF) system scheme considering hierarchies of economy, cleanliness and environmental protection, production capacity, product quality, and production stability, along with 20 other indices, including capital investment, dust content, drying capability, briquette rate, and the machine repair cycle. The most significant factors influencing each hierarchy were analyzed using a sensitivity analysis. Based on the GRA and AHP theories, an optimal scheme was selected for a fully operational 2 x 10(4) t/a cornstalk briquette fuel plant in China. The optimum scheme included six sets of briquetting machines with a capacity of 2 t/h + three sets of chopping machines with a capacity of 5 t/h + six sets of drying machines with a capability of 2 t/h + 1 set of cooling machines with a capacity of 12 t/h. The evaluated indices and weight coefficients were chosen objectively, and the comprehensive and technical performances of the selected BBF system scheme improved. These results provide a reference for the scheme selection and operation of large-scale BBF systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Current temperature levels in European district heating networks are still too high with respect to future conditions as customer heat demands decrease and new possible heat source options emerge. A considerable reduction of temperature levels can be accomplished by eliminating current faults in substations and customer heating systems. These faults do not receive proper attention today, because neither substations nor customer heating systems are centrally supervised. The focus of this paper has been to identify these faults by annual series of hourly meter readings obtained from automatic meter reading systems at 135 substations in two Swedish district heating systems. Based on threshold methods, various faults were identified in 74% of the substations. The identified faults were divided into three different fault groups: Unsuitable heat load pattern, low average annual temperature difference, and poor substation control. The most important conclusion from this early study of big data volumes is that automatic meter reading systems can provide proactive fault detection by continuous commissioning of district heating substations in the future. A complete reduction of current faults corresponds to approximately half the required reduction of the current temperature levels in the effort toward future low-temperature district heating networks.

Abstract: In this paper, the combustion process and emissions of a heavy-duty engine fueled with directly injected natural gas and pilot diesel were experimentally explored. The experiments were carried out under two operating points (A:1275 rpm BMEP 1.05 MPa, B:1550 rpm BMEP 1.05 MPa) with diesel rail pressure (DRP) varied from 18 MPa to 30 MPa and start of natural gas injection (NSOI) in the range of 1 degrees BTDC to 19 degrees BTDC. Based on the experimental results, as the injection timing advances, the maximum in-cylinder pressure and NOx emissions increase, the flame development duration and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decrease, the maximum heat release rate shows a trend of first decrease and then increase while the changing trend for carbon monoxide (CO) emissions is first increase and then decrease; as the injection pressure raises, the combustion process takes place earlier, causing negative effects on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions; with higher engine speed, however, the combustion events are delayed, leading to lower peak value of heat release rate, improved CO and NOx emissions, impaired total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions and higher BSFC.

Abstract: Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a promising carbon capture technology where cyclic reduction and oxidation of a metallic oxide, which acts as a solid oxygen carrier, takes place. With this system, direct contact between air and fuel can be avoided, and so, a concentrated CO2 stream is generated after condensation of the water in the exit gas stream. An interesting reactor system for CLC is a packed bed reactor as it can have a higher efficiency compared to a fluidized bed concept, but it requires other types of oxygen carrier particles. The particles must be larger to avoid a large pressure drop in the reactor and they must be mechanically strong to withstand the severe reactor conditions. Therefore, oxygen carriers in the shape of granules and based on the mineral ilmenite were subjected to thermal cycling and creep tests. The mechanical strength of the granules before and after testing was investigated by crush tests. In addition, the microstructure of these oxygen particles was studied to understand the relationship between the physical properties and the mechanical performance.
It was found that the granules are a promising shape for a packed bed reactor as no severe degradation in strength was noticed upon thermal cycling and creep testing. Especially, the addition of Mn2O3 to the ilmenite, which leads to the formation of an iron-manganese oxide, seems to results in stronger granules than the other ilmenite-based granules.

Abstract: This study presents a joint experimental and numerical investigation of a spray used in selective catalytic NOx reduction (SCR) after-treatment systems for Diesel engine exhaust gases. The focus lies on the impingement conditions and distribution and mixing mechanisms of the spray in cross-flowing exhaust gases. These aspects are vital to system performance but still not well described.
A pressure-driven SCR injector is characterized in an optically accessible flow test rig at different temperatures and mass flow rates representative of Diesel engine exhaust gas conditions by means of Mie scattering and Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). The effects of cross-flow velocity and temperature on spray structure, droplet size and velocity distributions are assessed resulting in a comprehensive characterization of the spray. Results show that the dense spray core, with droplets up to 200 pm, only moderately reduces in density as smaller droplets are entrained at high exhaust flows. Wall impingement conditions however vary substantially as impingement angles are shallower at higher cross-flow velocities.
A detailed assessment of the numerical model is presented and validation is carried out at different measurement locations of interest. The predicted droplet size distributions and velocities follow the observed trends and impingement angles as well as spray film areas on the channel floor are also in agreement with the experimental data. The validated model is subsequently used to numerically study the mixing dynamics.
The findings suggest that at low cross-flow conditions two counter-rotating kidney vortices are formed which entrain reflected droplets of the spray impinging on the channel floor, which leads to improved mixing. Vapor concentrations increase close to the side walls and reflected droplets lead to film-formation on the side walls. At higher cross-flow velocities, vortex formation is not evident and spray-wall interaction is less pronounced - impairing mixing and leading to a reduction in concentration uniformity at down-stream locations. Film formation and high vapor concentrations are restricted to the bottom channel centerline. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper the influence of the desulfurization method on the process efficiency of an integrated gasification chemical-looping combustion (IGCLC) systems is investigated for both packed beds and circulating fluidized bed CLC systems. Both reactor types have been integrated in an IGCLC power plant, in which three desulfurization methods have been compared: conventional cold gas desulfurization with Selexol (CGD), hot gas desulfurization with ZnO (HGD) and flue gas desulfurization after the CLC reactors (post-CLC). For CLC with packed bed reactors, the efficiency gain of the alternative desulfurization methods is about 0.5-0.7% points. This is relatively small, because of the relatively large amount of steam that has to be mixed with the fuel to avoid carbon deposition on the oxygen carrier. The HGD and post-CLC configurations do not contain a saturator and therefore more steam has to be mixed with a negative influence on the process efficiency. Carbon deposition is not an issue for circulating fluidized bed systems and therefore a somewhat higher efficiency gain of 0.8-1.0% point can be reached for this reactor system, assuming that complete fuel conversion can be reached and no sulfur species are formed on the solid, which is however thermodynamically possible for iron and manganese based oxygen carriers. From this study, it can be concluded that the adaptation of the desulfurization method results in higher process efficiencies, especially for the circulating fluidized bed system, while the number of operating units is reduced.

Abstract: Radiation is the principal mode of heat transfer in a combustor. This paper presents a refined weighted sum of gray gases model for computational fluid dynamics modelling of conventional air-fuel combustion, which has greater accuracy and completeness than the existing gaseous radiative property models. This paper also presents new conversion-dependent models for particle emissivity and scattering factor, instead of various constant values in literature. The impacts of the refined or new models are demonstrated via computational fluid dynamics simulation of a pulverized coal-fired utility boiler. Although the refined gaseous radiative property model shows great advantages in gaseous fuel combustion modelling, its impacts are largely compromised in pulverized solid fuel combustion, in which particle-radiation interaction plays the dominant role in radiation heat transfer due to high particle loading. Use of conversion-dependent particle emissivity and scattering factor will not only change the particle heating and reaction history, but also alter the radiation intensity and thus temperature profiles in the furnace. For radiation modelling in pulverized fuel combustion, the priority needs to be placed on particle radiation and a proper description of particle emissivity and scattering factor is required. The refined gaseous radiative property model is still recommended for use in generic combustion modelling because, of its inherent potential in improving the results, even though its advantages may be compromised by particle radiation in some cases. The gas and particle radiation modelling method and the conclusions presented in this paper are also applied to oxy-fuel combustion of pulverized fuels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Electrification of transportation is needed soon and at significant scale to meet climate goals, but electric vehicle adoption has been slow and there has been little systematic analysis to show that today's electric vehicles meet the needs of drivers. We apply detailed physics-based models of electric vehicles with data on how drivers use their cars on a daily basis. We show that the energy storage limits of today's electric vehicles are outweighed by their high efficiency and the fact that driving in the United States seldom exceeds 100 km of daily travel. When accounting for these factors, we show that the normal daily travel of 85-89% of drivers in the United States can be satisfied with electric vehicles charging with standard 120 V wall outlets at home only. Further, we show that 77-79% of drivers on their normal daily driving will have over 60 km of buffer range for unexpected trips. We quantify the sensitivities to terrain, high ancillary power draw, and battery degradation and show that an extreme case with all trips on a 3% uphill grade still shows the daily travel of 70% of drivers being satisfied with electric vehicles. These findings show that today's electric vehicles can satisfy the daily driving needs of a significant majority of drivers using only 120 V wall outlets that are already the standard across the United States.

Abstract: Wind speed forecasting technology is important in the field of wind power. However, the wind speed signals are always nonlinear and non-stationary so that it is difficult to predict them accurately. Aims at this challenge, a new hybrid approach has been proposed for the wind speed high-accuracy predictions based on the Secondary Decomposition Algorithm (SDA) and the Elman neural networks. The proposed SDA combines the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and the Fast Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (FEEMD), which includes twice decomposing processes as: (a) the WPD decomposes the original wind speed into the appropriate components and the detailed components; and (b) the FEEMD further decomposes the WPD generating detailed components into a number of wind speed Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). The experimental results in five real forecasting cases show that: (a) the proposed hybrid WPD-FEEMD-Elman model has satisfactory performance in the multi-step wind speed predictions; and (b) the hybrid WPD-FEEMD-Elman model has improved the forecasting performance of the hybrid WPD-Elman model and the standard Elman neural networks considerably.

Abstract: Operated under a cyclic redox mode with an oxygen carrier, the chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) process offers the potential to effectively combust solid fuels while capturing CO2. Development of oxygen carriers capable of reversibly exchanging their active lattice oxygen (O2-) with gaseous oxygen (O-2) under varying external oxygen partial pressure (P-O2) is of key importance to CLOU process performance. This article investigates the effect of A-site dopants on CaMnO3 based oxygen carriers for CLOU. Both Sr and Ba are explored as potential dopants at various concentrations. Phase segregations are observed with the addition of Ba dopant even at relatively low concentrations (5% A-site doping). In contrast, stable solid solutions are formed with Sr dopant at a wide range of doping level. While CaMnO3 perovskite suffers from irreversible change into Ruddlesden-Popper (Ca2MnO4) and spinel (CaMn2O4) phases under cyclic redox conditions, Sr doping is found to effectively stabilize the perovskite structure. In-situ XRD studies indicate that the Sr doped CaMnO3 maintains a stable orthorhombic perovskite structure under an inert environment (tested up to 1200 degrees C). The same oxygen carrier sample exhibited high recyclability over 100 redox cycles at 850 degrees C. Besides being highly recyclable, Sr doped CaMnO3 is found to be capable of releasing its lattice oxygen at a temperature significantly lower than that for CaMnO3, rendering it a potentially effective oxygen carrier for solid fuel combustion and carbon dioxide capture.

Abstract: The application of chemical looping combustion (CLC) for capturing CO2 from coal-fired power plants has the potential of very low efficiency penalty and low CO2 avoidance costs compared with first generation CO2 capture technologies. One important step towards commercial application is the demonstration of the technology in autothermal operation in the scale of 1 MWth fuel power. This study presents results of a test campaign in a 1 MWth CLC plant with hard coal as fuel and ilmenite as oxygen carrier. The results of a six hours period with two hours of constant coal feeding of 0.5 MWth are studied in detail. The fuel reactor was fluidized with steam and CO2, and the start-up propane burner was still in operation at minimum load. The overall air ratio in the fuel reactor was around 0.1. This indicates that the solids circulation was slightly too low to keep the fuel reactor temperature at 900 degrees C. The measured gas concentrations at the fuel reactor exit show that it was possible to gasify coal and to convert the main part of the gasification products by the ilmenite. The oxygen demand was around 20%, which is in line with the experience from the Chalmers 100 kW(th) test rig. The air reactor had to be heated by additional combustion of propane, most probably because the inventory of the air reactor was very low leading to low conversion rates of ilmenite. Hence, autothermal operation was not reached. Improved results can be expected by an increase of the solids inventory in the reactors and by an increase of solids circulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Energy conservation is a very important task for the automotive industry. The use of hybrid electric vehicles can improve energy efficiency, thus reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In this research, the performance characteristics of a novel coaxial power-split hybrid powertrairi for a transit bus are presented. The power sources are a combination of a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine and supercapacitors. A mathematical model for the coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain is established. Subsequently, an analysis program is developed based on Matlab and Advisor. The parameters are specified using experimental data. Afterwards, a rule-based control strategy is designed and optimized from the viewpoint of energy efficiency. Later, the system performance is evaluated using the Chinese Transit Bus City Driving Cycle and compared to a conventional powertrain. The results indicate that the proposed coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain can fulfill the requirements of the transit bus and enhance the energy efficiency dramatically. Moreover, the average energy efficiency of the supercapacitors was found to be above 97% over the entire driving cycle. Using supercapacitors as energy storage devices for the coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain can effectively recover the kinetic energy during regenerative braking and is a good solution for transit buses that require frequent acceleration and deceleration.

Abstract: Nowadays the increasing demand for sustainable mobility has fostered the introduction of innovative propulsion systems also in the public transport sector in order to achieve a significant reduction of pollutant emissions in highly congested urban areas. This paper describes both the design and the optimization of an environmentally friendly hybrid bus (hereafter referred to as "HYBUS") for urban public transportation.
After a preliminary description of the main features of the hybrid architecture, this paper assessed, through numerical simulations, the fuel economy potential of the hybridization in real world driving conditions. The promising results of this first part of the study led to the development of a first prototype. The first prototype of the bus was built by integrating an innovative hybrid propulsion system featuring a plug-in series architecture into the chassis of an old IVECO 490 TURBOCITY. The bus is 12 m long and capable to host up to 116 passengers in the original layout. The project relied on a modular approach where the powertrain could be easily customized for size and power, depending on the specific application.
The prototype was then extensively tested in the city of Genoa, Italy, an urban context extremely challenging for a hybrid powertrain due to its frequent uphill routes and significant road grades. The outcomes of the test campaign confirmed the simulations forecasts, and fostered additional analysis aimed to optimize the energy management strategy of the hybrid powertrain.
Numerical simulations were then used in order to identify more refined energy management strategies capable of further enhancing the fuel economy potential of the hybrid architecture. Consequently, a novel energy management was developed, and virtually tested, to manage the HYBUS in a more effective way. The results demonstrated the interesting potential of such hybrid architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Methanol exhibits better capability of lowering engine emissions and fuel cost, but a potential rise in pipe-out NOx and carbonyl emissions has increased health-related risks and Stalled its application. This paper examined regulated, unregulated and particulate emissions from a 1.8 L GDI-powered passenger car running the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Conventional gasoline, together with three gasohol samples with 15%, 25% and 40% methanol substitution (M15, M25 and M40), was used. To evaluate health risk linked with pipe-out formaldehyde and benzene, a human exposure model was established. The results showed that compared with gasoline, burning gasohol significantly reduced pipe-out CO and HC emissions. Evident decrease in NOx emission was noticed with M15 and M25 fueling, but in the case of M40, NOx emissions were similar with gasoline. Carbonyls, about 50% of which were found formaldehyde, surged sharply with increased methanol percentage in the blend, while VOCs showed an opposite propensity. Health risk assessment showed that, even under a severe exposure condition, the levels of exhaust-borne formaldehyde and benzene were not sufficient to cause acute or chronic symptoms. Cancer-related risks induced by gasoline and gasohol engine exhaust were found in the same magnitude. Burning gasohol enabled an over 30% PM removal but resulted in an increase in particulate number due to an increased number of nuclei-mode particles. At last, burning gasohol produced about 0.8-4.1% less pipe-out CO2 emission than gasoline, while saving fuel cost by 5.7-15%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As renewable electricity generation capacity increases, energy storage will be required at larger scales. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) at large scales, with effective management of heat, is recognised to have potential to provide affordable grid-scale energy storage. Where suitable geologies are unavailable, compressed air could be stored in pressurised steel tanks above ground, but this would incur significant storage costs. Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), on the other hand, does not need a pressurised storage vessel, can be located almost anywhere, has a relatively large volumetric exergy density at ambient pressure, and has relatively low marginal cost of energy storage capacity even at modest scales. However, it has lower roundtrip efficiency than compressed air energy storage technologies. This paper carries out thermodynamic analyses for an energy storage installation comprising a compressed air component supplemented with a liquid air store, and additional machinery to transform between gaseous air at ambient temperature and high pressure, and liquid air at ambient pressure. A roundtrip efficiency of 42% is obtained for the conversion of compressed air at 50 bar to liquid air, and back. The proposed system is more economical than pure LAES and more economical than a pure CAES installation if the storage duration is sufficiently long and if the high-pressure air store cannot exploit some large-scale geological feature.

Abstract: In this paper, an exergetic evaluation was conducted on a two-step biomass-derived light olefins system established using ASPEN PLUS. This system linked methanol synthesis via entrained-flow gasification to a methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process. The mass yield of the system was 0.248 kg light olefins per kg biomass, which is relatively higher than the literature results. The energetic and exergetic efficiencies of this system were 54.66% and 47.65%, respectively. The results of an exergetic analysis indicate that the biomass gasification, steam cycle, methanol separation, CO2 removal and olefins separation produce most of the system inefficiencies. By identifying the occurrence mechanism of the exergy losses, the potential for improvement can be obtained. A further increase of exergetic performance can be obtained from (1) improvement of gasification process via combining biomass torrefaction, and (2) enhancement of energy integration processes via heat network optimization and power generation from the produced steam.

Abstract: As the share of integrated renewable energy sources (RES) increases, traditional operation principles of the power systems need to change in order to maintain reliable and secure service provision, on one hand, and minimal cost and environmentally friendly electricity generation on the other. The challenge of alleviating additional uncertainty and variability brought by new sources to the system operation is seen as defining both flexibility capacities and flexibility requirements through provision of multiple services. In this context the role of emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage (ES), is recognized through their active participation in providing both energy and reserve service.
This paper elaborates on the benefits of active EV participation in multiple system services through various charging strategies. The presented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) unit commitment problem (UC) considers the capability of EV to provide primary, secondary and tertiary reserve as well as energy, however the focus is put on the benefits of EV providing spinning reserve services. The results clearly show benefits of multiple EV role to that of providing energy only. In addition the paper analyses multiple power systems, with regards to their energy mix, and recognizes how integration of EVs reflects on power system flexibility through metrics expressed as operational cost, environmental benefits and reduced wind curtailment.

Abstract: Internal combustion engines are still the main technology for energy conversion in automotive transport and are set to remain the main choice of propulsion solutions for some time to come. Development and design of these power units in the quest for improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact is increasingly reliant on simulations in order to reduce costs. Therefore, continuous improvement of sub-models used for numerical investigation is required so that correct and pertinent results are obtained. Convective heat transfer is receiving much attention in this respect, especially as direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines can feature abnormal combustion phenomena such as mega-knock, mainly driven by local hot spots in the combustion chamber, that cart be extremely damaging as they cannot be mitigated with existing control procedures. As a result, thermal stratification is more and more investigated through both quasi-dimensional and more complex computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. Alternative fuels are also extensively studied, especially as their specific properties that are different from those of gasoline can make their application challenging, thus requiring further insight in order to identify suitable injection and ignition control strategies. A new convective heat transfer correlation was developed for application in quasi-dimensional models, with a more fundamental basis combined with the application of a flow field model; results were compared to existing and extensively used empirical equations. Assessments were based on in-cylinder pressure measurements performed on a DISI engine fueled with gasoline, combined with the evaluation of flame area through optical techniques. Crank angle resolved UV-visible chemiluminescence was used for the analysis of early stage flame development and cycle resolved acquisitions were employed in order to visualize the main combustion phase. The effect of engine speed, load, spark advance and air-fuel ratio was investigated. Thermodynamic and optical data were found to be well correlated when applying the proposed model that also features simpler calibration. Further validation was performed by using heat flux measurements on another experimental power unit fueled with methane and hydrogen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Performance data of two commercially prepared oxygen carriers, MgO-promoted natural mineral hematite (Fe2O3) and synthetic mixed metal cuO-Fe2O3/alumina, are described in this paper. Large, 180-kg (400-pound) batches of both oxygen carriers were successfully prepared at a commercial catalyst preparation facility.
These carriers have shown excellent reactivity and stable performance during cyclic chemical-looping combustion (CLC) tests conducted with methane/air at 700-850 degrees C in an atmospheric fluid bed reactor. Attrition resistance of both oxygen carriers with particle size of 100-150 gm, measured using the ASTM 5757D method, was better than that of standard fluidized bed cracking catalysts. The presence of MgO on the hematite oxygen carrier significantly improved the oxygen utilization of hematite for methane CLC. The CuO-Fe2O3/alumina oxygen carrier showed excellent performance during the 25-cycle fluidized bed CLC test conducted at 800 degrees C with methane and air. Full combustion of methane to CO2 and stable oxygen transfer capacity were observed during all the cycles. The fluidization of this material was easy, with no particle agglomeration as is traditionally observed with CuO-containing materials. Fluidized bed temperature programmed reaction tests with coal were also conducted with both materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Sustainability of the aviation industry, as any other industry, depends on the elasticity of demand for the product and profitability through minimising operating costs. Of paramount importance is assessing and understanding the interdependency and effects of environmentally optimised solutions and emission mitigation policies.
This paper describes the development and application of assessment methodologies to better understand the effects of environmental taxation/energy policies aimed at environmental pollution reduction and the future potential economic impact they may have on the adaptation of "greener" novel technologies. These studies are undertaken using a Techno-economic Environmental Risk Assessment approach. The methodology demonstrated allows the assessment of the economic viability of new technologies compared to conventional technologies, for various CO2 emission taxation and fuel price scenarios. It considers relative increases in acquisition price and maintenance costs.
A study undertaken as a 'proof of concept' compares a Counter Rotating Open Rotor aircraft with a conventional aircraft for short range operations. It indicates that at current fuel price and with no carbon taxation, a highly fuel efficient technology, such as the one considered, could be rendered economically unviable.
The work goes on to demonstrate that in comparison to the conventional aircraft, any economic benefits that may be accrued from improvement in fuel consumption through such a technology, may well be negated through increases in acquisition price and maintenance costs. The work further demonstrates that if policy makers want to direct the industry towards greener propulsion solutions, then an increase in CO2 emission taxation may be appropriate.

Abstract: It is a major challenge to transform a laboratory scale production of fuel cells to an industrial scale in terms of throughput, operating lifetime, cost, reliability and efficiency. In spite of a number of efforts, the durability, reliability and cost of fuel cells still remain major barriers to scaling-up and commercialization. Unless these challenges are fully understood there is little chance of overcoming them. In fact, though much fundamental research has been performed, there is still no clear understanding of both the theoretical solution and technical measures needed to solve the durability and performance degradation of fuel cells in the scaling-up process. In this critical review, we will revisit advances in theory of flow field designs. Then, we will analyze main issues and challenges in concepts and criteria of flow field designs and development of theoretical models. We will focus on uneven flow distribution as a root cause of low durability and reliability and performance degradation and why flow field designs are a strategic solution to integrated performance, flow conditions, structure and electrochemical processes. Finally, we will discuss criteria and measures to tackle uneven flow distribution as well as critical durability and performance degradation in the scaling-up of fuel cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The development of electrochemical processes for the conversion of CO2 into value-added products allows innovative carbon capture & utilization (CCU) instead of carbon capture & storage (CCS). In addition, coupling this conversion with renewable energy sources would make it possible to chemically store electricity from these intermittent renewable sources. The electroreduction of CO2 to formate in aqueous solution has been performed using Sn particles deposited over a carbon support. The effect of the particle size and Sn metal loading has been evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The selected electrode has been tested on an experimental filter-press type cell system for continuous and single pass CO2 electroreduction to obtain formate as main product at ambient pressure and temperature. Experimental results show that using electrodes with 0.75 mg Sn cm(-2), 150 nm Sn particles, and working at a current density of 90 mA cm(-2), it is possible to achieve rates of formate production over 32 mmol m(-2) s(-1) and faradaic efficiencies around 70% for 90 min of continuous operation. These experimental conditions allow formate concentrations of about 1.5 g L-1 to be obtained on a continuous mode and with a single pass of catholyte through the cell. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Considerable portion of energy losses in a vehicle traced to tire. Energy losses in a tire are due to tire longitudinal slip as well as rolling resistance. Hence, both of aforementioned factors must take into the consideration to study the tire energy loss. Present paper aims to investigate the power losses in tires and to examine influence of road conditions and tire inflation pressure on them. To cover the real-world conditions, experiments were done on a gasoline-fueled passenger vehicle on an urban highway along two routes with same length and opposite gradients to comprise the change of road conditions. Then, by use of engine performance model which is prepared in dynamometer laboratory, the power losses in drive and driven wheels are conducted separately. According to the results, either in driven wheels or when cruising in negative gradient, the power loss due to rolling resistance is primary and as a result the tire power losses would be decreased as inflation pressure increases. But when the tractive force is significant, for instance in positive gradient, the role of slip power loss becomes substantial in drive wheels so that the sum of rolling resistance and tire slip losses must be evaluated. Results show that in positive gradient, the least tire power losses in drive wheels would be obtained when the tire is under inflated. In addition, CO2 emissions during the tests obtained and it is seen that a reduction in tire power losses leads to decrease of CO2 emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A consolidated bioprocess integrating enzyme production, saccharification and fermentation was applied for bioethanol production. Mixed solid-state fermentation of alkali-pretreated sugarcane bagasse (SCB) supplemented with wheat bran (WB) to produce a compound enzyme for saccharification by Trichoderma and Penicillium was carried out, and at 72 h, the obtained sugars concentration was 20.190 g/L. Then the mixture was further converted to ethanol by inoculating Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After 24 h, the maximum ethanol concentration 5.825 g/L (40.84% of theoretical yield) was achieved. At 144 h, the produced 8-glucosidase activity and fungal biomass were 0.483 IU/mL and 0.204 g/g, respectively. The consolidated bioprocess avoided enzyme preparation, saved much water/energy consumption and reduced equipment investment, which indicated that it might be an effective approach for the economic production of bioethanol.

Abstract: Italy is a large producer of biogas from anaerobic digestion, which is mainly used for power generation with limited use of cogenerated heat. Other utilization pathways, such as biomethane injection into the natural gas grid or biomethane used as a vehicle fuel, remain unexplored. Given the dense grid of natural gas pipelines and existing Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refueling stations in northern Italy, significant market opportunities for biogas could also arise in the heating and transport sectors. The main objectives of this paper are to explore the potential role of agricultural biogas in different utilization pathways. Biogas combustion for simultaneous production of heat and power in small Combined Heat and Power (CHP) facilities is also assessed, as is upgrading to biomethane for transport or natural gas grid injection in the specific context of northern Italy. The spatially explicit optimization model BeWhere is used to identify optimal locations where greenfield biogas plants could be installed and to determine the most economic and environmentally beneficial mix of conversion technologies and plant capacities. Carbon price, for instance in the form of tradable emission permits, is assessed as a policy instrument and compared with other options such as price premiums on biomethane or electricity costs. Results show that starting from a carbon price of 15 EUR/tCO(2), the cogeneration option is preferable if plants are located in the proximity of existing district heating infrastructure. CNG plants are only competitive starting at a carbon price of 70 EUR/tCO(2) in areas with high feedstock availability. The sensitivity analysis for energy prices reveals that a larger number of CNG facilities are included in the optimal mix at higher gas wholesale prices. This further indicates that specific premiums are needed to expand the biomethane market share, while greenhouse gas emission reductions would primarily be achieved by fostering cogeneration of electricity and heat supported by carbon price-based policy instruments.

Abstract: The most promising solution for propulsion of marine vessels currently and for the near future is the two-stroke low-speed diesel engines. Despite its advantages, as far as specific fuel oil consumption, power density and reliability is concerned, it suffers from increased NOx emissions mainly because of its low rotational speed. But the upcoming NOx emission legislation (Tier III) in the marine sector requires considerable reduction of NOx emissions towards levels which have not yet been commercially achieved using primary methods. This creates new challenges for the development and application of innovative techniques that could reduce engine's NOx emissions with the lowest possible fuel penalty. This is important considering current and future fuel prices. The large size of the 2-stroke marine engine makes the use of experimental techniques, to investigate this potential, expensive and time consuming. Modelling can significantly contribute towards this effort and result to reduction of research and development cost. Among the most effective in-cylinder techniques for NOx reduction is EGR, a proven technology for smaller engines used in the transport sector. In the present study, it is investigated via modelling, the potential to reduce NOx emissions of two-stroke marine engines using EGR Despite the technological difficulties resulting mainly from the use of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), which makes the application of conventional EGR techniques difficult, it is worthwhile investigating the NOx reduction potential, since significant progress has been achieved towards the development of new EGR gas cooling techniques and scrubber technologies for removal of sulphur species from the exhaust gas. The present investigation makes use of an existing well validated multi-zone combustion model, initially developed for high-speed DI diesel engines. The model has been successfully applied in the past, to investigate heavy duty diesel engine NOx reduction via EGR, providing favourable results. Currently it is modified and applied on a two-stroke marine diesel engine using EGR. Model evaluation is based on experimental data acquired from the international literature, due to lack of experimental data for 2-stroke engines. The analysis of derived results reveals model's ability to predict both engine performance and NOx emissions but most important the ability to predict the overall effect of EGR on NOx emissions in a qualitatively correct way. The re the strong potential of EGR to control NOx emissions of 2-stroke engines with relatively compared to alternative techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To achieve a step improvement in engine efficiency, a novel split cycle engine concept is proposed. The engine has separate compression and combustion cylinders and waste heat is recovered between the two. Quasi-isothermal compression of the charge air is realised in the compression cylinder while isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture is achieved in the combustion cylinder. Exhaust heat recovery between the compression and combustion chamber enables highly efficient recovery of waste heat within the cycle. Based on cycle analysis and a one-dimensional engine model, the fundamentals and the performance of the split thermodynamic cycle is estimated. Compared to conventional engines, the compression work can be significantly reduced through the injection of a controlled quantity of water in the compression cylinder, lowering the gas temperature during compression. Thermal energy can then be effectively recovered from the engine exhaust in a recuperator between the cooled compressor cylinder discharge air and the exhaust gas. The resulting hot high pressure air is then injected into a combustor cylinder and mixed with fuel, where near isobaric combustion leads to a low combustion temperature and reduced heat transferred from the cylinder wall. Detailed cycle simulation indicates a 32% efficiency improvement can be expected compared to the conventional diesel engines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Chemical looping combustion (CLC) of solid fuels is considered as a potential technology to reduce the energy penalty and the cost for CO2 capture. However, the low efficiency of carbon conversion and gasification products conversion is a big concern for the in-situ gasification chemical looping combustion (IG-CLC) process with the low-cost natural iron ore as an oxygen carrier. This paper evaluates the enhanced fuel conversion with a new CaO-modified iron ore as oxygen carrier during the continuous coal CLC in a 1 kW(th) reactor. Both CaO-mixed iron ore and cement/CaO-combined iron ore were tested. The effect of oxygen carrier on the gaseous products was evaluated in the fuel reactor temperature range of 880-980 degrees C. The samples of oxygen carrier were characterized using BET, SEM-EDX and XRD. The results indicate that compared with the pure iron ore oxygen carrier, the utilization of both CaO-mixed iron ore and the cement/CaO-combined iron ore could efficiently enhance coal conversion and gaseous conversion in the fuel reactor. However, when the CaO-mixed iron ore was used, some CaO powder due to the attrition during continuous operation adhered to the particle surface of iron ore. The Ca-containing compounds, i.e., potential eutectic of a low melting point caused sintering on the particle surface of iron ore. As a result, it caused the reactivity deterioration of oxygen carrier at a high fuel reactor temperature. To avoid the occurrence of sintering on the particle surface of the oxygen carrier, an improvement of cement/CaO-combined iron ore as oxygen carrier was proposed. A stable structure of Ca2Al2SiO7 was formed during the calcination process of the cement/CaO-combined iron ore. The sintering resistance of the iron ore was improved and the oxygen carrier after experiments maintained the porous structure. Reactivity deterioration of the combined oxygen carrier did not occur during the 5 h continuous operation even at the fuel reactor temperature of 980 degrees C. Overall, the Cement/CaO-combined iron ore is a competitive oxygen carrier in the coal CLC process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The incorporation of Bio-CCS, which involves an increase in investment and operating costs, would not be of interest in thermochemical biorefineries unless some economic benefit were provided. The rewarding of extra-avoided emissions encourages larger savings of GHG emissions in thermochemical biorefineries incorporating Bio-CCS. Therefore, there is a need for policies which reward of Bio-CCS incorporation, and in a broader sense, all extra-avoided emissions. In this study, we analyze how the geological storage of already captured CO2 (i.e. the incorporation of Bio-CCS) could be rewarded, taking different policy scenarios in the EU into consideration. Since thermochemical biorefineries achieve a GHG saving above the minimum target in the EU, the sale of all extra-avoided GHG emissions (not only from the geological storage of captured CO2) from energy carriers and chemicals is analyzed. Two different configurations of thermochemical biorefineries are analyzed: a biorefinery producing an energy carrier and a biorefinery co-producing an energy carrier and chemicals. Considering the sale of CO2 allowances in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), current prices (5-15 (sic)/t) would not make Bio-CCS incorporation profitable. However, it would be profitable compare with current sequestration costs for conventional power plants (50-100 (sic)/t). If the sale of extra-avoided emissions from the production of energy carriers were included in the EU-ETS, the CO2 sequestration cost would be reduced, although not enough to enhance the process economy. If chemicals were included, the sequestration cost would decrease significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Bio-char, produced from biomass pyrolysis, can be pelletized to improve its undesirable characteristics, such as low bulk and energy densities, poor transportation and storage properties, and troublesome to co-fire with coal. In this study, rice husk char was compressed into pellets with four kinds of binders (lignin, starch, calcium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide). The compressive process, mechanical strength, basic fuel properties, and combustion characteristics were investigated to elucidate the effect of binders on the properties of bio-char pellets. Results showed that starch pellets had good hydrophobicity, but low volume density and poor mechanical strength. The softening and morphological transition of lignin during compression may account for the high elastic modulus and good bonding of lignin pellets. The low saturated moisture content of Ca(OH)(2) pellets is mainly ascribed to its hydration. NaOH pellets showed the highest compressive strength among all pellets, and also exhibited the highest moisture uptake that may worsen the handling and storage treatment of bio-char. Compared with raw bio-char, bio-char pellets had a lower ignition temperature, wider temperature interval, and higher oxidation activity according to the thermogravimetric analysis. The lignin and Ca(OH)2 pellets showed lower compression energy consumption and moisture uptake, enhanced mechanical strength and promoted combustion performance, which demonstrated more desirable properties for utilization as biofuels.

Abstract: At the present time, trains in heavy haul operations are typically hauled by several diesel-electric locomotives coupled in a multiple unit. This paper studies the case of a typical consist of three Co-Co diesel-electric locomotives, and considers replacing one unit with an alternative version, with the same design parameters, except that the diesel-electric plant is replaced with flywheel energy storage equipment. The intelligent traction and energy control system installed in this unit is integrated into the multiple-unit control to allow redistribution of the power between all units. In order to verify the proposed design, a three-stage investigation has been performed as described in this paper. The initial stage studies a possible configuration of the flywheel energy storage system by detailed modelling of the proposed intelligent traction and energy control system. The second stage includes the investigation and estimation of possible energy flows using a longitudinal train dynamics simulation. The final stage compares the conventional and the proposed locomotive configurations considering two parameters: fuel efficiency and emissions reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Chemical looping combustion is now at a point beyond proof of concept. Lots of different oxygen carriers have been developed using different metal oxides, support materials and production methods. The interchangeability of oxygen carriers in a chemical looping combustion plant is investigated in a 120 kW(th) pilot. Four different oxygen carriers are tested with focus on reactor temperature, total solids inventory, specific fuel reactor inventory, solids circulation rate and air to fuel ratio. The experimental data of this work, the data of previous work with the same pilot plant and thermodynamic data allow the identification of three groups of oxygen carriers according to the demands on the reactor system for good fuel conversion. Different reactor configurations and potentially limiting factors for each type of oxygen carrier are identified. Changing oxygen carriers of the same group in an existing chemical looping plant seems to be possible without big changes of the reactor configuration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: More and more households are purchasing electric vehicles (EVs), and this will continue as we move towards a low carbon future. There are various projections as to the rate of EV uptake, but all predict an increase over the next ten years. Charging these EVs will produce one of the biggest loads on the low voltage network. To manage the network, we must not only take into account the number of EVs taken up, but where on the network they are charging, and at what time. To simulate the impact on the network from high, medium and low EV uptake (as outlined by the UK government), we present an agent-based model. We initialise the model to assign an EV to a household based on either random distribution or social influences - that is, a neighbour of an EV owner is more likely to also purchase an EV. Additionally, we examine the effect of peak behaviour on the network when charging is at day-time, night-time, or a mix of both. The model is implemented on a neighbourhood in south-east England using smart meter data (half hourly electricity readings) and real life charging patterns from an EV trial. Our results indicate that social influence can increase the peak demand on a local level (street or feeder), meaning that medium EV uptake can create higher peak demand than currently expected.

Abstract: Increasingly stringent fuel economy and emissions regulations alongside efforts to reduce oil dependence have accelerated the global deployment of advanced vehicle technologies. In recent years, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and consumers have generally been successful in mutually deploying cleaner vehicle options with little sacrifice in cost, performance or overall utility. Projections regarding the challenges and impacts associated with compliance with mid- and long-term targets in the U.S., however, incur much greater uncertainty. The share of existing new vehicles that is expected to comply with future regulations, for example, falls below 10% by 2020. This article explores advanced technologies that result in reduced fuel consumption and emissions that are commercially available in 2014 Model Year compact and midsize passenger cars. A review of the recent research literature and publicly available cost and technical specification data addressing correlations between incremental cost and fuel economy is presented. This analysis reveals that a 10% improvement in the sales-weighted average fuel economy of passenger cars has been achieved between 2011 and 2014 at costs that are at or below levels anticipated by the regulations by means of reductions in weight, friction, and drag; advancements in internal combustion efficiency; turbocharging combined with engine downsizing; transmission upgrades; and the growth of hybrids. Benefit-cost analyses performed on best-selling models in the selected classifications reveal that consumers thus far are not substantially incentivized to purchase fuel economy. Under baseline conditions, benefit-cost ratios are above a breakeven value of unity for only 6 of 28 models employing improved fuel-economy technologies. Sales-weighted data indicate that the "average" consumer that elected to invest in greater fuel economy spent $1490 to realize a 17.3% improvement in fuel economy, equating to estimated savings of $1070. Thus savings were, on average, insufficient to cover technology costs in the baseline scenario. However, a sensitivity analysis reveals that a majority of new technologies become financially attractive to consumers when average fuel prices exceed $5.60/gallon, or when annual miles traveled exceed 16,400. The article concludes with techno-economic implications of the research on future fuel economy regulations for stakeholders. In general, the additional cost consumers incur in exchange for a given level of fuel economy improvement in the coming years will need to be steadily reduced compared to current levels to ensure that the expected benefits of fuel savings are financially warranted.

Abstract: In this study, a novel thermal energy storage composite was developed by impregnating paraffin into hydrophobic coated expanded perlite (EPO) granules. A paraffin/uncoated expanded perlite (EPW) phase change composite was also prepared to study and compare the stability when integrated into cementitious composites. Paraffin/EPW, containing 35% by weight of paraffin, showed significant leakage of phase change material (PCM) during integration into concrete. However, no PCM leakage was observed for novel paraffin/EPO containing 50% by weight of paraffin in the composite. Microstructural and mechanical properties were studied for the compatibility of hydrophobic coated PCM composite in concrete. The thermal behaviour of a concrete panel incorporating PCM was studied and compared with the reference panel. The results revealed that incorporation of the developed PCM composite into concrete significantly improved the thermal inertia and thermal energy storage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The paper analyzes data about recharge of electric cars in Rome during 2013 as a part of a national research project (P.R.I.M.E.). The electric vehicles were recharged through the public Enel Distribuzione recharging infrastructure. For each recharge, the initial and final time were registered together with the electricity absorbed from the grid. The total number of recharges was about 7700. The first step of the investigation is the statistical analysis of the distribution of recharges in daily time slots in order to analyze the recharge behavior of Italian drivers. For each day and for each time slot, literature data from the Italian national grid operator (Terna) were used to retrieve the energy mix used to produce electricity in that day and in that time slot. In the third step, electricity generation mixes were used to obtain emission factors for greenhouse (CO2) and pollutant emissions (CO, NO, HC and particulate). Using information about the electric consumption of vehicles registered in Rome, the emission factors in g/km were obtained and compared with the limits set by European legislation for conventional (gasoline and diesel).

Abstract: To achieve the goal of drawing up optimal plans for power generation, decision makers need an appropriate methodology to effectively identify the pivotal aspects of electricity consumption fluctuation and anticipate the future trend. The parameter identification of conventional statistical approach mainly relies on distributional assumptions and functional form restrictions, which might be problematic for the real application. This paper addresses these issues by implementing a novel semi-parametric modeling approach, which is suitable for investigating the uncertainties in the mid-long term forecast and estimating the probability distributions of future demand. To identify the significant impact factors of the electricity consumption, a new Kullback-Liebler (K-L) divergence based similarity measure strategy is designed. A case study concerning the electricity demand forecasting in China demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach and verifies the feasibility of establishing explicit functional dependency between external variables and electricity consumption. Despite the complexity, notable reductions in the number of forecasting error are obtained due to the adoption of three indicators: deposits in financial institutions, exports, and imports.

Abstract: From June 2014 to January 2015, the slumped price of crude oil mainly be caused by the increasing shale gas in the U.S. The market of crude oil was altered by the variation of natural gas trade patterns. It implies that the international fossil energy trade is a multilayer structure, and each layer is a complex system with numerous countries and complicated relations. In this paper, we build the international fossil energy trade multilayer network (ETMN), and study the evolutionary characteristics of networks during 2002-2013. The generalization of several important indicators, including degree distribution, community, stability of communities and the time-varying evolution of main countries' importance were discussed. Our conclusions suggest that: Firstly, the ETMN and three energy-specific networks including coal, oil, and natural gas display the scale-free characteristic in un-weighted and weighted networks. However, it shows that even if a few countries have major trading partners, there are not always a few countries that play critical roles in trade intensity. Secondly, the natural gas network has the largest number of communities and stability compared with networks of coal and oil, and the volatility of stability lagged one year than the other two networks for the specific form of pipeline transportation. Thirdly, studying on the stability of networks shows that geopolitical environment is the most important influenced factor, but the status of renewable and new energy increases with its development obviously. Fourthly, the evolutionary characteristics of three major countries' importance, including United States, China and Japan, are analyzed in detail. At last, some policy suggestions were pointed out according to the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A dual-loop organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system is designed to recover the waste heat of a diesel engine. The high-temperature (HT) loop utilizes the heat load of the engine exhaust gas, and the low-temperature (LT) loop uses the heat load of the jacket cooling water and the residual heat of the HT loop sequentially. These two loops are coupled via a shared heat exchanger. Water is selected as the working fluid for the HT loop and wet steam expansion, which can be implemented through screw expanders, is exploited. The dryness fraction of the wet steam at the inlet of the expander can be adjusted to attain a suitable evaporation temperature and provide a better temperature match with the heat source. The working fluid candidates for the LT loop are chosen to be R123, R236fa and R245fa. The influence of the HT loop parameters on the performance of the LT loop is evaluated. The simulation results reveal that under different operating conditions of the HT loop, the pinch point of the LT loop occurs at different locations and therefore, results in different evaporation temperatures and other thermal parameters. The maximum net power output of the dual-loop ORC system reaches 115.1 kW, which leads to an increase of 11.6% on the original power output of the diesel engine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Saving energy is crucial for all sectors following the new framework presented by the European Commission to drive continued progress towards a low-carbon economy. Many studies focus on the residential sector, transport and energy-intensive industries, but there is a lack of tools to help decision makers in non-energy intensive industry (NEI). This paper presents the first bottom-up energy model developed for this sector. This prospective modeling enables us to analyze the impact of heat recovery using heat pumps (HP) in industrial processes up to 2020 in the French food and drink industry (MD), the biggest NEI sector. The technology has high potential in this sector and may be eligible for Energy Saving Certificates. Our model determines the differentiated cost for energy savings in response to incentive policies under the ESC mechanism at a 4-digit level of NACE classification. Sensitivity analyses also show how gas prices and electricity carbon footprints impact on HP penetration. Our study of this particular sector shows that the model could be a useful decision-making tool for assessing potential energy savings and could be extended to other sectors of NEI industry for more efficient subsectoral screening.

Abstract: The development of dynamic building envelope technologies, which adapt to changing outdoor and indoor environments, is considered a crucial step towards the achievement of the nearly Zero Energy Building target. It is currently not possible to evaluate the energy saving potential of innovative adaptive transparent building envelopes in an accurate manner. This creates difficulties in selecting between competing technologies and is a barrier to systematic development of these innovative technologies.
The main aim of this work is to develop a method for devising optimal adaptive glazing properties and to evaluate the energy saving potential resulting from the adoption of such a technology. The method makes use of an inverse performance-oriented approach, to minimize the total primary energy use of a building. It is applied to multiple case studies (office reference room with 4 different cardinal orientations and in three different temperate climates) in order to evaluate and optimise the performance of adaptive glazing as it responds to changing boundary conditions on a monthly and daily basis. A frequency analysis on the set of optimised adaptive properties is subsequently performed to identify salient features of ideal adaptive glazing.
The results show that high energy savings are achievable by adapting the transparent part of the building envelope alone, the largest component being the cooling energy demand. As expected, the energy savings are highly sensitive to: the time scale of the adaptive mechanisms; the capability of the facade to adapt to the outdoor climatic condition; the difference between outdoor climatic condition and the comfort range. Moreover important features of the optimal thermo-optical properties are identified. Of these, one of the most important findings is that a unique optimised technology, varying its thermo-optical properties between a limited number of states could be effective in different climates and orientations.

Abstract: Mg-Al-CO3-Hydrotalcite (HT) was prepared via hydrothermal synthesis method in this paper. Then the HT was organically modified. The composite PCM was prepared with the organic HT and paraffin via the liquid intercalation. The interlayer groups of HT were investigated using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) before and after modification. The microscopic structure of the organic HT/paraffin composite PCM was characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The thermal properties were measured using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and a thermal constant analyzer. The results showed that the HT prepared via the hydrothermal synthesis had single crystal phase and high crystallinity. The layer spacing of the organic HT was expanded. The intercalation rate of paraffin was 25.9 wt% in the organic HT. The phase transition temperature and the phase change enthalpy of the organic HT/paraffin composite PCM were 26.2 degrees C and 29.8 J/g, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Superior spray behavior of fuels in internal combustion engines lead to improved combustion and emission characteristics therefore it is necessary to investigate fuel spray behavior of new alternative fuels. This study discusses the evolution of the in-nozzle orifice parameters of a numerical simulation and the evolution of spray parameters of fuel spray in a constant-volume spray chamber during an experiment. This study compares mineral diesel, biodiesels (Karanja-and Jatropha-based), and their blends with mineral diesel. The results show that mineral diesel provides superior atomization and evaporation behavior compared to the biodiesel test fuels. Karanja biodiesel provides superior atomization and evaporation characteristics compared to Jatropha biodiesel. The qualitative comparison of simulation and experimental results in tandem shows that nozzle-hole design is a critical parameter for obtaining optimum spray behavior in the engine combustion chamber.

Abstract: Over a third of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stem from cooling and heating buildings, due to their fossil fuel based operation. Low exergy building systems are a promising approach to reduce energy consumption as well as GHG emissions. They consists of renewable energy technologies, such as PV, PV/T and heat pumps. Since careful tuning of parameters is required, a manual setup may result in sub-optimal operation. A model predictive control approach is unnecessarily complex due to the required model identification. Therefore, in this work we present a reinforcement learning control (RLC) approach. The studied building consists of a PV/T array for solar heat and electricity generation, as well as geothermal heat pumps. We present RLC for the PV/T array, and the full building model. Two methods, Tabular Q-learning and Batch Q-learning with Memory Replay, are implemented with real building settings and actual weather conditions in a Matlab/Simulink framework. The performance is evaluated against standard rule-based control (RBC). We investigated different neural network structures and find that some outperformed RBC already during the learning phase. Overall, every RLC strategy for PV/T outperformed RBC by over 10% after the third year. Likewise, for the full building, RLC outperforms RBC in terms of meeting the heating demand, maintaining the optimal operation temperature and compensating more effectively for ground heat. This allows to reduce engineering costs associated with the setup of these systems, as well as decrease the return-of-invest period, both of which are necessary to create a sustainable, zero-emission building stock.

Abstract: A life cycle assessment (LCA) is an extremely useful tool to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with all the stages of a crude oil's life from well-to-wheel (WTW). All of the WTW life cycle stages of crude oil consume energy and produce significant amounts of GHG emissions. The present study attempts to quantify the WTW life cycle GHG emissions for transportation fuels derived from five North American conventional crudes through the development of an LCA model called FUNNEL-GHG-CCO (FUNdamental Engineering PrinciplEs-based ModeL for Estimation of GreenHouse Gases in Conventional Crude Oils). This model estimates GHG emissions from all the life cycle stages from recovery of crude to the combustion of transportation fuels in vehicle engines. The contribution of recovery emissions in the total WTW GHG emissions ranges from 3.12% for Mars crude to 24.25% for California's Kern County heavy oil. The transportation of crude oil and refined fuel contributes only 0.44-1.73% of the total WTW life cycle GHG emissions, depending on the transportation methods and total distance transported. The GHG emissions for refining were calculated from the amount of energy use in the refining of crude oil to produce transportation fuels. All the upstream GHG emissions were allocated to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Refining GHG emissions vary from 13.66-18.70 g-CO(2)eq/MJ-gasoline, 9.71-15.33 g-CO(2)eq/MJ-diesel, and 6.38-9.92 g-CO(2)eq/MJ-jet fuel derived from Alaska North Slope and California's Kern County heavy oil, respectively. The total WTW life cycle GHG emissions range from 97.55 g-CO(2)eq/MJ-gasoline derived from Mars crude to 127.74 g-CO(2)eq/MJ-gasoline derived from California's Kern County heavy oil.

Abstract: Biomass co-firing is becoming a promising solution to reduce CO2 emissions, due to its renewability and carbon neutrality. Biomass normally has high moisture and volatile contents, complicating its combustion behavior, which is significantly different from that of coal. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combustion model of a single biomass particle is employed to study high-temperature rapid biomass combustion. The two-competing-rate model and kinetics/diffusion model are used to model biomass devolatilization reaction and char burnout process, respectively, in which the apparent kinetics used for those two models were from high temperatures and high heating rates tests. The particle size changes during the devolatilization and char burnout are also considered. The mass loss properties and temperature profile during the biomass devolatilization and combustion processes are predicted: and the timescales of particle heating up, drying, devolatilization, and char burnout are compared and discussed. Finally, the results shed light on the effects of particle size on the combustion behavior of biomass particle. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: An innovative small dynamic water desalination plant was developed and tested under laboratory conditions. The system is a combination of a heat pipe evacuated tube solar collector, conventional condenser and novel fluid piston converter. Saline water is boiled and turned into vapour in the manifold of the solar collector. A small fraction of the solar energy supplied to the plant is used to drive the fluid piston converter. Oscillations of the fluid piston periodically change the volume and pressure in the plant. For the duration of approximately half of the periodic cycle the pressure in the plant drops below the atmospheric level causing flash boiling of saline water in the manifold of the solar collector. Generated vapour is turned into fresh water in the condenser which is surrounded by a cooling jacket with saline water. The flash boiling effect improves the fresh water production capacity of the plant. Additionally, the fluid piston converter drives a pump which provides lifting of saline water from a well and pumps this through the cooling jacket of the condenser to a saline water storage tank. This tank replenishes saline water in the manifold of the solar collector. Experimental investigations demonstrated the saline water self-circulation capability of the plant and increase in the fresh water production compared to the static mode of operation. Experimental data was also used to calibrate the mathematical model of the plant. Comparison of theoretical and experimental information demonstrates that the model accurately predicts the performance of the plant. The proposed novel system with greater fresh water production capacity has a simple design and is easy to manufacture using low cost materials and therefore can be mass deployed for small scale saline water pumping and desalination across different regions with the relatively high solar radiation and shortage in the drinking water supply.

Abstract: Woodchip is preferred to all biomass forms because it shows standardised sizes and offers additional benefits in terms of load density. In Europe, a large amount of woodchip is produced by dedicated cultivations: very Short Rotation Coppice (vSRC) and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC). The chipping operation can be done during the biomass harvest or some months after tree cutting. This operation can be performed by different machines: disc chippers, drum chippers, feller-chippers and grinders.
The goal of this work was to determine the energy and the CO2 emission of different types of chippers used in biomass comminution produced by poplar vSRC and SRC. All machines were tested with two different feedstocks: branchwood (treetops and biomass produced by vSRC) and whole-trees (biomass produced by SRC).
Fuel consumption ranged between 14.36 and 59.521 h(-1) and energy consumption varied from 0.92 to 0.62 MJ Mg DM-1, respectively, for branchwood and whole-trees feedstock type. In addition, an average value of 16.40 kgCO(2)eq Mg DM-1 in branchwood chipping and an average value of 10.80 kgCO(2)eq Mg DM-1 were obtained in CO2 assessment.
This experiment indicated that self-propelled feller-chippers were significantly more convenient than "conventional chippers" in biomass comminution produced by dedicated plantations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work focuses on the design, fabrication and testing of thermoelectric generator (TEG) devices using dispenser printer. A series-parallel prototype of 50 couples, with 3.5 mm x 600 mu m x 100 mu m printed element dimensions, is fabricated on a custom designed polyimide substrate. Se doped mechanically alloyed (MA) Bi2Te3 was used as the n-type material whereas Te doped MA Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 was used as p-type material. The prototype TEG device produces a power output of 33 x 10(-6) W at 0.75 x 10(-3) A and 43 x 10(-3) V for a temperature difference of 20 K resulting in a device areal power density of 2.8 W m(-2). To achieve a similar power output in a practical situation, such as from pipes carrying hot fluid an experimental study in forced and natural convection is performed. In forced convection, 33 x 10(-6) W power output is achieved when the pipe surface temperature is about 373 K. While, in natural convection, maximum power up to 8 x 10(-6) W power is obtained at 373 K pipe surface temperature. Forced convection is desired for the system to generate sufficiently high power. In the case of natural convection, we achieved much lower power compared to forced convection. The prototype presented in this work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a printable and "perpetual" power solution for practical wireless sensor network (WSN) applications.

Abstract: While the potential of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to produce biocrude regardless of the types of microalgae (biomass-agnostic) has been noted, the quality of biocrude and the Energy Return On Investment (EROI) of HTL of various microalgal species have not been compared in detail. Here we report that the quality of biocrude and the EROI of microalgal HTL are directly dependent on the lipid contents of microalgae. When Nannochloropsis oceanica (30.2% lipid content) and Golenkinia sp. (17.3% lipid content) were compared for the quality of HTL in terms of the total yield, asphaltene/non-asphaltene contents, heteroatom (O, N, and S) concentrations, and the effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratios (H/C-eff) of the biocrudes, N. oceanica with high lipid content produced biocrude that can be more suitable for catalytic upgrading to transportation fuels than the biocrude from Golenkinia sp. with low lipid content. HTL of N. oceanica at low temperature (200 degrees C) in particular produced the biocrude with EROI that was better than that of Golenkinia sp. These results strongly support that the choice of microalgae with high lipid content is still a key factor that must be considered for biocrude production as much as it is regarded important for biodiesel production using microalgal biomass.

Abstract: NOx is one of the main compositions in the modern engine emissions and the reduction requirements of NOx have turned to be more stringent. To control NO emissions better, the technologies of NOx sensors are forced to achieve much faster response and higher accuracy. In this paper, the correlation between ion current signals and NOx emissions is studied by both experiments and simulations in a direct-injection controlled auto-ignition (CAI) engine. The investigation provides the possibility of a novel method of cycle-by-cycle NOx emissions detection. The simulation results present this positive correlation based on the chemical kinetics theory, and also directly reflect the formation order of the chemical products and the influence of temperature on the rates of main ionization and NOx generated reactions. Furthermore, the distributions of both ions and NOx products are shown with the CFD results, illustrating their in-cylinder space correlation. Combined with the simulation results, the experimental results not only validate the positive correlation between two different fuel types, but also provide the evidences of linear fitting function. Based on the fitting results, the cycle-based NOx emissions could be estimated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic (i.e., time-based) model for distribution system expansion planning (DSEP) considering distributed generation. The proposed model optimizes both investment and operation costs of distribution system. It determines the optimal location and size of distributed generators as well as the reinforcement strategy for primary (i.e., medium voltage) distribution feeders along a specified planning horizon. Besides, the dynamic feature of this model enables it to determine the time of each investment. The investment costs consist of installation cost of distributed generators and reinforcement cost of primary distribution feeders. Similarly, the operation costs comprise the cost of energy losses, operation and maintenance cost of the equipment and cost of power purchased from upstream grid (i.e., sub-transmission or transmission grid). The introduced model is solved using a combination of two efficient heuristic methods of Modified Integer-coded Harmony Search (MIHS) to find the optimal expansion scheme and Enhanced Gravitational Search Algorithm (EGSA) to optimize the operation costs. Furthermore, the suggested solution approach also incorporates an efficient mechanism for coding the candidate solutions in MIHS algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method and coding mechanism is extensively demonstrated by testing on two radial distribution systems and comparing the obtained results with the results of several other solution techniques.

Abstract: A radiant porous burner with augmented preheating (i.e., superadiabatic radiant burner, SRB) is experimentally investigated. The porous alumina (Al2O3) burner with a square cross-section consists of a small-pored upstream section for internally preheating the incoming gas mixture, a large-pored downstream section for establishing flame, a preheater for externally recovering heat from the exiting flue gas and preheating the inlet air for the burner in addition to the internal heat recirculation in the small-pored upstream section, and radiation corridors for extracting heat from the flame and transferring it to radiating disk surfaces. Temperature distribution and combustion stability limits of flame in the SRB and the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are measured. Results show that the SRB can be operated even at very fuel-lean condition because of the internal and external heat recirculation, showing blow-off and flash-back limits for a given fuel-equivalence ratio. It is observed that the superadiabatic radiation temperature on the disk surfaces is higher than the flue gas temperature at the same axial location, experimentally confirming the previous theoretical and computational results of SRBs. Improved performance of CO and NOx emissions compared with the conventional porous radiant burners also indicates that the SRB is acceptable for practical application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The need to meet future changes in power demand and current environmental regulations are considered the main driving forces for upgrading existing coal-fired power plants. In this context, repowering by gas-turbine integration is a well-established technique to increase power plant capacity and operational flexibility. Non-negligible benefits are also improvements in efficiency and a decrease in greenhouse gases emissions promoted by the shift to low carbon fuels.
This paper aims to investigate the impact of feedwater heater repowering on a 300 MW coal-fired power plant. Marginal efficiency and power increase, as well as the performance of integrated steam-gas power plants, are evaluated by varying the steam section operating conditions and gas turbine technology. Three main cases are investigated, assuming integration with simple or regenerative heavy-duty gas turbines and aeroderivative gas turbines.
As part of this investigation, a performance plane is defined, allowing to compare repowering options based on different steam turbine overloads and boiler modes of operation. Focusing on repowering configurations with the maximum power increase, the analysis also examines the plant capability to follow potential load variations and their impact on energy and economic performance parameters.

Abstract: The present work addresses the coupling of a flamelet database, to a low-Mach approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations using scalar controlling variables. The model is characterized by the chemistry tabulation based on laminar premixed flamelets in combination with an optimal choice of the reaction progress variable, which is determined based on the computational singular perturbation (CSP) method. The formulation of the model focuses on turbulent premixed flames taking into account the effect of heat losses, but it is easily extended to partially premixed and non-premixed regimes. The model is designed for applications in both, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RAMS) as well as large-eddy simulations (LES) and results for the two methods are compared. A priori analysis of the database is presented to demonstrate the influence of the reaction progress definition and the chemistry tabulation is validated against a one-dimensional premixed laminar flame. The validation of the turbulent case is performed using a turbulent premixed confined jet flame subject to strong heat losses, in which the model shows a good overall performance.

Abstract: Fossil fuels are major feedstock for industrial processes in the word. However, processing fossil fuels emits a large amount of CO2 giving a serious environmental impact. Conventional analysis of this impact is to quantify Global Warming Potential by using CO2 equivalent, but not on quantitatively energetic and economic metrics. This cannot measure a real cost of ecological goods and services, e.g. carbon sequestration, biogeochemical cycles, mineral and fossil resources. To address this issue, this paper introduces energetic and economic penalties. They are inspired by circulation of CO2 between industrial and ecological systems and defined as the additional energetic and economic costs for closing the CO2 loop by using ecological goods and services. These additional costs are considered as penalties. The carbon footprint and life cycle exergy/cost rate are applied to model the penalties. These models consider regional condition, for they include some regional ecological factors.
Coal-to-olefins projects in different regions of China are used as case studies. Their energetic and economic penalties are calculated. Results show that olefins productions in Gansu, Ningxia, and Sinkiang suffer from the highest penalties. For economic penalties, they are higher than 2400 RMB/t olefins. Productions in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi have the penalties in middle range, 1235 RMB/t olefins and 1656 RMB/t olefins. Productions in other regions pay much lower penalties, around 1000 RMB/t olefins. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The selection of the most suitable working fluid and cycle configuration for a given heat source is a fundamental step in the search for the optimum design of Organic Rankine Cycles. In this phase cycle efficiency and heat source recovery factor lead to opposite design choices in the achievement of maximum system efficiency and, in turn, maximum power output. In this work, both separate and combined effects of these two performance factors are considered to supply a thorough understanding of the compromise resulting in maximum performance. This goal is pursued by carrying out design optimizations of four different ORC configurations operating with twenty-seven working fluids and recovering heat from sensible heat sources in the temperature range 120-180 degrees C. Optimum working fluids and thermodynamic parameters are those which simultaneously allow high cycle efficiency and high heat recovery from the heat source to be obtained. General guidelines are suggested to reach this target for any system configuration. The distance between fluid critical temperature and inlet temperature of the heat source is found to play a key role in predicting the optimum performance of all system configurations regardless of the inlet temperature of the heat source.

Abstract: An electrical generator has been integrated with a locally produced, biomass-fed clay cooking stove in rural Malawi. The generator produces small amounts of electricity based on the thermoelectric effect. Five demonstrator stoves were deployed into a rural community in the Balaka district for up to 6 months. This study investigates the power generation performance of the devices over the first 80 days of the field trial. It was determined that the users were able to charge mobile phones, lights and radios from the generator stoves. The power generating performance of the stoves deteriorated slightly over the 80 day period. The was due to the effects of thermal cycling on the generator system as a whole which caused eventual drying out of the thermal paste and a loosening of the clamping nuts which reduces clamping pressure and power output. One stove failed due to a mechanical problem. It was found that the power produced significantly exceeded the power consumed in most cases, which indicates an over-supply. It appears that 3 W h is sufficient to meet the average daily electrical power requirements for the participants in this study. The data obtained from the field trial has been used to inform a redesign of the device for a second field trial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The field of energy harvesting holds the promise of making our buildings "smart" if effective energy sources can be developed for use in ambient indoor conditions. Photovoltaics (PV), especially in its thin flexible form for easy integration, become a prime candidate for the aim, if tailored for low-density artificial light.
We designed a test system which enabled us to measure the performance of PV devices under compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and light-emitting diode (LED) illumination at different illuminance levels and compared polycrystalline and amorphous silicon cells with our own flexible dye solar cells (DSCs). Whereas poly-Si cells, with 15% outdoor efficiency, delivered at 200 lux under CFL only 2.8 mu W/cm(2) power density (and an efficiency of 4.4%), a-Si specifically designed for indoors, gave 5.9 mu W/cm(2) and 9.2% efficiency under the same CFL conditions (and 7.5% efficiency under LED).
However, we show that the customization of flexible DSCs, by simply formulating ad-hoc less-concentrated, more transparent electrolytes, enabled these devices to outperform all others, providing average power densities of 8.0 mu W/cm(2) and 12.4% efficiencies under 200 lux CFL (more than quadruple compared to those measured at 1 sun), and 6.6 mu W/cm(2) and 10% efficiency under 200 lux LED illumination.

Abstract: Regenerative High Temperature Air Combustion (RHTAC) technology is composed of circular-ceramic regenerator, burners, small four-way reversing valve and control system. RHTAC technology works by using the regenerator in burners to complete heat exchange between the high-temperature fume exhausted and the combustion air. Based on RHTAC technology, Regenerative Radiant Tube Combustor (RRTC) has been developed, and was adopted by Shenwu Pyrolysis Process (SPP), which is a new pyrolysis technology with the heat-carrier-free rotating bed. SPP was researched and developed to upgrade low-rank coal into the upgraded coal, tar and pyrolyzing gas. Presently, various coals from China and other countries have been conducted, including Lignite and Long flame coal. To understand the function of the RRTCs in SPP, a pilot plant has been constructed and used to investigate the effects of the RRTCs on the fume and pyrolyzer temperature distributions and pyrolyzing products. The results show that low calorific value gas fuel (>700 kcal/Nm(3)) can be used, the heat loss in fume exhausted is low (temp. about 150 degrees C), so thermal efficiency of the RRTC is greatly improved; the RRTCs can realize accurate temperature control and the separation of volatile materials and fume in the pyrolyzer, so as to increase tar yield and improve gas quality. The tar yield is more than 90% of the Gray-King tar yield; the pyrolyzing gas contains high contents of CH4, H-2 and CO. Moreover, SPP could solve some technical problems, such as high dust content in coal tar, likely blockage of pipeline and greatly increasing the subsequent tar processing cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: CO2 capture from combustion processes faces several challenges including high energy penalty, low CO2 partial pressure, high flow rates and presence of water vapours. Absorption of CO2 at high temperature is recently attracting increasingly attention. Alkali metal based sorbents present clear advantages compared to other high temperature sorbents, such as high CO2 capture capacity, lower regeneration temperatures (<750 degrees C) and excellent stability. In this work, Na/Li-silicates prepared by mixing Na/Li carbonates with fly ash (FA) in various molar ratios were evaluated for their capacity to chemisorb CO2 at 500-700 degrees C and in presence of H2O (2-12 vol%), diluted CO2 (14 vol%) and CO2 sorption promoters.
The results indicate that the carbonate:silica ratio used in the sorbents synthesis significantly affects the CO2 sorption capacity and regeneration temperature. The presence of steam enhances the diffusion of Li and Na ions resulting in higher CO2 uptake. CO2 chemisorption follows a double layer mechanism with formation of carbonate layer on the surface. The simultaneous presence of Li and Na (and K when used as additive) in the formed carbonate layer results in an eutectic melt between 600 and 700 degrees C, which facilitates the diffusion of the ionic species. Li-Na-FA with molar ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 was the best prepared sorbent with a capacity of 2.54 mol CO2/kg sorbent (12% H2O, 14% CO2 at 700 degrees C). Absorption/desorption was completed in 15 min with reaction kinetics comparable to that of pure LLISiO4 sorbents. The tested materials maintained their capacity and absorption/desorption rates after 10 cycles at 700 degrees C. Overall, the Na/Li materials showed a CO2 capture capacity, stability over time and sorption-desorption kinetics comparable to those of other high-temperature sorbents, such as Li-FA (Li4SiO4 prepared using fly ash), and higher stability than CaO and hydrotalcites.

Abstract: A low cost Seasonal Solar Soil Heat Storage (SSSHS) system used for greenhouse heating was invented and investigated. With soil heat storage technology, the solar energy stored in soil under greenhouse can be utilized to reduce the energy demand of extreme cold and consecutive overcast weather in winter. Unlike conventional underground heat systems, heat pumps are not needed in this system and so the cost is drastically reduced. After the tests, the system proved that seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) is feasible and can partially solve the solar heat demand and supply imbalance problem between summer and winter. TRNSYS is used to simulate the process and effect of solar energy collection and soil heat storage, and the model is calibrated by operational data in a full season. Energy consumption of the SSSHS system and conventional solar heating system have been compared under the same condition: when the indoor air temperature of the greenhouse is kept above 12 degrees C throughout the year, the energy saving in Shanghai was 27.8 kW h/(m(2) typical greenhouse area year). In the end, the paper discusses the system optimization, including the optimized solar collector area and depth of buried U-pipes, and the results of a pilot test. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, KOH and ZnCl2 were impregnated into sewage sludge as activation agents to produce activated sludge char in the pyrolysis step for the De-NOx process. The emission characteristics of volatile combustion from the pyrolysis of raw sewage sludge (SS-Raw), sewage sludge spiked with KOH (SS-KOH), and sewage sludge spiked with ZnCl2 (SS-ZnCl2) were investigated. In addition, the De-NOx effects and the characteristics of the prepared chars, including specific surface areas, pore distributions, functional groups, were explored. The exploration results showed that the pollutants generated during the volatile combustion process could be divided into primary pollutants (SO2, NO, N2O, and HCl) and minor pollutants (CO, NH3, and HCN). Under the conditions of oxygen-rich combustion, SO2 and NOx emissions from SS-KOH were 0% and 113.2% of those from SS-Raw respectively. SS-ZnCl2 exhibited the similar SO2 and NOx emissions to those of SS-KOH. However, SS-ZnCl2 released considerable HCl during the pyrolysis process, thus limiting its application. Sludge char from SS-KOH (SC-KOH) also exhibited the best De-NOx performance compared to the chars from SS-Raw and SS-ZnCl2 and the De-NOx efficiency was 56% higher than that of sludge char from SS-Raw (SC-Raw). Therefore, with KOH-impregnated SS, activated sludge char can be produced via one pyrolysis step and used in the De-NOx process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Conventionally, compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles are refueled using a high-cost, centralized, and sparse network of CNG fueling stations that has primarily been developed for the use of fleet customers. An engine-integral reciprocating natural gas (NG) compressor has the capability to disrupt the incumbent CNG market by enabling the use of NG for personal transportation, fueled at home, from the preexisting low-pressure NG infrastructure, at low parts count, using conventional components, and therefore at low incremental costs. The principal objective of this paper is therefore to describe and analyze the dynamic and thermal design considerations for an automotive engine-integral reciprocating NG compressor. The purpose of this compressor is to pressurize storage tanks in NG vehicles from a low-pressure NG source by using one of the engine cylinders as a multi-stage reciprocating compressor. The engine-integral compressor is developed by making changes to a 5.9 l displacement diesel-cycle automotive engine. In this novel design and implementation, a small tank and its requisite valving are added to the engine as an intermediate gas storage system to enable a single compressor cylinder to perform two-stage compression. The resulting maximum pressure in the storage tank is 250 MPa, equivalent to the storage and delivery pressure of conventional CNG delivery systems. Dynamic simulation results show that the high cylinder pressures required for the compression process create reaction torques on the crankshaft, but do not generate abnormal rotational speed oscillations. Thermal simulation results show that the temperature of the storage tank and engine increases over the safety temperature of the natural gas storage system unless an active thermal management system is developed to cool the NG before it is admitted to the storage tanks.

Abstract: The intermittent nature of renewable energy has been discussed in the context of the operational challenges that it brings to electrical grid reliability. Demand side management (DSM) with its ability to allow customers to adjust electricity consumption in response to market signals has often been recognized as an efficient way to mitigate the variable effects of renewable energy as well as to increase system efficiency and reduce system costs. However, the academic & industrial literature have taken divergent approaches to DSM implementation. While the popular approach among academia adopts a social welfare maximization formulation, the industrial practice compensates customers according to their load reduction from a predefined electricity consumption baseline that would have occurred without DSM. This paper rigorously compares these two different approaches in a day-ahead wholesale market context analytically and in a test case using the same system configuration and mathematical formalism. The comparison of the two models showed that a proper reconciliation of the two models might make them mitigate the stochastic netload in fundamentally the same way, but only under very specific conditions which are rarely met in practice. While the social welfare model uses a stochastic net load composed of two terms, the industrial DSM model uses a stochastic net load composed of three terms including the additional baseline term. DSM participants are likely to manipulate the baseline in order to receive greater financial compensation. An artificially inflated baseline is shown to result in a different resources dispatch, high system costs, and unachievable social welfare, and likely requires more control activity in subsequent layers of enterprise control.

Abstract: The use of wind energy for power electric systems attempts to reduce the dependence on fuel-based energy. With the aim of generating electrical power based on wind energy, it becomes necessary to model and predict wind speed. Wind speed observations are packed with outliers what makes it difficult to propose accurate predictors. This paper presents an experimental comparison of three different methods for making a Kalman filter robust to outliers in the context of one-step-ahead wind speed prediction. Two wind speed databases were used to test the predictive performance of the algorithms. The performance for all the methods is measured in terms of skewness and kurtosis for the predicted signal. The algorithms discussed worked efficiently in a sequential approach, and outperformed the standard Kalman filter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this article, an experimental investigation is carried out to examine the heat transfer characteristics of a coil type solar dish receiver under actual concentrate solar radiation conditions. During the test, the concentrated solar flux is approximately 1000 kW/m(2) at aperture. The solar irradiance is almost unchanged (650 W/m(2)) for continuous two hours in the afternoon, which is used to analyze the energy and exergy performance of the solar receiver. Experimental results show that, the efficiency of the solar receiver is normally above 70% with the highest efficiency of 82%, whereas at steady state, the efficiency is maintained at around 80%. A very low value of the heat loss factor (0.02 kW/K) could be achieved during the current steady state operating conditions. The highest value of the exergy rate is around 8.8 kW, whereas the maximum energy rate can reach 21.3 kW. In addition, the highest exergy efficiency is approximately 28%, and the highest energy efficiency is around 82%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To dissociate carbon dioxide (CO2) using solar energy, a novel photo-thermochemical cycle combining photochemistry with thermochemistry is proposed in this paper. After illuminating titanium dioxide (TiO2) in a helium (He) atmosphere by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, CO2 was input and converted to carbon monoxide (CO) under heating in an enclosed cavity. To determine the optimal heating temperature, sets of four consecutive cycles were performed at temperatures from 573 K to 873 K. The preferred temperature was found to be 773 K. CO was stably produced in five successive cycles at 773 K, demonstrating the method's possibility. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to assess the crystal structure and morphology. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence (PL) analyses were also conducted to investigate the charge transfer and reaction mechanisms on the TiO2 surface. Finally, a charge transfer mechanism is tentatively proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Increasing emissions from road transportation endanger China's objective to reduce national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The unconstrained growth of vehicle GHG emissions are mainly caused by the insufficient improvement of energy efficiency (kilometers traveled per unit energy use) under current policies, which cannot offset the explosion of vehicle activity in China, especially the major southern provinces. More stringent polices are required to decline GHG emissions in these provinces, and thereby help to constrain national total emissions. In this work, we make a provincial-level projection for vehicle growth, energy demand and GHG emissions to evaluate vehicle GHG emission trends under various policy options in China and determine the way to constrain national emissions. Through sensitivity analysis of various single policies, we propose an integrated policy set to assure the objective of peak national vehicle GHG emissions be achieved around 2030. The integrated policy involves decreasing the use of urban light-duty vehicles by 25%, improving fuel economy by 25% by 2035 comparing 2020, and promoting electric vehicles and biofuels. The stringent new policies would allow China to constrain GHG emissions from road transport sector around 2030. This work provides a perspective to understand vehicle GHG emission growth patterns in China's provinces, and proposes a strong policy combination to constrain national GHG emissions, which can support the achievement of peak GHG emissions by 2030 promised by the Chinese government.

Abstract: Smartening and restructuring of power industry lead to introduction of new energy resources in both supply and demand sides of energy sectors. In this regard, energy storage systems (ESSs) are appropriate alternatives for reducing the utilization of current declining non-renewable energy resources. Consequently, it is essential to consider various aspects of ESS application and face its related implementation challenges. This paper investigates the simulation of ESSs in long-term power system studies and proposes two long-term chronological load modeling methods. At first, a review of current load modeling methods in long-term studies including ESSs is provided and then two new load modeling methods are proposed. The proposed models are implemented in a typical unit commitment problem and solved for IEEE reliability test system (RTS) and IEEE 118-bus test system. Finally, a comparative study among examined load modeling methods is presented. The key feature of the proposed load models is that they are able to provide a tradeoff between computational burden and model accuracy in terms of calculating the desired requirements of the system planner.

Abstract: Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming one of the prominent clean energy sources with its abundance, high calorific value, and low emission and price. Vapors generated from LNG due to heat leak are called boil-off gas (BOG). As world-wide LNG productions are in an increasingly growth, BOG generation and handling problems become more critical subject to more intense global competitions and stricter environmental regulations. In this study, typical C3-MR process, storage facilities, and loading facilities are modeled and simulated to study BOG generation at LNG exporting terminals, including LNG processing, storage, and berth loading areas. Factors causing BOG are presented, and quantities of BOG generated due to each factor at each location are calculated under different LNG temperatures. Various strategies to minimize, recover, and reuse BOG are also studied for their feasibility and energy requirements. The study would help proper handling of BOG problems in terms of minimizing flaring at LNG exporting terminals, and thus reducing waste, saving energy, and protecting surrounding environments.

Abstract: This paper describes a new method to predict emissions in internal combustion (IC) engines. The method couples a multi-dimensional engine modeling program with pre-integrated non-equilibrium chemical kinetics reaction results. Prior to engine simulation, detailed chemical kinetics reactions of air/fuel mixture at different temperatures, pressures, and compositions, are calculated using SENKIN, a subprogram in the CHEMKIN-II computer package. The reaction results are decoupled from their chemical eigenvalue (order of about 10(-10) s), then integrated and saved in physical time scale (order of about 10(-5) s) in a database file. In the database reaction results of different initial conditions (temperature, pressure, and species composition) are stored in different zones; the zones are indexed using their respective reaction conditions. Fluid dynamics and thermal dynamics of the movement of piston and valves, and spray droplets interaction are simulated by KIVA-3 V. Instead of calculating directly the non-equilibrium chemical reactions of the air/fuel mixture, reaction results are obtained from the database file via an interpolating subroutine, which returns temperature, heat release, and species concentrations after reaction to the main program. The approach avoids direct time consuming calculation of detailed chemical reactions as well as the errors introduced by coupling the physical and chemical processes. Emissions are predicted accurately since reaction of air/fuel mixture is calculated using the detailed chemical kinetics mechanism. The approach is applied to model a Caterpillar 3401 direct injection compression ignition (CI) diesel engine. In addition we carried out experimental tests on a Toledo 1500 SI gasoline engine, and those results are compared with the proposed computational approach. In all cases the predicted results agree well with the experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The objective of this work is to assess the exergoeconomic performance of three biomass upgrading processes, namely wood pellets, torrefied wood pellets and pyrolysis slurry (a mixture of pyrolysis char and oil), integrated with a municipal combined heat and power plant. The work is a continuation of work published earlier (Kohl et al., 2013) and the same simulation model results are used as input for the calculation of the exergy flows within the system. Economic data of the assessed processes has been obtained from the literature and has been combined with the exergy data following the specific exergy costing approach in order to perform the exergoeconomic analysis. The highest exergy destruction is caused in the combustion equipment, whereas the upgrading processes appear highly efficient. The systems' exergetic efficiency can be improved by 22%, 26% and 31% for the integration with pyrolysis slurry, torrefied wood pellets and wood pellets, respectively, making wood pellets the most efficient integration option. However, the integration of pyrolysis slurry production yields the highest profit under the projected price scenario. In addition it also reacts moderately on possible price fluctuations as is shown in a sensitivity analysis. Considering the generally acknowledged future technical potential of pyrolysis products for replacing fossil oil-based products transport fuel production as well as the commonly expected further price increase for fossil oil, pyrolysis slurry constitutes as the best option to be integrated with the municipal combined heat and power plant.

Abstract: Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been widely used for wind resource assessment. Model runs with higher spatial resolution are generally more accurate, yet extremely computational expensive. An alternative approach is to use data generated by a low resolution NWP model, in conjunction with statistical methods. In order to analyze the accuracy and computational efficiency of different types of NWP-based wind resource assessment methods, this paper performs a comparison of three deterministic and probabilistic NWP-based wind resource assessment methodologies: (i) a coarse resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.67 degrees) global reanalysis data set, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA); (ii) an analog ensemble methodology based on the MERRA, which provides both deterministic and probabilistic predictions; and (iii) a fine resolution (2-km) NWP data set, the Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit, based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Results show that: (i) as expected, the analog ensemble and WIND Toolkit perform significantly better than MERRA confirming their ability to downscale coarse estimates; (ii) the analog ensemble provides the best estimate of the multi-year wind distribution at seven of the nine sites, while the WIND Toolkit is the best at one site; (iii) the WIND Toolkit is more accurate in estimating the distribution of hourly wind speed differences, which characterizes the wind variability, at five of the available sites, with the analog ensemble being best at the remaining four locations; and (iv) the analog ensemble computational cost is negligible, whereas the WIND Toolkit requires large computational resources. Future efforts could focus on the combination of the analog ensemble with intermediate resolution (e.g., 10-45 kin) NWP estimates, to considerably reduce the computational burden, while providing accurate deterministic estimates and reliable probabilistic assessments.

Abstract: CO2 capture could contribute to a reduction of CO2 emissions by decreasing CO2 concentrations in flue gas streams of fossil fuelled power plants. State of the art technology for CO2 capture is reactive absorption using monoethanolamine (MEA) as a solvent, which requires a high energy demand for solvent regeneration in a continuous process. This study investigated the ability of the biocatalyst carbonic anhydrase, to significantly increase the absorption rate when combined with reactive solvents. Based on laboratory scale experiments the proof of chemical capability was evaluated for different solvents. CO2 absorption rates of 30 wt% MEA, 30 wt.% N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), 30 wt.% diethylethanolamine (DEEA) and 10 wt.% potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were measured with the addition of carbonic anhydrase (0.2 wt.%). Aqueous solutions of 30 wt.% MDEA as well as 30 wt.% K2CO3 were identified as promising solvents whose CO2 absorption rate was accelerated by the enzyme, as the addition of 0.2 wt.% carbonic anhydrase led to an increase of the absorbed mole flow by a factor > 4. Next, the technical feasibility of the enzyme-solvent concept was tested in packed columns to check for transferability of laboratory scale performance to pilot scale (diameter: 56 mm, height: 2.3 m, Sulzer BX gauze packing). The increase of the absorbed mole flow in pilot scale in the presence of biocatalyst was in good accordance with the laboratory scale experiments. No undesired effects such as foaming or aggregation were observed. Subsequently, mass transfer parameter determination was performed for enzyme-solvent combinations in a wetted wall column. Together, the data presented in this study enables for the first time, the application of rigorous models for conceptual process design for biocatalyst-accelerated CO2 capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents the off-design performance analysis of an organic Rankine cycle system in the view of control strategies. Variable inlet guide vanes and evaporating pressure are considered as control variables to adapt the system to the variable geothermal fluid mass flow rate and temperature. The optimal control strategy is studied to maximize the net power under the given geothermal source conditions. The constant pressure operation, the sliding pressure operation and the optimal control strategy are compared in order to analyze their differences. The results indicate that the constant pressure operation with variable inlet guide vanes generates more net power than the sliding pressure operation when the geothermal fluid mass flow rate is relative low. The optimal control strategy is determined by the off-design performance of evaporator and turbine. With fixed geothermal fluid temperature and variable geothermal fluid mass flow rate, the potential increase of the net power under the optimal operation can reach 4.7% and 11.0% for the constant and sliding pressure operation, respectively. When the geothermal fluid temperature decreases, the curve of net power tends to shift to the direction of larger geothermal fluid mass flow rate in all control strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The low prices in the European Emission Trading System (EU ETS) have triggered discussions of various possible reforms. One option is to decouple the CO2 prices from renewable energy policy by adjusting the emission cap to renewable energy investment overshoots. We introduce two ways of reducing the CO2 cap in response to overshoots of renewable policy investment over previously announced targets. We investigate these options with the agent-based model EMLab-generation. We find that both policy implementations are successful in restoring prices. They also ensure that making public investments that exceed policy targets contribute to carbon emission reduction, and that renewable policy does not benefit the most emission-intensive power plants. However, neither policy is suitable for achieving specifc levels of prices or price volatility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The increasing supply of fluctuating power from renewable sources not only in Germany requires improved capability for part load operation of conventional power plants in combination with electricity storage solutions to ensure the security of electricity supply.
Different operational concepts are introduced to link a base load lignite-fired power plant with a small sized coal gasification and synthesis unit (annex unit). The annex unit comprises coal gasification, water electrolysis (optional), gas treatment and subsequent synthesis of storable fuels or chemicals (SNG, methanol). This unit is a power sink and chemical energy storage in times of renewable excess electricity, which reduces the overall net power output to the grid and lifetime-consuming start-ups and shutdowns of the power plant. In addition, the annex unit can also provide peak load in line with the actual demand. The concepts are modeled and evaluated regarding efficiency, CO2 emissions and the ability to reduce the minimal load of the total plant.
The study was performed for an annex unit with 500 MW(th) gasifier linked to a 2264 MW(th) power plant. As a result, the annex concept with an additional 150 MW(el) electrolysis unit can reduce the power output to the grid from 50% minimal load to 33-34% during "electricity storage" and can increase the power output to the grid from 100% nominal load to 152-154% during "peak load generation". The improved flexibility of the annex concepts is accompanied by a reduction of the total efficiency (power plant and annex with re-combustion of the produced fuel) and a subsequent rise of the specific CO2 emissions. Thermal efficiencies of annex concepts without electrolysis result in 63.1% for SNG and 55.5% for methanol.
The capital expenditure of an annex unit (without electrolysis) is 21% lower than for an equally sized stand-alone unit because of taking advantage of the shared infrastructure of the coupled power plant.
Despite the growing share of green power there will be a significant demand for base load. The introduced annex concepts can contribute to flexibility and economics of existing conventional coal-fired power plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Inherent in large-scale photovoltaic (PV) investments is volatility that stems from a unique set of spatial factors, such as shading, building orientation, and roof slope, which can significantly affect both the level of risk and the return on investment. In order to systematically assess and manage the volatility, this study seeks to create a quantitative decision-support model: Portfolio Analysis for Community-based PV Investment Model (PACPIM). Focusing on residential PV systems, PACPIM determines optimized portfolios by applying the Mean Variance Portfolio theory. The model is intended to play an instrumental role in: (1) maximizing the hourly electricity output of PV systems; (2) minimizing the hourly volatility in electricity output; and (3) optimizing the risk-adjusted performance of community-based PV investment. The application and framework of PACPIM were deployed with an actual residential community consisting of 24 houses and their simulated data utilizing PVWatts (R) for estimating hourly electricity production. Results reveal that the optimized portfolios developed by PACPIM (1) increased annual electricity output of PV systems by 4.6%; (2) reduced the volatility in electricity output by 4.3%; and (3) offered the highest risk-adjusted performance among all possible portfolios based on the Sharpe ratios. This study is expected to effectively assist project owners and investors in systematically assessing their community-based PV projects and in developing optimized investment strategies.

Abstract: For two variants of a supercritical coal-fired combined heat and power plant a thermodynamic, economic and risk analyses were carried out. The first variant consists of a unit working without realization of CO2 capture process. The second one is the unit integrated with a chemical absorption CO2 capture installation. In this variant the heat required for the desorption process is supplied with steam extracted from the steam turbine. The developed model of the CHP plant allowed to obtain main operation characteristics for annual change of load. For the two analyzed variants the characteristics of the amount of produced electricity (gross and net), generated heat and consumed chemical energy of fuel, as a function of the cogeneration unit operation time per year, were determined. In the next stage of calculations these characteristics were required to carry out the economic and risk analysis. Economic performances were evaluated in terms of the break-even price of electricity. The performed analysis proves that both investment projects will achieve the same economic effect, i.e. 85.26 (sic)/MW h, if the price of emissions allowances reaches the value of 47.88 (sic)/MgCO2. In this case, the potentially better variant of the system may be indicated based on the result of the risk analysis. In order to perform the risk analysis the main technical and economic risk factors concerning implementation of this technology were identified. The risk analysis was conducted with the use of Monte Carlo method. Based on the determined cumulative probability curves of obtaining specified values of the break-even price of electricity, it was possible to obtain values for defined in the paper indices of the investment risk assessment. The results of risk analysis are presented and discussed in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To enhance prediction accuracy and reduce computation complexity, a decomposition-ensemble methodology with data-characteristic-driven reconstruction is proposed for crude oil price forecasting, based on two promising principles of "divide and conquer" and "data-characteristic-driven modeling". Actually, this proposed model improves the existing decomposition-ensemble techniques in the "divide and conquer" framework, by formulating and incorporating a data-characteristic-driven reconstruction method based on the "data-characteristic-driven modeling". Four main steps are involved in the proposed methodology, i.e., data decomposition for simplifying the complex data, component reconstruction based on the "data-characteristic-driven modeling" for capturing inner factors and reducing computational cost, individual prediction for each reconstructed component via a certain artificial intelligence (AI) tool, and ensemble prediction for final output. In the proposed data-characteristic-driven reconstruction, all decomposed modes are thoroughly analyzed to explore the hidden data characteristics, and are accordingly reconstructed into some meaningful components. For illustration and verification, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil spot prices are used as the sample data, and the empirical results indicate that the proposed model statistically outperforms all considered benchmark models (including popular AI single models, typical decomposition-ensemble models without reconstruction, and similar decomposition-ensemble models with other existing reconstruction methods), since it has higher prediction accuracy and less computational time.

Abstract: Utilizing catalysts in micro burners is an excellent possible solution to help stabilize fuel combustion. To increase the effective area for catalyst deposition and enhance the catalytic effect, it is proposed in this paper that metal foam is used for preparation of monolithic catalysts. To prove its feasibility, the 4.8 wt.% and 3.2 wt.% Pd/Al2O3/Fe-Ni metal foams (Foam I and II) were prepared through a series of treatment of coating and impregnation. The catalytic performance of both the metal foam based monoliths for methane catalytic oxidation was tested in a catalytic reaction test system. The results showed that Foam I exhibited higher catalytic activity at low reaction temperature. The reaction temperature and flow rate of reactant mixture play an important role in the activity of the catalysts. The results also disclosed that methane concentration has a weak impact on the catalytic activity, which means that the metal foams based monolith catalysts developed in this paper are effective in a wide range of fuel-air ratios.

Abstract: In this paper, results of a thermodynamic analysis using the entropy generation minimisation method for a parabolic trough receiver tube making use of a synthetic oil-Al2O3 nanofluid as a heat transfer fluid are presented. A parabolic trough collector system with a rim angle of 80 and a concentration ratio of 86 was used. The temperature of the nanofluid considered was in the range of 350-600 K. The nanofluid thermal physical properties are temperature dependent. The Reynolds number varies from 3560 to 1,151,000, depending on the temperature considered and volume fraction of nanoparticles in the base fluid. Nanoparticle volume fractions in the range 0 <= phi <= 8% were used. The local entropy generation rates due to fluid flow and heat transfer were determined numerically and used for the thermodynamic analysis. The study shows that using nanofluids improves the thermal efficiency of the receiver by up to 7.6%. There is an optimal Reynolds number at each inlet temperature and volume fraction for which the entropy generated is a minimum. The optimal Reynolds number decreases as the volume fraction increases. There is also a Reynolds number at every inlet temperature and volume fraction beyond which use of nanofluids is thermodynamically undesirable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To operate fuel cells effectively in low-oxygen environments, such as in submarines and unmanned underwater vehicles, a hydrogen source with high hydrogen storage density is required. In this paper, diesel autothermal reforming (ATR) with hydrogen peroxide as an alternative oxidant is proposed as a hydrogen production method. Diesel fuel has higher hydrogen density than metal hydrides or other hydrocarbons. In addition, hydrogen peroxide can decompose into steam and oxygen, which are required for diesel ATR. Moreover, both diesel fuel and hydrogen peroxide are liquid states, enabling easy storage for submarine applications. Hydrogen peroxide exhibited the same characteristics as steam and oxygen when used as an oxidant in diesel reforming when pre-decomposition method was used. The thermodynamically calculated operating conditions were a steam-to-carbon ratio (SCR) of 3.0, an oxygen-to-carbon ratio (OCR) of 0.5, and temperatures below 700 degrees C to account for safety issues associated with hydrogen peroxide use and exothermic reactions. Catalytic activity and stability tests over Ni-Ru (19.5-0.5 wt.%)/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-x were conducted using various diesel compounds. Furthermore, long-term diesel ATR tests were conducted for 200 h using Korean commercial diesel. The degradation rate was 3.67%/100 h without the production of ethylene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: CaO-based materials are promising sorbents for CO2 capture via carbonate looping for high temperature applications, which however suffer from decreasing sorption capacity over multiple sorption/desorption cycles. In this study, we report the development of mixed CaO-based CO2 sorbents with inert structural promoters prepared via sol-gel auto-combustion that exhibit significant stability increase. Different synthesis parameters such as the organic material used as combustion agent, the inert material used as stabilizer and the CaO concentration in the sorbent were investigated. Citric acid was identified as the most suitable combustion agent, resulting in the formation of calcium oxide with the highest initial sorption capacity. Among the four different promoters used to increase the resistance of CaO toward sintering, Al2O3 and ZrO2 resulted in the most stable sorbents due to formation of the mixed phases Ca3Al2O6 and CaZrO3. The two sorbents exhibited a very stable performance with a sorption capacity higher than 9 mol of CO2/kg of sorbent after 100 cycles under mild operating conditions (calcination at 850 degrees C under pure N-2 flow). On the other hand Ca-Mg and Ca-La demonstrated a significant decay of sorption capacity with more than 30% deactivation after 100 and 70 cycles respectively. Under severe but more realistic conditions (calcination at 950 degrees C under pure CO2 flow), the mixed CaO-Al2O3 sorbent still retained similar to 42% of its initial sorption capacity, corresponding to 4.8 mol of CO2/kg of sorbent, while CaO-ZrO2 exhibited a remarkable stability, maintaining sorption capacity of 8.5 mol of CO2/kg of sorbent after 100 cycles.

Abstract: This paper reports the results of a numerical optimization and experimental investigation of phase change material (PCM) based composite pin fin matrix heat sink. The main objective of this study is to determine the optimized configuration of the matrix type heat sink that will stretch the operation time during the heating cycle and minimize the time during the discharging cycle. The PCM used is n-eicosane. The heat sink is made of aluminium. A constant heat flux of 1.9 kW/m(2) is applied at the bottom of the heat sink. The numerical results were matched up with the experimental results to determine the overall heat transfer coefficient with the help of commercially available ANSYS FLUENT 14.0 software. For constant power level and constant volume of the PCM, 40 different geometrical configurations of heat sinks were considered and temperature time histories were obtained for both the charging and discharging cycles by using full three dimensional simulations of flow and conjugate heat transfer including phase change using FLUENT 14.0. The output of these simulations was given as an input to a neural network and a multi objective optimization was carried out to determine the optimum configuration of the heat sink, that maximizes the charging period and minimizes the discharging period simultaneously.

Abstract: We analyze the impacts of future scenarios of electric vehicles (EVs) on the German power system, drawing on different assumptions on the charging mode. We find that the impact on the load duration curve strongly differs between charging modes. In a fully user-driven mode, charging largely occurs during daytime and in the evening, when power demand is already high. User-driven charging may thus have to be restricted because of generation adequacy concerns. In contrast, cost-driven charging is carried out during night-time and at times of high PV availability. Using a novel model formulation that allows for simulating intermediate charging modes, we show that even a slight relaxation of fully user-driven charging results in much smoother load profiles. Further, cost-driven EV charging strongly increases the utilization of hard coal and lignite plants in 2030, whereas additional power in the user-driven mode is predominantly generated from natural gas and hard coal. Specific CO2 emissions of EVs are substantially higher than those of the overall power system, and highest under cost-driven charging. Only in additional model runs, in which we link the introduction of EVs to a respective deployment of additional renewables, electric vehicles become largely CO2-neutral. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Colorless Distributed Combustion (CDC) has shown ultra-low emissions and enhanced performance of simulated gas turbine combustors. To achieve distributed combustion, the flowfield must be tailored for desirable mixture preparation within the combustor prior to mixture ignition. Though CDC have been extensively studied using a variety of geometries, heat release intensities, and fuels, the role of internally recirculated hot reactive gases needs to be further investigated and quantified to obtain the minimum requirement of internal entrainment for achieving distributed reaction condition. In this paper, the impact of internal entrainment of product gases on flame structure and behavior is investigated with focus on fostering distributed combustion and to provide guidelines for seeking distributed combustion. To simulate the recirculated gases from within the combustor, a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide is introduced to the air stream prior to mixing with fuel and combustion. Increase in the amounts of nitrogen and carbon dioxide (simulating increased recirculation) increased the reaction volume to occupy larger volume with an overall enhanced and uniform distribution as revealed from the OH* chemiluminescence intensity. At the same time, the bluish flame is replaced with a more uniform almost invisible bluish flame. The increased recirculation also decreased the NO emission significantly for the same amount of fuel burned. Lowering oxygen concentration from 21% to 15% (due to increased recirculation) resulted in 80-90% reduction in NO with no impact on CO emission with sub PPM NO emission achieved at an equivalence ratio of 0.7. The same trend was demonstrated for a range of recirculated gases temperature. The reaction distribution was significantly enhanced with ultra-low emissions for oxygen concentration lower than 16% setting a minimum recirculation requirement for distributed combustion.

Abstract: A new ternary chloride salt mixture, named SYSU-4, was developed composed of NaCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2 to meet the needs of solar energy storage over 550 degrees C. The eutectic point and composition of SYSU-4 was predicted from the calculated phase diagram and also validated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). SYSU-4 was prepared experimentally by static melting method and its thermo-physical properties including heat capacity, density and viscosity at high temperature were measured, which were determined by DSC, Archimedes and vibration-rotation methods, respectively. According to the calculated ternary phase diagram, the lowest eutectic temperature was 424.05 degrees C, in good agreement with experimental results of 424 degrees C measured by DSC. Heat capacity of SYSU-C4 was averaged as 0.83 and 1.19 J/g K for solid and liquid phase, respectively referred to sapphire standard material. Density of SYSU-C4 decreased linearly from 2.5 g/cm(3) to 1.9 g/cm(3) with the increase of temperature from 500 to 750 degrees C. Viscosity of SYSU-C4 also decreased from 4.0 cp to 3.0 cp as the temperature increased. Negligible changes on the melting and freezing points of SYSU-C4 in 50 thermal cycles at 370-550 degrees C indicates excellent thermal cycling stability. Moreover, the thermal stability of SYSU-C4 was excellent under 700 degrees C. The developed ternary chloride salt mixture SYSU-4 can be a promising eutectic mixture for high-temperature solar thermal energy storage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The expansion of Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) practices is mainly driven by the viability of SRC wood as an alternative to other renewable and non-renewable fuels in energy production, but also to the capacity of increasing biodiversity and the supply of ecosystem services locally. To delve into these environmental synergies and possible trade-offs, the Life Cycle Assessment method was applied to seven SRC experimental sites recently implemented in Flanders (Belgium). These have differing land use objectives and, thus, present different species proportions and plantation density. For instance, most sites are either planted with willow and poplar clones, or with a mix of the two with local tree species in order to activate temporary unused industrial lands or enhance the local ecosystem functionality. A regular 3 to 7-year rotation was simulated up to year 2033 using CO2FIX given that trees were yet to be harvested at the time of the assessment. Yields were first estimated over time: SRC systems composed by mixed species presented the highest productivity and also the best environmental performance profiles. Overall, the highest environmental impacts were due to consumption of diesel during the cyclic harvests, but also to fertilization activities. Uncertainty distribution ranges were determined for the most critical parameters and a Monte Carlo analysis was performed to obtain average impact scores with variability ranges. While replacing hardwood with wood from SRC chips was not found to be advantageous because of e.g. larger metal, fossil and ozone depletion potentials, benefits were observed for land use reduction and climate change mitigation. Due to frequent rotations, the beneficial trends for the latter seem sufficient to compensate the negative effects of the other impacts on human health and ecosystems quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Surface active agent (SAA) was used to improve nanomaterial dispersion during preparation process of carbonate salt/nanomaterial composite phase change material (CPCM) by solution evaporation method. In order to investigate the effects of SAA on CPCM thermal performance, three kinds of PCM samples were prepared and their thermal performances were characterized. The results show that nanomaterial dispersion greatly affects CPCM thermal performance. For CPCM without SAA, its thermal performance is weakened instead of enhanced due to nanomaterial aggregation and the weakening phenomenon is more obvious when nanomaterial has larger specific surface area. SAA decomposes during high temperature CPCM working process. And the effect of SAA on CPCM thermal performance has duality: on the positive side, SAA can improve nanomaterial dispersion and enhance CPCM thermal performance; on the negative side, SAA decomposition products may weaken CPCM thermal performance. So, SAA and its mass fraction should be carefully selected. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a better SAA for high temperature nano-CPCM and a high mass ratio of SDS to nanomaterial is recommended. With mass ratio of SAA to nanomaterial 10:1, PCM thermal conductivity can be enhanced up to 58.75% by adding 1 wt.% multi-walled carbon nanotubes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In various research studies, ethanol blended fuels have shown reduced particulate matter (PM) emissions in comparison to gasoline and its surrogate fuels in direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engines. However, there are also studies reporting increased particulate concentration for fuels with low ethanol content. In this work the mixture formation and sooting combustion behavior of isooctane and the mixture E20 (20 vol% of ethanol in isooctane) is analyzed for catalyst heating operation. These operating conditions are critical as they strongly contribute to overall soot emissions in driving cycles. Simultaneous high speed imaging of OH*-chemiluminescence and natural soot luminosity measurements are performed in combination with primary particle concentration measurements using a laser induced incandescence (LII) sensor in the engine exhaust duct. At these operating conditions E20 exhibits a higher sooting tendency as compared to isooctane. In order to identify the reason for increased soot formation, the mixture formation process is analyzed by planar laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. The results show that soot was formed in fuel rich regions with incomplete evaporated fuel droplets remaining from the injection event. A different evaporation process of E20 fuel spray and mixing behavior is indicated showing a more compact rich mixture cloud with surrounding lean areas near the spark plug region. This mixture stratification is characterized by higher cyclic variations and constitutes a significant source of soot formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: It has been globally recognized that the harvesting of renewable energy is of considerable importance for the achievement of sustainable development. As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the shortage of indigenous fossil sources has inevitably resulted in excessive dependence on external energy sources. Nevertheless, in consideration of the reduction of fossil fuel reserves, as well as the impact on the environment of fossil fuel uses, the exploration of usable renewable energy sources becomes increasingly important for Hong Kong's long-term development. Based on 6-year wind observations from three meteorological stations at three islands in Hong Kong, this study provides a statistical assessment of the wind characteristics and wind energy potential at offshore locations surrounding Hong Kong. The Weibull distribution function was applied to estimate the Weibull parameters which can be used to facilitate the evaluation of offshore wind energy potential. The variation of the mean wind speed, the Weibull parameters and the wind power density were established under various timescales. Significant yearly, seasonal and monthly variations of the Weibull parameters were observed, while the diurnal variation was relatively small. The veracity of the Weibull distribution model to represent offshore wind data was examined, and it was shown that the Weibull model gave an adequate description of the frequencies of actual wind data. Finally, the total wind power capacities at the three potential offshore wind farm locations were derived, which indicated that the Southeastern waters are the most promising locations for offshore wind farm development in Hong Kong.

Abstract: An oven has been commonly employed to cure powder painted on metal parts for an air-conditioning production. There are many options to improve efficiency in fuel use for the paint curing oven; however some options need deep understanding to prove the possibility of thermal performance. In this work, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling and simulation have been applied to study the temperature distribution and the flow pattern in the paint curing oven on a large scale. The CFD model has been validated against real data. The validated CFD model is used to investigate the temperature distribution and the flow pattern for two proposed options: eliminating stored heat and rearranging airflow. Results demonstrate that both cases provide temperature increase of 1.9 and 1.3 degrees C for air compared to the present paint curing oven. It can be concluded that the two proposed options are applicable for further implementation to the present paint curing oven. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Exergy or availability is an accurate metric related to quality of energy and it is used to determine sustainability of an energy system. Exergy has been extensively used to evaluate efficiency of energy systems and energy conversion processes. An exergy model for a building is presented in this study. In this paper, exergy destruction, which indicates the loss of work potential, is formulated as a function of physical parameters of the building model and environment. To minimize exergy destruction in an Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system, we develop model predictive control (MPC) technique using the exergy model. Comparing to a traditional on-off controller for the building, the proposed exergy-based MPC (XMPC) reduces the exergy destruction and energy consumption up to 22% and 36%, respectively. Simulation results also indicate the advantage of XMPC over conventional energy-based MPC (EMPC). The results show that XMPC reduces exergy destruction by 4% compared to EMPC as well as saving 12% more energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the possible layout configurations of hybrid power plants based on the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and gas turbine (GT) technologies. SOFC/GT power plants have been investigated by using a plurality of approaches, such as: numerical simulations, experimental analyses, and thermo-economic optimizations. The majority of SOFC/GT hybrid systems are fed by methane, which is much cheaper and easier to manage than hydrogen. In fact, SOFC/GT systems use the capability of the fuel cell to internally perform the reforming process required to convert methane into hydrogen. The steam required to drive the reforming reaction can be supplied by the anode recirculated stream. Alternatively, such steam can be produced externally, by using the heat of the exhaust gases. In this case, steam can be used also for thermal purposes and/or for further system hybridization (e.g. Cheng cycle). The majority of the SOFC/GT power plants analyzed in literature are based on the pressurized arrangement, potentially able to ensure lower capital costs and higher efficiencies. Conversely, atmospheric plants are easier to manage, due to the possibility of operate the SOFC and the GT independently one of each other. The paper also investigates more complex SOFC/GT configurations, including: HAT turbines, IGCC SOFC/GT power plants, ORC cycles, etc. A detailed analysis of the SOFC/GT control strategies and part-load performance analyses is also presented, showing that such systems reach their best performance at nominal capacity, and are affected by significant reduction of the electrical efficiency in case of large variations of the load. Finally, the paper also presents a review of hybrid SOFC/GT power plants fed by alternative fuels, such as coal and biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) have high energy efficiency and low pollutant and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This study examines the economic competitiveness of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the Chinese market. BEVs are compared with ICEVs using benefit-cost analyses from the perspectives of consumers, society and GHG emissions. A life-cycle cost model is developed to evaluate the lifetime cost of a vehicle. The results show that, with central government subsidies, the BEV life-cycle private cost (LCPC) is about 1.4 times higher than comparable ICEVs. Central government subsidies on BEVs will not be cost effective and efficient unless the annual external cost reduction from using BEV reaches $2500 for a compact vehicle or $3600 for a multi-purpose vehicle. That total cost level would imply a carbon cost of more than $2100 per ton. The current life-cycle external cost reductions from using BEV are around $2000 $2300, which are smaller than government subsidies or LCPC differences between BEV and ICEV. Further projections show that BEVs likely will not be economically competitive in the Chinese market before 2031. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Heat pumps are widely recognized as a key technology to reduce CO2 emissions in the residential building sector, especially when the electricity-generation system is to decarbonize by means of large-scale introduction of renewable electric power generation sources. If heat pumps would be installed in large numbers in the future, the question arises whether all building types show equal benefits and thus should be given the same priority for deployment. This paper aims at answering this question by determining the CO2-abatement cost of installing a heat pump instead of a condensing gas boiler for residential space heating and domestic hot-water production. The electricity system, as well as the building types, are based on a possible future Belgian setting in 2030 with high RES penetration at the electricity-generation side. The added value of this work compared to the current scientific literature lies in the integrated approach, taking both the electricity-generation system and a bottom up building stock model into account. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the possible benefits of active demand response in this framework. The results show that the main drivers for determining the CO2-abatement cost are the renovation level of the building and the type of heat pump installed. For thoroughly insulated buildings, an air-coupled heat pump combined with floor heating is the most economic heating system in terms of CO2-abatement cost. Finally, performing active demand response shows clear benefits in reducing costs. Substantial peak shaving can be achieved, making peak capacity at the electricity generation side superfluous, hence lowering the overall CO2-abatement cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study employs a multi-regional input-output model at the provincial level to evaluate the environmental costs of coal burning in China in 2007, in terms of its damages from climate change externality. According to the results, the contributions of central-west provinces to the national economy are significantly underestimated because the hidden environmental inputs are not reflected by conventional national account. For example, if the externality of CO2 emission is monetized to be 20 USD/ton (152 RMB/ton), the net external cost introduced by Shanxi in 2007 amounts to nearly 8 billion USD (59 billion RMB), which is equivalent to over one tenth of the annual local output. Our results confirm that developed regions, such as Beijing and Guangdong, shape their low-emission profiles by transferring embodied emission flows to less developed regions. By using a Pigouvian tax to correct for the environmental externality, national consumer price index, producer price index, export price, and gross domestic product deflator will increase by 2.28%, 3.94%, 1.44%, and 1.61%, respectively. To offset the inflationary effect, a complementary measure of reducing domestic value-added tax rate is proposed and analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hydrogen (H-2) is a clean, effective and renewable fuel which can be produced by different methods including biological ones, namely fermentation and biophotolysis. To improve fermentative H-2 production the strategies, implicating use of by-products, utilization of carbon containing organic wastes and optimization of biotechnology process conditions, are developed. Glycerol, a biodiesel by-product, can serve as a cheap carbon containing source to produce H-2 by Escherichia coli. Recent data on metabolic pathways, responsible hydrogenases and dependence of H-2 production on external factors during glycerol fermentation are summarized. The strains are constructed to enhance H-2 yield. The mixed carbon sources (glycerol and glucose) fermentation is a novel approach; glycerol added to glucose containing medium increases H-2 production; different carbon sources comprising wastes can be used. H-2 production from glycerol by different bacteria is overviewed; cultures types, new technologies and optimal conditions, purification of H-2 and developing bioreactors are highlighted. All of these are significant for further developing H-2 production biotechnology from glycerol and perspective for applied energy systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Future power systems will require large shares of low-carbon generators such as renewables and power plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to keep global warming below 2 degrees C. Intermittent renewables increase the system-wide demand for flexibility and affect the operation of thermal power plants. We investigate the operation of future power plants by first composing a comprehensive overview of the operational flexibility of current and future power plants. Next, a combined long-term optimization and hourly simulation is performed with the soft-linked MARKAL-NL-UU and REPOWERS models for The Netherlands in 2030 and 2050. We quantify and compare the technical and economic performance of power plants for four distinctly different future scenarios. We find that future low-carbon power systems will have large shares of intermittent renewable sources (19-42%) and also a 2-38% higher variability in residual load compared to the Baseline scenario. Hence, power plant operation will be more variable, which reduces their efficiency by 0.6-1.6% compared to the full-load efficiency. Enough flexibility is present in future power systems to accommodate renewables, due to advances in power plant flexibility and interconnectors. As a result, generators with CCS have a large market share (23-64% of power generated). Moreover, the current energy-based market model generates insufficient revenues: the price received per MWh covers only 84% (+/- 30%) of the total generation costs per MWh of 77 (sic)/MWh (+/- 12(sic)). This will discourage new investments in generation capacity and reduce power system adequacy. New or additional market designs may be required to ensure system adequacy in future power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental and analytical evaluation of measures to raise the efficiency of window air conditioners (WAC). In order to achieve a higher energy efficiency ratio (EER), the original capacity of a baseline R410A unit was reduced by replacing the original compressor with a lower capacity but higher EER compressor, while all heat exchangers and the chassis from the original unit were retained. Subsequent major modifications included - replacing the alternating current fan motor with a brushless high efficiency electronically commutated motor (ECM) motor, replacing the capillary tube with a needle valve to better control the refrigerant flow and refrigerant set points, and replacing R410A with a 'drop-in' lower global warming potential (GWP) binary mixture of R32/R125 (85/15% molar concentration). All these modifications resulted in significant enhancement in the EER of the baseline WAC. Further, an economic analysis of the new WAC revealed an encouraging payback period. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Combined heat and power (CHP) facilities are a very promising path to reducing CO2 emissions and increasing efficiency in the power generation sector. The ability to supply essential residential utilities (electricity, cooling, and heating) in an efficient manner opens the way for combining district cooling, heating and power generation, and suggests that CHP plants are an attractive choice for providing integrated utilities for the neighborhood of the future. In this paper, we describe the optimal integration of a CHP plant as a utility producer for a residential district, and the potential for combining CHP with photovoltaic power generation. Utilizing residential energy demand data collected by Pecan Street Research Inc., a smart-grid demonstration project in Austin, TX, residential heating, cooling, and electricity demand are analyzed and evaluated. These demands are then used to compute an optimal operating strateky for an integrated CHP/solar utility and the impact of photovoltaic generation on plant operation and operating profit is determined. We demonstrate that CHP is a viable means for providing district-level cooling, heating, and power to a residential district in a hot climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Numerical optimisation related to the estimation of kinetic parameters and model evaluation is playing an increasing role in combustion as well as in other areas of applied energy research. The present work aims at presenting the current probability-based approaches along applications to real problems of combustion chemical kinetics. The main methods related to model and parameter evaluation have been explicated. An in-house program for the systematic adjustment of kinetic parameters to experimental measurements has been described and numerically validated. The GRI (Gas research institute) mechanism (version 3.0) has been shown to initially lead to results which are greatly at variance with experimental data concerning the combustion of CH3 and C2H6. A thorough optimisation of all parameters has been performed with respect to these profiles. A considerable improvement could be reached and the new predictions appear to be compatible with the measurement uncertainties. It was also found that neither GRI 3.0 nor three other reaction mechanisms considered during the present work should be employed (without prior far-reaching optimisation) for numerical simulations of combustors and engines where CH3 and C2H6 play an important role. Overall, this study illustrates the link between optimisation methods and model evaluation in the field of combustion chemical kinetics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The continuing growth in the world population has increased the demand and competition for energy, such that immense efforts are required to make non-renewable energy sources available. Using marine currents to generate electricity offers a distinct advantage over other renewable energy sources because of the regular and predictable nature of the resource. Therefore, in addition to promoting the development of new technologies, global policies for the generation of renewable and clean energy are being strengthened. Several methods of energy conversion have been developed over the years: the turbine-based current energy converter, in particular, has demonstrated high energy generation capacity and is already in operation. In this study, the three-dimensional model TELEMAC3D was used to investigate the hydrodynamic processes. This model was coupled with an energy conversion module to determine the best energy sites for marine current energy generation in the southern Brazilian shelf. Two viable regions were found in the region of study that exhibited high potential for energy generation from marine currents; however, the northern region has been found to be a more viable region for the installation of current converters and can reach an average power of approximately 10 kW per day and integrated values of 3.5 MW per year. The highest levels of power generation were found at 16-day intervals, showing a high correlation with events associated with the passage of meteorological fronts along the region of study. In this study, we design a turbine farm with ten helicoidal turbines. Three grids were used in a one-year simulation of the TELEMAC3D model that was coupled with an energy conversion module. The simulation results were used to identify a suitable region for trial tests on a model turbine farm. For a simulation with physical structures, the northern region site was notable because high conversion rates were maintained during events of high potential energy. This enhanced electricity generation occurred because of the intensification of the current field by a physical structure that enhanced the efficiency of the site. No significant differences in the temporal variability pattern were estimated between simulations with and without structures; thus, the presence of structures did not change the temporal energy conversion pattern on the time scales considered in this study. An annual power output of 59.39 GW h was predicted for the turbine configuration that was chosen for this study, which was equivalent to 0.22% of the entire energetic consumption of Rio Grande do Sul State in 2010.

Abstract: The biohydrogen production using the disintegrated and dissolved sludge by gamma irradiation was studied. The experimental results showed that gamma irradiation and irradiation combined with alkali pretreatment could disintegrate and dissolve waste activated sludge for biohydrogen production. The alkali-irradiation treatment of the sludge at pH = 12 and 20 kGy achieved the highest disintegration and dissolution, i.e., it could destroy the cell walls and release organic matters (such as soluble COD, polysaccharides and protein) into the solution. The disintegrated sludge could be used as a low-cost substrate for biohydrogen production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Renewable systems are especially suited for electricity generation in remote areas but, where high reliability of the electricity supply is required, a hybrid system including electricity storage could be the only solution to avoid the lack of feasibility in single renewable systems. In this paper a hybrid system composed by photovoltaic panels, a biomass gasifier and a battery bank is presented. The system was designed and constructed at the Distributed Energy Resources Laboratory (LabDER) in order to supply electricity to a laboratory complex in the Institut Superieur des Techniques Appliquees, Democratic Republic of Congo (ISTA-DRC). System behavior was also tested in LabDER prior being installed and operated in the final place. Design characteristics and commissioning results are presented together with the experimental verification of the capability to fulfill the demand with very low fluctuations in the generated electricity supply.

Abstract: To perform this comparison, the compound parabolic concentrator with a restricted exit angle of 65 (CPC-65) and the one without exit angle restriction (CPC-90) were fabricated and tested for concentrating radiation on multi-crystalline solar cells. Both CPC-65 and CPC-90 are identical in the acceptance half-angle (20 degrees) and geometrical concentration factor (2x). Theoretical calculations showed that CPC-90 based PV system (CPV-90) annually concentrated about 3-5% more radiation on solar cells as compared to CPC-65 based PV system (CPV-65). For CPV-65, all radiation would arrive on the solar cells at the incidence angle less than 65 degrees, but for CPV-90, about 8-10% of annual collectible radiation would arrive on solar cells at the incidence angle larger than 65. Measurements at outdoor conditions showed that the CPV-65 performed slightly better than CPV-90 in terms of short-circuit current and power output as the projection incidence angle of solar rays on the cross-section of CPC-troughs (theta(p)) less than the acceptance half-angle, otherwise the CPV-90 did better. Compared to CPV-90, the power output at maximum power points from CPV-65 were slightly higher, and increases of 2.1%, 5.4% and 8.17% were measured for theta(p)=0 degrees, 10 degrees and 16 degrees, respectively. Analysis indicated that effect of solar flux distribution over solar cells on power output of both CPVs was almost identical and insignificant, and the CPV-65 performed slightly but insignificantly better than the CPV-90 in terms of annual power output except in areas with poor solar resources where the annual power output from both systems was almost identical.

Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic integration of the international crude oil market and explores the leading/lagging relationship between the world's major crude oils-WTI, Brent, Dubai, Tapis and Nigeria using a time-varying average distance measurement and an error correction model combined with a directed acyclic graph technique. The results indicate a long-term equilibrium relationship between the major crude oil markets from 2000 to 2010, which supports the international crude oil market being integrated. The world's crude oil market began to diverge at the end of 2010, as demonstrated by the increasing average distance between the prices. WTI has been separated from the international crude oil market system and now reflects more local supply and demand situations. WTI behaved as the price setter before 2010, while Brent has played the leading role in the crude oil market since 2011. Conversely, Tapis always behaves as a price taker, following other crude oil prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents and discusses a proposal for a new methodology to determine the control valve inner authority, which is one of the basic parameters deciding about the control valve regulation capacity. Experimental verification is also carried out for selected control valves using the proposed concept and the alternative analytical methodology presented in recent years by Pyrkov. A comparison of the results is presented. It is shown that the proposed methodology gives results consistent with experimental data, whereas the results obtained using previously known methods can be substantially different from them.

Abstract: European Directive 2010/31/EU stated that by the end of 2020 all new buildings should be nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB). Since such buildings require a low quantity of energy for heating, they can utilize energy from the return line of a District Heating (DH) system. Further, this new type of buildings can successfully be integrated into the fourth generation of heat distribution technology, which is the new trend in the DH industry. On the other hand, existing building stock has a service lifetime of around 50 years, indicating that the required supply temperature in the DH system cannot be lowered beneath a certain level. Hereafter, together with new types of buildings and different policies, this could lead to changes in heat demand profiles of the DH system.
The above-mentioned situation in the building market will lead to changes in heat load profiles and unavoidably influence the performance indicators of energy conversion units. Therefore, the focus in this paper was devoted to operation analysis of ethanol-based a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant with combined cycle technology under changeable demand conditions and different temperature levels in the DH system.
In this paper different temperature levels of the DH system together with two temperature control strategies were considered. Further, the analysis included different heat demand profiles. The analysis was performed in Aspen HYSYS simulation software and data post processing was made by MATLAB. The results found that effective plant operation is highly dependent on heat load profile. Temperature control strategies did not induce a significant change in overall power production in CHP. The decrease in the supply temperature did not show a significant impact on plant performance. However, increase in temperature difference between supply and return lines led to higher power production and better overall plant performance. Further, it was concluded that it is rather difficult to operate CCPP connected to low energy building stock. This means that the CCPP is suitable for high-density heat areas, while it has poor energy performance indicators in low heat density areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Elucidating the complex mechanism of the impact of demographic changes, economic growth, and technological advance impacts on energy consumption and pollutant emissions is fundamentally necessary to inform effective strategies on energy saving and emission reduction in China. Here, based on a balanced provincial panel dataset in China over the period 1990-2012, we used an extended STIRPAT model to investigate the effects of human activity on energy consumption and three types of industrial pollutant emissions (exhaust gases, waste water and solid waste) at the national and regional levels and tested the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Empirical results show that a higher population density would result in a decrease in energy consumption in China as a whole and in its eastern, central and western regions, but the extent of its effect on the environment depends on the type of pollutants. Higher population density increased wastewater discharge but decreased solid waste production in China and its three regions. The effect of economic development on the environment was heterogeneous across the regions. The proportion of industrial output had a significant and positive influence on energy consumption and pollutant emissions in China and its three regions. Higher industrial energy intensity resulted in higher levels of pollutant emissions. No strong evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis for the three industrial wastes in China was found. Our findings further demonstrated that the impact of population, income and technology on the environment varies at different levels of development. Because of the regional disparities in anthropogenic impact on the environment, formulating specific region-oriented energy saving and emission reduction strategies may provide a more practical and effective approach to achieving sustainable development in China.

Abstract: A critical challenge associated with renewable energy is managing its variable and intermittent output. Offshore compressed air energy storage (OCAES) is a carbon-free storage technology that can used to support renewable energy generation in marine environments. This paper provides the first economic characterization of OCAES performance when coupled to an offshore wind farm by employing a mixed integer programming model. The model seeks the minimum levelized cost of electricity by optimizing the grid-tied cable capacity and OCAES component sizes across a range of specified cable capacity factors. OCAES can be used to increase the capacity factor of the grid-tied transmission cable, but the resultant levelized cost of electricity strongly depends on the OCAES cost assumptions. Compared to using a land-based gas turbine as backup, OCAES is significantly more expensive, even when the price of carbon exceeds 1000 $/tC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: China's cement industry is the second largest energy consumer and key emitter of CO2 and air pollutants. It accounts for 7% of total energy consumption in China and 15% of CO2, 21% of PM, 4% SO2 and 10% of NOx of total emissions, respectively. Provincial disparities in energy consumption and emissions of CO2 and air pollutants in China's cement industry are rarely quantified. In this study, an integrated assessment model including provincial energy conservation supply curves (ECSC) (which can shows the cost-effective and technical energy saving potential per province), the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model (which can be used to calculate air pollutant emissions), and ArcGIS (a geographical information system (GIS) with elaborated spatial functions) is developed and used to assess the potential of energy savings in terms of emission mitigation of CO2 and air pollutants and multiple benefits of energy efficiency measures at the provincial level during the period 2011-2030. The results show significant heterogeneity across provinces in terms of potential of energy saving as well as emission mitigation of CO2 and air pollutants (i.e. PM, SO2, and NOx) in the next two decades. Seven provinces (i.e. Shandong, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hebei), six of which are located in the central-and east-China, account for 47% of the total energy saving potential, equivalent to 26% of baseline energy use in 2030. The energy efficiency measures can help decrease 38% of CO2, 23% of SO2, 33% of NOx, and 26% of PM emissions in these seven provinces by 2030. This indicates that the multiple benefits should be considered when local policy makers or end users make decisions whether to use energy efficiency measures to solve environmental issues.

Abstract: Energy efficient passive designs and constructions have been extensively studied in the last decades as a way to improve the ability of a building to store thermal energy, increase its thermal mass, increase passive insulation and reduce heat losses. However, many studies show that passive thermal designs alone are not enough to fully exploit the potential for energy efficiency in buildings: in fact, harmonizing the active elements for indoor thermal comfort with the passive design of the building can lead to further improvements in both energy efficiency and comfort. These improvements can be achieved via the design of appropriate Building Optimization and Control (BOC) systems, a task which is more complex in high-inertia buildings than in conventional ones. This is because high thermal mass implies a high memory, so that wrong control decisions will have negative repercussions over long time horizons. The design of proactive control strategies with the capability of acting in advance of a future situation, rather than just reacting to current conditions, is of crucial importance for a full exploitation of the capabilities of a high-inertia building. This paper applies a simulation-assisted control methodology to a high-inertia building in Kassel, Germany. A simulation model of the building is used to proactively optimize, using both current and future information about the external weather condition and the building state, a combined criterion composed of the energy consumption and the thermal comfort index. Both extensive simulation as well as real-life experiments performed during the unstable German wintertime, demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively deal with the complex dynamics arising from the high-inertia structure, providing proactive and intelligent decisions that no currently employed rule-based strategy can replicate.

Abstract: In this paper, we use data collected from over 2000 non-residential electric vehicle supply equipments (EVSEs) located in Northern California for the year of 2013 to estimate the potential benefits of smart electric vehicle (EV) charging. We develop a smart charging framework to identify the benefits of non-residential EV charging to the load aggregators and the distribution grid. Using this extensive dataset, we aim to improve upon past studies focusing on the benefits of smart EV charging by relaxing the assumptions made in these studies regarding: (i) driving patterns, driver behavior and driver types; (ii) the scalability of a limited number of simulated vehicles to represent different load aggregation points in the power system with different customer characteristics; and (iii) the charging profile of EVs. First, we study the benefits of EV aggregations behind-the-meter, where a time-of-use pricing schema is used to understand the benefits to the owner when EV aggregations shift load from high cost periods to lower cost periods. For the year of 2013, we show a reduction of up to 24.8% in the monthly bill is possible. Then, following a similar aggregation strategy, we show that EV aggregations decrease their contribution to the system peak load by approximately 37% (median) when charging is controlled within arrival and departure times. Our results also show that it could be expected to shift approximately 0.25 kW h (-2.8%) of energy per non-residential EV charging session from peak periods (12 PM-6 PM) to off-peak periods (after 6 PM) in Northern California for the year of 2013.

Abstract: This work focuses on the development of optimization-based scheduling strategies for the coordination of microgrids. The main novelty of this work is the simultaneous management of energy production and energy demand within a reactive scheduling approach to deal with the presence of uncertainty associated to production and consumption. Delays in the nominal energy demands are allowed under associated penalty costs to tackle flexible and fluctuating demand profiles. In this study, the basic microgrid structure consists of renewable energy systems (photovoltaic panels, wind turbines) and energy storage units. Consequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is presented and used within a rolling horizon scheme that periodically updates input data information. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract: The relationship of open circuit voltage (OCV) versus state of charge (SOC) is critical for many techniques such as accurate battery modeling and reliable SOC estimation. However, the hysteresis existing in OCV-SOC curves of lithium-ion batteries complicates this relationship especially for lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries which exhibit a very flat OCV-SOC hysteretic feature. This paper aims at modeling the OCV-SOC hysteresis for LiFePO4 batteries. The modeling approach is a novel adaptive discrete Preisach model (ADPM) based on the classic Preisach model and the least mean square (LMS) theory. To enhance the performance, the ADPM uses the measured current at each time step to adjust the weight vector. This method significantly decreases the errors (<1%) between the model predicted SOC and the true SOC acquired from experiments. A deformation algorithm of ADPM is further proposed to guarantee the performance even when large errors appear in the measured current. For further applications of the proposed ADPM such as SOC estimation, the robust performance of ADPM is also discussed when considering OCV input errors and measurement current errors. The results show that the maximum SOC calculation errors are about 6% and 5% respectively against uncertain OCV input and measured current which indicate the enormous potential of ADPM in battery management systems.

Abstract: According to the IPCC, societies can respond to climate changes by adapting to its impacts and by mitigation, that is, by reducing GHG emissions. No single technology can provide all of the mitigation potential in any sector, but many technologies have been acknowledged in being able to contribute to such potential. Among the technologies that can contribute in such potential, Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is not included explicitly, but implicitly as part of technologies such as energy supply, buildings, and industry. To enable a more detailed assessment of the CO2 mitigation potential of TES across many sectors, the group Annex 25 "Surplus heat management using advanced TES for CO2 mitigation" of the Energy Conservation through Energy Storage Implementing Agreement (ECES IA) of the International Energy Agency (AEI) present in this article the CO2 mitigation potential of different case studies with integrated TES. This potential is shown using operational and embodied CO2 parameters. Results are difficult to compare since TES is always designed in relation to its application, and each technology impacts the energy system as a whole to different extents. The applications analyzed for operational CO2 are refrigeration, solar power plants, mobile heat storage in industrial waste heat recovery, passive systems in buildings, ATES for a supermarket, greenhouse applications, and dishwasher with zeolite in Germany. The paper shows that the reason for mitigation is different in each application, from energy savings to larger solar share or lowering energy consumption from appliances. The mitigation potential dues to integrated TES is quantified in kg/MW h energy produced or heat delivered. Embodied CO2 in two TES case studies is presented, buildings and solar power plants.

Abstract: This twelve-month field study analyzes the performance of a 7.56W (2.16-ton) water-to-air-ground source heat pump (WA-GSHP) to satisfy domestic space conditioning loads in a 253 m(2) house in a mixed-humid climate in the United States. The practical feasibility of using the ground as a source of renewable energy is clearly demonstrated. Better than 75% of the energy needed for space heating was extracted from the ground. The average monthly electricity consumption for space conditioning was only 40 kWh at summer and winter thermostat set points of 24.4 degrees C and 21.7 degrees C, respectively. The WA-GSHP shared the same 94.5 m vertical bore ground loop with a separate water-to-water ground-source heat pump (WW-GSHP) for meeting domestic hot water needs in the same house. Sources of systemic irreversibility, the main cause of lost work, are identified using Exergy and energy analysis.
Quantifying the sources of Exergy and energy losses is essential for further systemic improvements. The research findings suggest that the WA-GSHPs are a practical and viable technology to reduce primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions under the IECC 2012 Standard, as well as the European Union (EU) 2020 targets of using renewable energy resources.

Abstract: The majority of articles on Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) so far have focussed on the use of indirect-contact heat exchangers and a thermal fluid in which to store the compression heat. While packed beds have been suggested, a detailed analysis of A-CAES with packed beds is lacking in the available literature. This paper presents such an analysis. We develop a numerical model of an A-CAES system with packed beds and validate it against analytical solutions. Our results suggest that an efficiency in excess of 70% should be achievable, which is higher than many of the previous estimates for A-CAES systems using indirect-contact heat exchangers. We carry out an exergy analysis for a single charge-storage-discharge cycle to see where the main losses are likely to transpire and we find that the main losses occur in the compressors and expanders (accounting for nearly 20% of the work input) rather than in the packed beds. The system is then simulated for continuous cycling and it is found that the build-up of leftover heat from previous cycles in the packed beds results in higher steady state temperature profiles of the packed beds. This leads to a small reduction (<0.5%) in efficiency for continuous operation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Ray-tracing tools are commonly used to optically characterize solar concentrators, but the International Standards used to certify collectors for heating do not allow the use of these tools to analyse the optical behaviour of solar thermal systems. Solar concentrators for the medium temperature range often are of large dimensions and cannot be easily reoriented to the sun without an expensive rotating test platform suggested by the International Standards; therefore, some deficiencies can be detected if the standards procedures are applied to these types of concentrating collectors. In this paper, the use of ray-tracing tools combined with thermal experimental data is proposed to determine the energy balance coefficients by a Weighted Least Square adjustment (WLS). The main advantages of this methodology are that the measurement of the thermal efficiency at normal incidence and solar concentrator reorientation are not required, the optical behaviour of the system can be determined for any position of the sun, and it can be used for in situ measurements for large-scale solar thermal collectors.

Abstract: Stationary electricity storage technologies (SES) allow to increase the shares of intermittent renewable energy technologies in electricity networks. As SES currently exhibit high costs, policy makers have started introducing demand-pull policies in order to foster their diffusion and drive these technologies further down the learning curve. However, as observed in the case of renewable energy technologies, demand-pull policies for technologies can come at high costs in cases where the profitability gap that needs to be covered by the policy support is large. Yet, SES can create value in multiple distinct applications in the power system - making it a "multi-purpose technology". We argue that policy makers can make use of the multi-purpose character of SES to limit costs of demand-pull policies. We propose a policy strategy which grants support based on the profitability gap in the different applications, thereby moving down the learning curve efficiently. To support our argumentation, we firstly conduct a comprehensive literature review of SES applications exemplifying the multi-purpose character of these technologies. Second, we assess the profitability of one SES technology (vanadium redox flow battery) in five SES applications, highlighting a strong variation of the profitability gap across these applications.

Abstract: There is an imperative need to ensure biodiesel's long-term sustainability to fulfil the quest for renewable fuel resources. The technical problems which are correlated with the use of higher blends of fatty acids methyl esters in diesel engine need to be taken into account in order to avail the environmental and social advantages of biodiesel. The present 512 h long term endurance test performed with B40 (40% jatropha biodiesel + 60% diesel) fuelled modified engine has investigated the fundamental premise on the basis of the technical criteria of durability. Special focus has been given on certain phenomena that affect the engine utility life like lubricating oil dilution, deposits formation and oxidative stability. Experimental results indicated that modified engine can be successfully operated with B40. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper explores pre-treatment options for the anaerobic digestion (AD) of high-fat cattle slaughterhouse wastewater by assessing and attempting to compare pre-treatment methods used to treat various waste streams. The central focus on cattle slaughterhouse wastewater stems from the problematic nature of high fat, oil and grease (FOG) present in Australian red meat processing (RMP) waste water.
Fully integrated abattoirs such as those operating in Australia typically produce wastewaters that carry high FOG loads of 100-4000+ mg/L. While excessive levels of fat can be inhibitory to the AD process, these fats contain a very high theoretical methane potential of 1014 L CH4/kg VS when compared with carbohydrates at 370 L CH4/kg VS and proteins at 740 L CH4/kg VS. However, due to the hydrophobic and inhibitory nature of fat, oil and grease, accessing this methane potential is difficult. This article serves as a review of the literature in the field of pre-treatment of wastewaters and subsequent anaerobic digestion with the goal of increasing biogas yield, with an emphasis on digestion of wastes high in fat, oil and grease. This review covers mechanical pre-treatments including high-pressure homogenisation, ultrasonication and electrokinetic disintegration, and other forms of pre-treatment including thermal, chemical, thermochemical, and enzymatic hydrolysis, and biochemical emulsification. Biological pre-treatments, also known as pre-hydrolysis and two stage digestion are briefly reviewed. The most significant considerations for selecting a pre-treatment technology are the energy balance and costs. Therefore, this review will also provide a commentary on the advantages and disadvantages of the pre-treatment methods reviewed and conclude by evaluating their relative worth in pre-treating FOG.

Abstract: This paper presents a case study on optimal options for distributed energy resource (DER) technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a large retail shopping centre located in Sydney, Australia. Large retail shopping centres take the largest share of energy consumed by all commercial buildings, and present a strong case for adoption of DER technologies to reduce energy costs and emissions. However, the complexity of optimally designing and operating DER systems has hindered their widespread adoption in practice. This paper examines and demonstrates the value of DER in reducing the carbon footprint of the shopping centre by formulating and solving a multiobjective optimisation problem using the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) tool. An economic model of the shopping centre is developed in DER-CAM using on-site-specific demand, tariffs, and performance data for each DER technology option available. Four key optimal DER technology investment scenarios are then analysed by comparing: (1) solution trade-offs of costs and emissions, (2) the cost of reduced emissions attained in each investment scenario, and (3) investment benefits with respect to the business-as-usual scenario. The analysis shows that a moderate investment in combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) technology alone can reduce annual energy costs by 8.5% and carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions by 29.6%. A larger investment in CCHP technology, in conjunction with on-site solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, can deliver nearly 72% reductions in emissions at a 47% increase in total energy costs. The study demonstrates the effectiveness and flexibility of this type of modelling approach for the analysis, design, and ongoing assessment of new DER technologies under changing market conditions, supporting a more robust adoption of DER technologies in the commercial building sector.

Abstract: Global uptake of solar PV has risen significantly over the past four years, motivated by increased economic feasibility and the desire for electricity self-sufficiency. However, significant uptake of solar PV could cause grid balancing issues. A system comprising Stirling engine combined heat and power, solar PV and battery storage (SECHP PV battery) may further improve self-sufficiency, satisfying both heat and electricity demand as well as mitigating potential negative grid effects. This paper presents the results of a simulation of 30 households with different energy demand profiles using this system, in order to determine: the degree of household electricity self-sufficiency achieved; resultant grid demand profiles; and the consumer economic costs and benefits. The results indicate that, even though PV and SECHP collectively produced 30% more electricity than the average demand of 3300 kWh/yr, households still had to import 28% of their electricity demand from the grid with a 6 kWh battery. This work shows that SECHP is much more effective in increasing self-sufficiency than PV, with the households consuming on average 49% of electricity generated (not including battery contribution), compared to 28% for PV. The addition of a 6 kWh battery to PV and SECHP improves the grid demand profile by 28% in terms of grid demand ramp-up requirement and 40% for ramp-downs. However, the variability of the grid demand profile is still greater than for the conventional system comprising a standard gas boiler and electricity from the grid. These moderate improvements must be weighed against the consumer cost: with current incentives, the system is only financially beneficial for households with high electricity demand (>4300 kWh/yr). A capital grant of 24% of the installed cost of the whole micro-generation system is required to make the system financially viable for households with an average electricity demand (3300 kWh/yr).

Abstract: In this paper we propose a linear program (LP)-based algorithm to schedule battery storage co-located with residential solar photovoltaics (PV), when excess generation is compensated via net metering. While the objective of this LP-based approach is to maximize the operational savings that accrue to customers, an undesirable consequence to the utility is reverse power flow during the peak pricing period. We show in this paper that it is possible to balance the objective of the utility in limiting reverse power flow, with the customer objective of increasing operational savings, in the context of net metering. To balance the specified utility and customer objectives we employ a quadratic program (QP)-based algorithm, which explicitly penalizes reverse power flow. To complete our assessment of net metering, both the LP-based and QP-based scheduling algorithms are applied to measured load and generation data from 145 residential customers located in an Australian distribution network. The results of this case study confirm the absence of reverse power flow when all customers employ a QP-based battery schedule, with the majority of customers exhibiting operational savings.

Abstract: Pyrolysis behaviors of two lignite coals with different drying conditions were determined by a thermo-gravimetric analyzer coupled with mass spectrometer (TG-MS) and a high-frequency furnace. An in-situ heating stage microscope was adopted to observe the morphological changes during char-CO2 gasification process. It is concluded that the effects of moisture contents in coals on the gaseous release process during coal pyrolysis mainly depend on coal type, final pyrolysis temperature and heating method. The in-situ heating stage experiments indicate that the shrinking particle mode is suitable to illustrate the gasification reaction mechanism in the initial and midterm reaction stages of all the lignite char samples. Although drying conditions have significant effects on coal pyrolysis process under rapid heating, these dewatering conditions result in little noticeable reactivity loss of the char during the subsequent char-CO2 gasification reaction. The measuring results of catalytic active sites can well explain the similar reactivity of lignite coals with different drying conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To increase lifetime, safety, and energy usage battery management systems (BMS) for Li-ion batteries have to be capable of estimating the state of charge (SOC) of the battery cells with a very low estimation error. The accurate SOC estimation and the real time reliability are critical issues for a BMS. In general an increasing complexity of the estimation methods leads to higher accuracy. On the other hand it also leads to a higher computational load and may exceed the BMS limitations or increase its costs.
An approach to evaluate and verify estimation algorithms is presented as a requisite prior the release of the battery system. The approach consists of an analysis concerning the SOC estimation accuracy, the code properties, complexity, the computation time, and the memory usage. Furthermore, a study for estimation methods is proposed for their evaluation and validation with respect to convergence behavior, parameter sensitivity, initialization error, and performance.
In this work, the introduced analysis is demonstrated with four of the most published model-based estimation algorithms including Luenberger observer, sliding-mode observer, Extended Kalman Filter and Sigma-point Kalman Filter.
The experiments under dynamic current conditions are used to verify the real time functionality of the BMS.
The results show that a simple estimation method like the sliding-mode observer can compete with the Kalman-based methods presenting less computational time and memory usage. Depending on the battery system's application the estimation algorithm has to be selected to fulfill the specific requirements of the BMS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel magnetic carbonaceous acid catalyst was synthesized from glucose and iron chloride by a new method of double hydrothermal precipitation at 180 degrees C and pyrolysis at 400-800 degrees C, and subsequent sulfonation at 150 degrees C. Its crystalline phases, magnetic saturation (Ms), morphology, specific surface area, pore volume, functional groups, thermal stability, elemental composition and total acid density were analyzed with various techniques. It was found that catalyst carbonized at 600 degrees C (AC-600-SO3H@Fe/C) had high acid density (2.79 mmol/g) and strong magnetism (Ms: 14.4 Am-2/kg) for direct production of biodiesel from Jatropha oil with high acid value (17.2 mg KOH/g) by single-factor optimization. With the catalyst, 90.5% biodiesel yield was achieved at 200 degrees C with 3 cycles (>90% yield) and 96.3% catalyst recovery rate. The magnetic catalyst directly esterified and transesterified high acid value oil without pretreatment with high biodiesel yield and easily separated for three recycles with little deactivation. It could also find other applications such as pretreatment of oils with high AV and hydrolysis of biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Battery swapping mode (BSM) is an important method of supplying energy to electric vehicles, in which the battery swapping behavior of electric vehicle users affects significantly the charging behavior of the battery swapping station. To determine the impacts of a driver's swapping behavior on the power grid and generation cost, this paper proposes an optimization charging mode (OCM) and simulates the impacts of OCM on the power grid side and generation side. The empirical results indicate that the OCM significantly benefits the power grid and power generators. For the power grid side, OCM is helpful in balancing the power load and decreasing the difference of the peak and valley load. For the generation side, generators will reduce their coal consumption and cost when the OCM is conducted. In addition, OCM can integrate more renewable power into the power grid. Moreover, the empirical results demonstrate that the development of electric vehicle (EV) features scale economy. The benefits of OCM for the power grid side and generation side would be significantly improved with the increase of EV volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust optimization-based decision-making tool for the daily and weekly self-scheduling of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) in the uncertain environment of electricity markets. VPP, as a heterogeneous coalition of distributed energy resources (DERs), is generally composed of intermittent renewable sources, storage systems, flexible loads, and small conventional power plants and thus, to ensure the commercial profit, it needs to negotiate some bilateral contracts in advance prior to participating in the day-ahead market. From the empirical point of view, most relevant decisions made by a VPP as well as its coalition members in short-term and mid-term energy transactions involve a significant level of data uncertainty. For this reason, an efficient MILP model based on robust optimization approach is proposed to enable informed decision making under different levels of uncertainty. The flexible feature embedded in this tool with respect to solution accuracy and computational burden would be advantageous to the VPP. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed method is illustrated and analyzed through different scenarios, and thereby conclusions are drawn. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The prioritized purpose of this dissertation is to put forward a scientific and plausible interval of carbon price benchmark on the unified carbon trading market, of which will be scheduled to be established in the year of 2016. A model named EMD-GARCH that integrated Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (GARCH) together is presented here in order to forecast the carbon price of the five pilots (Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong, and Tianjin) in 2016 so as to provide exogenous data for later analysis. For further study, a recursive dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model will be structured to explore the impacts on China's macroeconomics, environmental quality, and energy demand respectively under 8 different simulation scenarios, which are being designed in terms of the aforementioned calculated carbon price outcome. The simulation results illustrate that the unified carbon price policy will exert a comprehensive effect on China in various perspectives that we discussed in this paper. Moreover, regarding the carbon price scenarios, the price level by itself generates a different degree of impacts in improving the environmental quality, decreasing the energy demand, and increasing the macroeconomic growth. Consequently, based on the analysis of those three approaches mix in this study, we suggest the alternative interval of carbon price benchmark in the national unified carbon trading market with a lower bound of 30 yuan/tCO(2) to an upper bound of 50 yuan/tCO(2).

Abstract: In the recent Comment on our paper 'Life cycle environmental impacts of UK shale gas' (Applied Energy 134 (2014) 506-518), Westaway et al. (Applied Energy, available online 20th March 2015) allege that we exaggerated the potential impacts of shale gas extraction in the UK. They first take an issue with our inclusion of worst case scenarios despite our clear declaration in several places in the paper that this is indicative of what could happen within the confines of a very ill-defined and highly variable future reality. Secondly, Westaway et al. claim that key assumptions in the modelling reflect illegal practices that would not occur, when in fact this is an exaggeration of the legal situation and these practices are still viable. This rebuttal addresses some of the claims made by Westaway et al. while welcoming further open and impartial discourse in this area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The accurate State of Charge (SOC) estimation in a Li-ion battery requires a suitable model of the cell behavior. In this work an enhanced closed loop estimator based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed, considering a precise model of the cell dynamics valid for different current profiles and SOCs, and a complete model of the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) which takes into account the hysteresis influence. The employed model and proposed estimator are validated with experimental results obtained from the response of a 40 Ah NMC Li-ion cell to several current profiles. These tests include current pulses, FUDS driving cycles, residential lift profiles, and specially designed profiles which demand an accurate modeling of the transitions between OCV boundaries. In each case, it is demonstrated that the enhanced model can reduce the estimation error nearly by half compared to an estimator ignoring the hysteresis effect. Furthermore, the good performance of the cell dynamics model allows an accurate and stable estimation over different conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To achieve the optimal energy allocation for the engine-generator, battery and ultracapacitor of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, a novel adaptive energy management strategy has been proposed. Three efforts have been made. First, the hierarchical control strategy has been proposed for multiple energy sources from a multi-scale view. The upper level is for regulating the energy between the engine-generator and hybrid energy-storage system, while the lower level is for the battery and ultracapacitor. Second, a driving pattern recognition based adaptive energy management approach has been proposed. This approach uses a fuzzy logic controller to classify typical driving cycles into different driving patterns and to identify the real-time driving pattern. Dynamic programming has been employed to develop optimal control strategies for different driving blocks, and it is helpful for realizing the adaptive energy management for real-time driving cycles. Third, to improve the real-time and robust performance of the energy management, the previous 100 s duration of historical information has been determined to identify a real-time driving pattern. Finally, an adaptive energy management strategy has been proposed. The simulation results indicate that the proposed energy management strategy has better fuel efficiency than the original and conventional dynamic programming-based control strategies.

Abstract: Microalgae have reported to be one of the most promising feedstock for biofuel production. To obtain a comprehensive and systematic overview of the current state of microalgal research, particularly microalgal biofuel research, we retrieved and analyzed manuscripts and patents related to this topic and published between 1900 and mid-2015. We found that there was a burst in microalgal biofuel research from 2006 to 2011 that significantly stimulated the development of microalgal biotechnology for the production of high value-added commodities and for environmental applications and microalgal mass culturing, in an attempt to make the entire process of biofuel production economically viable for industrialization. However, a lag in basic microalgal research has kept production costs high, resulting in a decline in investments, funding, and research efforts in the fields of microalgal biofuel production, microalgal biotechnology, and mass culturing since 2012. Based on a review of the challenges/problems of microalgae biofuel production and recent advances of their solution, the perspective view of the future R&D needs and trends were proposed. To bypass the price bottleneck of microalgae-based biofuel production, it has been proposed that energy-producing microalgal biotechnological applications be synergistically combined with microalgal biofuel production. Future investments and funding will most likely be directed toward basic studies that aim to elucidate the microorganisms' characteristics and toward the development of microalgal biotechnology and its environmental applications, which have potential economic and social benefits. This review represents a theoretical reference for both algal researchers and decision makers regarding the future directions of microalgal research, particularly that involving microalgal-based biofuel production.

Abstract: This study focuses on the environmental impact assessment through Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of two innovative 10 kW pellet boilers. In particular, the second boiler represents a technological evolution of the first one developed to improve its performance in terms of efficiency and environmental impact. For both boilers, emission factors measured during laboratory tests (full load tests and specific load cycle tests representative of real life boiler operation) have been used as input data in the life cycle analysis. The SimaPro software (v.8.0.4.30) was used for the LCA and the ReCiPe Midpoint method (European version H) was chosen to assess the environmental impact of all boilers (according to LCA ISO standards). In addition, the ReCiPe Endpoint method was used to compare the final results of all 5 boilers with literature data.
The pelletisation process represented the most relevant share of the overall environmental impact followed by the operational phase, the manufacturing phase and the disposal phase. A sensitivity analysis performed on the most efficient pellet boiler evidenced the variation of the boiler's environmental impact as a function of PM10 and NOx emission factors with respect to emission factors monitored during boiler full load operation. Moreover, the reduction of the boiler's weight and the adoption of new electronic components led to a consistent reduction (-18%) of its environmental impact with respect to the previous technology. A second LCA has been carried on for a 15 kW oil boiler, a 15 kW natural gas boiler and a 15 kW pellet boiler, representative of the state of the art of EU technology, to finally compare all LCA results. Results showed the environmental impact reduction of BW10 and BW10 2 pellet boilers with respect to fossil fuelled boilers mainly due to their reduced impact on CC (reductions by 86-90% and 88-91% with respect to the NG and oil boilers respectively), NLT (reductions by 77-79% and 86-87% with respect to the NG and oil boilers respectively) and FD (reductions by 89-92% and 90-93% with respect to the NG and oil boilers respectively) ReCiPe Midpoint subcategories.

Abstract: The selection of the proper thermal energy storage (TES) material for an application is crucial. On the one hand, these materials should have suitable thermal properties for the operational temperatures range of the systems they are planned to work for, such as thermal stability, high latent heat and high heat capacity. On the other hand, they should be available on the market and at low price. Besides, researchers have to bear in mind the importance of testing TES materials not only at laboratory scale but also at higher scale, since it has been demonstrated that some thermal characteristics are volume-dependant. In the present study, bischofite, a by-product obtained from the non-metallic industry in the North of Chile with desired thermal properties for mid-temperature applications (around 100 degrees C), has been studied. A first analysis was performed in terms of comparing the thermal properties and cost of bischofite with other material previously studied as TES materials in order to evaluate its potential in both latent and sensible phases. Afterwards, a second analysis was experimentally performed in terms of testing bischofite at large-scale (204 kg) in a pilot plant facility. The experimental procedure consisted on several charging processes within two different temperatures ranges: from 50 degrees C to 80 degrees C and from 80 degrees C to 120 degrees C in order to study the behavior of the material in the sensible solid phase and latent phase respectively. The temperature profiles, the power given by the HTF, the energy balance in the storage system and the accumulation energy rate of the bischofite were analyzed. Results of both analysis showed that bischofite has potential as TES material for mid-temperature applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Many cities today are committed to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and the fraction of renewables especially in new urban developments. However, quantitative data on building energy performance as a function of urban density, building compactness and orientation, building use and supply options are rarely available during the design of new cities or early scenario analysis for existing city quarters, making it difficult for cities to effectively evaluate which concepts work today and in the future. The paper proposes a methodology to assess the energy demand and supply options as a function of the availability of geometry, building standard and use data. An automated procedure was implemented to identify each building's geometry and volume and transfer the information to a simulation tool, which then calculates heating demand and solar energy generation on roofs and facades. The simulation includes shading calculations for each segment of the facades and roofs and thus allows a very detailed quantification of the building energy demand.
By applying the methodology to a case study city quarter designed in an urban competition in Munich, it could be shown how the urban design influences the energy demand of the quarter and which fractions of renewable energy can be integrated into the roofs. While the building insulation standard and use are the is most important criteria for building energy efficiency (with an impact of more than a factor 2), the exact geometrical form, compactness and urban shading effects influences the energy demand by 10-20%. On the other hand, the detailed roof geometry and orientation influences the possible solar coverage of electricity or thermal needs. Zero energy city quarters with solar resources alone are only possible when all available building surface areas are fully optimized and do not need to fulfill other requirements such as providing roof gardens, terraces or others. Combinations with other more centralized renewable resources such as deep geothermal, solar or biomass heat or cogeneration plants are often necessary to achieve zero energy balances.

Abstract: Renewable biofuels such as Hydroprocessed Renewable Diesel (HRD) and Biodiesel (B100) are perceived as potential alternative fuels for compression ignition (CI) engine. HRD and B100 are produced from the same feedstock i.e. Jatrophacurcas oil by transesterification and hydro-deoxygenation reactions respectively. Petro-diesel served as a reference fuel. The main objective of this study is to identify a better alternative fuel among HRD and B100 in terms of emissions and fuel consumption characteristics. The C-H-O based lubricity additive was added in HRD to give adequate lubricity to fuel injection pump. Both biofuels showed substantial reduction in particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (FIC) emissions as compared to petro-diesel. But NOx increased by 26% for HRD and 77% in the case of B100 fueled engine. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the engine fueled with HRD was lower than with B100 and petro-diesel. A comparative analysis of emission results revealed that the engine fueled with B100 performed well on many counts such as PM, CO and HC, but the HRD outperformed B100 in terms of NOx emission and BSFC, which are vital parameters for Cl engines. Hence, HRD may be considered as a promising alternative fuel for CI engines over other transesterified biodiesels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Nearly/net zero energy buildings (nZEBs) have attracted increasing attention particularly when high and complex performance is required in terms of energy-saving, indoor thermal comfort, environmental friendliness and grid-friendliness. However, there is no exact approach at present for the design and control of buildings to achieve the nearly/net zero energy target. This is mainly due to the complex interplay of energy production/consumption/storage systems as well as the automatically and manually controlled systems/elements in the highly integrated buildings. This paper therefore presents a comprehensive review on the issues related to the design and control of these buildings, i.e. the effects of climate/site on design, design optimization methods, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for robust design and system reliability, efficient and optimal control of high efficient generation systems and energy storage systems for alleviating/shifting the peak load, model predictive control for fast responses to smart grid, and adoption of advanced smart technologies. An outline of the progress of nZEBs is presented by summarizing the internationally known nZEBs identified including 30 case studies on the design strategies applied and the actual building performance. This review could also support the future development of methods that address the design and control of buildings with a holistic view. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Accurate models of the electrical behaviour of photovoltaic modules are effective tools for system design. One or two diode equivalent circuits have been widely used even though some mathematical difficulties were found dealing with implicit equations. In this paper, a new model based on a simple rational function, which does not contain any implicit exponential form, is presented. The model was conceived in order to be used with thin-film photovoltaic modules, whose current-voltage curves are characterised by very smooth shapes. The parameters of the model are evaluated by means of the derivatives of the issued characteristics in the short circuit and open circuit points at standard rating conditions, and assuming that the calculated current-voltage curve contains the rated maximum power point of the simulated panel.
The capability of the model to calculate the current-voltage characteristic for values of the solar irradiance and cell temperature far from the standard rating conditions was verified for various thin-film technologies, such as CIS, CIGS, amorphous silicon, tandem and triple-junctions photovoltaic modules. A comparison with the results obtained by another rational model and other two-diode models, which were used to simulate the electrical behaviour of thin-film photovoltaic modules, is also presented.

Abstract: This paper presents a well-founded quantified estimation of the demand response flexibility of residential smart appliances. The flexibility from five types of appliances available within residential premises (washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, domestic hot water buffers and electric vehicles), is quantified based on measurements from the LINEAR pilot, a large-scale research and demonstration project focused on the introduction of demand response at residential premises in the Flanders region in Belgium. The flexibility potential of the smart appliances, or the maximal amount of time a certain increase or decrease of power can be realized within the comfort requirements of the user, is calculated. In general, the flexibility potential varies during the day, and the potential for increasing or decreasing the power consumption is in general not equal. Additionally, an extrapolation of the flexibility potential of wet appliances is presented for Belgium. The analysis shows that, using smart wet appliances, an average maximum increase of 430 W per household can be realized at midnight, and a maximum decrease of 65 W per household can be realized in the evening. The resulting flexibility potential can be used as an instrument to determine the impact or economic viability of demand response programs for residential premises. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Thermoelectric modules (TEM) are solid state components which are able to convert thermal to electric energy without moving parts and therefore are generally recognized as durable and reliable. However, the performance of TEM is strongly depending on the temperature difference driving the heat flux and causing thermo-mechanical stress within the module. This study introduces a multi-objective optimization procedure based on a genetic algorithm with which this conflict in objectives can be solved under realistic boundary conditions. Therefore a finite element model is presented and an optimization model is derived. The results of the optimization show that a significant improvement in electric power output and mechanical stability can be achieved by regarding all relevant design parameters in the module.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using several post-industrial ceramics as filler materials in a direct thermocline storage configuration. The tested ceramics, coming from several industrial processes (asbestos containing waste treatment, coal fired power plants or metallurgic furnaces) demonstrate relevant properties to store thermal energy by sensible heat up to 1000 degrees C. Thus, they represent at low-cost a promising, efficient and sustainable approach for thermal energy storage. In the present study, the thermo-chemical compatibility of these ceramics with the conventional binary Solar Salt is tested at medium temperature (500 degrees C) under steady state. In order to determine the feasibility of using such ceramics as filler material, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) characterizations have been performed to check for their chemical and structural evolution during corrosion tests. The final objective is to develop a molten salt thermocline direct storage system using low-cost shaped ceramic as structured filler material. Most of the tested ceramics present an excellent corrosion resistance in molten Solar Salt and should significantly decrease the current cost of concentrated solar thermal energy storage system.

Abstract: The characteristics of simultaneous calcination and sulfation of limestone in circulating fluidized bed boiler (CFBB) conditions were studied. The calcination and sulfation reaction of the limestone was tested in a TGA. The lowest weight(%) reached by samples underwent calcination and sulfation simultaneously was higher than that of samples calcined in N-2 then sulfated, and it took more time for the former to reach the lowest weight(%) point. The lowest weight(%) point was a point at which the rate of weight loss due to calcination equaled the rate of weight gain due to sulfation. It was not a point that signified the end of calcination of limestone and nor the point of beginning of the sulfation reaction. The effects of some factors, including SO2 concentration, temperature, particle size, etc., were tested. The effect of SO2 on the calcination of limestone is a function of SO2 concentration. The differences in the lowest weight point reached at different SO2 concentrations (2250 and 3800 ppm) decrease at higher temperatures, for example 7.3% at 850 degrees C but only 3.6% at 880 degrees C. The effect of particle size is the most significant among all the variables tested. SEM-EDX showed there are some un-reacted calcium zones in the particles, especially in the core of the particles. Quantitative XRD phase analysis verified that for the limestone samples underwent calcination and sulfation simultaneously, there were indeed some CaCO3 remaining in the sorbent, even after 90 min of reaction. The sulfated limestone samples were crushed and heated in TGA to determine if and how much CaCO3 still remain. The limestone that calcined in N-2 then sulfated has higher utilization than that underwent calcination and sulfation simultaneously. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Two novel hybrid combined cycle power systems that use solar heat and methanol, and integrate CO2 capture, are proposed and analyzed, one based on solar-driven methanol decomposition and the other on solar-driven methanol reforming. The high methanol conversion rates at relatively low temperatures offer the advantage of using the solar heat at only 200-300 degrees C to drive the syngas production by endothermic methanol conversions and its conversion to chemical energy. Pre-combustion decarbonization is employed to produce CO2-free fuel from the fully converted syngas, which is then burned to produce heat at the high temperature for power generation in the proposed advanced combined cycle systems. To improve efficiency, the systems' configurations were based on the principle of cascade use of multiple heat sources of different temperatures. The thermodynamic performance of the hybrid power systems at its design point is simulated and evaluated. The results show that the hybrid systems can attain an exergy efficiency of about 55%, and specific CO2 emissions as low as 34 g/kW h. Compared to a gas/steam combined cycle with flue gas CO2 capture, the proposed solar-assisted system CO2 emissions are 36.8% lower, and a fossil fuel saving ratio of similar to 30% is achievable with a solar thermal share of similar to 20%. The system integration predicts high efficiency conversion of solar heat and low-energy-penalty CO2 capture, with the additional advantage that solar heat is at relatively low temperature where its collection is cheaper and simpler. The systems' components are robust and in common use, and the proposed hybridization approach can be also used with similar benefits by replacing the solar heat input with other low heat sources, and the system integration achieves the dual-purpose of clean use of fossil fuel and high-efficiency conversion of solar heat at the Same time.

Abstract: This paper concentrates on the development of a Photovoltaic Power Generation Plant (PPGP) for a remote mini-estate of 24 households, based on the socio-technical and the economic perspectives. This integrated approach presents a comprehensive framework for understanding the development of energy for remote communities. The social lives and the needs of the people are first assessed, followed by the components design and modeling of the PPGP in DIgSILENT PowerFactory tool, taking into account the hourly generation and demand for different seasons. A 400 V, 50 Hz three-phase output is produced from the plant via a static converter component; AC unbalanced load flow and the quasi-dynamic simulations are also run to ascertain the generation, busbar voltages, line loadings and losses in the system, over a 24-h period. While the PPGP performance is also being investigated, the economic analysis is done by employing life cycle cost analysis. The implementation challenges are highlighted and some recommendations are made as well. The locality of Gwagwalada, Nigeria is used as a case study. Results reveal that the social aspect plays a significant role in the design, planning, implementation and management of the plant. It further indicates that the proposed plant has the potential to provide a continuous and cost-effective power supply for the users during different seasons, compared to a conventional off-grid option.

Abstract: This paper focuses on experimental performance of an open-drive scroll type expander in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system. The expander was an originally oil-free scroll type air compressor with a built-in volume ratio of 4.05. The cycle used HFC-245fa as working fluid, and the loop has been mixed with a moderate concentration of refrigerant oil that circulated in the cycle. The experimental results of this study are divided into two main parts: first part focuses the experimental performance on the fixed superheating at the expander inlet with respect to various pressure differences of the system and rotational speeds of the expander. Second part involves various superheating at the expander inlet which was operated at fixed rotational speed and operating pressure difference of 5 bars and 6 bars. When the cycle was operated under fixed superheating conditions, the maximum cycle efficiency, expander efficiency and power output of the expander are 9.44%, 73.1% and 23 kW respectively. On the other hand, when the expander is operated in various superheating conditions, the expander and cycle efficiency simultaneously increase with the increasing of superheating. In addition, this paper not only focuses on the experimental results using the current expander, but also integrates the previous experimental data with present study to identify an appropriate scroll type expander with respect to various operating pressure differences for the heat source below 100 degrees C.

Abstract: The solar hybrid Steam Injection Gas turbine (STIG) cycle uses both recuperated heat and solar heat in order to generate steam at a low temperature and pressure, and inject it into the cycle in order to augment the power output. This work addresses the addition of thermal energy storage to allow operation from solar energy beyond the daylight hours. An annual performance analysis of the Solar STIG cycle with latent heat phase change material (PCM) storage is presented for the climatic conditions of Sede Boqer, Israel. We show that the heat transfer limitation present in a real PCM storage leads to a slight performance penalty only compared to an ideal storage. We also analyze the impact of shifting electricity generation from daytime to evening, which can lead to a surprisingly high contribution of the thermal storage. Results show annual solar fraction of up to 35.2%. The annual solar to electricity efficiency was 20.1% when using the recuperated Brayton cycle as reference, and 13.9% for an optimal conventional STIG cycle as reference. These values are similar to or higher than the annual efficiency of current solar thermal power technologies, even though the hybrid STIG cycle uses low-grade solar heat at 200-280 degrees C.

Abstract: Climate change present a range of equity issues for human being, but operating the equity principle within emission allocation scheme to various parties has raised multiple challenges. Although more than 40 schemes have been suggested in the literatures, there is little consistency in the way that baselines, scope, coverage and other key parameters have been compared or discussed. In this paper, we reviewed 41 schemes used in the literature so far and compared the cumulative allowances of main countries under various schemes in a consistent framework. Two cases are considered, i.e. only energy and industry related CO2 and all Kyoto GHGs. Besides the allowances, carbon Gini coefficient in the global perspective and the reduction tradeoffs between country groups are further quantitatively discussed. It is demonstrated that the full ranges of countries' allowances are quite large resulting from different equity considerations and implement methods behind different effort-sharing schemes. However, absolute mitigations are always required in developed countries in order to realize the 2 degrees C target, regardless of schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: For successful commercialization of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, the durability requirement must be satisfied. The degradation of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell has been extensively studied, and a number of review papers investigating the durability issue have already been published. However, the gas diffusion layer has rarely been examined, even though it might be a key factor for managing mass transport and two-phase flow while mechanically supporting a membrane-electrode assembly and a bipolar plate. This paper reviews the published works on the durability of the gas diffusion layer of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The degradation of the gas diffusion layer can be divided into mechanical degradation, including the compression force effect, freeze/thaw cycle effect, dissolution effect, and erosion effect, and chemical degradation, which consists of the carbon corrosion effect. Following these categories, the methods of accelerated stress tests, the degradation mechanisms, and the influential factors are investigated along with various measurements of gas diffusion layer properties and cell performances.

Abstract: Biomass-based heating and domestic hot water supply systems in residential buildings need optimised system design to maximise the boiler's efficiency. Although the efficiency of pellet boilers is certified through standard laboratory tests, there is only little information available in the literature about their performance in field conditions. The aims of this study were to compare the laboratory and field performance of small scale pellet boilers, and to characterise the boilers' operation in the field, finding the parameters which have the strongest influence on the efficiency. This research consisted in the extensive monitoring of five pellet boilers installed in residential buildings in Austria, including new and recently refurbished houses, as well as pre-fabricated, high performance houses. Different system configurations without buffer storage tank were monitored for one year, to determine annual and monthly efficiencies. Results showed that annual efficiencies ranged from 65% to 85%, thus evidencing a lower performance if compared to the 90-94% efficiencies certified by standard laboratory tests. Efficiencies were correlated to the boilers' load factors and number of ignitions, leading to the development of modified efficiency curves, suitable to predict the boiler's performance in field conditions.

Abstract: Chemical looping combustion (CLC) in an interconnected fluidized bed has attracted more and more attention owing to its novel technology with inherent separation of CO2. In recent years, some models have been developed to investigate the gas-particle flow and reactive characteristics during the CLC process. However, multi-scale structures in reactors make it complex to perform a simulation. In the current work, a multi-scale gas-solid flow-reaction coupled model is developed and applied to the simulation of the CLC process in a dual circulating fluidized bed (DCFB) system with consideration of the impact of multi-scale structures on chemical reactions, mass and heat transfer. By comparisons of gas pressure and gas components with experimental data, the present model shows a better prediction. The influence of clusters on the gas compositions and temperature field is analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The introduction of the off-grid electrification program in South Africa using the Solar Home System (SHS) was a central component of the government policy aimed at bringing development to un-electrified households. An assessment of the performance of SHS in many countries provided little evidence to support the development impact of the system. The general perception is that the SHS program is wasting government funds and has no hope of achieving the set objectives. Previous scientific reports have concluded that SHS is the most viable technology for bringing about socio-economic development to rural households. Most of these conclusions have been based on one sided arguments and largely on anecdotal evidence. This study provides a pluralistic view of the subject from the perspective of the energy service companies (ESCOs) and the households using the equipment. The development impact of SHS is subjected to scientific analysis by investigating the economic and social dimensions of the program. Additionally, the sustainability of the South African SHS program is assessed by investigating the challenges facing the ESCOs and the households. The study reveals that illumination provided by SHS electricity has profound impact on the livelihoods of rural households. Due to the limited capacity of SHS for productive and thermal use, there are limited direct economic benefits to the households. The associated economic impact is peripheral to the secondary usage of SHS electricity. SHS has improved the productivity of small scale business owners who utilize the light from SHS to do business at night. Irregularities in payment of subsidy funds and energy bills, high operation cost, non-optimal use of SHS, grid encroachment, and lack of customer satisfaction contribute to make the business unsustainable for the ESCOs.

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced on-off control method based on fuzzy logic is proposed for maintaining thermal comfort in residential buildings. Due to the time-lag of the control systems and the late building thermal response, an anticipative control mechanism is required to reduce energy loss and thermal discomfort. The proposed controller is implemented based on an on-off controller combined with a fuzzy algorithm. On-off control was chosen over other conventional control methods because of its structural simplicity. However, because conventional on-off control has a fixed operating range and a limited ability for improvements in control performance, fuzzy theory can be applied to overcome these limitations. Furthermore, a fuzzy-based solar energy compensation algorithm can be applied to the proposed controller to compensate for the energy gained from solar radiation according to the time of day. Simulations were conducted to compare the proposed controller with a conventional on-off controller under identical external conditions such as outdoor temperature and solar energy; these simulations were carried out by using a previously reported thermal analysis program that was modified to consider such external conditions. In addition, experiments were conducted in a residential building called Green Home Plus, in which hydronic radiant floor heating is used; in these experiments, the proposed system performed better than a system employing conventional on-off control methods.

Abstract: This paper empirically investigates both price and volatility spillover effects in a comprehensive VEC-MGARCH framework. The hedging strategy is further discussed using the spillover effects. Crude oil and natural gas markets of US, Europe and Japan are examined for regional segmentation and different pricing mechanisms of natural gas. Our results show that the European and Japanese gas prices are cointegrated with Brent oil prices, but US gas price is decoupled from oil due to natural gas market liberalization and shale gas expansion. In all cases, the results support the presence of price spillover from crude oil markets to natural gas markets, but a reverse relationship does not exist. The asymmetric price spillover effects might be explained by the relative size of each market. It was also found that the volatility in oil market seems to spillover to the natural gas market, and vice versa, in both US and Europe. On the contrary, volatility seems to be independent in natural gas and oil markets in Japan. The difference in the results of the volatility spillover effects could be explained by the pricing mechanism of natural gas, especially the risk avoidance mechanism in gas pricing in Japan. The risk management performance of edging strategy is remarkable considering volatility spillover. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This article investigates low-energy consumption silica gel circulating fluidized beds for the dehumidification of air conditioning systems. The system consists of an adsorption bed, a desorption bed, and two fans. The fans drive silica gel particles upward to form fluidized beds; as the particles descend, funnels inside the beds allow particles to move between beds through connecting pipes. The particles circulate between absorption and desorption beds to create a continuous operating dehumidification air conditioning system. To achieve a fluidized state, air velocities between 4.0 m/s and 6.0 m/s and regeneration temperatures between 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C, which simulate low-temperature waste heat or solar thermal conditions, were chosen for the study. Altering funnel heights and adding oblique baffles to the system allowed us investigate different adsorption/desorption performances. The results show that single-tube fluidized bed can increase adsorption/desorption performance by 20% and lower the pressure drop by about 30%, compared to the packed bed. The circulating fluidized bed system has the highest Energy Factor by 0.554 kg/kW h, and improve the packed bed system by 124% due to the absence of a motor and has the largest total adsorption rate. Increasing air velocities and regeneration temperatures cause adsorption/desorption performance to rise in circulating fluidized bed systems. A regeneration temperature of 60 degrees C has the highest total adsorption rate of 343 g/h. Compared to the other funnel heights, a 200 mm funnel height with an oblique baffle that increases circulatory effects improves the total adsorption rate by 14% to reach an adsorption rate of 230 g/h.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is a popular method to realize demand response. Automated response from smart appliances reduces the comfort impact for the users and hence reduces response fatigue concerns, while improving the price response. However, real-life experience with smart appliances is typically limited to heating and cooling appliances. The Linear pilot was a residential demand response pilot with 240 Belgian families using smart dishwashers, washing machines, tumble dryers and domestic hot water buffers in various experiments. Goal was to evaluate the performance of those smart appliances in real life circumstances for various applications of demand response. The results for the day-ahead dynamic pricing experiments, conducted from September 2013 till July 2014 at 58 families, are presented. These demonstrate a significant shift of the flexible share of the electricity consumption to the lower price periods. The dishwashers outperform the other appliances. The domestic hot water buffer shows the lowest performance in terms of relative cost savings, but its much larger energy consumption translates to larger absolute savings. As the flexible share of the total consumption remains small, the non-smart share represents a financial risk for the consumer. The smart appliances were well received by the users and no response fatigue was observed. However, there was a high variation in the group of pilot participants, both in terms of energy consumption as in terms of flexibility offered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: RCCI (reactivity controlled compression ignition) has drawn much attention since it was proposed, as it could lead to high performance and clean combustion. The original concept of an RCCI engine is to use gasoline and diesel as the low and high reactivity fuels, respectively. In this study, biodiesel is considered as a substitute of diesel. Hence, research was numerically conducted on a gasoline/biodiesel fueled RCCI engine. To simulate the combustion process, coupled KIVA4-CHEMKIN was used. The gasoline/biodiesel reaction mechanism as implemented in the code was developed by the authors. Two major factors, namely gasoline to total input energy ratio and SOI (start of injection) timing, have been considered. The varied gasoline energy ratios were applied to both C-SOI (conventional SOI) and A-SOI (advanced SOI) timings. Comparing the combustion characteristics between two SOI timings with varied gasoline energy ratios, it is found that A-SOI could offer more controllability on start of combustion, combustion phasing etc. when varying gasoline ratio. As for the emissions formation, increases in gasoline could reduce NOx and soot emissions simultaneously by achieving more homogeneous combustion. However, the designed spray angle of 78 for C-SOI, when used with A-SOI, would increase the soot formation especially when more biodiesel is injected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: For an operating flow battery system, how the battery's performance varies with ambient temperatures is of practical interest. To gain an understanding of the general thermal behavior of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), we devised and tested a laboratory-scale single VRFB by varying the operating temperature. The voltage efficiency of the VRFB is found to increase from 86.5% to 90.5% at 40 mA/cm(2) when the operating temperature is increased from 15 degrees C to 55 degrees C. The peak discharge power density is also observed to increase from 259.5 mW/cm(2) to 349.8 mW/cm(2) at the same temperature increment. The temperature increase, however, leads to a slight decrease in the coulombic efficiency from 96.2% to 93.7% at the same temperature increments. In addition, the capacity degradation rate is found to be higher at higher temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic data-driven method of pattern classification for identification of the state-of-charge (SOC) parameter in battery systems for diverse applications (e.g., plug-in electric vehicles and hybrid locomotives). The underlying theory is built upon the concept of symbolic dynamics, which represents the behavior of battery system dynamics at different levels of SOC as probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA). In the proposed method, (finite-length) blocks of battery data are selected via wavelet-based segmentation from the time series of synchronized input-output (i.e., current-voltage) pairs in the respective two-dimensional space. Then, symbol strings are generated from the segmented time series pairs in the sense of maximum entropy partitioning and a special class of PFSA, called the D-Markov machine, is constructed to extract the features of the battery system dynamics for pattern classification. To deal with the uncertainties due to the (finite-length) approximation of symbol sequences, combinations of (a priori) Dirichlet and (a posteriori) multinomial distributions are respectively adopted in the training and testing phases of pattern classification. The proposed concept of pattern classification has been validated on (approximately periodic) experimental data that have been acquired from a commercial-scale lead-acid battery.

Abstract: Energy, fuel and chemical production from biomass is increasingly attracting interest in the world. Gasification of biomass can produce raw syngas which contains CO, CO2, H-2 and CH4. In addition, raw syngas contains minor but significant quantities of undesirable impurities - collectively known as syngas contaminants. Syngas contaminants are composed of tars, nitrogen based compounds (NH3, HCN, etc.), sulfur based compounds (H2S, COS, etc.), hydrogen halides (HCl, HF, etc.) and trace metals (Na, K, etc.). Raw syngas cleanup is an essential step prior to syngas utilization in downstream applications. In recent years, significant research attention has been devoted to syngas cleanup to reduce contaminants below tolerable limits. The present paper is a comprehensive review of cold gas and hot gas syngas cleanup for major contaminants in syngas (tar, NH3, H2S, HCl and trace metals). This review organizes and discusses investigations on syngas for all major contaminants, critically reviews important challenges in syngas cleanup and discusses recent advancements in hot and cold gas cleanup.

Abstract: The re-emerging interest in vertical axis wind turbines for floating offshore applications has led to a need to investigate the relatively complex dynamics of such floating offshore structures. Through the use of a coupled model of dynamics this article investigates the frequency-domain characteristics of floating vertical axis wind turbine aerodynamic loads. The impact of platform induced motion on aerodynamic loads is discussed in detail, with results indicating an increase in aerodynamic loads of several orders of magnitude over the range of frequencies usually containing significant wave energy. The subsequent impacts of these observations on system component design are elaborated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There are very few useful work and exergy analysis studies for China, and fewer still that consider how the results inform drivers of past and future energy consumption. This is surprising: China is the world's largest energy consumer, whilst exergy analysis provides a robust thermodynamic framework for analysing the technical efficiency of energy use. In response, we develop three novel sub-analyses. First we perform a long-term whole economy time-series exergy analysis for China (1971-2010). We find a 10-fold growth in China's useful work since 1971, which is supplied by a 4-fold increase in primary energy coupled to a 2.5-fold gain in aggregate exergy conversion efficiency to useful work: from 5% to 12.5%. Second, using index decomposition we expose the key driver of efficiency growth as not 'technological leapfrogging' but structural change: i.e. increasing reliance on thermodynamically efficient (but very energy intensive) heavy industrial activities. Third, we extend our useful work analysis to estimate China's future primary energy demand, and find values for 2030 that are significantly above mainstream projections. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract: Over the past several years, studies have been conducted on the model predictive control (MPC), which has analyzed the amount of savings through model-based predictive control. As its result is dependent on the precision and accuracy of the model, minimizing the errors due to arbitrary events caused by the occupants as well as uncertain data input is important. In this study, to address these errors, real-time building energy simulation was conducted in accordance with which energy consumption could be predicted and a MPC framework was established for control. To use the building energy management system data, co-simulation was implemented based on the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) as it allows for a real-time simulation based on the external data input. The real-time predicted and measured energy consumption values were compared to the statistical indices such as the hourly Mean Bias Error and Coefficient Variation of the Root-Mean-Squared Error with acceptable values of -0.7% and 19.1%, respectively. As a case study, an enthalpy control algorithm with the real-time monitoring data was successfully implemented producing the damper position of the air handling unit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: According to a press release, the building sector accounts for about 40% of the global primary energy consumption. Energy savings can be achieved in the building sector by improving the building's dynamic energy performance in terms of sustainable construction management in the urban-based built environments (referred to as an "Urban Organism"). This study implements the concept of "dynamic approach" to reflect the unexpected changes in the climate and energy environments as well as in the energy policies and technologies. Research in this area is very significant for the future of the building, energy, and environmental industries around the world. However, there is a lack of studies from the perspective of the dynamic approach and the system integration, and thus, this study is designed to fill the research gap. This study highlights the state-of-the-art in the major phases for a building's dynamic energy performance (i.e., monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting phases), focusing on the operation and maintenance phase. This study covers a wide range of research works and provides various illustrative examples of the monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting of a building's dynamic energy performance. Finally, this study proposes the specific future developments and challenges by phase and suggests the future direction of system integration for the development of a carbon-integrated management system as a large complex system. It is expected that researchers and practitioners can understand and adopt the holistic approach in the monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting of a building's dynamic energy performance under the new paradigm of an "Urban Organism".

Abstract: This study investigates the steady state operation and performance of a 253 MW Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) that is based on the design and operating parameters of the existing Willem-Alexander plant in Buggenum, the Netherlands. For further performance optimization of such plants, an extensive base case model of the IGCC is developed and validated with actual process data. The model accurately predicts the mass flows, temperatures and pressures as well as a net efficiency of 42%. Exergy losses are experienced to the greatest extent in the gasifier and the combustion chamber of the gas turbine which indicates that efficiencies of mature IGCC's could be further optimized. To enhance the environmental performance of IGCC's, the specified model can be employed to simulate alternatives for biomass co-gasification and carbon capture technologies.

Abstract: It is known that the invisible hand - energy market can reflect the energy price. Follow this perspective, a net structure that every element can conduct mutually has been founded based on the causal relationships among energy price, energy supply and economic growth during a given economic period. Furthermore, a novel dynamic system model of energy price-energy supply-economic growth which can make sure the balanced development of energy market is proposed. Later, four types of regulatory strategies are offered with considerations of both the background of China's certain economic transforming periods and the visible hand of control policies. Then regulating effect of the energy market is obtained. Dynamic behavior of the system and its subsystems are analyzed by means of Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams. Evolutionary behavior of the energy market affected by changes of energy prices, energy supply and economic growth is described with the method of numerical simulation. A practical system of energy prices is achieved, based on the data of the total energy production, the GDP index, the energy price index in China between 1980 and 2010 and the use of artificial neural network. Model analysis indicates that economic growth will lead to increase of energy supply and there will be two turning points of energy supply in the rapid growth of the economy. Multiple regulatory strategies in the established system are investigated. It is shown that Strategy 1 (exploring new energy sources), Strategy 2 (enhancing the self-regulating market), Strategy 3 (industrial restructuring, appropriately lowering the speed of economic growth, and enhancing the systematic and scientific management) can all stabilize the energy market, but Strategy 4 (purely relying on administrative interventions) cannot stabilize the system, as it will only make the system stay in the state of cycle shocks. An evolutionary analysis is made to show the impacts of different control strengths under the same strategy and that of different control strategies on the energy intensity. It is shown that the regulating effect is periodic and takes time. Reasonable control efforts can effectively reduce the energy intensity, but excessive regulation will be counterproductive. In the short term, Strategy 2 is an effective means to reduce the energy intensity to 0.4886 in about two years. However, in the long term, Strategy 1 and Strategy 3 are effective means to reduce the energy intensity, which are 0.4221 and 0.4343. And they will take about twelve and six years respectively. In general, the expected effect, that is, reducing the energy intensity to 0.3425 in about seven years can be achieved on the premise of maximizing the autonomous function of the market (Strategy 2), exploring new energy sources (Strategy 1) and industrial restructuring (Strategy 3) with appropriate macro-control policies (Strategy 4).

Abstract: A dual-mode engine has been developed where in one mode all engine cylinders fire normally, providing locomotion for the vehicle. In the other mode, one cylinder of the engine is used to compress low pressure residential natural gas (NG), in multiple stages, to a standard U.S. compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle storage tank pressure of 248 bar [3600 psig]. This allows a natural gas vehicle (NGV) to be refueled anywhere there is access to the natural gas distribution network. Experimental studies were conducted on this prototype engine and are reported here. Knowledge gained from applying numerical models combined with empirical results led to the realization of a self-refueling natural gas vehicle. On the test stand, air (a surrogate for NG) was compressed by the engine to over 138 bar [2000 psig] filling an 11.8 GGE [140 L] tank in 150 min. On the vehicle platform, the integral compressor had an approximate refueling efficiency of 70%, with an electrical-equivalent parasitic load of 12.6%. Idling of non-compression cylinders and the distance between the compressor and the three-way valves used to control the compression staging were noteworthy sources of inefficiency within the system. At the conclusion of the project the vehicle powered by the dual mode engine was driven over 161 km [100 miles] using self-compressed natural gas which originated from the local utility.

Abstract: Thermostatically controlled electrical loads can provide valuable energy storage and are prime candidates for fast acting demand response (DR) that can be used to mitigate highly variable renewable power generation and limited availability of ramping resources. When conventional thermostats are retrofitted for real-time price DR control, significant control errors can arise, particularly in the form of dispatch control drift. This paper identifies the underlying causes and presents a new residential thermostat design that enables accurate aggregate load control. The new design gives rise to linear time-invariant models of aggregate load control and demand response, which facilitate the design of highly accurate load-based regulation services for electricity interconnections. Detailed simulation and performance studies coupling a residential house and feeder models are presented to show how consumer comfort and cost savings are achieved and how energy use is impacted for cities in three different climatic zones. During peak times, the new thermostat imparts the entire residential load an energy demand elasticity of about 10-25%. Larger demand elasticities could be achieved by extending the control strategy to other residential thermostatic loads. The proposed thermostat design can operate in the real-time distribution capacity auction system and can provide all the benefits associated with transactive systems, and in particular facilitate increased integration of renewable resources.

Abstract: Anaerobic digestion of food waste and distillers' grains with ethanol pre-fermentation (EP) at different inoculum-to-substrate ratios (ISRs) was investigated. With EP, the highest methane yield of 581.2 mL/g-VS was observed at ISR 2.5, with the methane yields of ISR 1.0 and ISR 0.4 being 41.8% and 71.7% lower. At the same ISR, the methane yield without EP (control group) was 143.2 mL/g-VS, 57.7% lower than that with EP. EP effectively alleviated inhibition by acidification, greatly reduced the duration of the lag phase, and markedly stimulated the growth of methanogens, compared with that of the control group. Thermodynamics analysis of various acidogenic fermentation patterns suggested that directing the acidogenic phase towards ethanol, instead of towards volatile fatty acids, allocates more potentially available energy for methanogens. Thus, EP prior to anaerobic digestion is a suitable way to stabilize an anaerobic digestion system even at a low ISR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The potential of the after-injection versus engine-out emissions, combustion noise and brake specific fuel consumption has been evaluated for a Euro 5 diesel engine with a reduced compression ratio (16.3:1). The engine has been fueled with conventional diesel fuel. In particular, the effects of injection strategies that feature either pilot and after-injection shots, or double-pilot and single-after injection shots, have been assessed experimentally, in the presence of high EGR fractions. Calibrations with triple and quadruple injection schedules have been optimized by means of a design of experiments procedure. The performance of the thus calibrated propulsion system has been compared with data from a previously optimized double injection schedule, characterized by a retarded main injection timing in order to intensify the premixed combustion. The experimental data refer to different steady-state working conditions that are representative of passenger car engine applications over the European homologation cycle. In-cylinder analyses of the pressure, heat release rate, temperature and emissions have been performed in order to have a better understanding of the effects of the implemented injection strategies on engine performance.
The substitution of the pilot-main injection schedule in the medium-high part-load zone of the NEDC region with a triple injection, featuring both pilot and after shots, has led to lower NOx and higher soot, while fuel consumption remains almost the same. In general, the EGR trade-off soot-NOx, bsfc-NOx, HC-NOx and CO-NO curves do not change to any significant extent when an after shot is added to the pilot-main injection train. Reductions in the combustion noise, which depend on the changes in the pilot injection parameters that result from the design of experiments procedure, can also be obtained, as a consequence of the addition of the after-injection to the pilot-main injection schedule. Pilot-pilot-main-after strategies guarantee improved NOx engine-out emissions and bsfc-NOx EGR trade-off curve at medium loads and speeds, compared to both pilot-pilot-main and pilot-main-after strategies, and allow combustion noise to be diminished significantly.

Abstract: Passive solar water heaters are extensively studied and used around the world. Nevertheless, little is known about thermal stratification in their storage tank as most research on these devices reports averaged temperatures and energy conversion efficiency. Here we address the issue by analyzing the impact of the slope on thermal behavior of the device at low tilt angles, of particular interest for sub-tropical regions. In the present work the effect of the tilt angle on flow patterns, energy conversion efficiency and the stratification effect was studied with experimental setups and tridimensional numerical simulations as well. The study was performed using a commercial "water in glass evacuated tube solar water heater" (WGET-SWH) with nominal capacity of 40 L and 8 evacuated tubes. Experiments were carried during four weeks varying the tilt angle of the collector. The data gathered during the clearest days were used to validate the tridimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. The numerical model was used to study the effect of several tilt angles (100, 27 and 45) with the same energy input. It was found that the tilt angle has significant effect on daily solar energy gain, flow patterns inside the storage tank and stratification. Nevertheless, it was found little impact on the thermal efficiency due to the low magnitude of heat losses though the vacuum tubes. Also, 100 tilt angle allowed to achieve significant higher temperatures and thermal stratification, along with a thermal inactive area at the bottom of the tank. Conversely, the content of the storage tank for the 45 tilt angle is fully mixed at the end of the heating process. This occurred mainly due to the relative position of the tubes' opening inside the tank and the mixing effect of the convective water flow. A non dimensional number to quantify the stratification effect is proposed and it was found an exponential dependence on the tilt angle. Some considerations regarding the use of WGET-SWHs on subtropical regions are made. No charge or discharge processes were considered in this work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Nowadays, simulation tools are available for calculating the thermal loads of multiple rooms of buildings, for given inputs. However, due to inaccuracies or uncertainties in some of the input data (e.g., thermal properties, air infiltrations flow rates, building occupancy), the evaluated thermal load may represent no more than just an estimate of the actual thermal load of the spaces. Accordingly, in certain practical situations, simplified methods may offer a more reasonable trade-off between effort and results accuracy than advanced software. Hence, despite the advances in computing power over the last decades, simplified methods for the evaluation of thermal loads are still of great interest nowadays, for both the practicing engineer and the graduating student, since these can be readily implemented or developed in common computational-tools, like a spreadsheet.
The method of Mackey and Wright (M&W) is a simplified method that upon values of the decrement factor and time lag of a wall (or roof) estimates the instantaneous rate of heat transfer through its indoor surface. It assumes cyclic behaviour and shows good accuracy when the excitation and response have matching shapes, but it involves non negligible error otherwise, for example, in the case of walls of high thermal inertia.
The aim of this study is to develop a simplified procedure that considerably improves the accuracy of the M&W method, particularly for excitations that noticeably depart from the sinusoidal shape, while not introducing a need for an excessive volume of data or complexity in the production of results.
In the first simplified procedure discussed in the paper, a full-featured excitation is decomposed into a Fourier series and then the wall's thermal behaviour is reconstructed from the application of the M&W method to each of the N sinusoidal components. Even though this established approach can lead to the most accurate results, given a sufficiently high N, it requires the knowledge of the decrement factor and time lag associated to each component of the Fourier series, which can represent a considerable amount of data.
The chief result of the research though is a novel procedure based on a parameter, gamma, that weigh-averages the approximate solution obtained by considering a single term Fourier decomposition of the excitation and the solution by considering the actual excitation. The procedure is more accurate than the original M&W method and will be of interest to researchers with the means of generating values of gamma for the walls which the end users of their research are interested in. It provides promising results for walls ranging from massive to negligible mass. It has been noticed that while using the same values of gamma that had been optimized for the wall facing east, acceptable results are also obtained when altered external excitations are imposed, namely due to intermittency of the direct solar radiation or due to a distinct value of the external heat transfer coefficient.

Abstract: Due to current and upcoming regulations to address the adverse impacts of particulate matter (PM) from shipping emissions, the maritime sector is required to find energy-efficient ways to comply mainly by using low fuel sulfur content (FSC) in regulated seas. We studied the PM emission from a research ship diesel engine with fuel switching capability, optimized for HFO used at cruising, operated at representative engine loads resulting to varying excess O-2 emission which was an indirect measurement of air-fuel mixture (lambda), using heavy fuel oil (HFO, 1.6 S (%m)) and diesel fuel (DF, <0.001 S (%m)). We determined the characteristics and temporal evolution of the PM by using the High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS) in combination with aethalometer, particle sizers, online gas phase, and filter measurements. The average emission factors were higher for HFO than for DF with relative percent differences of similar to 200, similar to 180, similar to 150, and similar to 145 for SO42-, inorganic elements, organic matter (OM), and PM2.5, respectively, while that for black carbon (BC) was similar for both fuels. The difference between HFO and DF in terms of carbonaceous emissions was higher at 100% and 25% than at 75% and 50% engine loads. The exhaust temperature (1) decreased with increasing lambda leading to the enhanced emission of OM in HFO and reduced OM and BC emission in DF. Contributions of hydrocarbons and,oxygenated hydrocarbons increased with lambda for HFO and decreased with DF. Gas phase total hydrocarbon (THC) was well correlated with BC only for HFO and OM and BC for DF. Overall, using a lower FSC reduced average PM emissions, however, engine load, and lambda were strongly linked to the characteristics and temporal evolution of major PM emissions. The information in this study may help the marine sector and policy-making process in evaluating and designing future solutions for shipping emission regulations and diagnostics.

Abstract: Although hydrothermal carbonization of biomass components is known to be mainly governed by reaction temperature, consistent reports on the effect and statistical significance of process conditions on hydrochar properties are still lacking. The objective of this research was to determine the importance and significance of reaction temperature, retention time and solid load on the properties of hydrochar produced from an industrial lignocellulosic sludge residue. According to the results, reaction temperature and retention time had a statistically significant effect on hydrochar ash content, solid yield, carbon content, O/C-ratio, energy densification and energy yield as reactor solid load was statistically insignificant for all acquired models within the design range. Although statistically significant, the effect of retention time was 3-7 times lower than that of reaction temperature. Predicted dry ash-free solid yields of attained hydrochar decreased to approximately 40% due to the dissolution of biomass components at higher reaction temperatures, as respective oxygen contents were comparable to subbituminous coal. Significant increases in the carbon contents of hydrochar led to predicted energy densification ratios of 1-1.5 with respective energy yields of 60-100%. Estimated theoretical energy requirements of carbonization were dependent on the literature method used and mainly controlled by reaction temperature and reactor solid load. The attained results enable future prediction of hydrochar properties from this feed-stock and help to understand the effect of process conditions on hydrothermal treatment of lignocellulosic biomass.

Abstract: The potential of pilot-pilot-main triple injection strategies versus engine-out emissions, combustion noise and brake specific fuel consumption has been assessed experimentally on a Euro 5 diesel engine with a reduced compression ratio (16.3:1). The engine has been fueled with conventional diesel fuel. The experimental tests on the engine have been carried out in a dynamometer cell under different steady state working conditions, that are representative of passenger car engine applications over the European homologation cycle. Furthermore, in-cylinder analyses of the pressure, heat-release rate, temperature and emissions have been performed in order to obtain more detailed knowledge on the cause-and-effect-relationships between the implemented injection strategies and the results of the experimental tests.
The implemented double-pilot injection engine calibrations have been optimized by means of the design of experiments procedure. The plotted data of the engine performance and emissions have been compared with data from the original double-injection schedule, characterized by a retarded main injection timing, in order to intensify the premixed combustion phase. The benefits and the disadvantages of the PCCI concept are preliminarily discussed, on the basis of the experimental pilot-main injection strategy results.
The substitution of the pilot-main injection schedule with the triple injection, for light engine loads and low engine speeds, has led to higher mean combustion pressures, lower heat release rates, shorter ignition delays and lower brake specific fuel consumption. Above all, a significant improvement in engine noise and in both CO and HC engine-out emissions has been achieved and the NO emission have been limited by the application of high EGR rates. When medium engine loads and speeds are analyzed, the considered double-pilot injection strategy allows the NO emissions to be reduced, compared to the baseline pilot-main injection schedule. However, the combustion noise does not improve and the soot deteriorates, even though the soot penalties are not relevant. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The quantitative tools and methods that have been developed to identify and cultivate industrial symbiotic exchanges in existing industrial parks to minimize overall energy and material consumption are reviewed. The issues relevant to adapting an existing park differs from those associated with constructing a new park using eco-industrial principles. Published literature was surveyed for methodologies which identify and establish viable inter-company exchanges for water, heat, power and materials. Studies which address issues associated with infrastructure alterations are specifically highlighted, as well as methods to quantify and manipulate any potential financial and/or ecological benefits gained by adopting proposed eco-industrial measures. Additional topics, such as network analysis, company motivation, confidentiality issues and introduction of new industries or facilities are included. This review surveys current quantitative methodologies that can be applied to the process of adapting established industrial park networks into eco-industrial park systems and case studies which are pertinent to this type of adaptation.

Abstract: This paper documents the magnitude of energy savings achievable in the field by retrofitting existing packaged rooftop air conditioner and heat pump units (RTUs) with advanced control strategies not ordinarily used for RTUs. A total of 66 RTUs on 8 different buildings were retrofitted with a commercially available advanced controller for improving operational efficiency. The controller features enhanced air-side economizer control, multi-speed fan control, and demand-controlled ventilation. Of the 66 RTUs, 18 are packaged heat pumps and the rest are packaged air conditioners with gas heat. The eight buildings cover four building types and four climate conditions. Based on the performance data collected for approximately 1 year, the normalized annual energy consumption savings ranged between 22% and 90%, with an average of 57% for all RTUs. The average fractional savings uncertainty was 12% at 95% confidence level. Normalized annual electricity savings were in the range between 0.47 kW h/h (kW h per hour of RTU operation) and 7.21 kW h/h, with an average of 2.39 kW h/h. RTUs greater than 53 kW and runtime greater than 14 h per day had payback periods less than 3 years even at electricity price of $0.05/kW h. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The Algae Cluster is a group of three European Commission funded projects, each building a different demonstration algae biofuel facility up to 10 hectares in size. Each project is carrying out an independent Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to understand the various environmental impacts of the biofuel production.
A major issue with LCA is that there is a high flexibility on defining metrics such as the boundary conditions, functional unit and impact categories. The LCA practitioners for these three projects have agreed upon a harmonised approach, with the intention of ensuring the projects are comparable. This paper details the logic behind this approach, and shares it with the community.
The purpose of this paper is to introduce the three algae demonstration projects and to present a harmonized methodology for LCA of algae biofuels. With this, work by different researchers may be compared more effectively, making it easier to measure the effectiveness of different strategies in algal biofuels with regard to sustainability.

Abstract: Coal comprises 70% of primary energy sources and 80% of electricity generation in China. This paper investigates the coal consumption-economic growth nexus in an integrated demand-supply framework over the period from 1978 to 2010. We incorporate the role of coal technology to explain the growth process. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds testing approach, we find improvement in the coal-to-electricity efficiency indicator, a proxy for coal technology, causing almost a 35% increase in real GDP in the long run. The Toda-Yamamoto causality test indicates unidirectional causality from coal consumption to economic growth, feedback effects both for coal-to-electricity efficiency indicator to economic growth and coal demand and openness to coal consumption. For a robustness check, we forecast the validity of the causal relationships beyond the sample horizon using the generalised forecast error variance decomposition method. Our analysis suggests that improving overall efficiency in coal sector will continue to play a significant role in maintaining sustainable growth in China in the long run. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The use of renewable technologies will increase with the requirement to meet carbon reduction targets. However, this must be done in a sustainable manner. This paper compares the impact of the current Lebanese electricity system with production of electricity from PV. This is the first paper to look at how the addition of PV to this system, and explores the potential impact. As many electricity networks in the region suffer from similar issues and have similar climates this research will not only inform the Lebanese system, but can be used to influence and inform impacts of other systems. It evaluates the environmental impact, and therefore the actual sustainability, of a 1.8 kWp monocrystalline Photovoltaic (PV) system with and without Lead-Acid batteries (PbA) compared to the existing centralised electricity production mix and decentralised diesel neighbourhood gensets. The analysis is rigorous as it is conducted using the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA), using the SimaPro software (Ecoinvent 2.2 database) and ReCiPe 2008 method for impact assessment. The environmental impacts of the PV technology are compared to that of the existing fossil fuel electricity generation mix. Results, using the functional unit of 1 kW h, indicate that the PV system, even when equipped with PbA batteries, has a lower environmental burden per delivered output compared to the Lebanese electricity mix, and even more so when decentralised diesel neighbourhood gensets are taken into account. The results of the analysis allows to calculate a series of parameters such as Global Warming Potential (GWP) (0.0402 kg CO2eq/kW h and 0.0389 kg CO2eq/kW h), Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) (4.41 MJ/kW h and 439 MJ/kW h), Gross Energy Requirement (GER) (1.23 and 1.22), Energy Pay-Back Time (EPBT) (16.9 years and 16.1 years), Carbon Dioxide Pay-Back Time (CO2eqPBT) (3.52 years and 3.21 years), and Net Energy Ratio (NER) (1.48 and 1.55) for the PV system with and without PbA batteries.

Abstract: Thermal performance of greenwalls, a critical and common concern, is regulated by solar irradiance vis-a-vis orientation and shading. A field experiment was conducted in humid-tropical Hong Kong to address the research question under typical summer-weather scenarios: sunny, cloudy and rainy. On a large circular concrete tank, climber-greenwall experimental plots were established with duplication in four cardinal compass directions. Air and infrared-radiometer surface temperature sensors monitored at different greenwall positions: ambient-air (control), bare-concrete-surface (control), vegetation-surface, behind-mesh-airgap, and behind-mesh-concrete surface. Pyranometers were installed vertically at four orientations and horizontally at tank-top (control) to monitor solar-energy input. Habitat verticality induces notable variations in solar-energy capture at four orientations by daily total, peak level, intensity, duration and timing. On sunny day, solar fraction reaching east side was only 37.1% of tank-top. Early morning sunshine striking east side nearly perpendicularly brings maximum intensity. South side facing the sun but at tangential incident angle has only 23.3% reception. Strong irradiance drives high control-surface temperature, but also induces notable vegetation-surface and adjacent ambient-air cooling by transpiration. A threshold solar intensity of about 300 Wm(-2) is necessary to impart notable cooling-effect. Summer-sunny day and rainy-day sunshine-burst episodes could satisfy this condition; cloudy day and rainfall periods with attenuated-diffused sunlight could not. Cloudy day and rainfall periods suppress cooling differences by orientation. Behind-mesh concrete surface is consistently cooler than control concrete surface in the three summer-weather scenarios. Behind-mesh-air remains warmer than ambient-air but cooler than two adjoining surfaces (vegetation and behind-mesh-concrete), indicating air-barrier effect and restricted air exchange between ambience and airgap. It implies that greenwall can bring bidirectional cooling, but transpiration cooling of anterior (ambient) air is more effective than shading and thermal-insulation cooling of posterior (airgap) air and concrete-surface. The findings could inform greenwall design to enhance ecosystem services for climate-change adaption and urban heat island amelioration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: One-step preparation of methyl levulinate from biomass was investigated. The process used was direct liquefaction under pressure in methanol using a 1 L autoclave. Bamboo, a lignocellulosic biomass, was liquefied using sulfuric acid in subcritical methanol. When sulfuric acid was used as the catalyst, a 30.75 wt% methyl levulinate yield could be obtained from bamboo at 200 degrees C after a reaction time of 120 min when the catalyst loading was 2.5 wt% per 60 g bamboo. In addition, microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, methyl glucoside and glucose were selected as model compounds for the liquefaction reaction so that the biomass to methyl levulinate reaction pathway could be investigated. The results suggested that lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable material that can be used to produce a high value-added fuel additive (methyl levulinate) by the direct liquefaction under pressure reaction process.

Abstract: Environmental impact is an essential aspect for the introduction of algae production systems. As information of large scale algae production is hardly available, process simulation is the only way to evaluate environmental sustainability in an early phase of process design. Simulation results allow the evaluation of production and design scenarios, and reveal the potential to improve the Life Cycle Performance of algae production systems. In this work, we discuss how choices in the process design of algae production systems (cultivation, biorefinery and the supply chain) advance LCA-results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We report for the first time on the use of water-continuous emulsions stabilized by a bio-based macromolecule in a compression-ignition diesel engine and compare their performance, combustion and emissions against the base fuels (diesel, biodiesel, and jet fuel). For this purpose, high internal phase ratio emulsions (70:30 fuel-to-water) were produced by mechanical emulsification using carboxymethylated wood lignin as stabilizer. Combusting experiments were performed with the engine operating at 2000 rpm under three loads (0, 1.26 and 3.26 bar brake mean effective pressure, BMEP). Engine performance, in-cylinder combustion, and exhaust emissions were monitored and compared for the fuels tested. At no load condition and when compared to the respective base (single phase) fuels, an increase in the indicated work was observed for diesel and biodiesel emulsions. Compared to the base fuels, the emulsions resulted in higher engine mechanical efficiency at 1.26 and 3.26 bar BMEP except for jet fuel emulsion at 1.26 bar. Additionally, they displayed a lower brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), if calculated on the basis of effective fuel content discounting emulsion water, and higher brake thermal efficiency. Compared to the base fuel, the respective emulsions generally presented lower peak in-cylinder pressure, lower heat release rates, and longer ignition delays at 1.26 bar and 3.26 bar BMEP; the opposite effect was observed at no-load conditions. Remarkably, a large reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions was noted in the combustion of the fuel emulsions, which was accompanied with a relatively higher carbon monoxide (CO) release at 1.26 and 3.26 bar (at 0 bar BMEP, the emulsions produced less CO emissions). The effect of emulsions on hydrocarbon emissions and smoke opacity depended on the fuel type and the engine load. Overall, it is concluded that while reports on fuel emulsions involve oil-continuous systems, the proposed water-continuous alternative represents an opportunity for diesel engines, whereby the fuel is dispersed as micrometric droplets for improved combustion and reduced emissions. At the same time, the fuel emulsion formulation takes advantage of the surface activity and high calorific value of widely available, inexpensive lignin stabilizers, making the proposed system a viable option towards cleaner or fully bio-based fuels.

Abstract: This paper proposes a modification to the classic p-median problem that considers the spatial distribution of supply resources and competition for them by potential facility locations. It is illustrated with a simplified case study to optimally locate community scale anaerobic digesters (ADs) in an area in the East Midlands in the UK. The modification evaluates the spatial distribution of the feedstocks needed by each potential AD unit and only includes new locations if their supply catchments do not overlap with the catchments of the current set of locations being considered. The modified algorithm is implemented using the Teitz and Bart search heuristic. This starts with an initial set of locations that it seeks to improve by swapping poor performing locations with better ones. In this case the modification takes account of the spatial distribution of the feedstocks for a typical AD recipe whilst seeking minimise demand weighted distance. The results demonstrate large improvements over the classic p-median model in location selection that eliminate the overlap of facility catchments. Some wider points relating to the robustness of many analyses reported in the bioenergy literature are discussed, with some observations about commonly found methodological deficiencies, before some areas for further research are suggested.

Abstract: Microalgae is being investigated as a renewable transportation fuel feedstock based on various advantages that include high annual yields, utilization of poor quality land, does not compete with food, and can be integrated with various waste streams. This study focuses on directly assessing the environmental impact of two different thermochemical conversion technologies for the microalgae-to-biofuel process through life cycle assessment. A system boundary of "well to pump" (WTP) is defined and includes sub-process models of the growth, dewatering, thermochemical bio-oil recovery, bio-oil stabilization, conversion to renewable diesel, and transport to the pump. Models were validated with experimental and literature data and are representative of an industrial-scale microalgae-to-biofuel process. Two different thermochemical bio-oil conversion systems are modeled and compared on a systems level, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis. The environmental impact of the two pathways were quantified on the metrics of net energy ratio (NER), defined here as energy consumed over energy produced, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Results for WTP biofuel production through the HTL pathway were determined to be 1.23 for the NER and GHG emissions of -11.4 g CO2-eq (MJ renewable diesel)(-1). Biofuel production through the pyrolysis pathway results in a NER of 2.27 and GHG emissions of 210 g CO2-eq (MJ renewable diesel)-1. The large environmental impact associated with the pyrolysis pathway is attributed to feedstock drying requirements and combustion of co-products to improve system energetics. Discussion focuses on a detailed breakdown of the overall process energetics and GHGs, impact of modeling at laboratory-scale compared to industrial-scale, environmental impact sensitivity to systems engineering input parameters for future focused research and development, and a comparison of results to literature.

Abstract: This paper describes a method of integrating decentralized energy systems at neighbourhood scale. The method is based on the energy hub concept, which describes and manages the relation between input and output energy flows and thus can be used to optimise energy consumption. The original energy hub concept is further developed to include decentralized and local energy technologies such as photovoltaics, biomass, or small hydro power, together with district heating systems, building and district conversion and storage technologies at neighbourhood level. Additionally, input from a building simulation tool for evaluating time-dependent buildings energy demand is included in the method. The proposed approach can be used to evaluate and size urban energy systems according to their energy-autonomy, economic and ecological performance. The advantage is that the energy supply systems and local energy storage systems can be evaluated in a combined way at district scale. The suggested method allows to lower peaks in energy demands of neighbourhoods on the electrical grid and to reduce the overall consumption. The developed method is finally applied on a case study for which future energy scenarios of different implementation scale are suggested. The area is located in a village in the mountains and contains 29 buildings. Suggested scenarios include decentralized and local renewable energy sources and district and small heating networks. Results show a variation of 52-98 tons of CO2 emissions, and an energy autonomy between 64% and 92%. In case of CO2 emissions, the best solution is given for a combination of multiple supply technologies and small networks which shows 46% lower emissions than for a scenario with only PV and biomass based systems.

Abstract: The trilateral cycle (TLC) is one of the most promising alternatives among the heat recovery-to-power technologies, due to its compact system configuration and high performance at relatively low compression work and low-to-moderate expander inlet temperature. These feats make the TLC beneficial for off-grid applications particularly in remote or offshore applications where power-to-weight ratio of the power plant is of significance. This study presents the thermodynamic performance simulation and design optimisation of the TLCs using unconventional working fluid for heat recovery-to-power generation from low-grade waste heat, which is considered for process development and integration of the TLC. Four system configurations, comprising the simple TLC, recuperated TLC, reheat TLC and regenerative TLC are analysed and compared their performance metrics. Based on the theory of steady-state steady-flow thermodynamics, the simulation models of the TLC power plants, corresponding to their thermodynamic processes are established and implemented using engineering equation solver. The results show that the thermal efficiencies of the simple TLC, recuperated TLC, reheat TLC and regenerative TLC employing n-pentane are 11.85-21.97%, 12.32-23.91%, 11.86-22.07% and 12.01-22.9% respectively at subcritical operating conditions with low-grade heat in the temperature limit of 393-473 K. These suggest that the thermal integration of the optimised design of the simple TLC enhanced heat exchange efficiencies as well as the performance metrics. A comparative study among these cycles shows that the proposed recuperated TLC achieved the best performance metrics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We propose a method for designing a local energy cooperative network (EneCoN) that uses new technologies for heating and power in a combined way. The method comprises six steps, including the generation of different technology options, energy balance modeling of the demand and supply, and multiobjective evaluation and optimization. As a decision-support tool, ternary diagrams are applied to analyze the effect of the mix of energy consumers in an EneCoN (i.e., residents, offices, or hospitals) on the objective function. The overall outcome of applying the method is a suggestion for the technology mix in the EneCoN that minimizes design objectives such as cost and environmental impacts with consideration of the mix of energy consumers as a design parameter. A case study was conducted on the installation of photovoltaic power generators, solar heat collectors, and fuel cells as new energy technologies in the target cities Tokyo, Sapporo, and Naha. Differences in the climate and energy demand profile were well reflected in the calculation, and different suggestions for the technology mix were obtained. The method also allowed good visualization of various complex design options (e.g., consumers, technology types, and the degree of combination) and can serve as a solid basis for designing energy systems.

Abstract: In the recent years, attempts to improve the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycles have been made. In order to enhance the energy management of the gas turbine cycle, a new integration concept has been proposed: integration of gas turbine cycle and forward osmosis desalination process. The combination of the gas turbine cycle and the forward osmosis (FO) desalination process basically implies the coupling of the waste heat from the gas turbine cycle to the draw solute recovery system in the FO process which is the most energy consuming part of the whole FO process. By doing this, a strong system that is capable of producing water and electricity with very little waste heat can be achieved. The feasibility of this newly proposed system was analyzed using UNISIM program and the OLI property package. For the analysis, the thermolytic draw solutes which has been suggested by other research groups have been selected and studied. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the integration system in order to understand and identify the key parameters of the integrated system. And the integrated system was further evaluated by comparing the gain output ratio (GOR) values with the conventional desalination technologies such as multi stage flash (MSF) and multi effect distillation (MED). The suggested integrated system was calculated to have a GOR of 14.8, while the MSF and MED when integrated to the gas turbine cycle showed GOR value of 12. It should also be noted that the energy utilization of the suggested integrated system is significantly higher by 27.1% and 63.8% than those of the MSF-gas turbine and MED-gas turbine systems, respectively. The noticeable enhancement in both the GOR and waste heat utilization of the suggested system resulted in 3.5 times higher water production rate than the MSF integrated system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper proposes a game-theoretic framework for economic operations of future residential distribution systems with high participation of distributed electricity prosumers. Recently, the large-scale grid integration of distributed renewable energy is becoming a promising solution to restructuring the current power grid infrastructure and ensuring the reliability of energy supply. The wide adoption of distributed renewable energy mainly depends on the participation level of residential consumers and prosumers. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to investigate the economic operations of this new, highly complex retail electricity market that potentially has millions of interactive endpoints. This paper identifies the new roles of utilities and distributed electricity prosumers in the future retail electricity market. The game-theoretic algorithms used to clear the retail electricity market price consider the group coalition scenarios of multiple electricity prosumers. Several numerical case studies are conducted to illustrate and validate the proposed framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Integrating a heat pump into a heat exchanger network (HEN) can effectively recover the low-grade heat and reduce energy consumption. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model on a HEN retrofit with a heat pump is proposed, with the goals of minimizing the total annual cost for the retrofit and maximizing the total annual CO2 emission reduction simultaneously. The Pareto front of these two objectives is obtained by solving the proposed model. Each point on the Pareto front corresponds to the optimal configuration of the heat pump and the process heat exchangers near the pinch of the HEN. The effect of the heat pump on the economic efficiency and CO2 emission reduction of the HEN are analyzed. The results indicate that integrating the heat pump into the HEN can improve the recovery of low-grade heat and reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the integration of the heat pump into a HEN could offset the benefits from CO2 emission reduction by energy savings, in which the CO2 emission reduction is restricted by a critical power input and a critical temperature rise. Consequently, rational installation and reasonable operation parameters of heat pump become significantly important to simultaneously ensure the reduction of CO2 emissions and energy savings in HEN retrofit.

Abstract: Latent heat storage (LHS) using phase change materials (PCM) is a promising technology for the effective use of solar and industrial exhaust heat. However, the heat transfer rate of an LHS system is severely limited by the low thermal conductivity of the PCM. Therefore, this paper describes the development of a high thermal conductivity phase change composite (PCC) with a percolating network of a high thermal conductivity filler. The relationship between the effective thermal conductivity of the FCC and the network structure of the filler was investigated. The FCC were prepared by the conventional melt-dispersion (MD) method and a novel hot-press (HP) method. Erythritol (melting point: 118 degrees C, thermal conductivity: 0.73 W m(-1) K-1) was used as the PCM, and carbon fiber (thermal conductivity: 900W m(-1) K-1 in the fiber direction) was used as the high thermal conductivity filler. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCC was measured by the laser flash method and the network structures were observed by energy dispersive spectroscopy using a scanning electron microscope. As a result, we observed that the percolating filler network in the PCC could be easily formed by the HP method, presenting a higher thermal conductivity with less filler additive than the FCC fabricated by the MD method. Additionally, we found that PCM raw materials with a high packing ratio accelerated the formation of the percolating filler network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, the pore size of macroporous Al2O3 tubular membranes were successfully shrunk by the coating of mesoporous silica aerogels on their surface. Fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) was successfully grafted on the surface of silica aerogel tubular membranes, resulting in a hydrophobic surface on the resulting membranes. The CO2 absorption flux of the FAS-modified silica aerogel tubular membrane reaches a stable value of approximately 0.6 mmol/m(2) s in one day of operation. Furthermore, the as-prepared FAS-modified silica aerogel tubular membranes can be used continuously to absorb CO2 for at least one day, and they can be reused in three consecutive cycles of CO2 absorption. The results of this study demonstrated that these FAS-modifled silica aerogel tubular membranes are not only durable but also reusable. The CO2 gases are almost absorbed completely (97% CO2 recovery) at liquid and gas flow rates of 500 and 200 sccm, respectively. Thus, these as-prepared silica aerogel tubular membranes with FAS modifications show promise for use in a large-scale CO2 absorption in a power plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) can be operated with a wide variety of fuels and in a large range of operating conditions. Taking advantage of high temperature and nickel based catalysts several compounds such as methane, ethanol and ammonia can be internally reformed or thermally decomposed producing hydrogen rich gas streams. In this study urea was investigated as a potential fuel for SOFC, since it is a widely available product in the fertilizers' market, safe to be handled and used, and can be recovered from biomass or water treatment plants as a byproduct. An additional pathway for green urea can be based on green hydrogen via electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources and CO2 recovered from carbon capture plants. Urea decomposition was studied and reproduced in the experimental activity to evaluate its effect on the performance of SOFCs. A gas stream, obtained by simulating decomposed urea with technical gases mixtures, was fed into an SOFC stack, varying the operational temperature and the steam to carbon ratio. Experimental results produced efficiencies higher than 40%. Based on experimental data a 0-D model was developed and operational conditions were expanded, reaching an overall efficiency of 60%.

Abstract: Many studies have used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to assess the environmental impacts and energetic suitability of microalgal biofuels. This paper presents a critical review focused on goal and scope, system boundaries, functional unit, Life Cycle Inventories (LCI) and environmental impacts of 41 LCA of algal biofuels. The comparison between these LCA has been made difficult by the heterogeneity of their underlying hypotheses and perimeters. Hence we propose to define methodological guidelines to harmonize results presentation in order to improve the validity of each new contribution and to ease its comparison to other studies. LCA allows detecting pollution transfers between production stages as well as between distinct environmental impacts. At the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) level, a special attention should be paid to the perimeter of the study (e.g. inclusion of infrastructures) and to the handling of the co-products (allocation or substitution). Moreover the inventory data have to be treated in a consistent way in order to guarantee the comparability of LCI between different studies. Hence we recommend that data of all the production steps should be given at a unit process level, i.e. the smallest element for which input and output data can be quantified. At the Life Cycle Impact Assessment level, other impacts than the greenhouse gases balance have to be taken into account, like impacts related to the use of fertilizers (acidification and eutrophication) and phytosanitary products (human toxicity and ecotoxicity), impacts of direct and indirect land use change, and water consumptions. Finally, as bio-fuel is aiming at replacing existing energy productions, an energy balance should always be carried out; the Cumulative Energy Demand Ratio offers a convenient framework in that regard.

Abstract: Bischofite is a by-product of the non-metallic mining industry. It has been evaluated as phase change material in thermal energy storage, but it shows little cycling stability, therefore in this paper the mixture of bischofite with an additive was studied. Since polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a PCM itself, in this paper PEG (with different molecular weights) is used as additive in a PCM (bischofite) to improve its thermal behaviour. Results show that adding 5% PEG 2 000 to bischofite gives a more cycling stable PCM without affecting its melting temperature neither decreasing significantly its heat of fusion. This research shows that mixing an inorganic PCM with an organic additive can be a good option to improve the thermal performance of the PCM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The primary objective of this study was to propose an innovative approach for collecting the solar thermal energy from the concept of solar chimneys for electricity generation via organic Rankine cycles (ORCs). The influences of several critical parameters on the thermal performance and outlet temperature of solar chimneys were investigated. The parameters measured from the experiment were substantially reduced using Taguchi method. In addition, the optimal configurations of the solar chimney was identified, which are high-transmissivity glass, rectangular-tubes absorber plate, tilt angle of 45, black polished surface, and airflow length of 4 m. The experimental results showed that the highest outlet temperature of air and heat collecting efficiency of solar chimneys were approximately 125 degrees C and 65%, respectively.
In a feasibility analysis of ORC application, the system provides to the buildings with 12 kW h/day of electricity, and the area of the collector required was 41.0 m(2). The experimental results indicated that the proposed method is feasible for solar chimney provide acceptable quality and quantity of heat for ORC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: It is generally accepted that only flexible CHP plants could be a viable option in an electrical system with high penetration of variable renewables. Variable power-to-heat-ratios and decoupled power and heat generation will be basic requirements. Currently, the most common way to fulfill these specifications is the use of heat storage devices, whereas wet operation of gas turbines is an alternative way to achieve both goals. The current work is an analysis of a micro gas turbine adapted to operate with steam injection. A thermodynamic model is developed and a typical apartments building in Berlin, Germany is chosen as a case study. The study presumes the existence of a micro gas turbine and analyzes the results of its adaptation for wet operation. The environmental and economic performance of the new system is compared to that of its commercial counterpart. It is shown that the retrofitted turbine has longer annual operation time and higher electrical energy generation. The retrofit also proves to be an attractive investment for the German CHP market with internal rates of return reaching almost 20%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The volatility and complex forecasting methods of fluctuating wind generation is a growing issue. From a system perspective, this introduces additional issues regarding demand and supply balancing and also creates the need for more balancing capacity. One of the best supplements to volatile wind nature is certainly hydro generation, especially in complement with pumped storage technology. Water can provide large backup capacity and flexibility to balance wind deviations. In this research short-run hydro-wind coordination is addressed and an approach based on the duality method of a convex programming is proposed, for valuing the impact of variable wind generation on the water shadow price of hydro generation. In such hydro-wind coordination, hydro generation is committed for the differences between the actual and forecasted wind generation. Obtaining water shadow prices is important for determining short-run marginal cost and economic feasibility assessment of this coordination. The proposed method solves short-run profit maximization, as its primal problem, and determines the values of limited hydro and wind resources, as its dual problem, using a linear programming approach. The coordination between the Vinodol hydropower plant and the Vrataru a wind farm in Croatia is presented as a case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ray tracing software, digital close range photogrammetry and the Monte-Carlo ray-tracing method have proven to be precise and efficient measurement techniques for the assessment of the shape accuracies of solar concentrators and their components. This paper presents a new method and results for the geometric aspect of a focal image for a Scheffler-Type Solar Concentrator (STSC) using ray tracing, digital close range photogrammetry and the Monte-Carlo ray-tracing method to establish parameters that allow for the design of the most suitable absorber and receiver geometry for coupling the STSC to a Stirling engine. The results of the ray tracing software, digital close range photogrammetry and Monte-Carlo ray tracing technique in STSC are associated with a Stirling receiver. When using the method to perform simulations, we found that the most suitable solar image geometry has an elliptical shape and area of 0.0065 m(2) on average. Although this result is appropriate, the geometry of the receiver is modified to fit an absorber and cavity receiver to improve the heat transfer by radiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The increasing economic advantage of replacing traditional two-speed fans with variable-frequency drive (VFD) fans has been gaining popularity in the industry. However, concerns regarding frequent ON/OFF switching and the lack of a well-devised controller have discouraged widespread adoption. In this study, a temperature zone method is proposed to replace the set-point method of fan control. Additionally, the highest output water temperature allowed in the process is set as the upper limit of a zone in order to further conserve energy. Both strategies are comprehensively analyzed for a virtual cooling tower that uses operational data from an existing VFD-fan-based cooling tower system in Taiwan. The results show energy savings of 38% for a 0.75 degrees C zone without increasing the ON/OFF switching frequency. The proposed strategies were further verified via an on-line field experiment. The proposed methods can be universally and easily applied to any existing cooling tower, and have significant implications for energy conservation if adopted globally. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: We illustrate the importance of disaggregating electricity generation when considering responses to environmental policies. We begin by reviewing various approaches to electric sector modelling in Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, and then clarify and expand upon the structure and calibration of the "technology bundle" approach. We also simulate the proposed U.S. Clean Power Plan and show how a disaggregate electricity sector can change results. Our simulations indicate that both the ability to switch between generation technologies and the manner of aggregation in electricity production are important for quantifying the economic costs of the plan. A model that does not consider the heterogeneity of generation technologies can possibly underestimate the size of the carbon price but overestimate the economic cost of mitigation.

Abstract: Sustainable mass production of algal biofuels requires a reduction in nutrient demand and efficient conversion into fuels of all biomass including lipid-extracted algal residues (LEA). This study evaluated methane production, nutrient recovery and recycling from untreated and enzymatically pretreated Nannochloropsis LEA using semi-continuous anaerobic digestion (AD). Additionally, this process was compared to methane generation from whole Nannochloropsis alga (WA) and thermally pretreated WA. The methane production from untreated LEA and WA reached up to 0.22 L and 0.24 L per gram of biomass volatile solids (VS), respectively, corresponding to only 36-38% of the theoretical potential. Additionally, observed VS reduction was only 40-50% confirming biomass recalcitrance to biodegradation. While enzymatic treatment hydrolyzed up to 65% of the LEA polysaccharides, the methane production increased by only 15%. Alternatively, WA thermal pretreatment at 150-170 degrees C enhanced methane production up to 40%. Overall, an integrated process of lipid conversion into biodiesel coupled with LEA conversion into methane generates nearly 40% more energy compared to methane production from WA, and about 100% more energy than from biodiesel alone. Additionally, the AD effluent contained up to 60-70% of the LEA phosphorus content, 30-50% of the nitrogen, sulfur, calcium and boron, 20% of the iron and cobalt, and 10% of manganese, zinc and copper, which can partially replace chemical fertilizers during algal cultivation. Consequently, supplementation of Nannochloropsis cultures with 5% AD effluent was optimal for a high algal growth rate. Therefore, coupling biodiesel and methane production provides significant energy advantages along with sustainability and economic benefits from nutrient recycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Understanding synthesis gas (syngas) oxidation on SOFC anodes is an important step towards commercialising SOFCs operating on realistic fuels. Using pattern anodes, we study electrochemical oxidation of H-2 and CO on nickel and ceria pattern anodes with and without water. Further, H-2/CO mixtures are studied in dry and wet conditions. For all the compositions studied here, the polarisation resistance on ceria pattern anodes is lower than nickel pattern anodes indicating that the reaction zone is not limited to the three phase boundary. Also, in most cases the activation energy is also lower indicating ceria can be a superior catalyst. It is found that the polarisation resistance with CO is higher than that with hydrogen for both ceria and nickel pattern anodes. For wet CO mixtures there is a possibility that water gas shift reaction can play an important role. Addition of H-2 brings about a dramatic decrease in the polarisation resistance in case of dry H-2/CO mixtures for both nickel and ceria pattern anodes. This indicates that hydrogen is preferentially oxidised so much so that it is possible that only hydrogen is oxidised with CO acting as a diluent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Triacylglyceride (TAG) recovery from algal biomass is primarily limited by the rigid algal cell envelope (cell wall and cell membrane). In this work, the effect of free nitrous acid (FNA) pre-treatment on TAG recovery from algal biomass with six different FNA concentrations is reported. Results show that at a range of low FNA concentrations (0.24-2.25 mg HNO2-N L-1) TAG recovery was strongly enhanced with increasing FNA concentration. An FNA concentration of around 2 mg HNO2-N L-1 resulted in a 3.3-fold increase in fatty acid recovery over untreated algae, but higher FNA concentrations (13.49 and 26.98 mg HNO2-N L-1) were detrimental to TAG recovery. Analysis of the fatty acid profile revealed that the higher FNA concentrations caused a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Also, the ratio of extracted fatty acids to total lipids was significantly reduced when high FNA concentration were applied, and only non-fatty acid lipids potentially benefited from more intense FNA pre-treatments.

Abstract: Considerable research efforts in Building Optimization and Control (BOC) have been directed toward the development of "plug-and-play" HOC systems that can achieve energy efficiency without compromising thermal comfort and without the need of qualified personnel engaged in a tedious and time-consuming manual fine-tuning phase. In this paper, we report on how a recently introduced Parametrized Cognitive Adaptive Optimization - abbreviated as PCAO - can be used toward the design of both model-based and model-free "plug-and-play" BOC systems, with minimum human effort required to accomplish the design. In the model-based case, PCAO assesses the performance of its control strategy via a simulation model of the building dynamics; in the model-free case, PCAO optimizes its control strategy without relying on any model of the building dynamics. Extensive simulation and real-life experiments performed on a 10-office building demonstrate the effectiveness of the PCAO-BOC system in providing significant energy efficiency and improved thermal comfort. The mechanisms embedded within PCAO render it capable of automatically and quickly learning an efficient HOC strategy either in the presence of complex nonlinear simulation models of the building dynamics (model-based) or when no model for the building dynamics is available (model-free). Comparative studies with alternative state-of-the-art BOC systems show the effectiveness of the PCAO-BOC solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This kind of energy generation systems are based on the combination of one or more RES allowing to complement the weaknesses of one with strengths of another and, therefore, reducing installation costs with an optimized installation. To do so, optimization methodologies are a trendy mechanism because they allow attaining optimal solutions given a certain set of input parameters and variables. This work is focused on the optimal sizing of hybrid grid-connected photovoltaic-wind power systems from real hourly wind and solar irradiation data and electricity demand from a certain location. The proposed methodology is capable of finding the sizing that leads to a minimum life cycle cost of the system while matching the electricity supply with the local demand. In the present article, the methodology is tested by means of a case study in which the actual hourly electricity retail and market prices have been implemented to obtain realistic estimations of life cycle costs and benefits. A sensitivity analysis that allows detecting to which variables the system is more sensitive has also been performed. Results presented show that the model responds well to changes in the input parameters and variables while providing trustworthy sizing solutions. According to these results, a grid-connected HRES consisting of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power technologies would be economically profitable in the studied rural township in the Mediterranean climate region of central Catalonia (Spain), being the system paid off after 18 years of operation out of 25 years of system lifetime. Although the annual costs of the system are notably lower compared with the cost of electricity purchase, which is the current alternative, a significant upfront investment of over $10 M - roughly two thirds of total system lifetime cost - would be required to install such system.

Abstract: The efficiency and power density of gas compression and expansion are strongly dependent on heat transfer during the process. Since porous media inserts can significantly increase heat transfer surface area, their addition to a liquid piston compressor/expander has been hypothesized to reduce the time to complete the compression or expansion process and hence the power density for a given thermodynamic efficiency; or to increase the thermodynamic efficiency at a fixed power density. This paper presents an experimental investigation on heat transfer with porous inserts during compression for a pressure ratio of 10 and during expansion for a pressure ratio of 6. A baseline case without inserts and five cases with different porous inserts are tested in a compression experiment: 3 interrupted ABS inserts with plate spacing of 2.5, 5, and 10 mm and 2 aluminum foam inserts sized with 10 and 40 pores per inch. The 2.5 mm and 5 mm interrupted plate inserts were also tested in expansion experiments. Porous inserts are found, in compression, to increase power-density by 39-fold at 95% efficiency and to increase efficiency by 18% at 100 kW/m(3) power density; in expansion, power density is increased three fold at 89% efficiency, and efficiency is increased by 7% at 150 kW/m(3). Surface area increase is found to be the predominant cause in the improvement in performance. Thus, a liquid piston compressor/expander together with a porous medium may be used in applications requiring high compression ratios, high efficiencies, and high power density such as in an open-accumulator compressed air energy storage (CAES) system or a compressor for compressed natural gas (CNG).

Abstract: This paper aims to provide more accurate results in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of electricity generation from wheat straw grown in Spain through the inclusion of parameter uncertainty and variability in the inventories. We fitted statistical distributions for the all the parameter that were relevant for the assessment to take into account their inherent uncertainty and variability. When we found enough data, goodness of fit tests were performed to choose the best distribution for each parameter and, when this was not possible, we adjusted triangular or uniform distributions according to data available and expert judge. To obtain a more complete and realistic LCA, we considered the consequences of straw exportation for the agricultural system, specially the loss of soil organic carbon and the decrease of future fertility. We also took into account all the inputs, transformations and transports needed to generate electricity in a 25 MWe power plant by straw burning. The inventory data for the agricultural, the transport and the transformation phases were collected considering their most common values and ranges of variability for the Spanish case. We used Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis to obtain global warming potential (GWP) and fossil energy (FOSE) consumption of the system. These results were compared with those of the electricity generated from natural gas in Spanish power plants, as fossil reference energy system. Our results showed that for the majority of the simulations electricity from wheat straw biomass combustion produced less greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and consumed less fossil energy than electricity from natural gas. However, only 58% of the simulations achieved the sustainability threshold of 60% GHG savings proposed by the European Union (EU). Our analysis showed that agricultural field works and the loss of soil organic carbon due to straw exportation were the most important phases for FOSE consumption and GWP respectively. According to parameters sensitivity analysis, the loss of soil organic carbon was completely dependent on the isohumic coefficient and the soil carbon content factor values. Due to this fact, local and specific estimates of these parameters are relevant tasks to be performed in order to reduce uncertainties and provide a definitive answer to the compliance of the EU sustainability criteria.

Abstract: Selecting optimum windows in heating dominated climates is a complex task because of the inherent trade-off between their U-value and solar heat gain coefficient. In addition, the use of shades is known to reduce heat losses, but they are rarely selected for this intent and considered as an integrated fenestration system at the design stage. This paper presents a method for selecting optimum fenestration systems (windows with shades) to maximize the annual net energy balance. The method has the capability to simulate a one or two layer shading system with one exterior and/or one interior planar shade(s). This methodology generates 2D schematics indicating the net energy balance of different fenestration systems. Such schematics are useful at an early design stage when there is a need to compare different design options for different orientations on a relative basis.
Diagrams are presented for five glazings with an interior roller shade, an exterior roller shutter and a combination of both, for the four cardinal orientations for the city of Montreal, Canada. A comparison of simulated and experimental U-values of four shading devices indicates results reasonably close to each other. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Semiclathrate-based CO2 capture from flue gas in the presence of various quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) such as tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB), tetra-n-butyl ammonium chloride (TBAC), and tetra-n-butyl ammonium fluoride (TBAF) was investigated with a primary focus on the thermodynamic, kinetic, and spectroscopic aspects. The thermodynamic stability of the CO2 (20%) + N-2 (80%) + QAS semiclathrates was examined with an isochoric method using a high pressure reactor as well as with dissociation enthalpy measurement using a high pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter (HP mu-DSC). The TBAF semiclathrate with CO2 (20%) + N-2 (80%) showed the most significant equilibrium pressure reduction at a specified temperature. However, the TBAC semiclathrate had the highest gas uptake and steepest CO2 concentration change in the vapor phase, which indicates the largest gas storage capacity for CO2 capture. CO2 was observed to be preferentially captured and enriched to approximately 60% in the semiclathrate phase. The CO2 selectivity was independent of the type of QASs used. The Raman spectroscopic results revealed that both CO2 and N-2 are enclathrated in the small cages of the QAS semiclathrates and that the enclathration of guest gas molecules does not change the structure of the semiclathrates.

Abstract: An energy-input analysis of the life-cycle of microalgal cultivation systems was performed to study the oil-rich biomass production from fast-growing microalgae, for biodiesel production purposes. We estimated and compared the energy demands for the algal biomass cultivation in open-ponds (OP) with that required in closed-system photobioreactors (PBR) based on the new technologies. We also present the best microalgal candidates that show the highest biomass productivity and lipid yield indoors (laboratory scale), and discuss their potential to be used for full-scale biodiesel production. The results show that the energy requirements are highly dependent on the final mass concentration and/or using industrial wastes, with PBR cultivation being the largest energy consumer. Our offered scenario to minimize energy inputs and to increase algal-oil yields considers the most ideal cases, which could be the most promising model for energy-efficient biofuel production. Although biodiesel production by any of these systems is still not economically competitive with fossil fuel, recent suggestions on how to increase the efficiency of both systems are discussed, based on our energy-input assessment, with a critical evaluation of all stages for large-scale production of oil-rich microalgal biomass.

Abstract: The annual productivity of Tetraselmis suecica in a 1-ha Green Wall Panel-II (GWP-II) plant in Tuscany (Italy) is 36 t (dry weight) ha(-1) year(-1), which corresponds to an energy output of 799 GJ ha(-1) year(-1). The energy inputs necessary to attain that productivity amount to 1362 GJ ha(-1) year(-1), mainly given by the embodied energy of the reactor (about 30%), mixing (about 40%), fertilizers (11%) and harvesting (10%). The Net Energy Ratio (NER) of T. suecica production is thus 0.6. In a more suitable location (North Africa) productivity nearly doubles, reaching 66 t ha(-1) year(-1), but the NER increases only by 40% and the gain (difference between output and inputs) remains negative. In a GWP-II integrated with photovoltaics (PV), the NER becomes 1.7 and the gain surpasses 600 GJ ha(-1) year(-1). Marine microalgae cultivation in a GWP plant, in a suitable location, can attain high biomass productivities and protein yields 30 times higher than those achievable with traditional crops (soya). When the GWP reactor is integrated with PV, the process attains a positive energy balance, which substantially enhances its sustainability. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study evaluated the feasibility of a chemical process which uses desalination brine to convert CO2 into useful sodium bicarbonate. The process is based on the integration of a modified Solvay process with conventional amine based post-combustion carbon dioxide capture for the simultaneous capture and conversion of CO2 into solid bicarbonates. A range of amine solvents were evaluated to select the most suitable solvent for the process. Then the effects of parameters such as temperature, brine concentration and amine concentration on the carbonation step of the process were evaluated. Moreover, different techniques for recovering the amine from the chloride rich solution were proposed and investigated.
The sterically hindered amine, 2-amino, 2-methyl propanol (AMP), was found to be the best alcohol amine for the process and the CO2 absorption step was found to be significantly improved at lower temperatures, high brine concentrations and moderate amine concentration. For AMP, the optimum concentration was found to be 30 wt%. Finally, the amine recovery technique tested showed promise and could be optimized further to give better results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This review paper deliberates the important works on the modelling and parameters estimation of photovoltaic (PV) cells for PV simulation. It provides the concepts, features, and highlights the advantages and drawbacks of three main PV cell models, namely the single diode Rs-, Rp- and the two-diode. For the parameter estimation techniques, both the analytical and the soft computing approach are covered. A critical evaluation is carried out to summarize the performance of the models, while at the end, a summary of the future trend and direction of research is given. Since the literature on this subject is very large and dispersed, the availability a single cohesive and comprehensive document on the subject matter is crucial in order to piece the information together and understand the bigger picture. Therefore it is envisaged that this work will be convenient for new entrants as well as experienced researchers and practitioners to update their knowledge in the latest development in the area of PV modelling and simulation.

Abstract: An innovative technique to encapsulate PCMs that melt in the 120-350 degrees C temperature range is presented. The developed technique does not require a sacrificial layer to accommodate the volumetric expansion of the PCMs on melting. The encapsulation consists of coating a non-reactive polymer over the PCM pellet followed by deposition of a metal layer by a novel non-vacuum metal deposition technique. The fabricated capsules have survived more than 2200 thermal cycles, which is equivalent to about seven years of service in a thermal energy storage system. Thermophysical properties of the PCMs were investigated by DSC/TGA, IR and weight change analysis. Thermal cycling test showed no significant degradation in these properties at any stage of testing.

Abstract: Wind energy is becoming a significant source of generation in many countries because of its zero fuel cost and no air pollution. Due to integration of large-scale wind power in conventional grids, synchronous generators are being economically replaced. Modern wind farms are based on power electronics interface; and unlike synchronous generators, they do not have inherent frequency support capability. So, in a combined synchronous and non-synchronous machine based power system, it has always been a concern for a network operator to maintain system frequency within acceptable limits following a major disturbance. From power system security point of view, wind penetration can be limited by frequency response criteria. Up to now, several methodologies have been proposed to estimate maximum threshold of wind integration. However, none of them recommends how a system operator could be immediately informed about a secured wind penetration limit, as soon as generation profile is known. This paper proposes a new estimation tool of maximum wind penetration level from the frequency response adequacy point of view. Available system information viz, inertia and headroom are used as input parameters in the developed tool. Output of this tool will provide the highest margin of wind power that can be integrated at a particular load condition without violating frequency response constraints. The proposed technique is applied and analysed for a 250 bus, 65 machine Australian electricity network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Bioenergy (i.e., bioheat and bioelectricity) could simultaneously address energy insecurity and climate change. However, bioenergy's impact on climate change remains incomplete when land use changes (LUC), soil organic carbon (SOC) changes, and the auxiliary energy consumption are not accounted for in the life cycle. Using data collected from Belgian farmers, combined heat and power (CHP) operators, and a life cycle approach, we compared 40 bioenergy pathways to a fossil-fuel CHP system. Bioenergy required between 0.024 and 0.204 MJ (0.86 MJ(th) + 0.14 MJ(el))(-1), and the estimated energy ratio (energy output-to-input ratio) ranged from 5 to 42. SOC loss increased the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residue based bioenergy. On average, the iLUC represented similar to 67% of the total GHG emissions of bioenergy from perennial energy crops. However, the net LUC (i.e., dLUC + iLUC) effects substantially reduced the GHG emissions incurred during all phases of bioenergy production from perennial crops, turning most pathways based on energy crops to GHG sinks. Relative to fossil-fuel based CHP all bioenergy pathways reduced GHG emissions by 8-114%. Fluidized bed technologies maximize the energy and the GHG benefits of all pathways. The size and the power-to-heat ratio for a given CHP influenced the energy and GHG performance of these bioenergy pathways. Even with the inclusion of LUC, perennial crops had better GHG performance than agricultural and forest residues. Perennial crops have a high potential in the multidimensional approach to increase energy security and to mitigate climate change. The full impacts of bioenergy from these perennial energy crops must, however, be assessed before they can be deployed on a large scale. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Hydrogen has been widely researched as a promising alternative fuel. Steam methane reforming (SMR) coupled with pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is one of the most dominant processes for hydrogen production. In order to reduce the energy consumption, a novel energy saving SMR-PSA H-2 production process by combining heat integration technology has been put forward. In SMR section, the waste heat of reformer and water-gas-shift (WGS) reactors is recovered to pre-heat feed gas and H2O. In the view of exergy, a compressor is used to achieve a well heat pairing of sensible and latent heat between hot and cold streams. In PSA section, the generated adsorption heat is recovered by heat pump and reused for regeneration of sorbent. In the total process, optimal heat coupling between hot and cold streams is realized. The simulation results indicated that the SMR and PSA sections in the optimized hydrogen production process can save 55.77 klimol H-2 and 6.01 kJ/mol H-2, respectively. The total energy consumption of the novel SMR-PSA process can be reduced to 39.5% that of the conventional process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, a chance-constrained two-stage fractional optimization (CTFO) method is proposed for planning regional energy systems in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Through simultaneously integrating two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), chance-constrained programming (CCP), and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques into a linear fractional programming (LFP) framework, CTFO can effectively tackle multiobjective and capacity-expansion issues, as well as uncertainties described as probability distributions in the constraints and objectives. Based on the developed CTFO method, a chance-constrained two-stage fractional regional energy model (CTFO-REM) is developed in this study for supporting energy management in the province of British Columbia. Conflicts between environmental protection that maximizes the renewable energy resource utilization and economic development that minimizes the system cost can be effectively addressed through the CTFO-REM model without setting a factor for each objective. The results also indicate that the CTFO-REM model can facilitate dynamic analysis of the interactions among efficiency, policy scenarios, economic cost, and system reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Algal biomass is appreciated as an essential bioenergy feedstock owing to the rapid growth rate of algal cells and the capacity to harbor substantial quantities of biochemicals via CO2 biosequestration for biofuel production. Amongst the various thermochemical technologies for converting algal biomass to biofuels, Subcritical Water Extraction (SWE) demonstrates significant capacity for generating liquid transportation fuels from algae with minimal environmental impacts. The SWE process expends pressurized water to produce biocrude or bio-oil as well as aqueous, solid, or gaseous by-products. However, the existence of high levels of heteroatoms in biocrude hinders its application in internal combustion engines, and this has triggered studies into parametric characterization of biocrude production from algal biomass. This article comprehensively reviews the process principles, optimal conditions, engineering scale-up and products development to ascertain the viability of an industrial-scale SWE process for biofuel production from algae.

Abstract: In this work, an exergy analysis of discharging multi-tank thermal energy storage systems with constant heat extraction is studied. Theoretical models are developed to analyze the effect of the induced stratification through storage division into several tanks for different system configurations: multi-tank systems with even mass distribution, and two-tank systems with uneven and variable mass distribution. The instantaneous and the process efficiencies are defined to assess the performance of the system as function of operation parameters. For two- and four-tank systems with mass evenly distributed, efficiency increments around 4% and 7%, respectively, are possible. For two-tank systems, higher efficiencies are accomplished for short times when the mass is unevenly distributed and larger amount of the mass is in the hotter tank. For longer times, the even distributed mass situation provides the highest performance. To achieve superior efficiency of two-tank systems during the entire timespan, a time varying mass distribution chi = 0.5(1 + e-2t '') is proposed. Finally, the energy losses as well as the pumping effects on the performance of one- and two-tank systems are analyzed. It is found that, both, the pumping effects and the energy losses are generally negligible and the efficiency can be improved dividing the storage system, rather than increasing the mass flow rate.

Abstract: Applications involving the use of thermoelectric materials can be found in many different areas ranging from thermocouple sensors, portable coolers, to solar power generators. Generally, they can be subdivided by the direction of energy conversion. While the Peltier effect is used in solid-state refrigeration, the Seebeck effect is responsible for the conversion of temperature gradients into electrical voltage in energy harvesting systems. However, this paper proposes a novel approach to the use of thermoelectric couples, treating them as variable insulators in thermal systems. Here, we demonstrate that thermal conductivity in thermoelectric materials can be externally controlled by electrical parameters such as electrical load or DC voltage in passive and active systems, respectively. Active mode is a good solution when a complete insulation or a high control of thermal conductivity is needed. Passive mode permits a thermal conductivity increment of 1 + ZT times with respect to semiconductor initial thermal conductivity. Results open new doors and new opportunities for thermoelectric materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper the possible replacement of conventional metallic heat exchangers with plastic components is investigated with reference to low size Organic Rankine Cycles, aiming at a reduction of the plant investment cost.
A thermodynamic optimization of a 20 kW regenerative ORC plant, representative of a low temperature (<140 degrees C) heat recovery application, has been carried out according to the presently available data for plastic shell and tubes heat exchangers offered on the market.
N-heptane was selected as the working fluid, thanks to the capability to operate within the pressure limits for evaporation and condensation processes imposed by the adoption of plastic components. Finally, the potential economic benefit of the plastic solution in comparison with conventional heat exchangers made of carbon steel was evaluated for the whole plant; the case of enhanced materials adoption, which is mandatory for the evaporator in presence of corrosive heat source media, was also considered.
It turns out that advantages of the proposed solution become appreciable whenever the presence of corrosive heat source media requires the use of materials other than carbon steel. For instance, for a plant availability of 5000 h/year and discount rate of 10%, we obtain a cost of the produced electricity of 94.8 $/MW h, 95.4 $/MW h, 101.5 $/MW h, and 118.9 $/MW h respectively for plastic, carbon steel, stainless steel and titanium solutions.

Abstract: Cycle aging of commercial 40 A h pouch-type lithium-ion cells with NMC/graphite chemistry was studied at different cycling temperatures (room temperature, +45 degrees C, and +45 degrees C charge/+65 degrees C discharge). Aging was observed as capacity fade and resistance increase, and the aging mechanisms were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem analysis, where visual inspection and thickness measurements were employed together with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses. It was observed that elevated temperatures resulted in accelerated capacity fade, especially for the +45 degrees C/+65 degrees C condition. SEI-layer growth and lithium plating, discovered in cell disassembly, were attributed to be the main mechanisms responsible for capacity loss. In addition to the capacity fade, resistance increase was observed both in ohmic and polarization resistances. The ohmic resistance growth was attributed to lack of electrolyte and increased separator resistance. Polarization resistance evolution during cycling was similar at room temperature and at +45 degrees C, but different at the +45 degrees C/+65 degrees C condition. It was concluded that post-mortem analysis is essential for attributing the cycle testing and impedance spectroscopy results to different components and processes inside the cell. For example, the lithium plating phenomenon could not have been predicted or discovered without disassembling the cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Inspired by energy storage systems for peak load shifting (PLS), this study proposes a PLS utilization mode of electricity-generating coal gas resources for the steel industry in China. The proposed mode can help the steel industry save electricity bills (2.4%) through the introduction of a time-of-use tariff. Data of a steel enterprise are used to prove the economic benefit of the coal gas utilization mode. Given that China produces more than half of converter steel of the total production worldwide, their coal gas resources are abundant. The PLS utilization mode will have a great effect on balancing the power grid. A simulated operation model for PLS coal-fired power units is used to calculate the energy conservation and emission reduction effect of coal-fired power plants under different scenarios. The annual coal savings are 1.7-3.1%, and the annual SO2 and NOx emission reductions are 2.9-12.4% and 44.6-14.1% of the total reduction amount of the steel industry in China, respectively.

Abstract: This work aims to evaluate the integration of a parabolic trough solar field in a feedwater heating scheme with a sugarcane bagasse plant located in Brazil. The sugarcane facility is equipped with a cogeneration cycle that uses a regenerative feedwater heating system. Superheated steam is expanded in parallel in a back-pressure (BPST) and in a condensing-extraction (CEST) steam turbine. Solar integration was evaluated to displace the high pressure steam extraction of CEST by preheating feedwater. The hybridized plant was operated in a fuel economy mode to save bagasse during the harvest period (April to December). The economized bagasse was then used to provide the operation of power plant during the off-season. The off-design operation of solar aided plant was here identified considering minimal modifications on the existing infrastructure. As main results, bagasse economy potential due to hybridization as well as the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of additional electricity produced was identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Future generation portfolios including varying quantities of gas-fired and renewable generation were compared on the basis of expected costs, cost risk and greenhouse gas emissions, with a view to understanding the merits and disadvantages of gas and renewable technologies. A Monte-Carlo based generation portfolio modelling tool was applied to take into account the effects of highly uncertain future gas prices, carbon pricing policy and electricity demand. Results suggest that portfolios sourcing significant quantities of energy from gas-fired generation in 2030 and 2050 are likely to be significantly higher cost and significantly higher risk than the other alternatives considered. High gas portfolios also do not achieve the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions levels that appear required to avoid dangerous global warming. For example, portfolios that source 95% of energy from gas-fired generation in 2050 experience expected generation costs that are $65/MW h (40%) higher than portfolios that source only, 20% of energy from gas-fired generation. These high gas portfolios also exhibit a cost risk (standard deviation in cost) that is three times higher. The lowest cost portfolios in 2050 source less than 20% of energy from gas with the remaining energy sourced from renewables. Even in the absence of a carbon price, the lowest cost portfolio in 2050 sources only 30% of energy from gas-fired generation, with the remaining 70% of energy being sourced from renewable technologies. Results suggest the optimal strategy for minimising costs, minimising cost risk and reducing GHG emission levels in future electricity industries may involve minimising energy sourced from gas, and increasing renewable generation. In the Australian case study considered, the modelling suggests it is appropriate to target renewable energy penetrations approaching 60% of energy by 2030 and 80-100% by 2050. In the lowest cost and lowest risk portfolios, firm capacity is provided primarily by the transition of existing coal-fired plant into a peaking role, and later by further investment in peaking open cycle gas turbine plant. These results are found to be robust to a wide range of assumptions around future carbon prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Many meteorological parameters present a natural diurnal cycle because they are directly or indirectly dependent on sunshine exposure. The solar radiation diurnal pattern is important to energy production, agriculture, prognostic models, health and general climatology. This article aims at introducing a new type of radial frequency diagram - hereafter called sunflower - for the analysis of solar radiation data in connection with energy production and also for climatological studies. The diagram is based on two-dimensional data sorting. Firstly data are sorted into classes representing hours in a day. Then the data in each hourly class is sorted into classes of the observed variable values. The relative frequencies of the value classes are shown as sections on each hour's segment in a radial diagram. The radial diagram forms a unique pattern for each analysed dataset. Therefore it enables the quick detection of features and the comparison of several such patterns belonging to the different datasets being analysed. The sunflower diagram enables a quick and comprehensive understanding of the information about diurnal cycle of the solar radiation data. It enables in a graphical form, quick screening and long-term statistics of huge data quantities when searching for their diurnal features and finding the differences between the data for several locations. The results of the data analysis using the sunflower diagram show how daily or monthly-based patterns are identified within small or huge data sets. The paper demonstrates the sunflower diagram usefulness over a wide range of applications from green energy production to weather analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The desirable properties of room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) with low heat capacity, low corrosive, nonvolatile and good CO2 solubility make it possible to tailor the amine aqueous solution for capture of CO2 with low energy consumption. However, the detailed thermal analysis, which is helpful for understanding deeply the energy saving potential for ionic liquids (ILs)-based solvent, is scant. In this work, three different ILs with the same cation, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([Bmim]), and different anions, including tetrafluoroborate ([BF4]), nitrate ([NO3]), chloride ([Cl]), are used to tailor the N-methyldieth anolamine/piperazine (MDEA/PZ) aqueous solution to assess their role in CO2 capture performance. The results showed that the investigated ILs affect the physical solubility of CO2. Adding [Bmim][BE4] into MDEA/PZ showed the largest CO2 cyclic capacities, whereas, it is the smallest for MDEA/PZ/[Bmim][NO3], which indicates that anion species of the ILs could tune the sensible heat. Based on the calorimeter measured results and modeling estimated results, the reaction enthalpy changes with the addition of different ILs were also observed. The addition of [Bmim][BF4] could reduce the average enthalpy of CO2 dissolution and the sensible heat at 313 K by 30.1% and 20.3%, respectively. Finally, the studies revealed that not only the latent heat of vaporization but also the sensible heat and reaction heat of CO2 capture can be tailored by the choice of ILs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to review the progress made in understanding the effects of fuel composition on premixed gas turbine combustion, with a special emphasis on system stability and emissions, for hydrogen-rich synthetic gas (syngas) mixtures. This is driven by the rising interest in the use of hydrogen blends and syngas in combined cycle power plants, as an alternative to standard natural gas. Typical applications where such mixtures are used include the recycling of hydrogen by-product from industry as well as promising pre-combustion carbon capture methods like fuel reforming or gasification integrated with gas turbine combined cycle plants. Syngas is mainly a mixture of H-2, CO and CH4; its composition can vary due to fluctuations in the process's conditions but can also dramatically change if the feedstock is modified like coal or biomass grades in gasification. Due to the substantially different chemical, transport and thermal properties that distinguish the syngas components, especially H-2, when compared with conventional hydrocarbon fuels, these non-standard fuels pose several challenges in premixed combustion. These challenges are reviewed in this paper along with the combustion fundamentals of these fuels. A survey of available technologies able to handle syngas and hydrogen-rich fuel in general is provided reflecting the difficulties encountered while using these fuels in real large scale commercial applications. We find that a limited number of options exist today for fully premixed combustion, but promising designs are under development. Finally, the ever growing use of numerical simulation to cost-effectively study full scale combustion systems with Large Eddy Simulations (LES) being at the forefront as a compromise between accuracy and computational cost justifies the simultaneous review of the different numerical attempts to simulate hydrogen-containing fuel mixtures and syngas in premixed combustion. Challenges specific to performing LES calculations for these reacting flows are highlighted. We find that, while the literature on premixed LES methane combustion is abundant, LES of premixed syngas and hydrogen-rich fuels combustion is comparatively scarce. Only few attempts were made so far showing the need for more research effort in this area to help tackle the challenges presented by these fuels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Hybrid and electric powertrains and alternative fuels (e.g., compressed natural gas (CNG), biodiesel, or hydrogen) can often reduce energy consumption and emissions from transit bus operations relative to conventional diesel. However, the magnitude of these energy and emissions savings can vary significantly, due to local conditions and transit operating characteristics. This paper introduces the transit Fuel and Emissions Calculator (FEC), a mode-based life-cycle emissions modeling tool for transit bus and rail technologies that compares the performance of multiple alternative fuels and powertrains across a range of operational characteristics and conditions. The purpose of the FEC is to provide a practical, yet technically sophisticated tool for regulatory agencies and policy analysts in assessing transit fleet options. The FEC's modal modeling approach estimates emissions as a function of engine load, which in turn is a function of transit service parameters, including duty cycle (idling and speed-acceleration profile), road grade, and passenger loading. This approach allows for customized assessments that account for local conditions. Direct emissions estimates are derived from the scaled tractive power (STP) operating mode bins and emissions factors employed in the U.S. EPA's MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) model. Life-cycle emissions estimates are calculated using emissions factors from the GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) model. The case study presented in this paper applies the FEC to second-by-second GPS position data collected from buses operating in metropolitan Atlanta, GA. These operations, from two different transit agencies, feature distinctly different transit service types: local transit bus operations and longer-distance express bus operations. The results illustrate that the decision as to which bus technology-fuel combination produces the least greenhouse gas emissions is a function of location and route characteristics. For the express bus operations monitored, the case study shows that CNG vehicles offer greater emissions reductions than Biodiesel (B20). For local bus services, battery electric buses show the greatest emissions savings in the fuel cycle, as long as range limitations can be met for the specific routes. The amount of these emissions savings is, however, highly dependent on the power generation mix. Among CNG, B20, parallel hybrid, series hybrid, and fuel cell buses, the least emitting option varies by location, due to complex interactions of factors such as duty cycle, meteorology, and terrain.

Abstract: The present study focused on the utilization of molten carbonate salts as a media for the pyrolysis process to produce oil from low-rank coal. A ternary eutectic mix of alkali carbonate salts (Li2CO3, Na2CO3, and K2CO3) was used to pyrolyze two kinds of low-rank coals. The effect of molten salt to the reactivity of coal was investigated by comparing the thermal decomposition profile of coal before and after it was mixed with the molten salt. The oil yield and its composition were also investigated. The results showed that the reactivity of the coal increased when the pyrolysis was performed in the molten salt. The molten salt increased the pyrolysis conversion about 16.5% and 16.4% for Loy yang and Xinghe coals, respectively, when they were pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C. The use of molten salt increased the oil yield since it can rapidly heat the coal to make the pyrolysis occur effectively. The total hydrocarbon content in the oil also increased about 13.6% and 11.0% for Loy yang and Xinghe coals, respectively. However, the molten carbonate salts failed to retain the sulfuric compound during the pyrolysis period due to the short residence time of oil in the molten salt phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper, performances of some zeotropic mixtures in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) have been assessed and evaluated for potential of utilizing the low-temperature and -caloric geothermal water. The options of single power generation and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production through the common series and parallel configurations have been considered. The possible optimization of these applications when using the mixtures opposite pure fluids is the main objective and has been largely discussed. To reach this, the maximal power output level has been mainly focused as evaluation factor for variety of the heat source temperatures (up to 120) and heat consumer parameters. The results showed that in case of stand-alone ORC the mixtures: R438A, R422A and R22M are more efficient than the pure fluids advised and can enhance the power productivity and geothermal water utilization at the sources' temperatures 80, 100 and 120 degrees C, respectively. R407A and R22D also offer attractive outputs at source temperatures of 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, compared to R601a in the series CHP option using R22M in the parallel CHP circuit at heat source temperature 120 degrees C is more feasible and enables considerable promotions for a wide field of conditions. Similarly, R422A at source temperature 100 degrees C is also energetically favorable, but only at conditions matching the low till moderate heat loads or high supply temperatures. Finally, R22M and R422A are always much better than the pure R227ea in the parallel ORC-CHP system within this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Methanol steam reforming inside microchannel reactors is regarded as one of effective methods for supplying hydrogen for fuel cells. Microchannel structure plays an important role on the reaction performance of methanol steam reforming. Parallel and uniform-distributed microchannels with rectangular cross-section are generally adopted. In this work, two kinds of microchannel cross-sections and four kinds of microchannel distributions are selected to investigate the effect of microchannel structure on the reaction performance of methanol steam reforming. The result indicates that microchannel distribution shows much more influences on the reaction performance of methanol steam reforming than the microchannel cross-section. Sparse-distribution in the Left direction and Dense-distribution in the Right direction (SLDR) as well as Equal-distribution in the Left-Right direction (ELR) with rectangular cross-section present relatively good reaction performances, whereas Dense-distribution in the Left direction and Sparse-distribution in the Right direction (DLSR) as well as Equal-distribution in the Upside-Underside direction (EUU) with tooth cross-section have relatively good performances. ELR presents the best reaction performances of methanol steam reforming among all the investigated microchannel structures, whether rectangular or tooth cross-section. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents the definition of a detailed optimization model for planning the operation of a standalone hybrid microgrid. The mathematical model is expressed in a general way in order to handle a large number of microgrid configurations in which the demand of different goods (storable or not) has to be fulfilled, as AC and DC electricity, heat, cooling, drinkable water and ice production. The operation of the microgrid is defined by a rolling-horizon strategy that includes solving of a mixed integer linear problem. The goal of the optimization problem is to define the programmable units schedule that leads to the minimum operating cost, ensuring that the demand of each good is fulfilled and exploiting the forecast of production and consumption of non-programmable units over a certain time horizon. The model handles multi-input and multi-output programmable units, considering part-load performance curves, start-up penalizations and several other operation constraints. To demonstrate the model ability, the paper addresses two examples of microgrid configuration: the first test case shows the operation cost reduction attainable with this strategy in comparison with commonly adopted heuristic dispatch strategies; the second one demonstrates the capability to manage a complex system, provided with an Organic Rankine Cycle power system powered by both a biomass boiler and a solar Fresnel collector.

Abstract: The majority of decisions in the building design process are taken in the early design stage. This delicate phase presents the greatest opportunity to obtain high performance buildings, but pertinent performance information is needed for designers to be able to deal with multidisciplinary and contrasting objectives. In the present work, an integrative approach for the early stages of building design is proposed to obtain detailed information on energy efficient envelope configurations. By means of genetic algorithms, a multi-objective search was performed with the aim of minimising the energy need for heating, cooling and lighting of a case study. The investigation was carried out for an open space office building by varying number, position, shape and type of windows and the thickness of the masonry walls. The search was performed through an implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm, which was made capable of exchanging information with the EnergyPlus building energy simulation tool. The analyses were conducted both in absence and in presence of an urban context in the climates of Palermo, Torino, Frankfurt and Oslo. In addition, a preliminary analysis on the Pareto front solutions was performed to investigate the statistical variation of the values assumed by the input variables in all the non-dominated solutions. For the analysed case study, results highlighted a small overall Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of the building in all locations. Pareto front solutions were characterised by low WWR values especially in east, west and north exposed facades. The area of the south facing windows was higher compared to the other orientations and characterised by a higher variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We propose the computation of different wind energy production indicators and financial profitability of potential wind power sites. The computation is performed by modeling the wind speed process as an indexed semi-Markov chain to predict and simulate the wind speed dynamics.
We demonstrate that the indexed semi-Markov chain approach enables reproducing the indicators calculated on real data. Two different time horizons of 15 and 30 years are analyzed. In the first case we consider the government incentives on the energy price now present in Italy, while in the second case the incentives have not been taken into account. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Gasoline is increasingly blended with primary alcohols globally, in order to ensure energy security and to reduce local and global pollution load. However, no systematic scientific study reporting unregulated emissions from gasohol (gasoline blend with alcohol) fuelled engines has been undertaken by measuring the real-time emissions. To investigate unregulated emissions experimentally, a 4-cylinder, water-cooled, multipoint port fuel injection (MPFI) gasoline engine coupled with an eddy current dynamometer was used. Exhaustive experiments were carried out in this spark ignition (SI) engine, which was fuelled by gasohols (E5, E15, M5 and M15) vis-a-vis baseline gasoline for characterizing regulated and unregulated emissions. A raw exhaust gas emission analyzer was used for regulated emission measurements and a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) emission analyzer was used for unregulated emission measurements. Experiments revealed that formic acid (HCOOH), iso-butane (iso-C4H10), and iso-pentane (iso-C5H12) were present in the exhaust in relatively lower concentration in gasohol blends compared to baseline gasoline. For higher gasohol blends (E15), iso-butane, n-pentane, ethane, toluene, and benzene were present in significantly low concentrations in the exhaust while ethyl alcohol, formaldehyde, propane and iso-butylene emissions were present in relatively higher concentrations in the exhaust. M15 emitted relatively lower concentrations of formic acid, iso-butane, iso-pentane, and benzene, but higher concentrations of methanol, formaldehyde, propane, n-pentane, and toluene compared to other test fuels. Gasohols were ineffective in reducing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetic acid. Acetaldehyde was emitted by gasoline-ethanol blends however it was not detected in the emissions from gasoline and gasoline-methanol blends. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The torrefaction characteristics of a microalga (Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31) residue in inert (N-2) and non-inert (CO2) atmospheres at temperatures of 200-300 degrees C with the durations of 15-60 min are investigated. A parameter of torrefaction severity index (TSI) is employed to account for the thermal degradation phenomena. The results indicate that the enhancement factor of higher heating value, energy yield, and atomic H/C and O/C ratios versus TSI are strongly characterized by a linear relationship. The solid and energy yields of the residue torrefied in CO2 are lower than in N-2 inasmuch as the thermal degradation in the former is more active, presumably due to the intensified reaction of CO2 with volatile matters in the biomass. At a given energy yield, the microalga residue torrefied at a lower temperature accompanied by a longer duration results in a fuel with higher energy densification and lower solid yield, thereby rendering the better torrefaction quality. On the other hand, a higher efficiency of energy utilization for upgrading the biomass can be achieved at a higher temperature along with a shorter duration. It is thus concluded that the optimization of torrefaction operation depends on the requirement of energy densification or energy utilization on fuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Many studies have developed mathematical programming models for optimal design of supply chains for agricultural or lingocellulosic biomass-derived bioethanol production. However, because of the shortcomings of using agricultural (food supply problems) and lingo-cellulosic biomass (low biomass availability and processing yield) as feedstock, use of micro-algal biomass has been considered for use as a feedstock for biodiesel (biofuel). Thus, in this study we developed a deterministic mathematical programming model for strategic planning design of a microalgae biomass-to-biodiesel supply chain network (MBBSCN) from feedstock fields to end users that simultaneously satisfies resource constraints, demand constraints, and technology over a long-term planning horizon.
The proposed deterministic model can help to determine where and how much feedstock to be transported, and where and how many refineries to be constructed to minimize the expected total cost including the co-product (naphtha and power) benefit. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model, we conducted a case study based on the Korea biodiesel market data. In this case study, the optimized (i.e., most cost-effective) supply chain design can be gained at a reliable cost of similar to$US 5.91/gal ($US 1.56/1). In particular, this study can help to identify the technological bottlenecks and major cost drivers for the microalgae-to-diesel strategy, and can be also a guideline for development of various mathematical programming models for optimal design of microalgae biomass-derived biofuel supply chain like lingo-cellulosic biomass-based optimization studies.

Abstract: The indicator "aggregate carbon intensity", such as that given by the ratio of a country's CO2 emissions to its GDP, is often used by researchers and policymakers in the study of climate change or environmental performance. A better understanding of the determinants of this indicator is useful in climate policy analysis. This paper introduces four different models to calculate a country's aggregate carbon intensity using the input output framework. The models are developed based on different combinations of input output models, country imports assumptions, and approaches to calculating GDP. Using the four models and multiplicative structural decomposition analysis, the determinants of the aggregate carbon intensity change of China from 2007 to 2010 are studied. The results given by the models are compared and attribution analysis on one of the determinants is conducted. The proposed procedure can be similarly applied to study changes in other aggregate intensity indicators, such as the ratio of energy consumption, water consumption or material use of a country to its GDP.

Abstract: Conventional energy planning focused on energy cost, GHG emission and renewable contribution based on future energy demand, fuel price, etc. Uncertainty in the projected variables such as energy demand, volatile fuel price and evolution of renewable technologies will influence the cost of energy when projected over a period of 15-30 years. Inaccurate projected variables could affect energy security and lead to the risk of high energy cost, high emission and low energy security. The energy security is an ability of generation capacity to meet the future energy demand. In order to minimize the risks, a generic methodology is presented to determine an optimal energy mix for a period of around 15 years. The proposed optimal energy mix is a right combination of energy sources that minimize the risk caused due to future uncertainties related to the energy sources. The proposed methodology uses stochastic optimization to address future uncertainties over a planning horizon and minimize the variations in the desired performance criteria such as energy security and costs. The developed methodology is validated using a case study for a South East Asian region with diverse fuel sources consists of wind, solar, geothermal, coal, biomass and natural gas, etc. The derived optimal energy mix decision outperformed the conventional energy planning by remaining stable and feasible against 79% of future energy demand scenarios at the expense of 0-10% increase in the energy cost. Including the nuclear option in the energy mix resulted 26.7% reduction in the total energy cost, 53.2% reduction in the GHG emission and guarantees feasibility against 79% of future energy demand scenarios over a 15 year planning horizon.

Abstract: This study examined some management strategies of wheat cultivation system and its sustainability in using straw as an energy feedstock. According to the EU regulatory framework on biofuels, no GHG emissions should be assigned to straws when they are used for energy. Given this relevance in the current energy policy, it is advisable to include all possible marginal effects related to land use, resource utilization and management changes in the comparison of different biomass options. Coherently, an expanded life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to include the upstream cultivation phase and to make a comparison between "straw to soil" and "straw to energy". Different crop management conditions in Southern Italy were simulated, by using the CropSyst model, to estimate the long-term soil organic carbon and annual N2O soil emissions. Three wheat cropping systems were considered: the conventional single wheat system without straw removal (WO) and with partial straw removal (W1), together with a no-tillage "wheat-wheat-herbage" rotation system with partial straw removal (W2). The results of the simulations were integrated in the LCA to compare fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of straw-to-electricity with respect to the fossil-based electricity system. The "improved" rotational wheat cropping system (W2) gave the best performance in terms both of GHG savings and fossil displacement, thus stressing that straw use for energy generation in parallel with the optimization of the cropping system are key factors in long-term environmental sustainability.

Abstract: Coal use and thus investment is expected to grow considerably in the Russian Federation over the next few decades. Projections suggest that at least $200 billion of investment will be needed to modernize existing coal-fired power plants by 2030, but the bulk of this financing is to come from the private sector or foreign enterprises. This study asks: what are the possible investment risks and rewards of pursuing this expansion of coal in the Russian power sector? To provide an answer, the study uses a mixed methods approach consisting of elite semi-structured interviews and a review of English and Russian peer-reviewed literature. The study provides a brief overview of the Russian electricity sector before discussing five distinct rewards to investing in coal such as low production costs, competitive returns on investment, rural modernization, expansion of exports, and the acceleration of innovation. These benefits however are offset by five risks: inferior performance to investments in oil and gas, development challenges, air pollution and climate change, social degradation from mining, and a tradeoff with existing policies incentivizing renewable energy and energy efficiency. The study concludes by analyzing what these disparate risks and rewards mean for policymakers and energy analysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, a modified flat panel solar thermal collector was built and thermal efficiency was measured with two heat transfer fluids: distillated water and Al2O3-distillated water based nanofluid at high concentration (3.0%) volume fraction of solid phase. In this work for the first time nanofluid with high nanoparticle concentration has been used thanks to a modified solar thermal collector, based on patent WO2011138752 A1, which consists in bottom and top headers properly shaped in order to reduce sedimentation of clusters of nanoparticles. Thermal efficiency has been measured through an experimental setup, according to EN 12975-2 standard. Experimental results showed that an increase of thermal efficiency up to 11.7% compared to that measured with water has been obtained by using nanofluid. Besides effect of nanofluid on thermal efficiency is greater at high temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Polyalcohol is one of the important medium temperature phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage, in which liquid-free solid-solid PCMs are more promising although sublimation can hardly be avoided when crystals transform to the "plastic phase". We reported here the preparation of encapsulated Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl aminomethane (Tris) with the SiO2 shell by sol-gel process. Through the hydrolysis and polycondensation of the bicomponent silicon precursors mixed with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS) of proper ratio, Tris@SiO2 microcapsules with excellent sealing property can be obtained, which prevent the leakage of Tris outside the capsules. Besides, silica encapsulation doubles the thermal conductivity of the PCMs to 0.478 W/(m K). The DSC measurement shows that the Tris@SiO2 capsule owns a reversible phase change in the range of 110-155 degrees C, which will stabilize at about 146 J/g during 70 times of thermal cycling. The Tris@SiO2 capsules have good potential for medium temperature thermal energy storage applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: While western Canada is an international leader in the growing pellet market, eastern Canada remains a minor player despite its abundance of wood residues from natural disturbances. This study investigates the potential amount of biomass from salvage logging of fire-killed stands along with harvesting residues from clearcut to supply pellet plants in eastern Canada between. We built and optimized supply scenarios in two forest management units to fulfill different pellet plant capacities under various operational, ecological, and economics constraints. Despite the high spatial and temporal variability of burned area, this study confirms the large quantities of biomass from fire-killed stands available as ecologically sustainable feedstock for bioenergy, which, combined with the comparatively smaller and more stable quantities from clearcut harvesting residues could supply theoretical pellet plants. Our results show that under current market conditions, biomass both from harvest residues and fire-killed stands could fulfill on average between 5% and 66% of a 50 000 ODT y(-1) plant needs at a price of $90 ODT-1 of wood chips for the decade considered. With a wood chip price at $120 ODT-1, 100% of the production capacity of a 50 000 ODT y(-1) plant or even of a 100 000 ODT y(-1) plant could be met. Ecological constraints related to the need to protect sensitive sites and prevent recovery operations on them, and operational constraints related to the capacity of the machinery to recover biomass from a given site, have little impact on the supply of biomass from fire-killed stands. However, important regional variations exist in terms of potentials and constraints, which would need to be taken into account when designing bioenergy industrial networks.

Abstract: In this paper, an energy harvesting pavement prototype using air as the operating fluid is described and analysed. The prototype harvests the thermal energy available in the pavement through pipes embedded in its structure, where air flows thanks to natural convection. The air is able to exit the system through an updraft chimney. A parametric analysis of the controllable parameters of interest is performed in this work in order to evaluate the variation in the performance of the energy harvesting prototype in different experimental setups.
This study shows that there exists a maximum value for the air speed in each configuration and that the energy harvesting efficiency depends on the height and the diameter of the chimney. Moreover, there is a minimum value of the chimney diameter that does not allow air movement and makes the whole system behave as if no pipes were embedded in the pavement structure.

Abstract: The operational rating system in building energy performance certificates (EPCs) has been used for systematically monitoring and diagnosing the energy performance in the operation and maintenance phases of existing buildings. However, there are several limitations of the conventional operational rating system, which can be subdivided into three aspects: (i) building category; (ii) region category; and (iii) space unit size. To overcome these challenges, this study conducted the problem analysis of the conventional operational rating system for existing buildings by using the statistical and geostatistical approaches. Based on the problem analysis, this study developed the dynamic operational rating (DOR) system for existing buildings by using the data-mining technique and the probability approach. The developed DOR system can be used as a tool for building energy performance diagnostics. To validate the applicability of the developed DOR system, educational facilities were selected as the representative type of existing buildings in South Korea. As a result, it was determined that the developed DOR system can solve the irrationality of the conventional operational rating system (i.e., the negative correlation between the space unit size and the CO2 emission density). Namely, the operational ratings of small buildings were adjusted upward while those of large buildings were adjusted downward. The developed DOR system can allow policymakers to establish the reasonable operational rating system for existing buildings, which can motivate the public to actively participate in energy-saving campaigns.

Abstract: Thermal energy or heat storage systems using chemical reactions to store and release energy operate in charging and discharging phases. The charging phase in this work is a dehydration process with constant heating rate decomposing salt hydrates as chemical components resulting in the obtention of a less hydrated or anhydrous form and, at the same time, storing the released heat (energy storage). Latest research on thermal decomposition of several salt-hydrates concerned experimental and numerical investigations (Huang et al., 2010; Sugimoto et al., 2007). A mathematical model of heat and mass transfer in a fixed-bed reactor for heat storage is proposed on the basis of a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) controlling the balances of mass, conversion, and energy in the bed and the reactor. These PDEs are numerically solved by means of the finite element method using Comsol Multiphysics 4.3a. The objective of this paper is to describe an adaptive modelling approach and establish a correct set of PDEs describing the physical system and appropriate parameters for simulating the thermal decomposition process. Thus it could help in the design of thermal energy storage system. The recommendations the International Confederation for Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (Vyazovkin et al., 2011) on kinetic behaviour were used to explain transport phenomena and reactions mechanism in gas and solid phases. The generalized Prout-Tompkins equation was therefore adopted with some modifications based on thermal analysis experiments and literature. The experimental data from the TGA-DSC measurements are then used to validate the kinetic model. This latter result after validation is used in the Comsol model to simulate the lab-scale reactor in charging mode (thermal decomposition). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Cooling of the condensation surface increases the production of purified water in solar distillation devices, also known as solar stills. However, most cooling methods are costly, complex and involve regular monitoring. Simple, easily operable and cheap cooling in solar stills can make it attractive for commercial adaptation at a large number of rural locations across the world. Here we demonstrate the increase in the area of the condensation surface as an effective way of increasing the production of purified water from the stills. Experiments were conducted inside the lab and under the sun. In the lab experiments, performed at a constant energy input of 625 W/m(2), the production of water increased by more than 65% with an increase in the area of the condensation surface by 7.5 times. In the experiments conducted under the sun, the production of water increased by more than 50% by using an additional area for condensation which is 7.5 times larger when compared with a reference still without an additional area of condensation. Further, by using a higher heat input, we show that the effect of increase in the area of the condensation surface by 6.5 times can increase the production of water by more than five times. We further demonstrate the effect of external cooling by decreasing the temperature of the condensation surface to almost 0 degrees C. The amount of water produced from the still was increased by more than eight times by maximizing cooling of the condensation surface. The results suggest that a solar still device with an increased area of condensation surface can be adapted as a cheap, easy to manufacture and easily operable device for a large number of people who are in need of drinking water.

Abstract: The increment in generation costs is one of the most important factors that characterizes the operation of insular power systems, and is related to the location of these systems and the type of fuel used to provide electricity. This situation motivates the integration of renewable generation at high rates, as well as energy storage systems (ESSs), to improve the utilization of these resources. In this paper, a new control strategy is presented for the day-ahead scheduling of insular power systems with a battery energy storage system. The method presented here incorporates the effects of the most relevant components such as thermal generators, wind power generation, power converter, charge controller and ESS, being integrated into the scheduling process of insular power systems as a new contribution to earlier studies. The results provided show a fuel saving of 2% and an improvement in the wind power use of 20%, which is significant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A multi-objective group search optimizer with adaptive covariance and Levy flights (MGSO-ACL) is developed to optimize the power dispatch of the LSIES with the selected objectives compromising the competing benefits of both the power grid and the DHCs. Furthermore, a decision making method based on an evidential reasoning (ER) approach is used to determine a final optimal solution from the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained by the MGSO-ACL The ER takes into account both the multiple objectives and the multiple evaluation criteria representing the economy and reliability interests of the power grid and the DHCs. Simulation studies are conducted on an IEEE 30-bus system, which is modified to include distributed DHCs and wind power generation, to verify the effectiveness of the MGSO-ACL and ER. The results demonstrate that the MGSO-ACL can obtain superior Pareto-optimal solutions in terms of convergence and diversity, and the ER is pragmatic in handling the complex decision making problem, in particular for determining the final optimal solution of the power dispatch of the LSIES.

Abstract: For nearly two decades, research groups have attempted to increase the thermal conductivity of bulk materials by saturating them with different concentrations and types of nanoparticles. However, optimal enhancements in the thermal conductivity of these materials continue to go unrealized, primarily due to interfacial phenomena that impede phonon propagation from the bulk material to the nanoparticle or between individual, contacting nanoparticles. Though it is almost certain that interfacial resistances between contacting nanoparticles are responsible for the underwhelming thermal performance of nanoparticles in bulk materials, the physical mechanisms that limit thermal transport at nanoparticle junctions is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the effect of nanoparticle constriction size (i.e. the contact area between linked nanoparticles) on the bulk thermal conductivity of a surrounding paraffin-based phase change material. To this end, we measure the effective thermal conductivity of different Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT)/paraffin nanocomposites is measured with the transient plane source technique. Using a newly developed physical model, the interfacial thermal resistance between the contacting nanoparticles is determined as a function of the constriction geometry. Results suggest that the thermal conductance (i.e. the rate of heat transfer) between contacting MWCNTs can be increased by a factor of 27 by increasing their diameter by only 58 nm. This is in direct conflict with effective medium approximations, which predict an increase in the bulk thermal conductivity of MWCNT-PCM composites when MWCNT diameters are reduced. Such a result indicates that the contact area between individual, contacting nanoparticles has a significant impact on thermal transport within the PCM nanocomposite, and therefore its bulk thermal conductivity. It is expected that these results will strongly impact the design of nanoparticle-laden PCMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, the thermodynamic advantage of integrating liquid air power generation (LAPG) process and binary cycle waste heat recovery technology to a standalone pressurized oxy-coal combustion supercritical steam power generation cycle is investigated through modeling and simulation using Aspen Plus simulation software version 8.4. The study shows that the integration of LAPG process and the use of binary cycle heat engine which convert waste heat from compressor exhaust to electricity, in a standalone pressurized oxy-coal combustion supercritical steam power generation cycle improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the pressurized oxy-coal process. The analysis indicates that such integration can give about 12-15% increase in thermodynamic efficiency when compared with a standalone pressurized oxy-coal process with or without CO2 capture. It was also found that in a pressurized oxy-coal process, it is better to pump the liquid oxygen from the cryogenic ASU to a very high pressure prior to vapourization in the cryogenic ASU main heat exchanger and subsequently expand the gaseous oxygen to the required combustor pressure than either compressing the atmospheric gaseous oxygen produced from the cryogenic ASU directly to the combustor pressure or pumping the liquid oxygen to the combustor pressure prior to vapourization in the cryogenic ASU main heat exchanger. The power generated from the compressor heat in the flue gas purification, carbon capture and compression unit using binary cycle heat engine was also found to offset about 65% of the power consumed in the flue gas cleaning and compression process.
The work presented here shows that there is a synergistic and thermodynamic advantage of utilizing the nitrogen-rich stream from the cryogenic ASU of an oxy-fuel power generation process for power generation instead of discarding it as a waste stream. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The geographic locations of biofuel production facilities should be strategically chosen in order to minimise the total cost of using biofuels. Proximity to biomass resources, possibilities for integration, and distance to biofuel users are aspects that need to be considered. In this paper, the geographically explicit optimisation model BeWhere Sweden was used to investigate the future production of next-generation biofuels from forest biomass in Sweden. A focus was placed on the integration of biofuel production with the existing forest industry, as well as on how different parameters affect biofuel production costs, the choice of technologies and biofuels, and the localisation of new biofuel plants. Six examples of different biofuel routes were considered. A methodology was developed considering detailed, site-specific conditions for potential host industries. The results show that the cost of biomass and the biofuel plant capital cost generally dominate the biofuel cost, but the cost for biomass transportation and biofuel distribution can also have a significant impact. DME produced via black liquor gasification (naturally integrated with chemical pulp mills) and SNG produced via solid biomass gasification (mainly integrated with sawmills), dominate the solutions. The distribution of these technology cases varies depending on a number of parameters, including criteria for sizing biofuel plants, the electricity price, the biofuel distribution cost and the cost of biomass, and is sensitive to changes in these parameters. Generally, plants with low specific investment costs (i.e., high biofuel production) and/or plants with low specific biomass transportation costs occur most frequently in the solutions. Because these properties often vary significantly among biofuel production facilities at different host industry sites of the same type, the results show the advantage of including site-specific data in this type of model.

Abstract: The low-concentration photovoltaic (LCPV) system has been identified as one of the potential solutions in lowering the overall installation cost of a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system. This paper evaluates the performance of a novel type of LCPV concentrator known as the rotationally asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (RACPC). A specific RACPC design with a geometrical concentration ratio 3.6675 x was fabricated and integrated with a 1 cm by 1 cm monocrystalline laser grooved buried contact silicon solar cell. This design was tested indoors to evaluate its current-voltage (I-V), angular response and thermal characteristics. Under standard test conditions, it was found that the RACPC increases the short circuit current by 3.01 x and the maximum power by 3.33 x when compared with a bare solar cell. The opto-electronic gain from the experiment showed good agreement when compared with the simulation results, with a deviation of 11%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In many urbanized areas the roadside and nature conservation management offers a biomass-for-bioenergy resource potential which is barely valorized, because of the fragmented biomass production sites and the scarcity of accurate data on the spatial availability of the biomass. In this study, a GIS based assessment was performed to determine the regional non-woody biomass-for-bioenergy potential for biogas from conservation areas and roadsides in Flanders, Belgium. These systems, with an area of 31,055 ha, have an annual herbaceous biomass production of 203 kton dry matter. The full associated biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain was optimized in four scenarios to maximize the net energy output and the profit. The scenario analysis was performed with OPTIMASS, a recently developed GIS based strategic decision support system. The analysis showed that the energetic valorization of conservation and roadside biomass through anaerobic digestion had a positive net energy balance, although there is still much room for improvements. Economically, however, it is a less interesting biomass resource. Most likely, the economic picture would change when other ecosystem services delivered by the protected biodiversity would be taken into account. Future technical advances and governmental incentives, like green energy certificates, will be necessary to incorporate the biomass into the energy chain. By tackling the existing barriers and providing a detailed methodology for biomass potential assessments, this study tries to facilitate the valorization of conservation and roadside biomass in order to reconcile biodiversity and road safety goals with renewable energy targets.

Abstract: We present a Raman spectroscopic study of the conversion of soybean oil into biodiesel by methanol using the lipase B enzyme pseudomonas cepacia as the bio-catalyst and 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids (C(n)C(1)Im) as co-solvents, where the alkyl chain length is varied from ethyl (n = 2) to decyl (n = 10). We have limited this study to a low reaction temperature, 40 degrees C, and a low enzyme concentration to investigate the possibility of producing biodiesel with low energy and cost demands. We also demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and straightforward method to estimate the yield of the transesterification reaction, by analysis of the characteristic C=0 stretching mode found in the range similar to 1730-1750 cm(-1). Our results indicate that both reaction yield and reaction rate increase with the chain length, but also that for chains longer than decyl further improvements are marginal. We discuss these results from the viewpoint of local interactions and local structure of the investigated ionic liquids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The EU EPBD recast regulation marked the application of the net zero energy building (Net ZEB) concept in all fields of building construction in Europe as a building able to generate as much energy as it consumes over a selected time frame. A more detailed insight is however needed, as even if a building achieves a long-term energy balance between energy generated and consumed, smaller time scales must also be considered. For example, from the utility's point of view, if a Net ZEB is a heavy consumer in the winter, it will appear to be quite similar to a conventional building, requiring the use of additional generation. The increase in the generation-load match means reducing the stress to the energy grid, the peak system energy required, and the wasted energy, thus avoiding unnecessary generation and, consequently, limiting carbon-related emissions.
In this paper, the authors address the problem of determining the optimal storage size starting from the data of an Italian nearly net zero energy building that produced a detailed database on generated and consumed electricity.
The study presented in this paper analyses the following steps: modelling of energy consumption through non-parametric estimators, modelling of energy generation through detailed models available in the literature, quantification of the load match levels for existing case studies, analysis of the state of charge (SOC) for a given model of the energy consumption probability distribution, and the identification of the minimum size of the storage required to improve energy load match. The results show that even when selecting unfavourable boundary conditions it could be possible to lower the energy import from the electricity grid by approximately 40%, that can possibly rise to more than 90% during summer.

Abstract: Although the expansion of offshore wind has recently increased in Germany, as in other countries, it is still forced to defend its role in long-term energy policy plans, particularly against its onshore counterpart, to secure future expansion targets and financial support. The objective of this article is to investigate the economic effects of offshore wind on the electricity spot market and thus open up another perspective that has not been part of the debate about offshore vs. onshore wind thus far. A comprehensive assessment based on a large amount of market, feed-in and weather data in Germany revealed that the market value of offshore wind is generally higher than that of onshore wind. Simulating the merit order effect on the German day-ahead electricity market for the short term and long term in the years 2006-2014 aimed to identify the reason for this observation and show whether it is also an indication of a lower impact on the electricity spot market due to a steadier wind resource prevailing offshore. Although the results suggest no difference regarding the impact on market price and value, they indeed reveal that offshore wind imposes less variability on the spot market price than onshore wind. In addition, the long-term simulation proved that the ongoing price deterioration cannot be blamed on the characteristic of variable wind production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The objective of this work is to examine the parameter sensitivity and optimize the cooling performance of two-stage thermoelectric cooler (TEC). Firstly, a multiphysics model is used to investigate the effects of geometry parameters and applied currents on the performance of a two-stage TEC. Specially, cross-sectional area ratio of the p-type leg to the leg pair chi and height ratio of the cold stage leg to the two stage legs delta are explored, which have never been investigated in previous studies. Secondly, a simplified conjugated-gradient method is coupled into the multiphysics model to optimize the four key geometric parameters and two applied currents supplied to hold and cold stages, for seeking the maximum cooling capacity. The results of individual parameter analysis mainly show that the optimal chi does not depend on the geometric structure and applied currents of TEC, while it is only determined by the p-type and n-type semiconductor materials. The height ratio (5 always plays the role to adjust the temperature between the cold and hot stages, resulting in that the both stages could operate at the proper temperature differences matching with their respective applied current. The optimization results show that the maximum cooling capacity Q(c,c) at Delta T= 0, 20, 40, and 60 K is enhanced by 19.62%, 21.30%, 25.49%, and 43.83%, respectively, as compared with the initial design. When Delta T increases from 0 K to 40 K, the change for each parameter in the optimal set is not larger than 1.8%, indicating that once the optimal design is obtained at a specific Delta T, it can be safely used at any other Delta T.

Abstract: Investigation of the optimal injection temperature for the hydrate dissociation plays a significant role in the gas hydrate exploitation in the practical field. In this work, the experiments of hydrate dissociation by depressurization in conjunction with thermal stimulation (DT) with the different injection temperatures are carried out in a Cubic Hydrate Simulator (CHS). Evaluation of the entropy production minimization (EPM), the energy ratio and the thermal efficiency are employed to investigate into the optimized injection temperature for hydrate dissociation. The thermal efficiency decreases with the increase of the injection temperature. The optimal injection temperatures for the hydrate dissociation from the points of the maximization of the energy ratio and the minimization of the entropy production, which are equivalent to maximizing the energy production and minimizing the energy consumption, respectively, are 38.8 degrees C and 37.9 degrees C. The results of evaluations from the two aspects are in a quite good agreement. Thus, the warm water injection of approximately 38-39 degrees C is suitable for hydrate dissociation with the DT method, and the hot water injection beyond 39 degrees C is uneconomical for hydrate dissociation.

Abstract: Since the temperature of shower drain water (SDW) is relatively high, lots of heat is wasted with the discharge of SDW. Therefore, the recovery of this unutilized heat from SDW shows great potential in improving the building energy efficiency. In this paper, a novel heat pump water heater assisted with SDW for small single family was proposed, which could effectively recover the energy in domestic SDW. To improve its performance, a shower waste heat extraction device (WHED) with water pre-heated loops was designed. A prototype of the system was firstly set up, and then the system performances under different conditions were experimented and discussed. The experimental results showed that approximately 70% of energy could be saved using this novel heat pump water heater, compared with the traditional electric water heater. Furthermore, the COP of the system could be improved observably when using water pre-heated loops. Thus the implementation of this novel heat pump water heater was verified to be capable of reducing energy usage and CO2 emissions significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The coupling between unsteady heat release and acoustic perturbations can lead to self-sustained thermoacoustic oscillations, also known as combustion instability. When such combustion instability occurs, the pressure oscillations may become so intense that they can cause engine structural damage and costly mission failure. Thus there is a need to understand the coupling physics between acoustic waves and unsteady combustion and to identify a measure to quantify the interaction between the flame and acoustics. The present work studies linear and nonlinear response of a conical premixed laminar flame to oncoming acoustic disturbances. Unsteady heat release from the flame is assumed to be caused by its surface area variations, which results from the fluctuations of the oncoming flow velocity. The classical G-equation is used to track the flame front variation in real-time. Second-order finite difference method is then used to expand the flame model. Time evolution of the flame surface distortions is successfully captured. To quantify the dynamic response of the flame to the acoustic disturbances, system identification is then conducted to estimate the linear and nonlinear flame transfer function. Good agreement is obtained. Finally, transfer function of an actuated open-open thermoacoustic system is experimentally measured by injecting a broad-band white noise. The present work opens up new applicable way to measure heat-driven acoustics transfer function in a thermoacoustic system by simply implementing white noise. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Ethanol is now one of the most widely used transport bin-fuels and production of ethanol from rice straw (RS) is an effective RS utilization way. This work investigated a novel two-step RS pretreatment process with the goal of decreasing the ethanol production cost through complete utilization of its components. In the process, RS was first treated with dilute sulfuric acid to remove the hemicellulose and recover the xylose from its hydrolyzate as a feedstock for xylitol production, and then the residue was treated with the standard sulfomethylation reagent to remove the lignin and recover its hydrolyzate containing the lignosulfonate as a cement water reducer. Among tested conditions, the best acid treatment (AT) conditions were 100 degrees C, 1.0 wt% sulfuric acid, 10% (w/v) RS and 2 h, and the hydrolyzate recycled 5 times. After AT, the xylose was recovered from its hydrolyzate with 83.2% yield. The best sulfomethylation treatment (ST) conditions were 160 degrees C, 15% (w/v) acid treated RS, and 5 h using the standard sulfomethylation reagent. After ST, its hydrolyzate containing 5.0% lignosulfonate was directly recovered as a cement water reducer. Under the above best two-step treatment conditions, 94% hemicellulose and 92% lignin in the origin RS were removed, but cellulose had almost no loss. After the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of the two-step treated RS (100 g L-1) for 72 h, the ethanol concentration and its yield reached 40.6 g L-1 and 86.4% respectively. It suggests the two-step pretreatment process was an efficient RS pretreatment method for its ethanol production. This process can be an example of RS bio-refinery for bin-fuel production.

Abstract: Thermal runaway (TR) propagation in a large format lithium ion battery pack can cause disastrous consequences and thus deserves study on preventing it. A lumped thermal model that can predict and help prevent TR propagation in a battery module using 25 Ah LiNixCoyMnzO2 large format lithium ion batteries has been built in this paper. The TR propagation model consists of 6 fully-charged single batteries connected through thermal resistances and can fit experiment data well. The modeling analysis focuses on discussing the influences on the TR propagation process caused by changes in different critical modeling parameters. The modeling analysis suggests possible solutions to postpone and prevent TR propagation. The simulation shows that it might be better to choose proper parameters that help prevent TR propagation rather than just postpone it, because a delay in the TR propagation process leads to a higher level of heat gathering which may cause severer thermal hazards. To prevent TR propagation, the model provides some substantial quantified solutions: (I) raise the TR triggering temperature to higher than 469 degrees C; (2) reduce the total electric energy released during massive internal short circuit to 75% or less of its original value; (3) enhance the heat dissipation by increasing the heat dissipation coefficient to higher than 70W m(-2) K-1; (4) add extra thermal resistant layers between adjacent batteries with a thickness of 1 mm and a thermal conductivity less than 0.2 W m(-1) K-1. One implementation, which is verified by experiment, is to insert thermal resistant layer between adjacent batteries to prevent TR propagation in the battery module. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Small size wind turbines can be attractive from many points of view: the environmental impact is low, they do not cause instabilities in the power network distribution and they do not need large power storage capabilities. Nevertheless, the exploitation of small turbines usually faces with several shortcomings and the actual return is often lower than expected, mainly because the power curve given by the manufacturer usually does not reproduce the actual behaviour of the turbines during the operating conditions.
Using high-resolution wind speed and energy production measurements, this paper presents an in situ experimental analysis of two small size wind turbines with the same rated power, placed in the same urban environment and realized with vertical and horizontal axis, respectively. Wind conditions are particularly interesting as they are characterized by two distinct regimes, corresponding to low (wind blowing from the sea) and high turbulence (wind blowing from the land).
The detected power production is discussed, showing the mutual strengths and weaknesses of the two technologies, focusing on the role of the technical features and control apparatus on the one hand and of the incoming wind conditions and turbulence on the other.

Abstract: Thermal generation is a vital component of mature and reliable electricity markets. As the share of renewable electricity in such markets grows, so too do the challenges associated with its variability. Proposed solutions to these challenges typically focus on alternatives to primary generation, such as energy storage, demand side management, or increased interconnection. Less attention is given to the demands placed on conventional thermal generation or its potential for increased flexibility. However, for the foreseeable future, conventional plants will have to operate alongside new renewables and have an essential role in accommodating increasing supply-side variability.
This paper explores the role that conventional generation has to play in managing variability through the sub-system case study of Northern Ireland, identifying the significance of specific plant characteristics for reliable system operation. Particular attention is given to the challenges of wind ramping and the need to avoid excessive wind curtailment. Potential for conflict is identified with the role for conventional plant in addressing these two challenges. Market specific strategies for using the existing fleet of generation to reduce the impact of renewable resource variability are proposed, and wider lessons from the approach taken are identified.

Abstract: In this article, a combined mean value-zero-dimensional model is developed using a modular approach in the computational environment of Matlab/Simulink. According to that, only the,closed cycle of one engine cylinder is modelled by following the zero-dimensional approach, whereas the cylinder open cycle as well as the other engine components are modelled according to the mean value concept. The proposed model combines the advantages of the mean value and zero-dimensional models allowing for the calculation of engine performance parameters including the in-cylinder ones in relatively short execution time and therefore, it can be used in cases where the mean value model exceeds its limitations. A large marine four-stroke Diesel engine steady state operation at constant speed was simulated and the results were validated against the engine shop trials data. The model provided results comparable to the respective ones obtained by using a mean value model. Then, a number of simulation runs were performed, so that the mapping of the brake specific fuel consumption for the whole operating envelope was derived. In addition, runs with varying turbocharger turbine geometric area were carried out and the influence of variable turbine geometry on the engine performance was evaluated. Finally, the developed model was used to investigated the propulsion system behaviour of a handymax size product carrier for constant and variable engine speed operation. The results are presented and discussed enlightening the most efficient strategies for the ship operation and quantifying the expected fuel savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The adaptation between a building and its automation system can potentially be increased by model-based controllers with an integrated control model and information about indoor climate disturbances. The associated energy savings potential is large but a widespread utilization is typically prevented by high complexities. From that point of view, a trade-off technology that combines implementability with an overall higher performance than the system of current practice would be a better option at most sites. This work presents an experimental evaluation of an alternative controller that follows the same principle as model-based, but has gone through a large number of simplification measures for a reduced overall complexity and a limited function. The controller was evaluated for indoor climate control by automating the ventilation flow rate during a typical office working day that was re-created in a laboratory environment. Experiments were conducted in two different office sites, as well as during two weather seasons of Swedish summer and winter. From the investigation, it was concluded that despite of the reduced complexity, the investigated controller could save between 12% and 19% of indicated energy compared to a system of common practice at the same time as the quality of indoor climate was maintained.

Abstract: The implementation of innovative materials for energy saving is a main focus in the building sector. In this context, aerogels are often indicated as really promising materials. In particular, aerogel blankets have already shown potential in many retrofitting projects while the development of glazing systems with aerogel is still at the research stage. This paper describes the development of double pane glazing systems with monolithic silica aerogel in their cavity. The results of a multi-disciplinary analysis, including thermal and lighting tests, are reported. This new monolithic aerogel window is then used in the retrofitting project of an educational building completed in the 1960s. A level 3 energy audit was conducted through measurements of the envelope transmissibility, the building air-tightness, and several indoor environmental parameters. The energy audit provided data for an accurate energy model and to perform a detailed analysis of the energy consumptions of the building. Several energy saving measures for the case study building were then investigated. Lighting and energy simulations allowed comparisons of different designs of the aerogel window with the intent to guarantee sufficient daylight, clear perception of the external environment, and high energy saving. Finally, this paper provides a sensitivity analysis of the investigated retrofitting strategies in different climates, with the intent to show where aerogel windows may represent a valuable retrofitting choice.

Abstract: Politics and industry increasingly request comprehensive ex-ante decision support from a sustainability perspective in complex strategic decision situations. Several approaches have been introduced in the last years to increase the comprehensiveness of life cycle based assessments from covering only environmental aspects towards covering all sustainability aspects. This way, (environmental) life cycle assessment (LCA) has been extended towards life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). However, a practical application in ex-ante decision support requires additional features and flexibility that do not exist in the newly devised frameworks. Our methodology of integrated life cycle sustainability assessment (ILCSA) builds upon existing frameworks, extends them with features for ex-ante assessments that increase the value for decision makers and introduces a structured discussion of results to derive concrete conclusions and recommendations. At the same time, the flexibility allows for focussing on those sustainability aspects relevant in the respective decision situation using the best available methodology for assessing each aspect within the overarching ILCSA. ILCSA has so far been successfully applied in five large EC-funded projects. We discuss our methodology based on a concrete application example from these projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Experimental results on the destruction of H2S and xylene mixtures in H-2/O-2-N-2 flames, at an equivalence ratio of three (Claus condition) are presented. The combustion generated products, including excited radical species were analyzed using flame emission spectroscopy and online gas chromatography (GC). The results showed the oxidation of H2S and H-2 that resulted in the formation of high mole fraction of SO2. The formed SO2 further decomposed due to the formation of S-2 and CS2 in the reactor. This reveals the possible interaction between sulfurous and hydrocarbon radicals. The examination of emission spectra of excited species between 280 nm and 490 nm showed C-2* and C-3* swan bands, CHO* and CH* bands and H* (Balmer band series). The results also showed bands of SO, SH, S-2*, CS2* and SO2*. The continuum of SO2 afterglow was also observed in the flame. These results provide insight on the reaction chemistry associated with the destruction of xylene and H2S. They are also of significant interest to operators and designers of sulfur plants, as well as related policy-makers. The results show the formation of value added chemicals, such as methane that can also be recovered from acid gases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study estimated the potential of algal bioenergy production using nitrogen and phosphorus present in the dairy manure (produced in the US). State wise dairy manure production and energy mixes were used to estimate algal bioenergy production and associated life cycle nonrenewable primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions for the four scenarios. These scenarios were constructed using various combination of following processes (i) anaerobic digestion, (ii) algal biodiesel production using effluent from (i), (iii) pyrolysis, and (iv) enzymatic hydrolysis. Bioenergy production, nonrenewable primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions of each state were aggregated to estimate the total bioenergy production, nonrenewable primary energy requirement and greenhouse gas emissions for the US. Two different cases were simulated for each scenario, one without taking into account the nutrient values (N, P) of applied sludge generated from the bioenergy production (Case B) while in the other one, nutrient values of sludge were considered (Case A). For incorporation of nutrient values of sludge, system expansion approach was used. It was estimated that by using dairy manure, 0.56 billion GJ/yr bioenergy could be produced. Minimum "nonrenewable primary energy requirement (NRPER)" (GJ/GJ) [Total primary nonrenewable energy requirement/bioenergy produced] and GHG emissions (kg CO2 eq./GJ bioenergy produced) for the four scenarios (1-4) for case B were as follows (1) 0.37, 27 (2) 0.51, -30; (3) 0.55, 47 and (4) 0.70, 15 respectively. In case A, NRPER did not change as compared to case B. GHG emissions increased in case A scenarios as compared to case B scenarios. The increase in GHG emission was mostly due to incorporation of reference scenario (raw dairy manure was applied on the ground) and N2O emission from the sludge amended soil. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The identification, adoption and utilisation of reliable interconnection technology to assembly crystalline silicon solar cells in photovoltaic (PV) module are critical to ensure that the device performs continually up to 20 years of its design life span. With report that 40.7% of this type of PV module fails at interconnection coupled with recent reports of increase in such failure in the tropics, the review of interconnection technologies employed in crystalline silicon solar cells manufacture has become imperative. Such review is capable of providing information that can improve the reliability of the system when adopted which in turn will increase silicon PV module production share more than the current value of 90.956%. This review presents the characteristics of interconnect contacts in conventional cells and other unconventional crystalline silicon cells. It compares series resistance, shadowing losses and the induced thermo-mechanical stress in the interconnection for each interconnection technique employed. The paper also reviews interconnection technologies in these assemblies and presents a comparison of their concept, cell type, joint type, manufacturing techniques and production status. Moreover, the study reviews and discusses the material and technological reliability challenges of silicon solar cells interconnection. The review identifies laser soldering technology as one which has the potential of making interconnection with higher reliability when compared with conventional soldering technology. It was found that this technology supports the current design trend of thinner, wider and cheaper crystalline silicon solar cells significantly whilst producing interconnection that experience relatively lower induced thermo-mechanical stress. The authors recommend that wider acceptance and usage of laser soldering technology could improve the performance and consequently extend the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of photovoltaic modules in general and particularly the ones which operates in the tropics. This will enable improvement in the reliability of PV modules for sustainable energy generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Rice husks were converted into activated carbon by KOH activation, at temperatures between 400 and 900 degrees C and used in a two-electrode supercapacitor. The rice husks contain SiO2 nano-crystals surrounded by an amorphous carbon matrix. The activated carbons maintained their size and shape after the synthesis process and the ordering degree of carbon increased at elevated temperatures. The highest BET surface area of the activated carbons was around 3145 m(2) g(-1). Electrochemical properties of the studied samples were measured using a two electrode cell in 6 M KOH and 1.5 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile. The material synthesized at 800 degrees C showed the highest gravimetric capacitance performance of 367 F g(-1) and 174 F g(-1) in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. In contrast to the commercial activated carbons, rice husk activated carbon (RHAC), this material showed excellent high-power handling ability and electrochemical cycle performance, after 30000 cycles the capacitive value almost remained unchanged.

Abstract: Conductive polypyrrole (PPy) polymer - multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) composites were synthesized using sulfanilic acid azochromotrop (SPADNS) and sulfonazo III sodium salt (CHR-BS) as anionic dopants for chemical polymerization of PPy. The composites were tested for application in electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). Sedimentation tests, electrophoretic deposition experiments and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations showed that strong adsorption of anionic CHR-BS on MWCNT provided MWCNT dispersion. The analysis of scanning and transmission electron microscopy data demonstrated that the use of CHR-BS allowed the formation of PPy coatings on MWCNT. As a result, the composites, prepared using CHR-BS, showed higher capacitance, compared to the composites, prepared using SPADNS. The electrodes, containing MWCNT, coated with PPy showed a capacitance of 179 F g(-1) for active mass loading of 10 mg cm(-2), good capacitance retention at scan rates in the range of 2-100 mV s(-1) and excellent cyclic stability. Asymmetric ES devices, containing positive PPy-MWCNT electrodes and negative vanadium nitride (VN)-MWCNT electrodes showed significant improvement in energy storage performance, compared to the symmetric ES due to the larger voltage window. The low impedance and high capacitance of the individual cells paved the way to the development of modules with higher voltage, which showed good electrochemical performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Among the actively studied electrode materials, layered cobalt or nickel compounds have been recognized as a family of promising electrode materials for supercapacitor. However, the cycling performance of these materials is unsatisfactory by far. In this work, a novel and stable layered cobalt nickel silicate hollow sphere compound was prepared for supercapacitor application using a facile hydrothermal synthetic approach. The obtained material exhibited a good specific capacitance and outstanding long-term cycling stability (only 0.7% and 5% losses of its initial specific capacitance after 10,000 and 20,000 cycles, respectively) at a high current density of 20 A/g after annealing at 600 degrees C. This work provides new insights of designing novel cobalt or nickel compounds for supercapacitor with excellent stability, and promotes the application of layered metal silicates as advanced supercapacitor materials.

Abstract: Nanowired alpha-MnO2 material supported on carbon fiber paper (alpha-MnO2/CFP) is synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method for supercapacitor electrode. The alpha-MnO2/CFP material is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and BET for its composition, structure/morphology, and BET surface area. The electrochemical properties of the alpha-MnO2/CFP electrode are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M Na2SO4 solution. The porous alpha-MnO2/CFP material electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 251 F g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1), and also exhibits a good rate capability and an excellent cycling stability. It is testified that even after 3000 cycles, the capacitance retention of the porous alpha-MnO2/CFP material electrode can still maintain over 98.9% of the capacitance at the high current density of 4 A g(-1), demonstrating its excellent cycling stability. The high electrochemical performance of the porous alpha-MnO2/CFP material nanowire electrode may be attributed to the 2 x 2 tunnel structure, high active surface area, and high porosity of the of alpha-MnO2 material.

Abstract: A simple chemical route was adopted for the preparation of graphene by chemical reduction route using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent. A systematic study was done to show the effect of NaBH4 on the reduction and the obtained graphene samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Atomic force microcopy and High resolution transmission electron microscopy. Better reduction of GO was observed at GO and NaBH4 ratio of 1:10 (denoted as SR1:10). Further, the investigation was emphasized to show the effect of the above GO to reductant ratio on its charge storage properties. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in 6 M KOH electrolyte and the results show that the capacitance performance was increased in the order of GO < SR1:8 < SR1:4 < SR1:12 < SR1:10. A high specific capacitance of 284.3 F/g was observed for SR1:10 electrode at 5 mV/s scan rate could be due to better electrical conductivity of sample. The ratio of GO and NaBH4 was optimized to 1:10 for high degree reduction of graphene, which has higher capacitance towards supercapacitor applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ultra-small nickel-manganese oxide/multi-wall carbon nanotubes/carbon fiber paper (NMC) composite with 3D porous structure for supercapacitor electrode material was synthesized by an electrochemical deposition process. The MWNCTs depositing on the current collector carbon fiber paper (CFP) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as a substrate with high surface to support nickel-manganese oxide, enhance the electrical conductivity of the oxides. These composite was characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of as-prepared composites are also investigated. The results indicate that MWCNTs/CFP composite is a wonderful conductive substrate for supporting metal oxide and NMC possesses wonderful structural and electrochemical properties, which makes NMC a wonderful material for developing supercapacitor electrodes with high electrochemical properties.

Abstract: In this study, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which combines battery for long-term energy management and supercapacitor for fast dynamic power regulation, is proposed for remote area renewable energy power supply systems. The operation of a passive connected HESS was examined via both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation using Matlab/Simulink. An electric inductor was further introduced to improve the performance of the HESS. An experimental test bench was developed to validate the simulation results. It was demonstrated that the HESS can stabilize energy provision, not only for the intermittent renewable energy (RE), but also for fluctuating load applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Polyaniline tends to degrade with cycling in aqueous electrolytes and it can be alleviated using gel electrolytes. A low-cost solid-state supercapacitor of high energy density and good cyclic stability is fabricated with a facile method. The electrodes of the supercapacitor are made of a freestanding composite film of polyaniline and acid-treated carbon particles using phytic acid as a crosslinker, and the gel electrolyte is composed of sulfuric acid and polyvinyl alcohol. The electrochemical performances of the as-fabricated supercapacitor are investigated with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our results show that a maximum capacitance of 272.6 F/g (3.63 F/cm(2)) at a current density of 0.63 A/g can be achieved by the supercapacitor, which is significantly higher than most solid-state ones reported in the literature. The ability to achieve a high-capacitance supercapacitor with good cyclic stability is mainly attributed to excellent infiltration of the gel electrolyte into the electrodes. The developed lightweight, thin, flexible, and environmental friendly supercapacitor would have potential applications in various energy storage devices, such as wearable electronics and hybrid electric vehicles.

Abstract: In order to improve the energy density and power density of supercapacitors, the main concepts of this study are to exploit advantages of three different materials: high energy density of ruthenium oxides (RuO2), high power density of mesoporous carbon CMK-3, and high conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form a composite electrode.
The crystallization and dispersion of RuO2, the effects of RuO2 mass fraction, and CMK-3/CNTs on energy/power densities are discussed. Microstructures of all the specimens are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Furthermore, the specific capacitance and the ideal density of energy and power are derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. In short, the combination of RuO2, CNT, and CMK-3 lead to enhanced the specific capacitance of 1102 F/g, energy density of 0.15 W h/g and power density of 237 W/g, which are 4 times and 3 times greater than those of CMK-3, respectively. The results provide effective routes to enhance the capacitance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a simple but innovative bi-directional energy conversion system is developed, utilizing supercapacitor as energy source to drive an electric scooter, as well as to recover braking energy on demand. Supercapacitor is superior to battery at high load as the latter is susceptible to aging and significant heat loss under this condition, leading to sometimes serious issues such as shortened lifecycle. The system consists of a microprocessor based vehicle controller (integrating an embedded regenerative braking controller), a 300 W Permanent Magnet (PM) DC motor, two low-power DC-DC converters to form a higher power DC-DC converter pack, a motor controller, a supercapacitor bank and a capacitor cell balancing sub-system. To characterize system performance, a dedicated test rig is built and the system is broken down into three stages with input and output variables of each stage being evaluated systematically in three representative cases. The experimental results show overall effectiveness of such system. Operating conditions where high efficiency reside are therefore able to be determined to gain insight into a complex system.

Abstract: Fluorescent polypyrrole nanospheres (PPy/CBS-X) with uniform diameter were synthesized via a chemical oxidation polymerization with fluorescent brightener, 2,2'-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diyldi-2,1-ethenediyl)bis-benzenesulfonic acid disodium salt (CBS-X), as dopant. The sample S-2 containing 1 mol% CBS-X simultaneously exhibited the highest electrical conductivity of 31.3 S/cm and the largest specific area of 98.33 m(2)/g. When being used as electrode material for supercapacitors, it also possessed the high electrochemical specific capacitance (245.8 F/g) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s and the better rate capability and improved electrochemical stability than neutral (undoped) PPy, essentially attributed to a synergistic effect on the high doping level, large specific area and good pi-pi interactions from both PPy chains and CBS-X dopant. Most interestingly, the electrochemical activity of the fluorescent PPy/CBS-X could be easily monitored by photoluminescence. These features make the fluorescent polypyrrole nanospheres potential smart electrode material for high performance supercapacitors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Carbon deposition has a serious effect on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). An unsteady-state 2D model based on COMSOL software is used to study the carbon deposition process in a planar SOFC. The carbon deposition, catalyst activity, reaction rate and temperature fields are obtained to analyse the mechanism of carbon deposition in the SOFC at different operating time. The effects of the operating voltage, inlet H-2 molar fraction, operating pressure and operating temperature on the performance of the SOFC are investigated in detail. It is found that the biggest variation of the performances caused by carbon deposition occurs in the inlet domain of the anode support layer. The increase of operating voltage, inlet H-2 molar fraction, operating pressure and temperature accelerates the carbon deposition process. The predicted results could deepen our understanding of carbon deposition and its transient quantitative effects on the catalyst, structure and cell performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Three kinds of new polymeric SSPCMs with different crosslinking structures were synthesized and characterized for thermal energy storage. In the SSPCMs, three hexahydroxy compounds (sorbitol, dipentaerythritol and inositol) were individually employed as the molecular skeleton and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as the phase change functional chain. The molecular structure, crystalline properties, phase change behaviors, thermal reliability and stability of the synthesized SSPCMs were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG), respectively. The results show that the prepared SSPCMs possess high thermal energy storage density and an applicable temperature range of 30-70 degrees C, and the maximum phase change enthalpy in the heating and cooling process for the SSPCMs is 107.5 kJ/kg and 102.9 kJ/kg, respectively. The prepared SSPCMs have good reusability, excellent thermal reliability and stability from the heating-cooling thermal cycle test and TG curves. The resultant SSPCMs could be potentially applied in the areas of thermal energy storage and temperature-control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study investigates the economic viability of small-scale, multi-generation systems (combined heat and power (CHP), combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP)), along with conventional heating and cooling systems combining sixteen heating/cooling energy generation systems (H/C-EGSs). The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EBPD) comparative framework methodology is followed. The local cost-optimal solution for an office building, in Helsinki, Finland is determined for each H/C-EGS as well as the global cost-optimum. The suggested energy efficiency measures get 144 building combinations, and alongside the H/C-EGSs, altogether 2304 cases. The results show that the global cost-optimum belongs to the ground source heat pump with free ground cooling. The investigated biomass-based CHPs are economically viable only with high overall efficiency and low power-to-heat ratio due to both low investment and operational costs. The biomass-based CCHPs do not have economic or environmental benefits over the biomass-based CHPs due to the significant increase entailed of both investment and operational costs. The fossil fuel-based CHPs with high operational costs are the worst solutions economically and environmentally. Extending the cost optimal solutions by a photovoltaic panels system yields the net zero-energy office building with minimum life-cycle costs as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Chemical reaction is the most important source of combustion irreversibility in premixed conditions, but details of the exergy loss mechanisms have not been explored yet. In this study numerical analysis based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics combined with detailed chemical kinetics is conducted to explore the exergy loss mechanism of gasoline engine like combustion process which is simplified as constant volume combustion. The fuel is represented by the common accepted gasoline surrogates which consist of four components: iso-octane (57%), n-heptane (16%), toluene (23%), and 2-pentene (4%). We find that overall exergy loss is mainly composed of three peaks along combustion generated from chemical reactions in three stages, the conversion from large fuel molecules into small molecules (as Stage 1), the H2O2 loop-related reactions (as Stage 2), and the violent oxidation reactions of CO, H, and O (as Stage 3). The effects of individual combustion boundaries, including temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, oxygen concentration, on combustion exergy loss have been widely investigated. The combined effects of combustion boundaries on the total loss of gasoline surrogates are also investigated. We find that in a gasoline engine with a compression ratio of 10, the total loss can be reduced from 31.3% to 24.3% using lean combustion. The total loss can be further reduced to 22.4% by introducing exhaust gas recirculation and boosting the inlet charge. If the compression ratio is increased to 17, the total loss can be decreased to 20.4%, and finally to 16.8%, if the compression ratio is further increased to 100. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The Vaxja municipality sets specific energy related requirements beyond the Swedish building code (BBR) when selling land for the construction of new residential buildings. The requirement for Ostra Lugnet residential area was that all buildings must be connected to the local district heating network and installation of heat pumps was prohibited in developer-built group/row houses. This paper (a) analyzed if the energy use of the buildings fulfilled the requirements of the BBR and that of Vaxjb municipality, and (b) compared the primary energy use and CO2 emission from operation of the district heated buildings with hypothetical scenarios where only air-source or bedrock heat pumps were installed. Results showed that a significant proportion of the group/row houses did not fulfil the specific energy use requirements of the BBR and that of Vaxio municipality. There were large variations between predicted and actual energy use. Using a marginal accounting approach, houses with district heating were found to have the lowest carbon emission. From this perspective it seems appropriate for Vaxjb municipality to set the requirement that new residential buildings in Ostra Lugnet be connected to the local district heating network.

Abstract: The adopted energy efficiency directive stresses the use of excess heat as a way to reach the EU target of primary energy use. Use of industrial excess heat may result in decreased energy demand, CO2 emissions reduction, and economic gains. In this study, an energy systems analysis is performed with the aim of investigating how excess heat should be used, and the impact on CO2 emissions. The manner in which the heat is recovered will affect the system. The influence of excess heat recovery and the trade-off between heat recovery for heating or cooling applications and electricity production has been investigated using the energy systems modeling tool reMIND. The model has been optimized by minimizing the system cost. The results show that it is favorable to recover the available excess heat in all the investigated energy market scenarios, and that heat driven electricity production is not a part of the optimal solution. The trade-off between use of recovered excess heat in the heating or cooling system depends on the energy market prices and the type of heat production. The introduction of excess heat reduces the CO2 emissions in the system for all the studied energy market scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy storage is regarded as a key factor to allow significant increase in the percentage of electricity generation from renewables. One of the most critical aspects related with energy storage is its economic feasibility, which intrinsically involves the analysis of the off-design conditions and the evaluation of the operating strategies using proper methodologies. This paper considers a promising system for mechanical energy storage constituted by a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) integrated with a Hybrid Power Plant (HPP) and coupled with a wind farm. This system is modeled considering the South of Italy as the possible location. The HPP-CAES is simulated to operate on the Italian Power Exchange market, for one year, implementing suitable selling strategies. Cost analysis is performed using a thermoeconomic approach. Results show that reduced operating hours and large variations in the electricity production of the wind farm make the HPP-CAES cost-effective only when it is operated with the goal of solving local imbalances of the grid.

Abstract: A thermoelectric generator prototype has been built; it produces 21.56W of net power, the produced thermoelectric power minus the consumption of the auxiliary equipment, using an area of 0.25 m(2) (approximately 100 W/m(2)). The prototype is located at the exhaust of a combustion chamber and it is provided with 48 thermoelectric modules and two different kinds of heat exchangers, finned heat sinks and heat pipes. Globally, the 40% of the primary energy used is thrown to the ambient as waste heat; one of the many different applications in which thermoelectricity can be applied is to harvest waste heat to produce electrical power.
Besides, the influence on the thermoelectric and on the net power generation of key parameters such as the temperature and mass flow of the exhaust gases, the heat dissipation systems in charge of dispatching the heat into the ambient and the consumption of the auxiliary equipment has been studied. In terms of heat dissipation, the heat pipes outperform the finned dissipators, a 43% more net power is obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Organic phase change materials (PCMs) have exhibited many promising potentials for thermal energy conversion and storage, but they are still confronted with many technical bottlenecks for practical application, such as low conductivity, leakage during phase transition process, and lack of functionality. In this article, a highly-efficient electro/photo to heat conversion system of polyurethane@graphite foam (PU@GF) phase change composites was successfully fabricated through in situ polymerization of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in GF. The obtained PU presents solid-solid phase transition behavior that is different from the solid-liquid phase change of original PEG, which can prevent PU from leakage even if it was loaded in micrometer pores in the GF during application. On the other side, PU can improve the thermal stability and decrease the overcooling degree of the composites in effect. Excellent conductive network was provided by the GF, with which the light absorption and thermal conductivity of the composites were enhanced dramatically. Consequently, the solid-solid phase change composites can effectively store electricity or sunlight energy. The electro-heat storage efficiency of the composites can exceed 80% at 1.2 or 1.4 V, meanwhile, the photo-heat storage efficiency can close to 67% under simulated solar illumination. This result presents the highest efficiency for electro-to-heat conversion by PCMs techniques driven by a quite low voltage up to now, and will give rise to a new expectation of functional PCM application for energy conversion and storage.

Abstract: Small Hydro Power (SHP) is one of the most important renewable energy generation sources. It is a cost-effective technology that is being used for rural electrification in the developing countries including India. The Indian government is providing attractive initiatives to the private investors to promote faster development of SHP. Until now, a lot has been written about assessment, potential, advantages and the technical aspects of the SHP plants. However, the important business sustainability perspective has not been yet subjected to empirical analysis. Sustainable development involves three interconnected dimensions: social, economic and environmental sustainability. This paper attempts to investigate whether SHP business in India is a sustainable business. The study is based on the analysis of qualitative data acquired through 28 in-depth interviews with various actors that are connected to the SHP industry in India which include Independent Power Producers (IPPs), manufacturers, designers, consultants and representatives of various government organizations. The empirical material was collected in four states of India namely New Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in February, 2013. The data was acquired by individual in-depth interviews, group discussions and direct observation of one SHP plant. The results show that all the three dimensions of sustainability are being realized to a certain extent. However, utmost efforts have to be undertaken in order to call this sector completely sustainable. Both benefits and challenges in all these dimensions are highlighted and recommendations towards a sustainable SHP sector are provided. Further, this study also proposes suggestions for the interested investors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Demand response is increasing in popularity and many utilities are developing demand response programs. However, there exists many challenges to the deployment of demand response. One of the main barriers to widespread rollout is the uncertainty surrounding the value of demand response. In this regard, there is a real and pressing need to evaluate demand response if its full potential is to be realized. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature and identifies some of the key barriers to the deployment and the challenges to the evaluation of demand response and provides some recommendations on evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: In this paper, high power 7 A h LiFePO4-based cells (LFP) have been used to investigate the impact of the charging methodology on the battery's lifetime. Three charging techniques have been used: Constant Current (CC), Constant Current-Constant Voltage (CC-CV) and Constant Current-Constant Voltage with Negative Pulse (CC-CVNP). A comparative study between these techniques is presented in this research. For this purpose, a characterization of the batteries has been performed using capacity test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As expected the obtained results showed that the battery's aging rate depends on the charging methodology. Indeed, it has been shown that a combination of low amplitude and fewest number of negative pulses has a positive effect on battery's capacity fading. From the impedance measurements, the results have demonstrated that the CC-CVNP technique with low amplitude and fewest number of negative pulses is more effective than the other techniques in reducing the concentration polarization resistance and the diffusion time constant. This research has provided an extended analysis to select the proper charging methodology that can be used to design an enhanced charging system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRESs) into power grids has increased in the last decade. Integration of wind farms and solar systems as the major IRESs have significantly boosted the level of uncertainty in operation of power systems. This paper proposes a comprehensive computational framework for quantification and integration of uncertainties in distributed power systems (DPSs) with IRESs. Different sources of uncertainties in DPSs such as electrical load, wind and solar power forecasts and generator outages are covered by the proposed framework. Load forecast uncertainty is assumed to follow a normal distribution. Wind and solar forecast are implemented by a list of prediction intervals (Pis) ranging from 5% to 95%. Their uncertainties are further represented as scenarios using a scenario generation method. Generator outage uncertainty is modeled as discrete scenarios. The integrated uncertainties are further incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem and a heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve this stochastic SCUC problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, five deterministic and four stochastic case studies are implemented. Generation costs as well as different reserve strategies are discussed from the perspectives of system economics and reliability. Comparative results indicate that the planned generation costs and reserves are different from the realized ones. The stochastic models show better robustness than deterministic ones. Power systems run a higher level of risk during peak load hours. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The present technologies in internal combustion engines for transportation purposes clearly demonstrate the room for improvement still achievable. In a recent past, harmful emission reduction was the main goal: wonderful technologies were developed which strongly reoriented the interest and the use of such engines. Actually, CO2 is the most important driver: it calls for fuel consumption reduction (energy saving) and energy recovery from that usually wasted.
Considering that about one third of the fuel energy is in the flue gases, the possibility to recover this energy and re-use it for engine and vehicle needs is one of the smartest ways to participate to reduce fuel consumption and, therefore, CO2 emissions. In particular, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-based power units fed by the exhaust gases are promising and technologically ready, but they have a significant impact on the exhaust line and engine behavior.
A trade-off between energy recovered in mechanical form and energy lost due to the engine back pressure, vehicle weight increase, discharge energy at the condenser, and the management of the strong off-design operating conditions is a key point which could definitively open the way to this technology or limit it to particular applications.
The paper discusses the effects of the pressure losses produced by an ORC-based power unit mounted on the exhaust line of a turbocharged IVECO F1C engine, operated on a test bench. The interactions produced on the turbocharged engine have been experimentally investigated: the presence of an Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) system to manage the turbocharger makes the effect of the back pressure not straightforward to be predicted. The IGV opening and closure degree, in fact, can compensate the effect of the back pressure which intrinsically tends to increase specific fuel consumption. A wide experimental testing of the turbocharging group in order to understand its reaction and the net effect in terms of engine specific fuel consumption is presented.
Finally, once the engine performances were verified, the contribution due to the heat recovery inside the ORC-based power unit fed by the exhaust gases in terms of mechanical power was evaluated and experimentally verified in some points, considering the strong off design conditions produced by the engine operating point variations. In fact, exhaust gas flow rate and temperature variations lead the evaporator, even though properly designed, to severe off-design conditions which modify the inlet working fluid conditions till to make the mechanical recovery impossible. Under the hypothesis that the engine propels a light duty vehicle, the effect of the extra weight is discussed re-evaluating the propulsion power increase in terms of fuel consumption.

Abstract: This paper is aimed to analyze design criteria, setting up, control strategies and experimental tests related to a power configuration of DC micro-grid for fast charging,of full electric and plug in hybrid vehicles. The proposed DC fast charging architecture is derived by an analysis comparing the main characteristics of well known architectures, mainly based on AC and DC bus, taking also into account the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) with stationary energy storage systems and fleets of road electric/hybrid vehicles. On the base of the proposed architecture a laboratory prototype of charging station has been realized by means of a 20 kW AC/DC bidirectional grid tie converter interconnected with two different power DC/DC converters of similar rated power. In this micro-grid architecture the AC/DC converter realizes a conversion stage at 790 V DC, whereas other two converters allow either the electric vehicle battery packs to be charged or an energy storage buffer to save electric energy and support the main grid during the fast charging operations. The laboratory tests described in this paper are mainly devoted to characterize the laboratory demonstrator, in different operative conditions, such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G), charging/discharging operations of different types of storage systems and fast charging operations of road electric vehicles. Then the study of the proposed power conversion architecture is focused on the evaluation of charging/discharging power, efficiency, energy flux management and its impact on the main grid. In addition proper control strategies are evaluated and implemented, allowing the proposed architecture to follow the required operations. The obtained experimental results demonstrate real advantages in terms of charging times and power requirements from the main grid, when adopting DC buffer architecture for fast charging operations. Finally, these results support the identification of a knowledge base, useful to evaluate energy management and control strategies to be adopted for DC charging stations and each one of their power converters in a smart grid scenario with distributed generation systems.

Abstract: Wall temperature uniformity and enhancement in a micro combustor for thermo photovoltaic (TPV) applications have attracted considerable attention from researchers in recent years because of their direct impact on efficiency and feasibility of desired energy conversion. In this regard, numerous experimental and numerical studies in micro-combustion application have been conducted and reported. However, most previous studies have been focused on geometrical configurations limited to planar and circular channels. It is therefore of interest to investigate the impact of different channel geometries on wall temperature distribution and energy conversion efficiency. This study addresses flow and flame behavior in a micro-combustor. By utilizing the well-established computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach, the effect of geometrical parameters on the flow behavior and wall temperature is examined and evaluated. In order to improve the productive capability of the computational model, several steady state Reynolds Average Numerical Simulation (RANS) turbulence models alongside with different reaction rate formulations are evaluated. The results indicate that Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) with Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) provide the best quantitative prediction. The developed model is employed to investigate the effect of inlet velocity on flame structure and outer wall temperature. Furthermore, the effect of reactor cross sections, including circular, square, rectangular, triangular and trapezoidal, on the wall temperature is also evaluated. The results show that the

wall temperature is increased with an increase in the inlet velocity. Trapezoidal and triangular cross-sections are found to have better performance in terms of Figure of Merit (FoM), a parameter used in this study to gage thermal and hydraulic performance of a micro-combustor.

Abstract: We present a model developed to study the increase of self-consumption of photovoltaic (PV) power by smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Whereas previous studies mostly use large EV fleets in their models, our focus is on a smaller scale. We apply the model to a microgrid in Lombok, a residential neighbourhood in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The microgrid consists of a 31 kWp PV installation, an office, internet servers, three households, and two EVs. Three control algorithms are presented which manage the charging profile of multiple EVs either in real-time or using linear optimisation with predictions for PV power and electricity demand. We perform one-year simulations using data for PV power, EV use, and electricity demand. Simulations results are evaluated on PV self-consumption and peak demand reduction. In addition, we make qualitative statements on battery degradation resulting from the charging strategies based on several indicators. We also simulate changes in microgrid composition, for example by including more EVs. In the simulations, self-consumption increases from 49% to 62-87% and demand peaks decrease by 27-67%. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of smart charging EVs with PV power. Furthermore, our results give insight into the effect of different charging strategies and microgrid compositions.

Abstract: We have investigated a hybrid power train for ship crane operations, using a lithium-ion battery in conjunction with diesel gensets for auxiliary power generation, as an alternative to a conventional power train using only gensets. We have simulated crane operations in port using both solutions, in order to quantify the potential economic gains of using hybrid power generation. This study is based on a real open-hatch dry bulk vessel of 50,000 dwt, which is compared with a corresponding newbuilding ship with hybrid auxiliary power generation. We have modelled the complete auxiliary power system, including diesel generators, lithium-ion batteries, cranes and ship hotel consumers. We have developed a novel hybrid control strategy that has the potential to reduce the minimal size and thereby cost of batteries for hybrid ships. Our results indicate that the hybrid solution will lead to about 30% reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions while operating cranes, which amounts to annual savings of $110,000, with $450,000 savings over three years of operation, as well as reduced capital costs compared to the conventional power generation system.

Abstract: Regenerator is the core component in the regenerative heat engines, such as thermoacoustic heat engine, and Stirling heat engine. The regenerator has a porous configuration, in which the thermoacoustic effect happens between the working gas and solid wall converting heat into acoustic work. In this paper, a novel experimental setup was developed to investigate the thermoacoustic conversion characteristic of the regenerator. In this system, two linear motors acted as compressors to provide acoustic work for the regenerator and the other two linear motors served as alternators to consume the acoustic work out of the regenerator. By changing the impedance of the alternators, the phase difference between the volume velocities at the two ends of the regenerator could be varied within a large range. In the experiments, the influence of phase difference, heating temperature and different materials on the performance of the regenerator were studied in detail. According to the experimental results, the output acoustic power increased when the phase difference between velocities of the compression and expansion pistons increased within this phase angle range. And the thermoacoustic efficiency had different optimum values with different heating temperatures. Additionally, it also shows that flow resistance and heat transfer area were very important to the performance. In the experiments, a maximum output acoustic power of 715W and a highest thermoacoustic efficiency of 35.6% were obtained with stack and random fiber type regenerators respectively under 4 MPa pressurized helium and 650 degrees C heating temperature. This work provides an efficient way to investigate the thermoacoustic conversion characteristic of the regenerator. It also provides some clues to the regenerator design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The present work investigated the outdoor performance of a basin type multi-stage solar still as well as the effect of collector over basin area (CBA) ratio on the distillate production. The effect of CBA was studied in outdoor experiments for the first time. The system consisted of a still coupled with one, two or three flat-plate solar collectors. In order to study the effect of CBA more accurately, the experiments were conducted in both winter and summer. In these experiments, the distilled water production of the multistage still was measured during the whole 24 h of a day on an hourly basis. The results revealed that in the winter, the basin coupled to one solar collector (CBA = 3.45) produced 11.56 kg of distillate. Adding a second collector (CBA = 6.90) to the system increased the production by 96%, whereas adding a third one (CBA = 10.35) increased it by only 23%. However, in the summer, 48% and 23% more productivity were obtained by adding the second and third collector, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Mitigating climate change is driving the need to decarbonize the electricity sector, for which various possible technological options exist, alongside uncertainty over which options are preferable in terms of cost, emissions reductions, and energy security. To reduce this uncertainty, we here quantify two questions for the power system of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): First, when compared within the same high-resolution modeling framework, how much do different combinations of technologies differ in these three respects? Second, how strongly does the cost and availability of grid-scale storage affect overall system cost, and would it favor some technology combinations above others? We compare three main possible generation technologies: (1) renewables, (2) nuclear, and (3) fossil fuels (with/without carbon capture and storage). Our results show that across a wide range of these combinations, the overall costs remain similar, implying that different configurations are equally feasible both technically and economically. However, the most economically favorable scenarios are not necessarily favorable in terms of emissions or energy security. The availability of grid-scale storage in scenarios with little dispatchable generation can reduce overall levelized electricity cost by up to 50%, depending on storage capacity costs. The UK can rely on its domestic wind and solar PV generation at lower renewable shares, with levelized costs only rising more than 10% above the mean of 0.084 GBP/kWh for shares of 50% and below at a 70% share, which is 35% higher. However, for more than an 80% renewable generation share to be economically feasible, large-scale storage, significantly more power imports, or domestic dispatchable renewables like tidal range must be available.

Abstract: State-of-energy (SoE) is a very important index for battery management system (BMS) used in electric vehicles (EVs), it is indispensable for ensuring safety and reliable operation of batteries. For achieving battery SoE accurately, the main work can be summarized in three aspects. (1) In considering that different kinds of batteries show different open circuit voltage behaviors, the Gaussian model is employed to construct the battery model. What is more, the genetic algorithm is employed to locate the optimal parameter for the selecting battery model. (2) To determine an optimal tradeoff between battery model complexity and prediction precision, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to determine the best hysteresis order of the combined battery model. Results from a comparative analysis show that the first-order hysteresis battery model is thought of being the best based on the AIC values. (3) The central difference Kalman filter (CDKF) is used to estimate the real-time SoE and an erroneous initial SoE is considered to evaluate the robustness of the SoE estimator. Lastly, two kinds of lithium-ion batteries are used to verify the proposed SoE estimation approach. The results show that the maximum SoE estimation error is within 1% for both LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 battery datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Active Demand Response (ADR) can contribute to a more cost-efficient operation of, and investment in, the electric power system as it may provide the needed flexibility to cope with the intermittent character of some forms of renewables, such as wind. One possibly promising group of demand side technologies in terms of ADR are electric heating systems. These systems could allow to modify their electrical load pattern without affecting the final, thermal energy service they deliver, thanks to the thermal inertia in the system. One of the major remaining obstacles for a large scale roll-out of ADR schemes is the lack of a thorough understanding of interactions between the demand and supply side of the electric power system and the related possible benefits for consumers and producers. Therefore, in this paper, an integrated system model of the electric power system, including electric heating systems (heat pumps and auxiliary resistance heaters) subjected to an ADR scheme, is developed, taking into account the dynamics and constraints on both the supply and demand side of the electric power system. This paper shows that only these integrated system models are able to simultaneously consider all technical and comfort constraints present in the overall system. This allows to accurately assess the benefits for, and interactions of, demand and supply under ADR schemes. Furthermore, we illustrate the effects not captured by traditional, simplified approaches used to represent the demand side (e.g., price elasticity models and virtual generator models) and the supply side (e.g., electricity price profiles and merit order models). Based on these results, we formulate some conclusions which may help modelers in selecting the approach most suited for the problem they would like to study, weighing the complexity and detail of the model.

Abstract: Energy technology adoption is a complex process, involving social, behavioral, and economic factors that impact individual decision-making. This paper uses an empirical, geographic information system (GIS)-integrated agent-based model of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption to explore the importance of using empirical household-level data and of incorporating economic as well as social and behavioral factors on model outcomes. Our goal is to identify features of the model that are most critical to successful prediction of the temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns that characterize the technology adoption process for solar PV. Agent variables, topology, and environment are derived from detailed and comprehensive real-world data between 2004 and 2013 in Austin (Texas, USA). Four variations of the model are developed, each with a different level of complexity and empirical characterization. We find that while an explicit focus only on the financial aspects of the solar PV adoption decision performs well in predicting the rate and scale of adoption, accounting for agent-level attitude and social interactions are critical for predicting spatial and demographic patterns of adoption with high accuracy.

Abstract: This study evaluates the feasibility and fairness of 2012 amendment to coal-electricity pricing linkage policy in China. Our empirical design is based on several stochastic frontier cost functions and the results show that the amended pricing linkage scheme is a double-edged sword as follows. On the one hand, it provides incentives for less-efficient (with efficiency less than 90%) power plants to increase their efficiency. One the other hand, it imposes a penalty to highly-efficient power plants (with efficiency more than 90%). And even worse, the higher the efficiency is, the bigger the penalty will be. To make the current coal-electricity pricing linkage scheme more feasible, we suggest the threshold value of 5 instead of 10%, and a group specific threshold value instead of the current one-size-for-all practice.

Abstract: A numerical-experimental analysis on a new generation of hydraulically controlled servo solenoid injectors for Euro 6 Diesel engine applications has been carried out. The main innovation of these high-pressure injectors is the replacement of the standard pilot-valve configuration with a pressure-balanced layout. The new setup is aimed at reducing clearance leakages and at improving the dynamic response of the needle to the electrical command.
A previously developed advanced one-dimensional code for the simulation of Common Rail injection systems has been adapted to simulate the innovative injectors. In particular, electromagnetic, hydraulic and mechanical submodels have been set up for the pressure-balanced pilot-valve simulation.
The validated numerical model of the injector has been applied to investigate the mechanics of the pressure-balanced pilot-valve and the sensitivity of the dynamic response of the needle to some of the innovative pilot-valve layout design parameters. Furthermore, the developed simulation tool has been used to examine the real impact that the replacement of the standard pilot-valve layout with a pressure-balanced one could have on the injected flow-rate performance.
The comparative investigation between the standard and the innovative pilot-valve has been completed with an analysis of their experimental static leakages. A comparison has also been made with static leakages measured for hydraulically-controlled servo piezoelectric injectors. Finally, a simple and accurate thermodynamic flow model has been developed to predict static leakages in indirect-acting solenoid and piezoelectric injectors. This model has pointed out the significant dependence of static leakages on temperature and pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Spray drying process has been widely used in various industries for many decades for production of numerous materials. This paper explores the energy performance of an industrial scale spray dryer equipped with an exhaust air heat recovery system for production of high value particles. Energy efficiency and energy saving were calculated using a comprehensive mathematical model of spray drying. The response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to study the effect of process parameters on energy performance using a space-filling design. The meta model equations were formulated employing the well-fitted response surface equations with adjusted R-2 larger than 0.995. The energy efficiency as high as 43.3% was obtained at high flow rate of dilute slurry, while the highest energy saving of 52.4% was found by combination of positive effect of drying air temperature and negative effect of slurry mass flow rate. The utilization of efficient air-to-air heat exchanger leads to an increase in energy efficiency and energy savings. The detailed temperature and vapor concentration profiles obtained with the model are also valuable in determining final product quality when spray dryer is operated at energy efficient conditions.

Abstract: This paper describes an efficient method for optimizing the placement of wind turbines to maximize the expected wind farm power. In a wind farm, the energy production of the downstream wind turbines decreases due to reduced wind speed and increased level of turbulence caused by the wakes formed by the upstream wind turbines. As a result, the wake interference among wind turbines lower the overall power efficiency of the wind farm. To improve the overall efficiency of a wind farm, researchers have studied the wind farm layout optimization problem to find the placement locations of wind turbines that maximize the expected wind farm power. Most studies on wind farm layout optimization employ heuristic search-based optimization algorithms. In spite of their simplicity, optimization algorithms based on heuristic search are computationally expensive and have limitation in optimizing the locations of a large number of wind turbines since the computational time for the search tends to increase exponentially with increasing number of wind turbines. This study employs a mathematical optimization scheme to efficiently and effectively optimize the locations of a large number of wind turbines with respect to maximizing the wind farm power production. To formulate the mathematical optimization problem, we derive a continuous wake model and express the expected wind farm power as a continuous and smooth function in terms of the locations of the wind turbines. The constructed wind farm power function is then maximized using sequential convex programming (SCP) for the nonlinear mathematical problem. We show how SCP can be used to evaluate the efficiency of an existing wind farm and to optimize a wind farm layout consisting of 80 wind turbines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Most hydrodynamic vertical axis turbine concepts use solid blades with active adjustable pitch. These turbines generally need external starting or active pitching mechanisms to overcome their limited starting performance. In this study, a simple and cost-effective vertical axis turbine with flexible foils was designed based on inspiration from hydrodynamic thrust characteristics of aquatic creatures. A full-scale turbine was tested in a controlled river environment in Norway. The turbine's high solidity, flexible foils with self-adjustable cambering, and pivot and spring arrangements on the blade and arm connections enabled the following: reduced turbine vibrations, dynamic foil adjustments, a passive blade pitch action, and limited variation in rotational speed versus incoming flow velocity. These novel aspects resulted in a high performance turbine that attained up to a 0.37 power coefficient in a confined channel and could self-start at low inflow water velocities.

Abstract: We assess the near-term market for vehicle-to-grid electric vehicles (V2G-EV5) using an internet-based contingent-valuation survey. V2G-EV5 are a special breed of electric vehicles used to return power to the grid for ancillary service support or during periods of peak electricity demand. Whether or not these vehicles are economically viable is of interest to policy makers and utility companies. We estimate a demand function for V2G-EVs, consider the importance of different vehicle attributes on demand, and then assess their likelihood of near-term success on the market. To assess the potential market, we compared consumer's willingness to pay for V2G-EVs with the estimated cost of V2G-EV5 under different scenarios of battery cost projection. We found, in all scenarios, WTP estimates are lower than projected costs. Range anxiety, stringent V2G contract, and high battery costs are the primary reasons for the outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Most existing borehole heat exchanger models are based on constant heat flux solutions. This paper first proposes a periodic heat flux composite model for a borehole heat exchanger to reproduce the periodic nature of real loads. An explicit analytical solution of a periodic cylinder-source in composite media is derived using a harmonic method. The periodic thermal response factor is defined to characterize the thermal behaviour of a borehole subjected to a periodic heat flux. The periodic thermal responses factors for high- and low-frequency periodic heat flux are dominantly determined by the thermal properties of the content inside the borehole and the ground outside the borehole, respectively. A frequency decomposition hybrid algorithm is specially designed according to the frequency response characteristic of borehole. The proposed periodic heat flux model is verified through an inter-model comparison with existing constant heat flux models and the comparison indicates an equivalent relationship between the two types of models. An annual simulation is performed using the hybrid algorithm and the accuracy of the algorithm is verified. The paper also presents a new method to analyse the data of an oscillatory thermal response test by using the periodic composite model. The effective heat capacities of the ground and grout are estimated. The simulation results of the periodic composite model are in good agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study on moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion of prevaporised liquid fuels burning in a reverse-flow MILD combustor under elevated pressures. The influence of fuel type, equivalence ratio, carrier gas, operating pressure and air jet velocity on the combustion stability and emissions are investigated. Ethanol, acetone and n-heptane are vaporised and carried to the combustor using either nitrogen or air. It is found that the combustion stability is highly dependent on fuel type, with n-heptane being the most unstable due to its fast ignition under all high-pressure conditions studied. Measured CO emissions emitted from all fuels are very low except when the equivalence ratio approaches the lean extinction limit, and this effect is not dependent on the pressure. The joint regime of low CO and NO, emission becomes narrower under elevated pressure as NO emissions emitted from all fuels increased with pressure. The enhanced NO, formation rate via the nitrous oxide mechanism, the slower mixing, the increased flame temperature and residence time are believed to cause higher NO, emissions as pressure increases. The NO emissions are reduced by increasing the air jet velocity, which is attributed to a lower peak temperature. The NO, emissions are also reduced when the fuel is carried by nitrogen instead of air. Further research is required to understand this trend which will help in reducing NO emissions under these conditions, especially at elevated pressures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the investigation of critical dynamic events causing thermochemical decomposition of the working fluid in organic Rankine cycle power systems. The case study is the plant of an oil and gas platform where one of the three gas turbines is combined with an organic Rankine cycle unit to increase the overall energy conversion efficiency.
The dynamic model of the plant is coupled with a one-dimensional model of the once-through boiler fed by the exhaust thermal power of the gas turbine. The heat exchanger model uses a distributed cross-flow physical topology and local correlations for single- and two-phase heat transfer coefficients.
The results indicate that severe load changes (0.4-1.0 MW s(-1)) can lead to exceedance of the temperature limit of fluid decomposition for a period of 10 min. Ramp rates lower than 0.3 MW s(-1) are acceptable considering the stability of the electric grid and fluid decomposition. It is demonstrated that the use of a spray attemperator can mitigate the problems of local overheating of the organic compound.
As a practical consequence, this paper provides guidelines for safe and reliable operation of organic Rankine cycle power modules on offshore installations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Increasing severe water deficiency has led to an urgent need for better water resource management, especially in China. Electric power systems have been recognized as large water consumers; therefore, comprehensive analysis of their water use is needed. This study aims to analyze the flux and direction of virtual water and virtual scarce water within power system based on transmission-consumption water intensity (TCWI). A case study is then conducted to investigate China's electric power system. The results show that including the water stress index (WSI) and virtual scarce flow concept largely influences the analysis of interregional virtual water flows. Regardless the WSIs, there are four regions exporting virtual water (northeast, north, northwest and central) and two regions exporting virtual scarce water (east and south). While considering the virtual scarce water, the central region becomes a big exporter with 144.12 GL of virtual scarce water outflow. In addition, the virtual water and virtual scarce water flux among these six regions reaches 726 GL and 163 GL, respectively. The electric transmission system transfers virtual scarce water from inland areas to coastal areas, which is roughly the opposite of the distribution of China's water resources. The virtual water analysis incorporating the water scarcity not only largely increases the effectiveness of the results, but also provides more valuable and accurate information for water-efficient management and planning in electric power system.

Abstract: Recycling food waste to produce biogas by anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising process that can both provide renewable energy and dispose solid waste safely. However, this process affects the environment due to greenhouse gas emissions. By lifecycle assessment (LCA), we assessed the energy consumption (EC) and environmental impact (El) of an integrated food waste-based biogas system and its subsystems. Data were collected from an actual plant in China that adopted a combination of wet-heat treatment and wet AD process at thermophilic condition. The EC of the system for processing 1 ton of waste was 663.89 MJ, among which 47.76% was from the primary treatment process (including pretreatment and AD). The GWP(100) (100-year global warming potential) emission of the system reached 96.97 kgCO(2)-eq/t, and the AP (acidification potential), EP (eutrophication potential), HTPinf (human toxicity potential) and FAETP(inf) (fresh water ecotoxicity) emissions were low. The El was mainly generated by two subsystems, namely, the primary treatment and the secondary pollution control. Sensitivity analysis showed that a 40% increase of the feed fat content resulted in 38% increase in the net energy value output and 48% decrease in EP effect. The increase in oil content and biogas production rate could significantly reduce the EC and El of the system. It has been shown that improving the technology of the process and increasing the recycling rate of products will result in the reduction of EC and El of the biogas system. In addition, a quantitative assessment model of EC and El in integrated food waste-based biogas technology is established. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the electricity retailers' short-term decision-making problem in a liberalized retail market as a multi-objective optimization model. Retailers with light physical assets, such as generation and storage units in the distribution network, are considered. Following advances in smart grid technologies, electricity retailers are becoming able to employ incentive-based demand response (DR) programs in addition to their physical assets to effectively manage the risks of market price and load variations. In this model, the DR scheduling is performed simultaneously with the dispatch of generation and storage units. The ultimate goal is to find the optimal values of the hourly financial incentives offered to the end-users. The proposed model considers the capacity obligations imposed on retailers by the grid operator. The profit seeking retailer also has the objective to minimize the peak demand to avoid the high capacity charges in form of grid tariffs or penalties. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to solve the multi-objective problem. It is a fast and elitist multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. A case study is solved to illustrate the efficient performance of the proposed methodology. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the model for designing the incentive-based DR programs and indicate the efficiency of NSGA-II in solving the retailers' multi-objective problem.

Abstract: Fuel consumption of mining dump trucks accounts for about 30% of total energy use in surface mines. Moreover, a fleet of large dump trucks is the main source of greenhouse gas (GHG) generation. Modeling and prediction of fuel consumption per cycle is a valuable tool in assessing both energy costs and the resulting GHG generation. However, only a few studies have been published on fuel prediction in mining operations. In this paper, fuel consumption per cycle of operation was predicted using artificial neural networks (ANN) technique. Explanatory variables were: pay load, loading time, idled while loaded, loaded travel time, empty travel time, and idled while empty. The output variable was the amount of fuel consumed in one cycle. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10% demonstrated applicability of ANN in prediction of the fuel consumption. The results demonstrated the considerable effect of mining trucks idle times in fuel consumption. A large portion of the unnecessary energy consumption and GHG generation, in this study, was solely due to avoidable idle times. This necessitates implementation of proper actions/remedies in form of both preventive and corrective actions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy consumption for ventilation is extensive in cold climates. Air-to-air heat/energy recovery is a well-known and effective method to reduce the energy consumption. However, frosting commonly occurs inside heat/energy exchangers in cold climates, which would significantly degrade the performance of the exchangers. Preheating the outdoor air and bypassing the outdoor airflow are two effective methods for frosting prevention or defrosting. In this study, the performance of two cross-flow heat/energy exchangers at frosting and defrosting periods are experimentally tested under different operating conditions and the values of frosting limit and defrosting time ratio are presented. As well, the effects of these two defrosting methods on energy consumption of ventilation in three cold cities (i.e. Saskatoon, Anchorage and Chicago) are evaluated. The results show the outdoor air preheating method performs better than the outdoor air bypassing method. In addition, the heat/energy recovery potential in Saskatoon undergoes the largest reduction under frosting, and the cold weather conditions have less impact on energy exchangers than heat exchangers for heat/energy recovery.

Abstract: The stack shunt current of VRB (vanadium redox flow battery) was investigated with experiments and 3D (three-dimensional) simulations. In the proposed model, cell voltages and electrolyte conductivities were calculated based on electrochemical reaction distributions and SOC (state of charge) values, respectively, while coulombic loss was estimated according to shunt current and vanadium ionic crossover through membrane. Shunt current distributions and coulombic efficiency are analyzed in terms of electrolyte conductivities and stack cell numbers. The distributions of cell voltages and shunt currents calculated with proposed model are validated with single cell and short stack tests. The model can be used to optimize VRB stack manifold and channel designs to improve VRB system efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Existing research relating to visual impact of wind turbines (WTs) affirms this to be an essential parameter for public acceptance in most cases as well as for the planning process and permitting of planned wind farms. This study brings new findings about the impact of two crucial factors: numbers of WTs (1-25) visible and distances of WTs (0.75-15 km) from the observer (e.g. from residential buildings, landmarks, observation points). Photographs of three aesthetically varying landscapes with various numbers of WTs (Vestas V90, height 105 m, rotor diameter 90 m) at various distances were evaluated in terms of visual preferences. The results show significant effect from the aesthetic value of a given landscape on the impact of both tested factors. An important finding is that the landscape with the highest aesthetic quality initially was evaluated to be the absolute worst after the addition of WTs and vice versa. Increasing numbers of WTs in the least attractive landscape had less visual impact than did doing so in the two more attractive landscapes. This helps explain strong public opposition to locating WTs in aesthetically valuable landscapes and their greater acceptance in less-attractive landscapes. Increasing stepwise from 1 to 25 WTs within a given landscape progressively decreased visual preferences, although the cumulative effect of a higher number of WTs was not confirmed. We also established threshold distances after which the negative visual impact of a WT disappeared (10 km for the most attractive landscape, 5 km for the least attractive one). Based on these findings, visibility zones were proposed for practical assessment of WTs' visual impact. The study's results can make a substantial contribution towards reducing negative visual impact in WT planning and thus achieving greater public acceptance of these devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The methane yield and microbial community resulting from co-digestion of dairy manure and switchgrass at different mixing ratios [4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 0:4 based on total solids (TS) content] were evaluated. The results indicated that switchgrass is an excellent feedstock for biogas production when co-digested with dairy manure. Mono-digestion of a high dose (>4% TS) of switchgrass led to volatile fatty acid accumulation and process failure, whereas co-digestion of switchgrass and dairy manure could increase the buffering capacity and improve the fermentation efficiency. The optimal mixture ratio of dairy manure and switchgrass was 2:2, with a methane yield that was 39% higher than that obtained by digestion of the individual substrates. The added amount of 8% TS at the 2:2 ratio achieved the highest methane yield of 158.6 mL/g VS, which corresponded to a 1.3-fold increase in the volumetric productivity of methane compared to mono-digestion of 4% TS switchgrass. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and clone library analyses showed significant differences in the bacterial community resulting from the different co-substrate ratios. Planctomycetes (28%), Chloroflexi (24%), and Bacteroidetes (24%) were the dominant phyla in digesters with a co-substrate ratio of 2:2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Storage equipment, such as batteries and thermal energy storage (TES), has become increasingly important recently for peak-load shifting in energy systems. Mathematical programming methods, used frequently in previous studies to optimize operating schedules, can always be used to derive a theoretically optimal solution, but are computationally time consuming. Consequently, we use meta-heuristics, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and cuckoo search (CS), to optimize operating schedules of energy systems that include a battery, TES, and an air-source heat pump. In this paper, we used a GA, differential evolution (DE), our own proposed mutation-PSO (m-PSO), CS, and the self-adaptive learning bat algorithm (SLBA), of which m-PSO was the fastest, and CS was the most accurate. CS obtained the semi-optimal solution 135 times as fast as dynamic programming (DP), a mathematical programming method with 0.22% tolerance. Thus, we showed that metaheuristics, especially m-PSO and CS, have advantages over DP for optimization of the operating schedules of energy systems that include a battery and TES.

Abstract: Ground (or geothermal) heat exchangers are attracting a great deal of attention as a way of using shallow geothermal energy. This paper provides not only a critical review but also a thorough introduction to the analysis of heat transfer by borehole and foundation pile ground heat exchangers, with an emphasis on different analytical models. The literature is reviewed in a time-scale framework because of the diversity of the time and space scales involved in the thermal processes of ground heat exchangers. We summarize, discuss, and evaluate major advances in this field, including heat-source models, short-time models, models for energy piles, in situ thermal-response tests, indoor sandbox experiments, and parameter estimation as an inverse problem. Of particular note is that the unit-step temperature response (i.e., G-function) of a ground heat exchanger with one U-shaped pipe is calculated; and six analytical models are compared: an infinite cylinder-source model, two infinite line-source models, two finite line-source models, and a composite-medium line-source model. This paper closes by identifying several unsolved problems that require solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Costs for High Concentrator Photovoltaic (HCPV) power plants dropped dramatically during 2013 and are expected to continue to fall in the next few years. Moreover, when viewed from the perspective of life cycle cost, HCPV becomes even more competitive than other renewable technologies in some geographical areas. Consequently, an analysis of the economic feasibility of the HCPV systems in future scenarios is necessary for comparison with other electricity generation technologies. One of the methods commonly used for the economic feasibility analysis in electricity generation projects is the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). In this paper a cost analysis of electricity generation of HCPV technology in Spain by using the LCOE has been carried out. The results obtained in this LCOE analysis show that in 2020 the LCOE will be able to reach values for HCPV systems from 0.035 to 0.080 (sic)/kW h, lower than LCOE for conventional PV systems, in some geographical areas of Spain. The results obtained in this analysis have been shown in innovative maps. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Regional wind integration studies in the United States require detailed wind power output data at many locations to perform simulations of how the power system will operate under high-penetration scenarios. The wind data sets that serve as inputs into the study must realistically reflect the ramping characteristics, spatial and temporal correlations, and capacity factors of the simulated wind plants, as well as be time synchronized with available load profiles. The Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit described in this article fulfills these requirements as the largest and most complete grid integration data set publicly available to date. A meteorological data set, wind power production time series, and simulated forecasts created using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model run on a 2-km grid over the continental United States at a 5-min resolution is now publicly available for more than 126,000 land-based and offshore wind power production sites. State-of-the-art forecast accuracy was mimicked by reforecasting the years 2007-2013 using industry-standard techniques. Our meteorological and power validation results show that the WIND Toolkit data is satisfactory for wind energy integration studies. Users are encouraged to validate according to their phenomena and application of interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermal methods are inevitable in heavy oil/bitumen recovery. Different types of "aqueous" methods such as cyclic steam and hot water injection, in-situ combustion, hot water and steam flooding, and steam assisted gravity drainage have been widely applied over decades. Currently, non-aqueous heating methods, generally named electromagnetic, are in consideration as an alternative to the aqueous methods, which may not be applicable due to technical and environmental limitations. This technique still requires further research and field scale pilot applications to prove their technical and economic viability.
In this paper, a critical discussion on the review of electromagnetic heating is presented. An attempt is undertaken to review most of the research works (computational and experimental as well as a limited number of field applications) performed over more than five decades. After evaluating aqueous and nonaqueous thermal methods, a comparative analysis is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Development of clean coal technologies for power generation is crucial in meeting the European Union 2050 target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 capture technology using chemical solvents currently has the highest potential to decarbonise coal-based power generation. Substitution of amine solvent with NH3 has been proposed as a viable option to reduce the efficiency penalty. In this study, the scenario of a supercritical coal-fired power plant retrofitted with a chilled ammonia process capture plant and CO2 compression unit was modelled in a common simulation environment. To fully assess the integration impact on power plant performance, the pressure loss due to steam extraction has been taken into account by using the Stodola ellipse law. Analysis of a basic integration scenario revealed that the efficiency penalty fell between 10.4% and 10.9% points depending on the stripper pressure. The quality of extracted steam became insufficient to meet the reboiler heat requirement above a stripper pressure of 21.8 bar, and the lowest efficiency penalty was obtained when reboiler condensate was returned to the deaerator in the power plant. In evaluating measures to improve integration, the efficiency penalty was reduced to 8.7-8.8% points through the integration of a single-stage or two-stage auxiliary steam turbine, respectively, and a back-pressure turbine. Nevertheless, the analysis has indicated that the net impact on power plant performance is similar to that of an amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are a new load type with considerable temporal flexibility. This work evaluates to what extent EV fleets (based on empirical driving profiles from two distinct sociodemographic groups) can cover their charging requirements by means of variable renewable generation (wind or solar-PV). For this purpose we formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem minimizing the amount of conventional generation employed. The results indicate that the usage of variable renewable generation can be more than doubled as compared to uncoordinated charging. Furthermore, we analyze how the utilization of renewable generation by EV fleets is affected through different portfolios of renewable generation sources, charging infrastructure specifications as well as a reduced optimization horizon.

Abstract: In this paper, the potential of industrial waste heat for heating and cooling applications is investigated. Therefore, heat transformation technologies are presented and their technical and economic potential are discussed. First, different industrial processes and their operating temperatures are presented as possible waste heat sources as well as low temperature processes, which can be supplied with waste heat. Then, a general economic analysis is performed for three different cases of waste heat use: an absorption chiller producing cold and heat production with a compression and an absorption heat pump. The maximum acceptable investment cost for each technology is estimated and compared with the current investment cost depending on the operating hours of the system. For this, three different consumer types, Enthusiast, Real Estate and Industry, are defined to represent different expectations in interest rate, payback period and the resulting annuity factor. Instead of judging if a technology is profitable or not, it is calculated how much the system is allowed to cost in order to be competitive for certain operating hours. Combined with present day cost of the technology, this serves as a rough judgment of the market deployment process. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the initial assumptions for the economic analysis is performed, revealing a strong influence of the annuity factor. For the present day technology cost, absorption chillers were found to be profitable for two of the three consumer types when operated for at least 2500 h per year. Electric heat pumps are profitable for all consumer types when exceeding 4000 operating hours per year while absorption heat pumps start at 3000 h of operation per year to be profitable for all consumer types.

Abstract: Storage-like devices (SLDs), which include energy storage systems as well as devices with similar properties such as electric vehicles, can be exploited for load leveling. However, to prevent simultaneous charging and discharging of an SLD, complementarity constraints should be included in the optimization model, which makes the problem strongly non-convex. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) methods are commonly used to solve such problems; however, this results in long solution time to achieve an approximate optimal solution. Therefore, a method to efficiently find optimal solutions of load-leveling problems with SLDs is desirable. Here, we report a load-leveling optimization model for a system with SLDs and show that the complementarity constraints can be exactly relaxed under two sufficient conditions so that a convex relaxed model can be solved instead. Moreover, the exactness of the relaxation can be determined prior to solving the relaxed model, and the sufficient conditions are usually satisfied in practical situations. The numerical studies verify the theoretical analysis and show that an equally good optimal solution of the load-leveling problem with SLDs can be obtained far more efficiently by using the proposed method than a commonly used MIP method.

Abstract: The reliance of Great Britain power generation on the gas network makes it critical to consider the future availability and cost of gas in planning the expansion of the power system. A combined gas and electricity network planning model was used to investigate impacts of various low carbon strategies on regional expansion of the Great Britain gas network out to the 2050s. A number of long term energy supply and demand strategies covering a range of plausible investment policies for Great Britain gas and electricity systems were explored. Reliance of Great Britain on gas imports was projected to vary from 84%, in an energy system with significant electrification of heat and transport sectors and large capacity of nuclear generation, to 94% in a business as usual case. Extensive investment in Liquefied Natural Gas import facilities at Milford Haven and the Isle of Grain was shown to compensate for reduction of indigenous gas supplies. Exploitation of shale gas in north England was shown to reduce the gas dependency of Great Britain in the business as usual case to 74%. Electrification of the heat and transport sectors combined with exploitation of shale gas in Great Britain could reduce import dependency to below 10% by 2050. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The largest applied convertors in passenger cars are the internal combustion engines - gasoline, diesel, adapted also for operating on alternative fuels and hybrid modes. The number of components that are necessary to realize modern future propulsion system is inexorably increasing. The need for efficiency improvement of the vehicle energy system induces the search for an innovative methodology during the design process.
In this article the compressed air is investigated as an innovative solution for hybridization of small gasoline engine. The combination of a conventional IC engine and a pneumatic short-term storage system is an interesting approach to achieve lower fuel consumption. Instead of using a battery, a hybrid pneumatic vehicle uses a robust and inexpensive air pressure tank for energy storage. The fuel consumption benefit of the hybrid air system is assessed and the vehicle usages leading to the maximal fuel consumption benefits of the hybrid pneumatic powertrain are investigated.
The hybrid pneumatic concept is applied on a largely deployed C Segment commercial vehicle with 3 cylinder gasoline engine. The lowest fuel consumption results are investigated on the usage of this vehicle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Taking into account the heterogeneity of production technologies across Chinese cities, we adopted a meta-frontier function and a non-radial directional distance function to construct an index that comprehensively evaluates the performance achieved by coupling energy-saving and emissions reduction. We also analyzed the theoretical factors leading to performance loss in energy-saving and emissions reduction. An empirical analysis of 209 Chinese cities suggests the following. First, the energy-saving and emissions reduction performances of Chinese cities are generally low, and the relationship between these variables and the economic development level is U-shaped. The results also suggest that cities place more importance on energy-saving than on emissions reduction. Second, the technology gap and insufficient management are the two primary sources of latent capacity that could contribute to energy-saving and emissions reduction in Chinese cities; insufficient management is the dominant factor in both high-income and lower-middle income cities. Four combinable strategies for energy-saving and emissions reduction are proposed. Third, the heterogeneities of production technologies related to energy-saving and emissions reduction are universal; the technological gap between the current and the best production technologies is seen in the largest of the middle income cities, and the gap is smallest in high-income cities.

Abstract: This work comprehensively reviews the recent advances for chemical-looping reforming of CH4 (CLR) technology, which breaks down the traditional CH4 reforming process (including steam and dry reforming) into two separate half-steps, namely CH4 oxidation and replenishment of oxygen carrier (OC) with appropriate oxidizing agents. In order to steer the conversion of CH4 toward partial oxidation (POM) for synthesis gas (H-2 + CO) production rather than total oxidation for producing CO2 and H2O, the appropriate selection of OC becomes a critical issue. Moreover, instead of the commonly used air to re-oxidize the oxygen-depleted OC after reaction with CH4, steam and CO2 have been proposed as two alternatives, opening up the opportunities to produce extra H2 and CO. However, owing to much weaker oxidization ability of steam and CO2 than air, the low oxidation degree and slow oxidation rate seem to remain as challenges. Furthermore, the resistance of OC to attrition, agglomeration and carbon deposition is also of great importance. In these regards, the latest major milestones are compiled. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A control strategy was developed to predict optimal ground source heat pump water flow rates under part load operation. Using this strategy, optimal flow rates are calculated from available design data and minimal on-line measurements. The optimal control strategy was evaluated with validated single speed and tandem speed ground source heat pump simulation models in both heating and cooling mode. A range of building load profiles were implemented when analysing heat pump system performance. The optimal strategy was shown to result in an improvement in system performance when compared to nominal flow rate operation, particularly for low load conditions. Due to the prevalence of low load operation over a heating or cooling season, the seasonal system performance (SPF3) was shown to increase by between 20% and 40% when using the optimal strategy.

Abstract: We present an empirical analysis of the more than 250 space heating-focused energy efficiency policies that have been in force at the EU and national levels in the period 1990-2010. This analysis looks at the EU-14 residential sector (Pre-2004 EU-15, excluding Luxembourg) using a panel data regression analysis on unit consumption of energy for space heating (kWh/m(2)/year). The policies are represented as a regression variable using a semi-quantitative impact estimation obtained from the MURE Policy Database. The impacts of the policies as a whole, and subdivided into financial, regulatory, and informative policies, are examined. The correlation between the actual reductions in demand and the estimated impact of regulatory policies is found to be stronger than the corresponding correlations with the respective impacts of financial policies and informative polices. Together with the well-known market barriers to energy efficiency that exist in the residential sector, these findings suggest that regulatory policy measures be given a high priority in the design of an effective pathway towards the EU-wide goals for space heating energy.

Abstract: Much academic attention has been given to the so-called carbon outsourcing hypothesis: the idea that increased outputs and exports of energy intensive goods from developed countries, especially China, has allowed more developed countries to grow, while reducing their carbon emissions. However, most studies on the issue overlook the complexities of increasingly globalized input markets, where exports themselves are made up of inputs assembled from around other countries around the world. This study estimates such effects on China's net carbon dioxide emissions by accounting for the energy and carbon embodied in its processing and non-processing exports sectors. China's policies of carbon dioxide emission intensity aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide emission intensity are then re-evaluated. To do this we use an extended input-output framework with new assumptions for estimating energy and carbon intensities. This includes a detailed energy disaggregation for domestic use of energy, processing exports and non-processing exports. In across 32 industries, after which a multiplicative structural decomposition analysis is applied. Our findings confirm that industrial emission intensity and final demands were driving factors behind the significant downward shift in national emission intensity from 2002 to 2007. However, by considering the embodied emissions effects of imported inputs into Chinese exports, we found that the energy and resource intensive industries accounted for a smaller proportion of exports than typically understood. However, we also found that within the industry sector changes in structure contributed to an increase in energy intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work, we synthesized a series of four nanocapsules containing n-alkanes (CnH2n+2), namely tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, and heptadecane, in poly(styrene-co-ethylacrylate) using an emulsion copolymerization method. The nanocapsules were characterized according to their geometric profiles, phase transition temperatures, phase transition heats, mean particle sizes, and chemical stabilities by means of scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, we also focused on the effect of the core/shell mass ratio on the phase change properties of the nanocapsules. We found that microcapsules were synthesized successfully and that the best core/shell mass ratio was 3:1 for this study. These results indicate that encapsulated n-alkanes with poly(styrene-co-ethylacrylate) have an excellent potential for energy storage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Blocking effect of the orbiting scroll tip on the suction flow of a scroll expander, closely associated with the location of the suction port, has a vital role on the transient performances of the expander. In this study, CFD based 3D numerical simulations were performed on scroll expanders with different suction port locations to estimate transient features of the aerodynamic parameters including pulsating mass flow rate through the suction port, asymmetric distributions of the internal flow, gas forces and moments exerted on the orbiting scroll. The results illustrate the pulsating features of the suction mass flow rate, in response to both variations of the suction flow area and the suction chamber volume, change obviously for expanders with different suction port locations. A special aerodynamic separation of the suction chamber induces a sudden drop of the suction mass flow rate before the top profile meshing. Apart from the mass flow rate, both the fluctuating intensities and the magnitudes of the gas forces and moments change with different suction port locations as well. A proposed local analysis approach on the driving moment indicates the fluctuations of the driving moment in different time periods are induced by different factors, and transient moment features of all scroll segments are closely associated with the asymmetric pressure distribution which is an integrated result of the suction/discharging flows and the eccentric rotation of the orbiting scroll.

Abstract: The mobilized thermal energy storage system (M-TES) has been demonstrated as a promising technology to supply heat using waste heat in industries to distributed users, where heat discharging determines whether M-TES system can satisfy the required heating rate. The objective of this work is to investigate the solidification mechanism of phase change materials (PCM) for heat discharging in a direct-contact thermal energy storage (TES) container for M-TES. A 2-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation model of the TES tank is developed in ANSYS FLUENT, and validated with the experimental measurement. Effects of flow rate and inlet temperature of heat transfer oil (HTO) were studied. Results show that (a) the discharging process includes the formation of solidified PCM followed by the sinking of solidified PCM; (b) the discharging time of M-TES can be reduced by increasing the flow rate of heat transfer oil. When the flow rate is increased from 0.46 m(3)/h to 0.92 m(3)/h, the solidified PCM is increased from 25 vol.% to 90 vol.% within 30 min; (c) the discharging time can be reduced by decreasing the inlet temperature of HTO. While the inlet temperature is reduced from 50 degrees C to 30 degrees C, the solidified PCM is increased from 60 vol.% to 90 vol.% within 30 min. This work provides engineering insights for the rational design of discharging process for M-TES system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a promising technology for heat recovery. However, evaporator leads to the highest irreversible loss and results in reducing cycle efficiency. In this paper, the heat source was segmented into two temperature ranges, which provides the possibility of two-stage evaporation. Based on cycle configuration, parallel two-stage organic Rankine cycle (PTORC) and series two-stage organic Rankine cycle (STORC) were put forward. The objective is to evaluate system performances, thereby elucidating their respective availability. Geothermal water inlet temperature (GWIT) ranges from 90 to 120 degrees C, with R245fa as the working fluid. The ratio of net power output to the total thermal conductance was chosen as the objective function. The results show that PTORC and STORC are significantly influenced by intermediate geothermal water temperature (IGWT) and evaporating temperatures. PTORC and STORC could evidently reduce the irreversible loss, and STORC is more significant. PTORC and STORC can output more net power, depending on cycle configuration and GWIT. STORC enhances the net power output with GWIT, whereas PTORC is just the opposite. The total thermal conductance of PTORC and STORC are almost equal with that of ORC.

Abstract: Design of plate-fin heat exchangers is a very complex task generally based on trial and error process. Traditional designing methods are very time consuming and do not guarantee the archive of an optimal solution; therefore heuristic based computation methods are used, usually. So, in present paper a new design method proposed for optimization of plate fin heat exchangers using biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm. The BBO algorithm has some advantages in detecting the global minimum compared with other heuristic algorithms. In present research the BBO scheme has been employed for optimal design of the plate fin heat exchanger by minimization of the total annual cost, heat transfer area and total pressure drops of the equipment considering main structural and geometrical parameters of the exchanger as design variables. Based on proposed approach, a full computer code was developed and three various case studies are investigated by it to illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. Comparison of the results with those obtained by previous methods reveals that the BBO algorithm can be successfully employed for optimization of plate fin heat exchangers. Finally, parametric analysis carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed method to the cost and structural parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend a previously developed bottom-up energy demand model such that the model can be used to determine changes in behavioral and energy usage patterns of a community when: (i) new load patterns from Plug-in Electrical Vehicles (PEV) or other devices are introduced; (ii) new technologies and smart devices are used within premises; and (iii) new Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies, such as price responsive demand are implemented. Unlike time series forecasting methods that solely rely on historical data, the model only uses a minimal amount of data at the atomic level for its basic constructs. These basic constructs can be integrated into a household unit or a community model using rules and connectors that are, in principle, flexible and can be altered according to the type of questions that need to be answered. Furthermore, the embedded dynamics of the model works on the basis of: (i) Markovian stochastic model for simulating human activities, (ii) Bayesian and logistic technology adoption models, and (iii) optimization, and rule-based models to respond to price signals without compromising users' comfort. The proposed model is not intended to replace traditional forecasting models. Instead it provides an analytical framework that can be used at the design stage of new products and communities to evaluate design alternatives. The framework can also be used to answer questions such as why demand behaves the way it does by examining demands at different scales and by playing What-If games. These analyses are not possible with demand forecast models built on historical samples, simply because, these forecast models and their level of accuracy are limited by their training data sets and can hardly demonstrate variations that are not present in the historical data sets.

Abstract: The forestry sector is showing an increasing demand for documentation about its environmental performance. Concerning forest operations, many studies have revealed remarkable differences in environmental impact mainly due to differences in location, forestry practice and technologies. As a consequence, reliable information on environmental performance for forestry operations and wood supply chain is considered to be crucial.
This work aims to evaluate the environmental impacts of the firewood supply chain from high stand beech forest in North-Eastern Italy. Two scenarios have been considered: the first scenario investigates the firewood supply chain based on the wood harvested from the local forest, while the second one investigates the supply chain based on wood imported from the Balkans' area.
The differences between the two scenarios are assessed through a "gate to grave" life cycle assessment for the impact categories: Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP); Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) and Human Toxicity Potential (HTP). The functional unit is 1 MJ of energy produced by firewood.
The study has shown that there are different critical values of transportation distance for impact categories.
Although most of the chemicals emitted in the life cycle of firewood cannot be offset, a sustainable forest management can completely offset the fossil CO2 emissions of the short and the long supply chain by saving less than 10% of the net increment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper examines the asymmetry of changes in CO2 emissions over business cycle recessions and expansions using yearly data from 1949 and monthly data from 1973 for the United States (US). In addition, decomposition analysis is applied to investigate the relative roles of various proximate contributing factors to observed changes in total and per capita CO2 emissions and emissions intensity, over business cycle phases. The results suggest, inter alia, that aggregate emissions and emissions intensity reduce much faster in contractions than they increase in expansions. In addition, unlike the three previous expansions, in the most recent post-GFC US expansion, emissions per capita have continued to decline, and at a rate very similar to the rate of reduction in preceding contractions. This suggests the real possibility that the most recent contraction may have had an ongoing impact on the path of per capita emissions well beyond the immediate impact experienced during the contraction itself.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are often considered as better options in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption compared to internal combustion vehicles. However, making any decision among these vehicle options is not a straightforward process due to temporal and spatial variations, such as the sources of the electricity used and regional driving patterns. In this study, we compared these vehicle options across 50 states, taking into account state-specific average and marginal electricity generation mixes, regional driving patterns, and vehicle and battery manufacturing impacts. Furthermore, a policy scenario proposing the widespread use of solar energy to charge EVs and PHEVs is evaluated. Based on the average electricity generation mix scenario, EVs are found to be least carbon-intensive vehicle option in 24 states, while HEVs are found to be the most energy-efficient option in 45 states. In the marginal electricity mix scenario, widespread adoption of EVs is found to be an unwise strategy given the existing and near-future marginal electricity generation mix. On the other hand, EVs can be superior to other alternatives in terms of energy-consumption, if the required energy to generate 1 kW h of electricity is below 1.25 kWh. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to improve the efficiency of the P&O maximum power point tracker (MPPT) by reducing the steady state oscillation and eliminating the possibility of the algorithm to lose its tracking direction. A dynamic perturbation step-size is employed to reduce the oscillation, while boundary conditions are introduced to prevent it from diverging away from the MPP. To prove its effectiveness, the proposed P&O is compared with the conventional and adaptive P&O using the Ropp, sinusoidal and ramp irradiance tests. In addition, the performances are evaluated based on a one-day (10 h) irradiance and temperature profile. The algorithm is implemented on a buck-boost converter and benchmarked by the standard MPFT efficiency (eta(MPPT)) calculation. It was found that, for all the tests, the eta(MPPT) of the proposed P&O scheme is increased by approximately two percentage points. Besides, the proposed algorithm does not require any extra hardware components; only several lines of additional software codes are to be embedded into the conventional P&O MPPT control program.

Abstract: This paper presents a transient simulation model based on the coupling of electric conduction and heat transfer in order to (1) quantify the conversion efficiency enhancement of a thermoelectric generator (TEG) under periodic heating and (2) predict the thermal and electrical performances of a TEG. Joule heating, the Peltier effect, and the Thomson effect are included in the transient model, which is experimentally validated using a commercial bismuth-telluride-based thermoelectric device under both steady state and transient conditions. In contrast to an alternate temperature gradient (ATG), which has been adopted in previous studies and is difficult to maintain in a regular square form, pulsed input power is considered herein as an effective parameter for investigating its influence on the thermal and electrical performances of a TEG. In particular, the output power and temperature difference across a TEG under pulsed input power are compared with those under constant input power, where the time average of a pulsed heat source is equivalent to the heat flux under a constant heat source. In the case of periodic heating, a rectangular input heat flux with 10% duty cycle is applied to the TEG system, with average values of 40,000 W/m(2), 30,000 W/m(2), 20,000 W/m(2), and 10,000 W/m(2); its time period ranges from 60 s to 2000 s. It is found that pulsed heat power yields better results than an ATG in terms of improving the conversion efficiency under the same input power condition; specifically, a maximum efficiency enhancement of 8.6x is achieved. In addition, it is found that the ratio of the maximum input heat flux to the minimum input heat flux under periodic heating, a/b, plays an important role in improving the conversion efficiency. For a given time period and average input power, a larger a/b value leads to higher efficiency enhancement. Moreover, it is observed that the efficiency enhancement is independent of the average input power under a given a/b value and fixed time period. Finally, we show that the efficiency under steady state heating is linearly proportional to the input heat flux, and the linear coefficient is 2.05 x 10(-7) [1/(W/m(2))]; this result can facilitate the prediction of TEG performance.

Abstract: To ensure the high energy performance of a new building, its operational rating should be accurately estimated in the early design phase. Toward this end, this study developed an estimation methodology for the dynamic operational rating (DOR) of a new residential building using the advanced case-based reasoning (A-CBR) and stochastic approaches. This study was conducted in three steps: (i) establishment of a case database; (ii) retrieval of similar cases using the A-CBR approach; and (iii) estimation of the dynamic operational rating using the stochastic approach. The residential buildings located in Pusan, South Korea, were selected to validate the applicability of the developed methodology. Also, this study used the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the developed methodology (which means the difference between the predicted and measured energy performance). As a result, it was determined that the MAPE of the A-CBR model (i.e., 96.8% for electricity and 86.6% for gas energy) is superior to those of the other models (i.e., the basic CBR, multiple regression analysis, and artificial neural network models). In addition, based on the stochastic approach, it was estimated that cluster No.6, as a case study, would have the letter rating of 'B' grade (i.e., 25 < DOR <= 50) with 83.46% of probability; and the letter rating of 'C' grade (i.e., 50< DOR <= 75) with 16.54%. The developed methodology can be used to easily and accurately estimate the dynamic operational rating of a new residential building in the early design phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents the concept of a multi-dimensional marine engine diagnostic tool. The dimensions of the tool are diagnostic signals, which form a vector in affine space. The distance of the resulting vector from reference vectors for considered technical states of the engine is the result of diagnosis. Moreover, diagnostic signals, derived from the composition of the exhaust gas, are also considered. The chosen diagnostic signals are the nitric oxide, carbon oxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen contents in the exhaust gas and the temperatures behind all engine cylinders of the marine engine. Analyses were based on laboratory tests of a 4-stroke marine engine. The operation of the proposed diagnostic tool has been partly verified by a passive experiment under sea operation conditions of a main propulsion marine engine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The volumetric efficiency of the Internal Combustion (IC) engine and compressor can be increased by properly adjusting the acoustic resonance frequency of the suction muffler or the suction valve timing without any additional equipment or power source. This effect is known as acoustic supercharging. However, the energy efficiency has become more important than the volumetric efficiency because of the energy shortage issue and factors influencing consumers' purchasing decisions. Therefore, methods for increasing the energy efficiency using the acoustic effect in the suction part of IC engine and compressor should be considered. In this study, a systematic method for improving the energy efficiency using the acoustic effect in the suction part of the compressor used in refrigerators and air conditioners was developed for the first time. This effect is named as the Acoustically Supercharged Energy Efficiency (ASEE). For the ASEE, first, a hybrid coupling method was suggested for the acoustical analysis in the suction part of the compressor. Next, an Energy Efficiency Design Map (EEDM) was proposed. This can serve as a design guide for suction mufflers in terms of the energy efficiency. Finally, sensitivity analyses of the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) and total massflow rate with respect to the acoustic pressure were conducted to identify the relationship between the acoustic pressure and the suction valve motion. This provides the physical background for the EEDM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this research, we prepared macro-encapsulated paraffin-lightweight aggregate (LWA) for the development of structural-functional integrated normal weight aggregate concrete (NWAC). The macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was prepared by incorporation of paraffin into porous LWAs through vacuum impregnation. The sealing performance of the epoxy was evaluated by thermal cycling test while the thermal conductivity of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWAs was improved by incorporating different percentages of graphite powder into epoxy. The chemical compatibility, thermal properties, thermal stability and reliability of macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was also determined. Finally, the compressive strength and thermal performance of concrete containing macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was evaluated. Test results showed that the maximum percentage of paraffin absorbed by LWA was 70%. The thermal conductivity of the macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA with 15% graphite powder was 162% higher than that of epoxy. Moreover, the developed macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was found to be chemically compatible, thermally stable and reliable (did not show any sign of degradation below 150 degrees C and sustained 1000 cycles of melting and freezing) and it has high latent heat storage capacity (102.5 J/g). The compressive strength of NWAC with macro-encapsulated PCM-LWA at 28 days ranged from 33.29 to 53.11 MPa, therefore presenting an opportunity for structural applications. The indoor thermal performance test revealed that NWAC with macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA can function in reducing the energy consumption by decreasing the indoor temperature and shifting the loads away from the peak periods. Thus, we demonstrated and produced concrete with structural and thermostatic properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper describes the development and experimental evaluation of Juelich's novel reactor type ATR AH2 for autothermal reforming of diesel fuel and kerosene. ATR AH2 overcomes the disadvantages of Juelich's former reactor generations from the perspective of the fuel cell system by constructively integrating an additional pressure swirl nozzle for the injection of cold water and a steam generation chamber. As a consequence, ATR AH2 eliminates the need for external process configurations for steam supply. Additionally, the internal steam generator has been modified by increasing its cross-sectional area and by decreasing its length. This measure reduces the pressure drop of the steam generator from approx. 500 mbar to roughly a thirtieth. The experimental evaluation of ATR AH2 at steady-state revealed that the novel concept for heat management applied in ATR AH2 is suitable for fuel cell systems at any reformer load point between 20% and 120% when the mass fractions of cold water to the newly integrated nozzle are set to values between 40% and 50%. The experimental evaluation of ATR AH2 during start-up and shut-down showed that slight modifications of the reaction conditions during these transient phases greatly reduced the concentrations of ethene, ethane, propene and benzene in the reformate. From the fuel cell system perspective, these improvements provide a very beneficial contribution to longer stabilities for the catalysts and adsorption materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Microalgae have great potential as a feedstock for the production of a wide range of end-products under the broad concept of biorefinery. In an earlier work, we proposed a superstructure based optimization model to find the optimal processing pathway for the production of biodiesel from microalgal biomass, and identified several challenges with the focus being on utilizing lipids extracted microalgal biomass for economic and environmentally friendly production of useful energy products. In this paper, we expand the previous optimization framework by considering the processing of microalgae residue previously treated as wastes. We develop an expanded biorefinery superstructure model, based on which a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed to determine the optimal/promising biorefinery configurations with different choices of objective functions. The MINLP model is solved in GAMS using a database built in Excel. Economic sensitivity analysis is performed to elaborate the potential improvements in the overall economics, and set the targets that must be achieved in the future in order for microalgal biofuels to become economically viable.

Abstract: An advanced combustion strategy namely "multiple premixed compression ignition" (MPCI) can exploit multiple combustion regimes. In this paper, the two-stage premixed combustion (i.e. low-temperature combustion and high-temperature combustion) using relatively low-reactivity and high volatility fuel is uncovered in MPCI mode. The mixture formation and combustion processes of low-octane gasoline MPCI mode is resolved by KIVA-CHEMKIN. The low-octane gasoline (G70H30) modeled in this study is a mixture of 70% gasoline and 30% n-heptane by volume, and it is represented by iso-octane and n-heptane oxidation mechanism. A discrete multi-component (DMC) vaporization model is used to simulate the evaporation process of G70H30, while a simplified 12-step GRI-Mech model and a two-step soot model are applied for the NOx and soot calculation, respectively. As a comparative study, partially premixed compression ignition (PPCI) mode of G70H30 is also simulated using the same numerical models. From the longitudinal and transverse sections of the combustion chamber, temporally and spatially distributed combustion events are found in the MPCI mode. That is to say, the first low temperature premixed compression ignition occurs outside of the piston bowl, and it occurs mainly in the squeeze zone above the piston triggered by the local fuel rich region. Then the second high temperature premixed combustion, which is controlled by the local turbulence resulting from the second fuel injection and chamber wall interaction, is located in the center of the combustion chamber. The temporally and spatially distributed combustion in MPCI mode decreases the local temperature, resulting in less NOx formation and lower heat transfer losses. However, there is no marked combustion distribution phenomenon in the G70H30 PPCI mode, and more NOx is generated due to higher local temperature. In addition, the early first injection of MPCI and PPCI causes spray-liner impingement, and becomes the main source of soot formation in the subsequent combustion processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The CH4-flue gas replacement in naturally occurring gas hydrates has attracted significant attention due to its potential as a method of exploitation of clean energy and sequestration of CO2. In the replacement process, the thermodynamic and structural properties of the mixed gas hydrates are critical factors to predict the heat flow in the hydrate-bearing sediments and the heat required for hydrate dissociation, and to evaluate the CO2 storage capacity of hydrate reservoirs. In this study, the C-13 NMR and gas composition analyses confirmed that the preferential enclathration of N-2 molecules in small 5(12) cages of structure I hydrates improved the extent of the CH4 recovery. A high pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter (HP mu-DSC) provided reliable hydrate stability conditions and heat of dissociation values in the porous silica gels after the replacement, which confirmed that CH4 in the hydrates was successfully replaced with flue gas. A heat flow change associated with the dissociation and formation of hydrates was not noticeable during the CH4-flue gas replacement. Therefore, this study reveals that CH4-flue gas swapping occurs without structural transitions and significant hydrate dissociations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Four organosolv pretreatment processes, namely Formiline, Acetoline, sulfuric acid-catalyzed ethanol (SACE) and auto-catalyzed ethanol (ACE) pretreatments were used to pretreat wheat straw under respective optimal conditions. Comparative studies were performed in terms of the enzymatic digestibility of cellulosic solids, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for ethanol production, mass balance analysis and structural features of the pretreated solids. The results indicated that Formiline and Acetoline pretreatments showed higher degrees of delignification, lower xylose degradation and lower solid glucan recoveries than SACE and ACE processes. The SACE and ACE pretreated solids still had high lignin contents but demonstrated higher initial enzymatic hydrolysis rates than Formiline and Acetoline pretreated solids. Formiline pretreatment obtained the highest final enzymatic glucan conversion, glucose concentration and ethanol yield, while Acetoline pretreatment obtained the lowest. After organosolv pretreatment, the compact and beehive-like cell wall structure was disrupted and cellulose fibers became separated. The SACE and ACE pretreated solids showed more depositions on fiber surface, which probably came from the condensation and precipitation of lignin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study offers a unique contribution to the literature by investigating the convergence of province-level carbon dioxide emission intensities among a panel of 30 provinces in China over the period 1990-2010. We use a novel, spatial dynamic panel data model to evaluate an empirically testable hypothesis of convergence among provinces. Our results suggest that: (1) CO2 emission intensities are converging across provinces in China; (2) the rate of convergence is higher with the dynamic panel data model than the cross-sectional regression models; and, (3) province-level CO2 emission intensities are spatially correlated and the rate of convergence, when controlling for spatial autocorrelation, is higher than with the non-spatial models.

Abstract: The Electrical Vehicle (EV) has become a potential solution for enhancing the sustainability of our road transportation, in view of the environmental impacts traditional vehicles have regarding emissions and use of fossil fuel dependence. However, the widespread use of EVs is still restrained by the energy storage technologies, and the electrification of road transportation is still in its early stages. This paper focuses on the technical aspects related to the 'electrification of roads' (called 'eRoads') infrastructure that aims to diminish the limitations for using EVs. A historical overview of the technology development towards the electrification of road transportation is presented, along with an overview of prospective technologies for implementing an eRoad charging infrastructure. Of these, the Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) technology is examined in further details. The main objective of this paper is to explore the potential knowledge gaps that need to be filled for a successful integration of IPT technology within actual road infrastructure. As such, this paper can be used as an overview of the current state-of-the-art of eRoad infrastructure and also as guidance towards future research directions in this domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: As part of its energy transition strategy, China has set ambitious targets for increasing the contribution of renewable energy and, in particular, of wind power. However, the Chinese power sector has not undergone the necessary reforms to facilitate the integration and absorption of a larger share of variable renewable energy. This is evident from the difficulties in absorbing wind power from already commissioned wind farms and the resultant curtailment of wind power. Pumped storage hydroelectricity (PSH) is a flexible power source that can facilitate higher penetration levels of wind power as well as complement China's growing nuclear power capacity. However, regulatory policy constraints have restricted the effective utilization of existing PSH capacity and discouraged investment in new PSH capacity. This paper examines these constraints and assesses the likely impact of new policies designed to address them. Finally, policy recommendations and concluding remarks are provided. This paper contributes to the literature on renewable energy integration from a new perspective. The lessons from China are relevant to other countries going through the energy transition.

Abstract: Detailed cradle-to-grave life cycle analyses are performed for bulk-scale solid oxide fuel cell power plants fueled by gasified coal. These results are compared to cradle-to-grave life cycle analyses of the supercritical pulverized coal and integrated gasification combined cycle power generation plants, which are also performed as a part of this study. Life cycle inventories for each plant including the inputs (resources and fuels) and outputs (emissions and waste) of the gate-to-gate plants and their associated up- and down-stream sub-processes are computed. The impact of carbon capture and sequestration on each plant is quantified and assessed using the ReCiPe 2008 life cycle inventory method for three socioeconomic perspectives. The results of each coal plant are compared to one another and to plants generating power from natural gas at the end-point level. Results indicate that not only do coal-fed SOFCs generate power with a significantly lower life cycle impact than the current state-of-the-art coal plants, but when carbon capture is enabled they can do so with a lower impact than the most modern plants utilizing natural gas, as well.

Abstract: The establishment of an optimal mix of renewable energy sources (RES) is pertinent to creating low-carbon energy systems with adequate load-following capabilities. Transitioning from a fossil fuel-based energy system to a system based on RES is a process in which the RES penetration must be guided by specific targets in the medium term. Moreover, the relative contributions from RES and fossil fuels in every stage of the transition process must be identified through clear optimization criteria. In this article, we propose a methodology denoted the Minimum Total Mix Capacity (MTMC) to determine the optimal mix of RES and fossil fuels in an electricity system by taking into account the hourly values of RES production and electricity demand. The MTMC methodology is applied to the Mexican electricity system, which greatly depends on fossil fuels. The Mexican Congress mandated that the fossil fuel-based electricity generation be limited to 65% by the year 2024, 60% by 2035 and 50% by 2050. We use the MTMC methodology to investigate the potential for RES integration into the Mexican electricity system by constructing three scenarios (low, mid and high biomass) to achieve the 2024 target and analyze the system's response to varying contributions of wind and solar power production to the scenarios. The minimum complementary capacity based on fossil fuels that is needed to cover the demand without electricity imports is assessed to determine the total mix capacity for the transition system. Using the MTMC methodology, several combinations of biomass, wind and solar power that achieve a minimum of 35% RES electricity production are identified; however, there is only one combination that results in the minimum overall capacity, hence resulting in the optimal mix. Moreover, a domain of near-optimal mix combinations can be identified among all of the scenarios, which may also be considered as an alternative. Biomass has the highest effectiveness in terms of high RES production and the lowest required overall power generating capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The working operations of a full-scale digester of a wastewater treatment plant for waste-mixed sludge (WMS) stabilization was reproduced using a pilot-scale apparatus. The effect of WMS co-digested with fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) was investigated at different organic loading rates (OLR), from 1.46 kg VS/m(3) day to 2.8 kg VS/m(3) day, and reduced hydraulic retention time, from 14 days to about 10 days. Methane production per unit of digester volume increased from about 140 NL/m(3) day to a maximum value of about 900 NL/m(3) day when OLR was increased from 1.46 kg VS/m(3) day to 2.1 kg VS/m(3) day. Higher OLR caused an excessive HRT reduction, decreasing the percentage of volatile solids degradation without significantly affecting process stability. The maximum electrical energy producible from the full-scale anaerobic facility was about 3,500,000 kW h/year. In these conditions the electrical power output and the net efficiency of the co-generator were 470 kW and 37%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The continual growth in commercial aviation fuels and more strict environmental legislations have led to immense interest in developing green aviation fuels from renewable lignocellulosic biomass. This work demonstrated a novel transformation of biomass into bin-jet and diesel fuels. The transformation included following three reaction steps: (i) the catalytic pyrolysis of sawdust into low-carbon aromatics, (ii) the production of C8-C15 aromatics by the aromatic alkylation and (iii) the production of C8-C15 cyclic alkanes by the hydrogenation of C8-C15 aromatics. The production of the desired C8-C15 aromatics with the highest selectivity of 92.4% was achieved by the low temperature alkylation reactions of the low carbon aromatics using the ionic liquid of [bmim]Cl-2AlCl(3) (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminate). The biofuels derived from sawdust basically met the main specifications of jet fuels. This transformation potentially provides a useful avenue for the development of green aviation biofuels utilizing lignocellulose biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Two- and three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed to study the combustion process of PRF70/air/exhaust gas mixtures under partially premixed combustion (PPC) conditions relevant to modern low temperature internal combustion engines. The aim is to gain improved understanding of the underlining physics in PPC engines. A skeletal PRF chemical kinetic mechanism is used together with full transport properties. The 2D and 3D numerical simulations are performed on respectively a 0.614 x 0.614 mm(2) domain and a 0.614 x 0.614 x 0.614 mm(3) domain with a 1.2 mu m cell size. The results reveal the effects of the split of the fuel mass in different injections on the combustion and emission process in PPC engines. Increasing the amount of second fuel injection results in a retarded heat release and decreased NO emission, however, increased CO emission. While this CO/NOx tradeoff has been observed in previous PPC engine experiments the fundamental reason for this is clarified here. PPC is shown to consist of a two-stage combustion process: in the first stage the stratified fuel! air mixture auto-ignites, which results in partial oxidation of the fuel in the fuel-rich region and a mixture of radicals and hot products in the fuel-lean region. In the second stage the partially oxidized fuel/air mixture is oxidized in a thin diffusion flame where the diffusion and chemical reaction both play an important role. The split of fuel mass in different injections essentially affect the amount of fuel/air in the fuel-lean region and the fuel-rich region, thereby the relative importance of the diffusion flame. This in turn affects the emissions of NO and CO. The effects of turbulence on the heat release rate, pressure-rise-rate and emissions are a manifestation of the change of the reaction zone structures. At high turbulence intensities and large integral lengths a more homogeneous mixture is achieved, which promotes the volumetric ignition stage, speeds up the heat release rate, increases the pressure-rise-rate, and increases the NO formation and CO oxidation rates. The existence of both volumetric ignition and diffusion flame in PPC poses a great challenge for numerical simulations of PPC engines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: From the view of cooling system, the natural draft dry cooling tower with vertical delta radiators (NDDCTV) under constant heat load can be studied by keeping constant water temperature drop At. With computed entry water temperature t(w1) as the sum of tower exit water temperature t(w2) and the constant Delta(tw) a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model for NDDCTV under constant heat load was established. Through analyses about mesh-independence, sensitivity about crosswind profile index and comparison with published results, the accuracy and credibility of the established numerical model for NDDCTV were confirmed. The aerodynamic field around cooling deltas was analyzed at windless and crosswind conditions, so as to clarify the impacts of ambient air temperature and air inflow deviation angle theta(d) on the performance of cooling columns. With constant heat load and uniform entry water temperature, the cooling performance of each sector was analyzed under crosswind impact. With increasing crosswind velocity v(c), the cooling performance of NDDCTV under constant heat load deteriorates sharply at low v(c), but varies slightly at high v(c), which can be improved by air deflectors.

Abstract: Measuring energy efficiency performance of equipments, processes and factories is the first step to effective energy management in production. Thus, enabled energy-related information allows the assessment of the progress of manufacturing companies toward their energy efficiency goals. In that respect, the study addresses this challenge where current industrial approaches lack the means and appropriate performance indicators to compare energy-use profiles of machines and processes, and for the comparison of their energy efficiency performance to that of competitors'. Focusing on this challenge, the main objective of the paper is to present a method which supports manufacturing companies in the development of energy-based performance indicators. For this purpose, we provide a 7-step method to develop production-tailored and energy-related key performance indicators (e-KPIs). These indicators allow the interpretation of cause-effect relationships and therefore support companies in their operative decision-making process. Consequently, the proposed method supports the identification of weaknesses and areas for energy efficiency improvements related to the management of production and operations. The study therefore aims to strengthen the theoretical base necessary to support energy-based decision making in manufacturing industries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Organic farming is applied in olive groves in Lesvos Island the last 20 years. "Kolovi" and "Adramitiani", two dominant varieties are cultivated. Since there is limited research for energy inputs in olive groves, 62 conventional and 26 organic farms were selected during 2011-2013 in order to (a) determine the differences in energy flow among farming systems and varieties, (b) group olive groves based on energy flow indicators, (c) compare the CO2-equivalent emissions among farming systems and varieties. A combination of univariate and multivariate statistical methods was applied. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) revealed three farm groups, all consisted of conventional and/or organic olive groves and included both varieties. Group 1 had the lowest energy inputs, while Group 3 the highest. Fuels and transportation, as energy inputs, had the highest contribution in farms' grouping. A large number of external variables was studied, most of which (fruit production, olive oil production, pomace production, shoot production, olive oil energy production, pomace energy production, shoot energy production, total energy inputs, total energy outputs, intensity, energy efficiency, and energy productivity) had statistically significant differences among the three Groups. Management practices along with geographical location could be a reasonable explanation for the differences between the groups of studied olive groves. Group 3 had the highest non-renewable energy inputs (14,683.5 MJ ha(-1)) and consumption (2.4 MJ kg(-1)) and gas emissions (1.27 Mg ha(-1) CO2, 0.17 kg ha(-1) CH4, and 10.31 g ha(-1) N2O). Group 2 had the highest renewable energy inputs (7065.8 MJ ha(-1)) and consumption (0.9 MJ kg(-1)), and low CO2-equivalent per fruit production (0.12 kg kg(-1)). The above mentioned results show that best management farming practices introduce the use of renewable energy inputs and lead to lower gas emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The power industry is the largest air polluter in China, contributing nearly 40% of CO2 emissions and 60% of SO2 emissions. Under mounting pressure to improve standards of environmental protection, it is imperative that the industry increases the efficiency and environmental performance of power plants in China. We investigate the impacts of three different environmental regulations on efficiency improvement and CO2 reduction: command and control regulations (CCR), market-based regulations (MBR), and government subsidies (GS). We find that MBR and GS have a positive impact on efficiency improvement and CO2 reduction. However, CCR have no significant impacts. This finding has important implications since CCR dominates China's environmental policy. We discuss the policy implications of these findings, such as China should further release the potential of MBR in the power industry, instead of solely relying on CCR; and pay more attention to the coordination of different policy instruments.

Abstract: An important factor for industrial-scale implementation of torrefaction - a thermal pre-treatment technology that enhances the fuel characteristics of biomass - is the requirement for a low-cost source of heat energy. Significant benefits can be achieved if torrefaction is integrated with a large heat producer. To study this possibility, a new model for the energy and mass balances of the torrefaction process was developed on the basis of available experimental data. The torrefaction model was then integrated into steam power plant simulations, and the performance of different integration schemes was evaluated. To investigate the effect of plant size and operating mode, the same configurations were studied for both large and small combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Large plant operates at full boiler load, and capturing a portion of heat from the plant reduces the power output for all integration cases. At the same time, higher trigeneration efficiencies in comparison with non-integrated case together with fuel consumption decrease due to torrefaction gas co-firing indicate that integration of torrefaction and CHP plant at full load could be beneficial. In case of small plant, free boiler capacity at reduced-load conditions allows to cover the torrefaction heat demand and simultaneously increase the electricity generation for almost all integration cases. Trigeneration efficiency is changing within a relatively narrow range for most of the cases, while the solid fuel consumption is higher than in design case. This work shows that integration method together with process temperature and plant operation mode are the important factors that could have an effect on CHP plant integration with torrefaction process.

Abstract: A novel dual tank solar-assisted heat pump (SAHP) system configuration for domestic hot water heating was developed. Due to the multiple modes of operation arising from the configuration, it was necessary to develop a custom control strategy to minimize electricity consumption. The controller evaluates which modes of operation are possible given the current conditions and selects the best mode from those available.
The system modes of operation were validated experimentally,using a test apparatus built at the University of Waterloo. Annual simulations of system performance for a single-family residential home indicate that the dual tank SAHP system developed provides significant energy savings in comparison to a traditional solar domestic hot water system. Using a benchmark comparison of a standard electric domestic hot water system and a solar domestic hot water system, the dual tank SAHP increased energy savings from 60% to 69% for 7.5 m(2) solar collector area. Applying the system to a larger load offers the potential for significant energy and cost savings, which would improve economic justifiability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Current technologies that provide climate control in the transportation sector are quite inefficient. In gasoline-powered vehicles, the use of air-conditioning is known to result in higher emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants apart from decreasing the gas-mileage. On the other hand, for electric vehicles (EVs), a drain in the onboard electric battery due to the operation of heating and cooling system results in a substantial decrease in the driving range. As an alternative to the conventional climate control system, we are developing an adsorption-based thermal battery (ATB), which is capable of storing thermal energy, and delivering both heating and cooling on demand, while requiring minimal electric power supply. Analogous to an electrical battery, the ATB can be charged for reuse. Furthermore, it promises to be compact, lightweight, and deliver high performance, which is desirable for mobile applications. In this study, we describe the design and operation of the ATB-based climate control system. We present a general theoretical framework to determine the maximum achievable heating and cooling performance using the ATB. The framework is then applied to study the feasibility of ATB integration in EVs, wherein we analyze the use of NaX zeolite-water as the adsorbent-refrigerant pair. In order to deliver the necessary heating and cooling performance, exceeding 2.5 kW h thermal capacity for EVs, the analysis determines the optimal design and operating conditions. While the use of the ATB in EVs can potentially enhance its driving range, it can also be used for climate control in conventional gasoline vehicles, as well as residential and commercial buildings as a more efficient and environmentally-friendly alternative.

Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to the experimental validation of the optimal PV-to-inverter sizing ratio value for the energy yield maximization of a GCPVS by means the implementation of a custom workbench using a solar array simulator which has allowed to replicate a wide variety of technical configurations and environmental data. The compliance between the experimental setup and the mathematical model developed to simulate the optimal PV-to-inverter sizing ratio value was demonstrated by the specific tests carried out on its two main subsystems (the PV generator and the inverter), thus the subsequent simulations were made on a firm basis. Likewise, the evaluation of the overall system also showed a good agreement between the experimental and the simulated energy yield and optimal PV-to-inverter sizing ratio results, rendering relative errors below 3% for both magnitudes.

Abstract: Energy simulation, the virtual representation and reproduction of energy processes for an entire building or a specific space, could assist building professionals with identifying relatively optimal energy conservation measures (ECMs). A review of current work revealed that methods for achieving simultaneous high accuracies in different levels of simulations, such as building level and zone level, have not been systematically explored, especially when there are several zones and multiple HVAC units in a building. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to introduce and validate a novel framework that can calibrate a model with high accuracies at multiple levels. In order to evaluate the performance of the calibration framework, we simulated HVAC-related energy consumption at the building level, at the ECM level and at the zone level. The simulation results were compared with the measured HVAC-related energy consumption. Our findings showed that MBE and CV (RMSE) were below 8.5% and 13.5%, respectively, for all three levels of energy simulation, demonstrating that the proposed framework could accurately simulate the building energy process at multiple levels. In addition, in order to estimate the potential energy efficiency improvements when different ECMs are implemented, the model has to be robust to the changes resulting from the building being operated under different control strategies. Mixed energy ground truths from two ECMs were used to calibrate the energy model. The results demonstrated that the model performed consistently well for both ECMs. Specific contributions of the study presented in this paper are the introduction of a novel calibration framework for multi-level simulation calibration, and improvements to the robustness of the calibrated model for different ECMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The decline in available fossil fuel resources coupled with an ever increasing global demand for energy, have led to substantial interest in the development of renewable biofuels. Biofuels from microalgae, especially liquid fuels produced from saline microalgae lipids (oils), are seen as an important component of the future biofuels mix. In Australia, several companies and research groups are working on developing microalgal biofuels and whilst most are still in the research and development stage, recently constructed demonstration facilities highlight the potential for large-scale cultivation. Western Australia (WA) specifically, has several key advantages for large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation including abundant sunshine, extensive land area unsuitable for agriculture, an abundant water source in the Indian Ocean, existing infrastructure in several potential locations, high local demand for fuel and stable.political conditions.
The purpose of this study was to identify capable geographic locations for constructing large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation facilities in WA. Through the development of the Australian Algal Cultivation-Spatial Location Model (AAC-SLM) an examination of site specific parameters such as irradiance, temperature, CO2 and nutrient availability, workability of soils, land-use and access to distribution infrastructure and a viable workforce, most capable locations for large-scale microalgae cultivation were identified in the state. Results indicate that large tracts of land along the central coast of Western Australia are ideal for cultivation development and could produce up to 11% of Australia's annual automotive diesel needs across the most suitable locations. The end result provides a robust method that can be tailored to the specific requirements and data availability of other regions within Australia and in other nations as a tool to attract future development through the identification of capable cultivation locations.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the thermodynamic and economic performances optimization for an ORC system recovering the waste heat of exhaust gas from a large marine diesel engine of the merchant ship. Parameters of net power output index and thermal efficiency are used to represent the economic and thermodynamic performances, respectively. The maximum net power output index and thermal efficiency are obtained and the corresponding turbine inlet pressure, turbine outlet pressure, and effectiveness of pre-heater of the ORC system are also evaluated using R1234ze, R245fa, R600, and R600a. Furthermore, the analyses of the effects of turbine inlet temperature and cooling water temperature on the optimal economic and thermodynamic performances of the ORC system are carried out. The results show that R245fa performs the most satisfactorily followed by R600, R600a, and R1234ze under optimal economic performance. However, in the optimal thermodynamic performance evaluations, R1234ze has the largest thermal efficiency followed by R600a, R245fa, and R600. The payback periods will decrease from 0.5 year for R245fa to 0.65 year for R1234ze respectively as the system is equipped with a pre-heater. In addition, compared with conventional diesel oil feeding, the proposed ORC system can reduce 76% CO2 emission per kilowatt-hour. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Intermittent generation is challenging for the existing power systems, which have difficulties in following varying electricity production. To help the generation and demand be in balance, demand response (DR) provides one promising approach. Among many DR applications, residential micro-CHP systems can be advantageous, as these systems typically comprise storage in addition to a controllable cogeneration unit. Current state-of-the-art control strategies for residential micro-CHP systems utilize time-varying electricity price to optimally operate the system. Thus, such systems have the ability to export or import electricity when either one is beneficial.
In this paper, we are interested in the imported electricity. The presence of the intermittent generation in a power system occasionally causes surplus electricity production, which the system should cope with. In such a case, it may be profitable to use electricity for heat production in a micro-CHP system. Therefore, this paper examines the potential overall benefit of integrating a resistor for storage heating in the system, which can act as a power sink when needed. A cost-minimizing control strategy is represented for the coordination of a residential micro-CHP system. Furthermore, its operation is tested in simulations, and the effect of the resistor is analyzed from the prosumer and power system point of view. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An imperative step toward decarbonisation of current industrial processes is to substitute their petroleum-derived feedstocks with biomass and biomass-derived feedstocks. For decarbonisation of the petrochemical industry, integrated catalytic processing of biomass pyrolysis oil (also known as bio-oil) is an enabling technology. This is because, under certain conditions, the reaction products form a mixture consisting of olefins and aromatics, which are very similar to the products of naphtha hydro-cracking in the conventional olefin processes. These synergies suggest that the catalytic bio-oil upgrading reactors can be seamlessly integrated to the subsequent separation network with minimal retrofitting costs. In addition, the integrated catalytic processing provides a high degree of flexibility for optimization of different products in response to market fluctuations. With the aim of assessing the techno-economic viability of this pathway, five scenarios in which different fractions of bio-oil (water soluble/water insoluble) were processed with different degrees of hydrogenation were studied in the present research. The results showed that such a retrofit is not only economically viable, but also provides a high degree of flexibility to the process, and contributes to decarbonisation of olefin infrastructures. Up to 44% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were observed in several scenarios. In addition, it was shown that hydrogen prices lower than 6 $/kg will result in bio-based chemicals which are cheaper than equivalent petrochemicals. Alternatively, for higher hydrogen prices, it is possible to reform the water insoluble phase of bio-oil and produce bin-based chemicals, cheaper than petrochemical equivalents.

Abstract: Increasing competitiveness of renewable power sources due to tightening restrictions on CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion is expected to cause a shift in power generation systems of the future. This investigation considers the impact of the Cryogenic CarbonCapture (TM) (CCC) process on transitional power generation. The CCC process consumes less energy than chemical and physical absorption processes and has an energy storage capability that shifts the parasitic loss of the CCC process away from peak hours. The CCC process responds rapidly to the variation of electricity demand and has a time constant that is consistent with the intermittent supply from renewable power sources. The hybrid system of conventional and renewable power generation units and the CCC process are optimized in this investigation. The system under consideration consists of load-following coal and gas-fired power units, a CCC process, and wind generation. The objective is to meet the residential and CCC plant electricity demands while maximizing the operating profit. The results demonstrate that an average profit of $35 k/hr is obtained from this hybrid system over the selected days. The total electricity demand is best met using a combination of coal, gas, and wind power with grid-scale energy storage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: With ever increasing cost of fossil fuels and natural gas, the improvement in gas turbine power cycle efficiency is needed due to the tremendous savings in fuel consumption. Water/steam injection is considered as one of the most popular power augmentation techniques because of its significant impact on the gas turbine performance. One of the recently suggested evaporative gas turbine cycles is the Maisotsenko open cycle for gas turbine power generation. In this paper, detailed thermodynamic analysis of this cycle is investigated with a thorough air saturator model. A comparative analysis is carried out to signify the advantages and disadvantages of Maisotsenko gas turbine cycle (MGTC) as compared with humid air gas turbine cycles. MGTC performance is evaluated based on a simple recuperated gas turbine cycle. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of different operating parameters on the overall cycle performance. Finally, integrating an air saturator instead of a conventional heat exchanger in recuperated gas turbine cycles enhances the power plant performance such that an efficiency enhancement of 7% points and net specific work output augmentation of 44.4% are obtained.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess the benefits of introducing a demand side management optimisation controller to a cold thermal storage ice bank. This controller consisted of an ice bank model, an air temperature forecast model and an optimisation algorithm. The financial and grid utilisation benefits produced by implementation of this controller over the current state of the art in ice bank load shifting control was tested in a day ahead real time electricity pricing forecast environment. This hypothetical real time electricity price was based on the cost of electricity in the Irish wholesale market. Multiple ice bank charge levels were simulated in order to quantify the performance of two control methods for varying operating conditions. First, the "standard controller" was based on the current modus operandi for ice bank systems where ice was generated for food cooling at night when the off-peak electricity tariff is available (00:00-08:00 h). Second, the "upgraded controller" was developed as a bespoke Demand Side Management control system for food refrigeration in a future electricity pricing environment. It consisted of a dual function load shifting optimisation algorithm, an ice bank model, and a predictive air temperature model. A preliminary study was also carried out to test the robustness of the controller's performance in an uncertain real time electricity pricing forecast scenario. Both economic and grid management benefits were found by simulating the operation of the cold thermal storage load shifting controller in a forecasted day ahead real time electricity pricing environment. The energy savings achieved for 100% ice bank charge were low, but as the desired charge level was reduced to 75%, 50% and 25% the savings potential increased. The introduction of uncertain real time electricity pricing forecasts nullified any cost savings made by the load-shifting controller in comparison to the current state of the art.

Abstract: The methane storage properties of five benchmark high surface area adsorbent materials were studied at ambient temperature and up to 250 bar service pressure. Using adsorption and sample density data, we evaluated the potential of these materials to store methane in a 110 L pressure vessel. At 50 bar, the adsorbent materials significantly outperformed traditional compressed gas storage. Two materials, an activated carbon and a copper based metal-organic framework (Cu-BTC), also showed improvement over compressed gas storage at 250 bar. Driving ranges calculated from storage data show that with an adsorbent, a 110 L tank filled to 50 bar could have a driving range of up to 140 miles, more than three times the range offered by a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle when operating as a pure battery electric vehicle.

Abstract: Transportation distance, moisture content of the raw material and volume per storage are crucial factors for the economy of forest biomass supply operations from roadside to plant. The present study investigated the current process for raw material allocation in a case study in Eastern Finland and compared it to a newly developed process which is based on the previously mentioned factors with the aim of increasing the energy output during the peak period. It applied discrete-event simulation to assess the effects on productivity of a supply chain consisting of two truck-trailer combinations and a large-scale chipper, economically analyzed the results and compared the current practice to the information-based approach.
The results show that the information-based approach increased the productivity in terms of energy output of the supply chain. During the peak period from December to February, when the available fleet works to full capacity and productivity is therefore critical, the energy output in terms of MW h increased by up to 29%. Over the whole year the output increased by up to 8% while the supply costs decreased by up to 7%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE), the intermediate product while producing bio-butanol, has been proposed to be used as an alternative fuel directly to reduce the butanol recovery/separation costs. It is important to understand how the ABE ratio influences the combustion process because of the large differences in physical and chemical properties between the ABE components and diesel. Therefore, a wide range of ratios of ABE (0%, 20%, 50%, and 80% in volume referred to as D100, ABE20, ABE50 and ABE80 respectively) were blended with diesel and combusted in a constant volume chamber under various ambient temperatures (1200 K, 1000 K, and 800 K) and various ambient oxygen concentrations (21%, 16%, and 11%). Mie scattering images of the liquid spray and broadband flame luminosity images were captured by a high speed camera coupled with a copper vapor laser beam as light source. The results show that ABE20 exhibits spray characteristics similar to those of D100 while ABE50 exhibits spray characteristics similar to those of ABE80. However, the sprays of ABE50 and ABE80 are much shorter and narrower compared to those of D100 and ABE20. It is predicted that there exists a critical ratio between 20% and 50% for ABE, beyond which the spray characteristics of the blend will be dominated by ABE. The intermediate ABE blend, ABE50 achieves a shorter ignition delay (slightly longer than that of D100) and combustion duration compared to those of ABE20 and ABE80 because of its improved spray performance and relatively low latent heat and high cetane number. The natural flame luminosity is found to be reduced significantly with an increasing ABE ratio due to the fuel-borne oxygen that accelerates soot oxidation along with longer flame lift-off length that effectively decreases the equivalence ratio in the combustion region. Overall, ABE50 is the blend that displays combustion characteristics similar to neat diesel while achieving a shorter combustion duration and lower natural flame luminosity. Thus, ABE50 could potentially increase thermal efficiency and decrease soot emissions when applied in diesel engines. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The influence of surfactant addition on the hydrogen fermentative of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste was extensively investigated under thermophilic conditions (55 +/- 2 degrees C) in batch cultures. The addition of Tween 80 (R) (T80) and polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) substantially improved hydrogen yields (HYs) resulting in 109.9 +/- 7.1 and 113.8 +/- 7.7 mlH(2)/gCarb.(Initial) at T80 and PEG 6000 (R) concentrations not exceeding 2.8% and 16.7 g/L, respectively. A combination of 2.8% T80 with 1.7 g/L PEG 6000 (R) achieved slightly higher HYs of 116.7 +/- 5.2 mlH(2)/gCarb.(initial). An artificial neural network model reliably represented the relationship between the surfactant concentration and hydrogen production with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.980. Microbial community analysis of the batches supplemented with 2.8% T80 and 1.7 g/L PEG 6000 (R) showed the dominance of the hydrogen-producing bacteria Enterobacter, Escherichia, Buttiauxella, and Pantoea. The study confirms the potential of surfactant addition for H-2 production from wastes containing organics in a particulate form. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work, an optimal standalone direct pumping photovoltaic irrigation system is proposed for the deficit irrigation of olive orchards. A simulation model of the system was developed in order to obtain the economically optimal design of this system. This model is composed of different sub-models: the photovoltaic power generation capacity sub-model, the direct pumping management sub-model and the sub-model that evaluates the economic and productive response of the crop to the application of water. The model simulates for increasing values of peak power of the photovoltaic system, the water and energy balance in the photovoltaic irrigation system and the crop yield. It also calculates the investments and operational costs of the system and, finally, the net economic returns to the farmer. The model enables us to select the optimal design of the system that achieves its maximum economic profitability.
The economically optimal designs provided by the model are not achieved for a completely full irrigation of the crop but rather for deficit irrigation. In this way, we propose a new approach to PV irrigation systems design and management that we call PV opportunity irrigation (PVOI). PVOI makes use of the ability of many crops to undergo some water stress without experiencing a significant yield loss in order to reduce the size of the PV irrigation system. The operational strategy in the PVOI approach is to irrigate as long as enough power is supplied by the PV array. Unlike any other conventional design method available in literature, the total amount of water applied to the crop depends on the energy provided by the PV
[GRAPHICS]
array rather than on a strict fulfillment of the pre-established crop water irrigation requirements. The application of the PVOI approach implies not only a reduction in the investment costs of the system but also some water savings, which is very important in areas with water scarcity.

Abstract: A computational model to investigate proton-conducting Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) with direct internal reforming is developed. The numerical framework employs a 42-step elementary heterogeneous mechanism for Ni catalysts, using mean-field approximation. Mass transport through the porous media is described by the dusty gas model (DGM). Electrochemical parameters are deduced by reproducing two sets of experimental data, via the non-linear Butler-Volmer equation. A simple 1-D energy balance model is used to predict temperature profiles. The performance of the cell is analyzed by assuming the co-flow planar cell to be adiabatic. Simulations are carried out to understand the influence of various operating conditions on temperature distribution, species transport, and electrochemistry in the cell. The effect of dividing the anode into four zones, with different specific catalytic areas, on macroscopic performance parameters is investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is one of the up-and-coming power sources for automotive vehicles. To generate a stable performance during driving, the PEMFC needs to achieve an optimized water management under various humidity conditions. Being the path for the two-phase flow of fuel, air, and water, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is a critical component, which influences water balance. In this study, a pore size gradient structure is introduced in the substrate of a GDL to control the local capillary pressure gradient, which is the driving force of the water flux inside the PEMFC. Through measurements of steady-state performance, transient response, voltage instability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, it was found that the pore size gradient structure improves the cell performance regardless of the relative humidity conditions used (50% and 100%). Furthermore, it is possible to hold the water on the membrane for higher ion conductivity and drain it toward the channel to secure gas supply toward the catalyst layer. In addition, it was also confirmed that the structural change enhances the bending stiffness of the GDL. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy efficient operation of microgrids, a localized grouping of controllable loads with distributed energy resources like solar photovoltaic panels, requires the development of energy management systems (EMSs) with the capability of controlling the loads so as to optimize the aggregate performance of the microgrid. In microgrids comprising of buildings of different nature (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.), where the occupants exhibit heterogeneous occupancy schedules, the objective of an effective management strategy is to optimize the aggregate performance by intelligently exploiting the occupancy schedules and the intermittent production of solar energy. This paper presents a simulation-based optimization approach for the design of an EMS in grid-connected photovoltaic-equipped microgrids with heterogeneous occupancy schedule. The microgrid exchanges energy, buying or selling it, with the main grid and the EMS optimizes an aggregate multi-objective criterion that takes into account both the energy cost and the thermal comfort of the occupants of the microgrid. Simulative results obtained using a microgrid test case developed in EnergyPlus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: the proposed EMS strategy is shown to take advantage of the occupancy information, intelligently and automatically changing the energy demand of each building according to the occupants' behavior, and achieving relevant improvements with respect to alternative EMS strategies.

Abstract: Shallow vertical ground-source heat pump systems (GSHPSs) have become a popular alternative to conventional heating systems. Typically more than one vertical ground heat exchanger (GHE) is required along with an increasing heat demand. The higher the number of GHEs, the more a system may benefit from optimal design and operation strategies that focus on costs and efficiencies. However, an optimisation of the heat and fluid flows in these systems, based on discretised models, can be computationally time-consuming and sometimes infeasible. To meet this challenge, one might apply simplified models and identify suitable constraints. In this work an analytical finite line source (FLS) model is compared by RockFlow, a finite element approach. The average absolute difference for a long-term investigation between these approaches is obtained at only approx. 0.2 degrees C, which was evaluated as sufficient. Subsequently, the FLS model is successfully applied to demonstrate the existence of borehole-specific heat flux distributions. For all case studies optimal solutions were found. These results confirmed the useful application of novel optimisation methods. The impact of the GHE specific heat flux distributions on the time-dependent and spatial temperature course in the vicinity of the GHE is impressively shown. The investigation of the soil and heat pump cycle revealed the system efficiency potential and costs. The efficiency improvement potential, caused by different optimal heat flux distributions, was approx. 2%. The best energy extraction improvement was nearly 20%, which equated to a monetary saving of 12%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Over the last few years, agro-biogas has been receiving great attention since it enables replacement of natural gas, thereby representing a tool which reduces greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. In this context, this paper is aimed at the application of the Carbon Footprint (CF) to an agro-biogas supply chain (SC) in Southern Italy, according to ISO/TS 14067:2013, so as to calculate the related 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP(100)).
The topic was addressed because agro-biogas SCs, though being acknowledged worldwide as sustainable ways to produce both electricity and heat, can be source of GHG emissions and therefore environmental assessments and improvements are needed. Additionally, the performed literature review highlighted deficiencies in PCF assessments, so this study could contribute to enriching the international knowledge on the environmental burdens associated with agro-biogas SCs.
The analysis was conducted using a life-cycle approach, thus including in the assessment: functional unit choice, system border definition and inventory analysis development. The primary data needed was provided by a farm located in the province of Foggia (Apulia region in Southern Italy), already equipped with anaerobic digestion and cogeneration plant for biogas production and utilisation. Results from this study are in agreement with those found by some of the most relevant studies in the sector. Indeed, it was possible to observe that GWP100 was almost entirely due to cropland farming and, in particular, to the production of ammonium nitrate in the amount required for fertilisation. Furthermore, environmental credits were observed thanks to: carbon sequestration enabled by no-tillage practice; and avoided production of chemical fertiliser thanks to 50% organic farming. Based upon the results obtained, a sensitivity analysis was carried out, thus highlighting reduced environmental impacts if ammonium nitrate was replaced with urea.
Finally, thanks to this study, all the target stakeholders will learn more about the input/output flows involved in the system analysed, the related environmental impacts and the improvements needed to reduce them. In this way, it could be possible to compare the analysed agro-biogas SC with others of equal functionality, and so to enable considerations to be made on the resulting similarities and differences in terms of methodological approach, inventory flows and environmental impact.

Abstract: Experimental results are presented from the combustion of toluene with CO2 and H2S gas in H-2/O-2-N-2 flames at an equivalence ratio of Phi = 3 (Claus condition). The results from the combustion of 100% H2S, H2S/C7H8 and H2S/C7H8/CO2 acid gases are also reported. The results showed a decrease in mole fraction of H2S and simultaneous evolution of SO2 in H2S/H-2/O-2-N-2 flame. In contrast, combustion of H2S/C7H8 acid gas showed faster initial SO2 formation to a maximum mole fraction, but the formed SO2 decomposed further downstream in the reactor. This is in further contrast to that of H2S/C7H8/CO2 acid gas combustion, where CO2 acted as an oxidizer (released atomic oxygen) that furthered SO2 formation. The results also revealed the formation of CH4, C2H2 and CS2 with the addition of toluene. The presence of CO2 enhanced the formation of mercaptans (COS and CS2) and decomposition of formed hydrocarbons in the reactor. These results help to identify conditions under which hydrocarbons and mercaptans (COS and CS2) are formed, and how they can be mitigated during sulfur and energy recovery from acid gases.

Abstract: Dimethyl ether (DME) is one of the most promising alternative fuels emerging in the past few decades. At present, DME is mainly applied to the compression ignition (CI) engines, and numerous studies showed its superior performances in Cl engines versus the traditional fuels. More recently, DME was also introduced into the field of industrial boiler to solve the pollution problem raised by coal usage. But the emission behavior of DME in this type of combustion system was not studied as thoroughly. In this paper, experiments and simulations are conducted to study the NOx and CO emission characteristics of the DME/air jet diffusion flame, which may be valuable for design and operation of the DME-fueled industrial boilers. During the measurements, a series of fuel jet velocities (u(f)) and air co-flow velocities (u(co)) were designed for the experiments to investigate their effects on NOx and CO emission indices systematically. Additionally, the CFD-CRN method was also employed to analyze NOx formation characteristics in different regions of the flame. The conversion relationship between the nitrogenous species (including NO, NO2, HCN, etc.), NOx formation and consumption pathways, and NOx and CO emission indices of the DME/air jet diffusion flame were analyzed by reaction rate and sensitivity analyses.

Abstract: Improving energy efficiency through technological advancement has become a primary measure to achieve energy conservation targets in China. However, the existence of energy rebound effects may completely or partially offset energy savings associated with technological advancement From sectors perspective, technological advancement is not a necessary condition for energy conservation for a given sector because of varied rates of technological advancement and dependence among sectors. Adopting the input-output model, this article presents a detailed analysis of energy rebound effects in China's economy at the aggregate and sectoral level over 2006-2010. The results show that the aggregate sectors' rebound effect is about 11.31%, which is larger than without considering the interaction among sectors (11.25%); and strongly suggests that technological advancement has varied impacts on energy conservation and rebound effects. Thus various strategies of technological advancement and incorporated mitigation measures are necessary for energy conservation across sectors. Furthermore, the current study confirms that China's total value of fossil-fuel subsidies reached 160.23 billion US$ (constant 2005 price) in 2006-2010; and after removal of subsidies, the energy use is expected to save 411.35 million toe and the rebound effects for aggregate sectors become 10.64%. Finally, some relevant policy issues are discussed in depth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Time-of-use (TOU) pricing serves as a cost-effective way to realize electricity demand response, which aims at relieving peak demand. Customer participation is critical to the success of TOU pricing programs. To fulfill the potential of such programs, customers must be able to access electricity tariffs and understand their terms. This paper reports a survey of 43 TOU pricing programs targeting industrial customers offered by U.S. utilities. This work is inspired by and complements the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission survey of demand response in the electric power industry, highlighting the interpretation of key pricing components and specific characteristics of TOU tariff sheets collected from public sources. The case studies examine various industrial scenarios to predict electricity cost savings when customers are facing the transition from flat rates to TOU pricing. The analysis results show that the cost savings vary enormously, ranging from -72.0% to +82.6%, depending on specific utility programs and switching strategies involved. Such information is useful for customers to determine whether to participate in a TOU pricing program. Key findings and implications for industrial customers, utilities, and regulatory agencies are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In order to estimate the remaining driving range (RDR) in electric vehicles, the remaining discharge energy (E-RDE) of the applied battery system needs to be precisely predicted. Strongly affected by the load profiles, the available E-RDE varies largely in real-world applications and requires specific determination. However, the commonly-used direct calculation (DC) method might result in certain energy prediction errors by relating the E-RDE directly to the current state of charge (SOC). To enhance the E-RDE accuracy, this paper presents a battery energy prediction (EP) method based on the predictive control theory, in which a coupled prediction of future battery state variation, battery model parameter change, and voltage response, is implemented on the E-RDE prediction horizon, and the E-RDE is subsequently accumulated and real-timely optimized. Three EP approaches with different model parameter updating routes are introduced, and the predictive-adaptive energy prediction (PAEP) method combining the real-time parameter identification and the future parameter prediction offers the best potential. Based on a large-format lithium-ion battery, the performance of different E-RDE calculation methods is compared under various dynamic profiles. Results imply that the EP methods provide much better accuracy than the traditional DC method, and the PAEP could reduce the E-RDE error by more than 90% and guarantee the relative energy prediction error under 2%, proving as a proper choice in online E-RDE prediction. The correlation of SOC estimation and E-RDE calculation is then discussed to illustrate the importance of an accurate E-RDE method in real-world applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This work proposes a systems optimization control model for energy management of a parallel crushing process made up with high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) machines. The aim is to reduce both energy consumption and cost through optimal control of the process and load shifting, respectively. A case study of a copper crushing process is solved under three scenarios in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed model. Simulation results show that 41.93% energy cost saving is achieved through load shifting by coordinating the rotational speed of HPGRs. It is further shown that the energy saving can be achieved when the two HPGRs are not operated with equal overall efficiency, but also through a small decrement in rolls operating pressure. In the first case, 1.87% energy saving is obtained while in the last case, about 4.5% energy saving is achieved for every decrement of 0.2 N/mm(2) in rolls operating pressure without significant change in product quality.

Abstract: Most of the pretreatments to sewage sludge in lab-scale studies show high potentials to be implemented in an anaerobic digester since they produce an increase in the biogas production. However, no energy assessments are usually considered in scientific reports. By making a simple evaluation of energy consumption by pretreatments, it can be stated that unfortunately not all the pretreatment technologies have an energy self-sufficiency to be implemented in a WWTP, requiring many times a continuous energy investment. Generally, pretreatments consuming electricity do not satisfy its energy demands from the biogas production in the same process, although high solubilization or biogas production increases are reached. Just ultrasounds applied in full-scale plants, with commercial technologies such as Sonix or Biosonator, provide an energetically self-sufficient pretreatment. In the case of thermal pretreatments, the potential to be implemented with full energy integration is much higher, since they can recover heat from the biogas engine as well as electrical energy in the same extent as for electric pretreatments. This way, full energy integration can be achieved in thermal hydrolysis plants; such is the case of commercial technologies such as Cambi, Exelys (Veolia) or CTH (Aqualogy). Several theoretical approaches and simulations also state that thermal hydrolysis presents a high potential to be fully integrated in WWTP with a complete energy recovery and self-sufficiency.

Abstract: It is well known that for a thermoelectric generator (TEG) in thermal steady-state with constant temperature difference across it the maximum power point is found at half of the open-circuit voltage (or half of the short-circuit current). However, the effective thermal resistance of the TEG changes depending on the current drawn by the load in accordance with the parasitic Peltier effect.
This article analyses the different case in which the input thermal power is constant and the temperature difference across the TEG varies depending on its effective thermal resistance. This situation occurs in most waste heat recovery applications because the available thermal power is at any time limited.
The first part of this article presents the electrical characterisation of TEGs for constant-heat and it investigates the relationship between maximum power point and open-circuit voltage. The second part studies the maximum power that can be produced by TEGs with pellets (or legs) of different size and number, i.e. with different packing factors, and of different height. This work provides advice on the optimisation of the pellets geometrical parameters in order to increase the power generated, and consequently the thermodynamic efficiency, and to minimise the quantity of thermoelectric material used, for systems with limited input thermal power.

Abstract: This paper examines the cost-effectiveness of subsidies (feed-in tariffs and renewable energy credits) paid for by electricity consumers to support the uptake of roof top photovoltaic (PV) systems by households in Australia. We estimate annual payback periods, and then regress these against the actual uptake of household PV and associated emission reductions, creating a relationship not apparent in other research. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the declining cost of PV panels had most impact on PV uptake followed by feed-in tariffs, renewable energy credits and the increasing cost of household electricity tariffs. Our modelling shows that feed-in tariffs were higher than necessary to achieve the resultant levels of PV uptake and that the low cost of PV panels and comparatively high electricity tariffs are likely to result in a continuing strong uptake of household PV in Australia. Our modelling shows that subsidies peaked in 2011 and 2012, with payback periods of three to four years, having since increased to five to six years. Emission reduction costs are expected to reduce from over AU$200 per t CO(2)e in 2013 to between AU$65 and AU$100 per t CO(2)e in 2020. Household PV reduced Australia's emissions by 3.7 million t CO(2)e in 2013 (1.7% of Australia's total emissions) and is expected to reach eight million tonnes (3.7% of Australia's total emissions) by 2020.

Abstract: Due to increasing awareness of the deleterious environmental and health effects of diesel combustion emissions, major regulatory action and policy measures are focused on reducing emissions from diesel engines. Freight operations, including rail-based freight transportation, have received special attention as an industry where major change can be affected, especially in neighborhoods located near operations centers. A FORTRAN-based dynamic simulation model of an SOFC-GT (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Gas Turbine) system from a prior feasibility study has been adapted to analyze system operation along a representative but demanding route in southern California. In previous simulations with the model, the basic operational feasibility of the system has been demonstrated as well as the in-service operation for pre-reformed fuels. In the current study, the analysis is extended to include reformation of two fuels (diesel and natural gas) onboard the locomotive and analyses of system efficiency, fuel consumption, CO2 emission, and NOx emission that can be attained through careful thermal integration of the reformer unit. Route-averaged fuel-to-wheels system efficiencies of 60% and 52% are predicted for natural gas and diesel fuel, respectively. Additionally, SOFC-GT operation could provide (1) a reduction approaching 98% in NOx for both fuels; (2) a 54% savings in CO2 for operation on natural gas; and (3) a 30% CO2 reduction for operation on diesel fuel compared to state-of-the-art locomotive technology. These gains may be offset by design challenges, especially for the diesel case, due to the requirement for large volumes of water to support the reformation process even for medium-length freight hauling trips.

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven diagnostic approach for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) systems. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) is realized by analyzing individual cell voltages. A feature extraction method Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) and a multi-class classification method Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine (DAGSVM) are utilized successively to extract the useful features from raw data and classify the extracted features into various classes related to health states. Experimental data of two different stacks are used to validate the proposed approach. The results show that five concerned faults can be detected and isolated with a high accuracy. Moreover, the light computational cost of the approach enhances the possibility of its online implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The feasibility of simultaneous production of acetate and methane from glycerol was investigated by selective enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in an extreme-thermophilic (70 degrees C) fermentation. Fed-batch experiments showed acetate was produced at the concentration up to 13.0 g/L. A stable operation of the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was reached within 100 days. Acetate accounted for more than 90 w/w% of metabolites in the fermentation liquid. The yields of methane and acetate were close to the theoretical yields with 0.74-0.80 mol-methane/mol-glycerol and 0.63-0.70 mol-acetate/mol-glycerol. The obtained microbial community was characterized. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens, mainly Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus formed 93% of the methanogenogenic community. This confirms that a high temperature (70 degrees C) could effectively select for hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea. Thermoanaerobacter spp. was the main bacterium forming 91.5% of the bacterial population. This work demonstrated the conversion of the byproduct of biodiesel production, glycerol, to acetate as a chemical and biogas for energy generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In recent decades, the accelerating economic and social developments have led to exponentially increasing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. As a result, much research efforts have been directed toward more effective measures for the carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this review, we first briefly described the general background on the various techniques available for the abatement of CO2 emissions worldwide. Then, we provided an in-depth discussion regarding the two comparable control technologies, i.e., the amine- vs. ammonia-based capture approaches; ammonia has lower energy costs than monoethanolamine (MEA). The applicability of each method was described further with an emphasis on their advantages and disadvantages. We also briefly discussed the available options for post-absorption processing such as recovery of absorbed CO2, compression, and storage. Many immobilized amines as adsorbents can only be regenerated a few times or are a 'once-through process'. This may deplete the global supply of those materials if CCS is scaled up in excess of Mton CO2 captured per year. Ideally, the captured CO2 should be isolated from the atmosphere indefinitely and/or photochemically reduced (either biologically or industrially). Finally, we explored future challenges in this field of study to envision and suggest more optimized solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Sludge with a low organic content has poor biochemical methane potential. High-solids digestion is a possible method to recover bioenergy economically from this kind of sludge, but the blocked mass transfer is a major obstacle. A pilot scale high-solids anaerobic digester equipped with an enhanced stirring system was designed and operated continuously for 9.5 months to evaluate the feasibility of: bioenergy recovery from low-organic-content sludge. The results showed that high-solids anaerobic digestion can evolve successfully from low-solids status. Although the system once suffered slight inhibition derived from ammonia, it then stabilized with volatile fatty acids concentration of 200-400 mg/L and free ammonia concentration less than 250 mg/L, exhibiting similar removal rates of organic solids and biogas yields as achieved using low-solids digestion. Statistical analyses proved that the organic removal rate was almost proportional to the organic content of feed sludge. The organic removal rate was nearly 35% when the organic content of feed sludge was 50%, while the system tended to failure when the organic content of feed sludge was less than 38%. High-solids anaerobic digestion, when combined with improved agitation, is an effective method for bioenergy recovery from sludge with organic content of 40-50%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: To reduce the costs of controlling emissions from coal-fired power stations, we propose an advanced and effective process of combined SO2 removal and NH3 recycling, which can be integrated with the aqueous NH3-based CO2 capture process to simultaneously achieve SO2 and CO2 removal, NH3 recycling and flue gas cooling in one process. A rigorous, rate-based model for an NH3-CO2-SO2-H2O system was developed and used to simulate the proposed process. The model was thermodynamically and kinetically validated by experimental results from the open literature and pilot-plant trials, respectively. Under typical flue gas conditions, the proposed process has SO2 removal and NH3 reuse efficiencies of >99.9%. The process is strongly adaptable to different scenarios such as high SO2 levels in flue gas, high NH3 levels from the CO2 absorber and high flue gas temperatures, and has a low energy requirement. Because the process simplifies flue gas desulphurisation and resolves the problems of NH3 loss and SO2 removal, it could significantly reduce the cost of CO2 and SO2 capture by aqueous NH3.

Abstract: In this study, renewable ethylene glycol (EG) was exploited as a potential fuel for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with conventional nickel yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet anodes for sustainable electric power generation. Carbon deposition behaviors over Ni-YSZ anodes under different carbon-containing atmospheres such as EG, glycerol, ethanol and methane. were characterized through thermodynamic prediction, oxygen-temperature programmed oxidation and SEM-EDX analysis. EG was observed to be better than acetic acid and glycerol and much better than methane and ethanol in terms of carbon deposition. A calculation of the open-circuit voltages of EG-fueled SOFCs suggested that EG is a suitable fuel for SOFCs. A maximum power output of 1200 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C was obtained from a cell operating on EG-steam fuel, which is only a little lower than that from a cell based on hydrogen fuel. The cell was further operated stably on an EG-steam gas mixture for 200 h with no apparent performance degradation, carbon deposition over the anode, Ni agglomeration, or change in the morphology of the anodes. The current study confirmed the practical applicability of EG as a direct fuel for SOFCs, which may have a great effect on future energy systems. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) and grass Egeria densa (Ed.) with four different WAS: E.d. ratios was evaluated for the first time under mesophilic conditions. First-order kinetic, modified Gompertz, and Cone models were employed to reveal the principle kinetics of methane-rich bioenergy production from co-digestion. The results showed that the addition of E.d. could greatly upgrade the sludge methane production, and the highest methane yield averaged 198.32 +/- 2.61 mL/g VSadded for WAS: E.d. ratio of 0.7: 0.3, 18.72 +/- 0.14% higher respective to that of WAS alone (about 176.36 mL/g VSadded). E.d. improved the solubilization of co-substrates and avoided the build-up of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and free ammonia ([NH3]) and subsequent inhibition, inducing a stable digestion environment. Model simulation indicated Cone model best fitted the actual evolution of methane production, as evidenced by low Root Mean Square Prediction Error (rMSPE) and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), as well as high Pearson's correlation between the predicated and actual values. Additionally, the parameters analysis highlighted that the co-digestion with Ed. substantially promoted the hydrolysis rate (k(hyd)) and methanogenesis potential (f(d)) of sludge, further explaining the increased solids removal and output of methane. This study demonstrated the sustainability and attractiveness of anaerobic co-digestion of sludge and grass E.d., providing a sound basis for cost-efficient biomass stabilization and bioenergy recovery.

Abstract: This article describes a method to model roof geometries from widely available low-resolution (2 m horizontal) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets for application on a city-wide scale. The model provides roof area, orientation, and slope, appropriate for predictions of solar technology performance, being of value to national and regional policy makers in addition to investors and individuals appraising the viability of specific sites. Where present, similar buildings are grouped together based on proximity and building footprint dimensions. LiDAR data from all the buildings in a group is combined to construct a shared high-resolution LiDAR dataset. The best-fit roof shape is then selected from a catalogue of common roof shapes and assigned to all buildings in that group. Method validation was completed by comparing the model output to a ground-based survey of 169 buildings and aerial photographs of 536 buildings, all located in Leeds, UK. The method correctly identifies roof shape in 87% of cases and the modelled roof slope has a mean absolute error of 3.76 degrees. These performance figures are only possible when segmentation, similar building grouping and ridge repositioning algorithms are used. (C) 2015 ElSevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper introduces the design of the CSIRO variant of the Global Trade and Environment model (GTEM-C). GTEM-C is a hybrid model that combines the top-down macroeconomic representation of a computable general equilibrium model with the bottom-up engineering details of energy production. The model features detailed accounting for global energy flows that are embedded in traded energy goods, and it offers a unified framework to analyse the energy-carbon-environment nexus. As an illustrative example, we present simulation results on global energy transformation under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's representative carbon pathways 4.5 and 8.5. By testing the model's sensitivity to the relevant parameter, we find that the pace of electrification will significantly contain the spiking of carbon prices because electricity can be produced from carbon-free or less carbon-intensive technologies. The decoupling of energy use and carbon footprint, due to the uptake of clean electricity technologies, such as nuclear, wind, solar, and carbon capture and storage, allows the world to maintain high level of energy consumption, which is essential to economic growth.

Abstract: Microalgae, which are promising candidates for biodiesel production, possess a robust cell wall which prevents the release of intracellular lipids in the medium. The breaking of the algal cell wall for lipid releasing can be energy-intensive. The direct or in situ supercritical transesterification method is considered to have the potential to disrupt the rigid algal cell wall and convert the extracted lipids into biodiesel in only one step, thus reducing significantly the process energy consumption. In this work, wet (similar to 80 wt.% moisture) and dry unwashed marine microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana were used directly to synthesize biodiesel in a single-step process by direct transesterification with no added catalysts using supercritical methanol. The effect of main process parameters (methanol to dry algae ratio, reaction time and temperature) was studied. Initially, the methanol to dry algae ratio (6:1-12:1 vol,/wt.) was investigated and then the synergic effect between reaction time (10-50 min) and temperature (245-290 degrees C) was studied using a factorial experimental design. In addition, the effect of the supercritical process on the structure of the algal cell walls was studied by scanning electron microscopy observations. Maximum biodiesel yields of similar to 0.46 and similar to 0.48 g/g of lipids were reached from wet and dry unwashed algal biomass, respectively, at 255-265 degrees C, 50 min reaction time, and using a methanol to dry algae ratio of 10:1

Abstract: Previous studies with fixed operating temperatures have shown that hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) was a promising absorber layer for solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems because of (a) a low temperature coefficient and (b) the opportunity to reverse light induced degradation with thermal annealing. This study further refined the simulation of the optimal dispatch strategy for a-Si:H based PVT by studying annealing cycles and analysis of the degradation at other operating temperatures controlled by the varying ambient temperatures. Four representative case studies were evaluated for the combinations of high and low solar flux and high and low average ambient temperature. Electrically-optimized dispatch strategies are found for a range of PVT thermal insulating effectivenesses. The results showed significantly more electricity generation in all the case study representative regions except for areas dominated by low temperatures and low solar fluxes. These results indicate that a-Si:H PV performance can be improved in most populated regions in the world by integrating it into a PVT device and using spike annealing to reverse light-induced degradation effects. The model presented in this paper uses publicly-available data to implement suitable dispatch strategies and execute virtual performance analysis of PVT for any geographic location in the world.

Abstract: In order to reduce CO2 emissions and waste generation from the steelmaking industry; a high-gravity carbonation process via rotating packed bed (RPB) was developed using cold-rolling mill wastewater (CRW) and basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS). Since mass transfer among phases is believed to be a key to effective carbonation for CO2 fixation, in this study, a mass transfer model for the high-gravity carbonation process was developed based on two-film theory. The mass transfer characteristics including overall gas-phase mass transfer coefficient (K(G)a) and height of a transfer unit (HTU) were determined accordingly. The results indicated that the mass transfer resistance of carbonation using BOFS/CRW in an RPB was mainly lay on the liquid side. In addition, the effect of key operating variables such as rotating speed, slurry flow rate, gas flow rate, and liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio on mass transfer characteristics was evaluated. The developed model was validated with the experimental data, where the experimental K(G)a values lay within +/- 20% of the values estimated. Based on the obtained results, empirical models of K(G)a and HTU values were established. Furthermore, response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the high-gravity carbonation process from the viewpoint of mass transfer characteristics. The obtained RSM results were in fairly good agreement with the results of the developed model based on the two-film theory. Based on the theoretical models and statistical analyses, the optimum gas-phase mass transfer rate for high-gravity carbonation process of steelmaking slags in an RPB was graphically determined.

Abstract: Passive thermal management systems using phase change materials (PCMs) provides an effective solution to the overheating of lithium ion batteries. But this study shows heat accumulation in PCMs caused by the inefficient cooling of air natural convection leads to thermal management system failures: The temperature in a battery pack operating continuously outranges the safety limit of 60 degrees C after two cycles with discharge rate of 1.5 C and 2 C. Here a hybrid system that integrates PCMs with forced air convection is presented. This combined system successfully prevents heat accumulation and maintains the maximum temperature under 50 degrees C in all cycles. Study on airspeed effects reveals that thermo-physical properties of PCMs dictate the maximum temperature rise and temperature uniformity in the battery pack, while forced air convection plays a critical role in recovering thermal energy storage capacity of PCMs. A numerical study is also carried out and validated with experiment data, which gives theoretic insights on thermo-physical changes in this hybrid battery thermal management system.

Abstract: Ternary eutectic chloride (NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2)/expanded graphite (EG) composites were prepared for thermal energy storage applications at a solar thermal power plant. Heat capacity and latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) characteristics of the composites including the melting temperature and latent heat capacity were investigated using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique, and the effects of EG additives in the composite on thermal conductivities were evaluated using a hot disk analyzer. The ternary eutectic chloride/EG composites with expanded volumes ranging from 150 to 250 g/L and the EG mass fractions ranging from 0 to 5 wt% were prepared by absorbing liquid chlorides into the EG at high temperature. Experimental results indicated that the specific heat capacity of solid composites decreased with EG mass fraction and temperature. In the liquid state, the effect of the EG loading on the specific heat was not uniform. Specific heat capacity reached maximum at 1 wt% of EG loading and the specific heat capacities of all samples rose with temperature. The melting temperatures of the composites were the same as the pure ternary eutectic chloride, but the phase change latent heat decreased with the mass percentages of EG in the composites. The thermal conductivities of the composites were 1.35-1.78 times higher than that of the pure ternary eutectic chloride. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There are significant resources of coal on the planet. It is likely that a lot of this coal will be combusted. A 1 GW(e) coal power plant operating at 35% electrical efficiency and a capacity factor of 75% produces 6.77 million tonnes of CO2 per annum. A closed cultivation system with a carbon capture efficiency of 80% allows production of 2.69 Mt of micro-algal (volatile solids), in a foot print of 19,200 ha for a tubular photo-bioreactor (PBR) and 34,000 ha for a Flat Plate PBR. An open system (raceway pond) at a carbon capture efficiency of 50% produces 1.68 Mt of micro-algal (volatile solids) and requires a footprint of 52,303 ha. Employing a three stage sequential process (combining dark fermentation, photo fermentation and anaerobic digestion) to produce bin-hydrogen and bio-methane from the micro-algae could potentially generate 35% of the primary energy in the coal in the form of renewable gaseous fuel if a closed system of cultivation is used. This is sufficient to fuel 600,000 cars per annum. In the cultivation of micro-algae, pumping and circulation is a considerable parasitic energy demand. The ratio of energy output (gaseous biofuel) to energy input (pumping and circulation) is less than 1 for all the three cultivation systems assessed, ranging from 0.71 for raceway ponds to 0.05 for a tubular PBR. If coal powered electricity is the source of this parasitic energy then a tubular PBR system produces more CO2 than the CO2 captured by the micro-algae. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) are preferred to convert low temperature geothermal energy (<150 degrees C) to electricity. The working fluid selection and system parameters optimization are the main approaches to improve geothermal ORC systems performance. Zeotropic mixtures are showing promise as ORC working fluids due to the better match between the working fluid and the heat source/sink temperatures. This study optimizes the cooling water temperature rise as well as the evaporation and condensation pressures of isobutane/isopentane (R600a/R601a) mixtures for various mole fractions to maximize the net power output of a geothermal ORC for geothermal water temperatures of 110 degrees C, 130 degrees C and 150 degrees C and reinjection temperatures not less than 70 degrees C. Two mole fractions maximize the turbine power generation, while the maximum net power output occurs for R600a mole fractions from 0.7 to 0.9 due to the variation of the parasitic power consumed by the working fluid feed pump and the cooling water circulating pump. A geothermal ORC using R600a/R601 can generate 11%, 7% and 4% more power than an ORC using pure R600a for geothermal water inlet temperatures of 110 degrees C, 130 degrees C and 150 degrees C, respectively. Both the evaporator and condenser area per unit power output using R600a/R601a are higher than that using pure R600a or R601a due to the reduction in the heat transfer coefficient and the temperature difference between the mixture working fluid and the heat source/sink. The total heat transfer area per unit power output increases to a maximum at an R600a mole fraction of 0.5 and then decreases with increasing R600a mole fraction. The total heat transfer area can be reduced for the same power output with higher geothermal source temperatures. The turbine using R600a/R601a with higher R600a mole fractions is nearly the same size as a turbine using pure R600a. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This simulation study applies the general framework described in BESTEST-EX for self-testing residential building energy model calibration methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's BEopt/DOE-2.2 is used to evaluate an automated regression metamodeling-based calibration approach in the context of monthly synthetic utility data for a 1960s-era existing home in a cooling-dominated climate. The home's model inputs are assigned probability distributions representing uncertainty ranges, pseudo-random selections are made from the uncertainty ranges to define "explicit" input values, and synthetic utility billing data are generated using the explicit input values. A central composite design is used to develop response surface statistical models for the home's predicted energy use. Applying a gradient-based simulated annealing optimization algorithm to the statistical "metamodels", the calibration approach systematically adjusts values of the design variables and reduces disagreement between predicted energy use and synthetic utility billing data. Various retrofit measures are applied and used to assess accuracy of retrofit savings predictions resulting from using the calibration procedure. Substituting actual BEopt/DOE-2.2 model simulations with the statistical models reduces overall calibration procedure run-time while sacrificing only a limited degree of accuracy for retrofit savings predictions.

Abstract: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) are considered to be a better alternative for conventional vehicles in the matter of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and urban air pollution reduction. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely used methodology to quantify and compare the environmental impacts of vehicle technologies. In this study, we compare the life cycle environmental emissions of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matters (PM) of the BEV with the petrol and diesel vehicles. Unlike many other literatures, this study uses the real-world energy consumption data for the environmental assessment. In addition, this study explores the possible impact of the short term and long term fluctuations in the electricity mix and the vehicle charging profile, on the life cycle emissions performance of BEV. The influence of charging profile on the well-to-tank (WTT) emissions (i.e. emissions associated with electricity production) of BEV is discussed by using hourly emissions and different possible peak and off-peak charging time frames. The results of this study proves off-peak charging is a better option to reduce the life cycle emissions, compared to peak charging. When a BEV is charged during off-peak hours instead of peak hours, the well-to-tank CO2, SO2, NOx and PM emissions per km can be reduced significantly. Also, this study emphasizes the importance of taking driving behaviors of users and auxiliary energy consumption into account. This aspect is analyzed by comparing the empirical energy consumption and the corresponding WTT emissions of BEV, with the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard values. The results reveal that the auxiliary energy consumption is responsible for, nearly a third of the WIT emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study is aimed to investigate the combined application of diesel methanol dual fuel (DMDF) and a simple after-treatment for reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions of a diesel engine. The effects of DMDF, a double diesel oxidation catalyst (DDOC) and a DOC closely coupled with a particulate oxidation catalyst (POC) in series (DPOC) on smoke emissions, particulate mass and number concentrations and size distributions were analyzed. Tests were conducted on a 4-cylinder turbo-charged, inter-cooling, mechanical in-line fuel injection pump diesel engine modified to DMDF combustion mode. Testing results showed that, before the DDOC and the DPOC, the dry-soot and smoke opacity efficiency decreases with the increase of substitution ratio of methanol at high engine load. There is a significant decrease of smoke opacity in DMDF mode after the DDOC, while the DPOC has a significant effect on the reduction in dry-soot emission. There is an average reduction in dry-soot by 25% in pure diesel fuel mode after the DDOC, while in DMDF mode, the average reduction is more than 60%, and the maximum reduction in dry-soot is up to 96%. There is a slightly reduction in PM emissions at low substitution ratio of methanol, while the high substitution ratio of methanol leads to more reduction in PM emissions. After the DDOC and the DPOC, particulate number and mass concentrations, especially nuclear particles, can be significantly reduced when the exhaust gas temperature is enough high.

Abstract: Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is a promising alternative for generating renewable energy. One of the most prominent CSP technologies is the central receiver tower with heliostat field, which has received attention in the last decade due to its high achievable temperatures and potential cost reduction. In order to make this technology economically viable, research has been focused on the solar field, solar receiver, energy storage and power block. The power block is one of the important components since improving system efficiency leads to reductions in the storage, solar field and receiver sizes and costs. Recently, supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles have emerged as an alternative for power block with central receiver tower systems due to higher thermal efficiencies and compactness compared to traditional steam Rankine cycles. In this paper, detailed energy and exergy analysis of four different supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle configurations (Simple Brayton cycle, Recompression Brayton cycle, Partial cooling with recompression and Recompression with main compression intercooling) were performed with and without reheat. Prior the compressor inlet, dry air cooler is used for all supercritical Brayton cycles studied in this paper. A solar receiver, replacing the heater and reheater for conventional Brayton cycles, is also used to provide heat input to the cycles. The simulations were carried out for Alice Springs (Australia) solar conditions and optimum operating conditions of the supercritical cycle were obtained by optimising the first law thermodynamic efficiency.
The effect of turbine inlet temperature and the cycle configuration on the thermal performance and exergy destruction was analysed.
The results showed that the thermal efficiency of the supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle increases monotonically with the temperature of the cycle. The recompression cycle with main compression intercooling achieved the best thermal performance (eta(1) = 55.2% at 850 degrees C). The detailed exergy analysis also showed that the solar receiver has the highest exergy destruction (>68%) while turbines and compressors have minimal contribution (less than 3%). Furthermore, it is noted that the exergy efficiency has a bell shaped curve, reaching at maximum value between 700-750 degrees C depending on the cycle configuration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Effective ground thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance, which are key parameters in the design of borehole heat exchangers (BHEs), are often determined on the basis of in-situ thermal response tests.(TRTs). However, many disturbance factors can affect the accuracy of a TRT, e.g., voltage fluctuations from the power grid and oscillating external environments where a TRT rig is installed. Interpretation of TRT data is often done using the infinite line source (ILS) model, combined with the sequential plot method, because it is not only simple but also provides additional information about the estimation behavior and convergence. However, estimation behavior using the sequential method tends to fluctuate over time because the constant heat flux assumption is always violated as a result of the disturbance factors. As an alternative, a temporal superposition applied analytical model can be used in a recursive curve fitting manner, but this method cannot provide the additional information that sequential method can. In this study, as a solution for interpreting disturbed TRT data and to utilize additional information from the sequential plot method, we proposed an alternative method using a temporal superposition applied ILS model combined with the quasi-Newton optimization method. To verify the effectiveness, the proposed method was applied to in-situ TRTs and the results were compared with those from the conventional method in terms of the estimation stability and convergence speed. The results showed that, compared to the conventional sequential method using the ILS model, the proposed method yielded standard deviations for the effective thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance that were at least six times and four times lower, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method was able to achieve about four times faster convergence speeds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In a full-scale anaerobic digestion plant, agricultural residues are generally converted into biogas and digestate, the latter usually produced in large amount. Generally, biogas is converted into heat, often lost, and electricity, which is completely valorized or it is sold to the public grid. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility to combine anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis processes in order to increase the energy recovery from agricultural residues and the sustainability of the anaerobic digestion plant. Results revealed that heat excess produced during anaerobic digestion could cover the drying needs for the solid digestate, while pyrolysis of digestate at 500 degrees C resulted in 8.8 wt.%, 58.4 wt.% and 32.8 wt.% of syngas, oil and char, respectively. The LHV of syngas was 15.7 MJ N m(-3), whereas pyrolysis oil exhibited a HHV of 23.5 MJ kg(-1) after water extraction. The hybrid system operating in symbiosis could increase the production of electricity from 9896 kWh(el) day(-1) to 14,066 kWh(el) day(-1) corresponding to an increase of 42% compared to AD stand-alone plant.

Abstract: In integrated steel works, byproduct gases are generated in the iron and steel making process, which accounts for approximately 30% of the total energy involved. The efficient utilisation of these gases is significant for energy saving and CO2 reduction in the iron and steel industry. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was proposed to optimise the byproduct gas management for the minimisation of operation costs and the efficient usage of energy. Compared with previous models, this proposed model considered the influence of the boiler penalty factor (BPF) and gasholder penalty factor (GPF) on optimisation results. The sum of the standard deviation volume (SSDV) and total switching times (TST) are defined to evaluate the effect of penalty factors on gasholder and boiler stability. The results of a case study indicate that the SSDV and TST are sensitive to the GPF and BPF, i.e., penalty factors have a large impact on optimisation results. Because the SSDV and TST are two confronted variables, Pareto optimality was applied to identify reasonable penalty factors which were used in the MILP model to obtain reasonable optimisation of the byproduct gas system. The optimisation results demonstrate that, compared with manual operation, the planning of the optimal distribution of byproduct gases proposed in this study can reduce the fluctuation of the volume of the gasholders and the load of the boilers to make the operation of the byproduct gas system safe and stable. Furthermore, according to sensitivity analysis, the stability of gasholders and boilers are sensitive to electricity price change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, the pressure influence on the MILD combustion process and on emissions is examined. Experiments were performed in a combustion chamber based on the reverse flow configuration to enhance mixing of fresh and burnt gases. First, investigations under atmospheric pressure were performed to determine the regime of jointly low NOx and CO emissions. Afterwards, the effects of burnt gas recirculation and mixing under ambient pressure were evaluated by decreasing the inlet nozzle diameter without changing the residence time. In the second step, measurements were conducted under higher pressure while keeping the mass flow rates constant. Thereby, the tesidence time is extended, the NOx formation chemistry is changed. These effects result in a strong rise in NOx emissions and simulations indicate that at higher pressure a flame is established at the nozzle exit for higher equivalence ratios. In order to decrease the Damkohler number and shift the combustion process to the well-stirred reactor regime, the inlet nozzle diameter was decreased without changing the residence time. Thereby, burnt gas recirculation and gas mixing is enhanced, while simultaneously extending the chemical time scales. A significant decrease in NOx emissions was detected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The effect of alkali and alkali earth metals (AAEMs) on yields of hydrocarbons from catalytic pyrolysis of biomass was investigated. Experiments were performed in a tandem micro-reactor that segregates the biomass from the zeolite catalyst (ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis). It was found that even trace amounts of AAEMs added to cellulose as acetate salts dramatically reduced the yields of hydrocarbons. Both the concentration and types of AAEM salts impacted product distribution. The yield of aromatics and olefins decreased monotonically with increasing concentration of AAEMs. The effect of AAEMs on reducing hydrocarbon yields followed the order: K+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+. Two pretreatments of biomass were investigated to alleviate the catalytic effects of AAEMs that naturally occurs in biomass: acid-washing and acid-infusion. It was found that pretreated biomass increased yields of hydrocarbons apparently by suppressing reactions that would otherwise convert carbohydrate to non-condensable gases and char.

Abstract: A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is presented for the optimal design of the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) power system. The model was formulated in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), which is a mathematical modeling language for programming and optimization. Previous studies have either focused on the estimation of the UAE's energy demands or the simulation of the operation of power technologies to plan future electricity supply. However, these studies have used international simulation tools such as "MARKAL" and "MESSAGE"; whereas the present work presents an optimization model. The proposed design optimization model can be used to estimate the most suitable combination of power plants under CO2 emission and alternative energy targets, carbon tax, and social benefits of air emissions avoidance. Although the proposed model was used to estimate the future power infrastructure in the UAE, the model includes several standard power technologies; thus, it can be extended to other countries. The proposed optimization model was verified using historical data of the UAE power sector operation in the year 2011. Likewise, the proposed model was used to study the 2020 UAE power sector operations under three scenarios: domestic vs. international natural gas prices (considering different carbon tax levels), social benefits of using low emission power technologies (e.g., renewable and nuclear), and CO2 emission constraints. The results show that the optimization model is a practical tool for designing the UAE power infrastructure, evaluating future production technologies and scenarios, and identifying key parameters affecting the UAE power sector.

Abstract: In this work, two options are investigated to enhance the economics of the catalytic production of bioethanol from biomass gasification by exploiting the excess of CO2 emission saving: (i) to import fossil energy, in the form of natural gas and electricity or (ii) to trade CO2 emissions. To this end, an integrated life cycle and economic assessment is carried out for four process configurations, each using a different light hydrocarbon reforming technology: partial oxidation, steam methane reforming, tar reforming and autothermal reforming. The results show that for all process configurations the production of bioethanol and other alcohols significantly increases when natural gas displaces biomass, maintaining the total energy content of the feedstock. The economic advantage of the partial substitution of biomass by natural gas depends on their prices and this is explored by carrying out a sensitivity analysis, taking historical prices into account. It is also concluded that the trade of CO2 emissions is not cost-competitive compared to the import of natural gas if the CO2 emission price remains within historical European prices. The CO2 emission price would have to double or even quadruple the highest CO2 historical price for CO2 emission trading to be a cost-competitive option. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Following a literature survey which shows the existence of large variations among studies in the construction of energy security indexes, this paper proposes a framework with a composite index and three sub-indexes for evaluating Singapore's energy security. The sub-indexes capture the economic, energy supply chain and environmental dimensions of energy security. A total of 22 indicators, normalised using the banding approach, are aggregated to form the sub-indexes and the composite index referred to as the Singapore Energy Security Index (SESI). These indexes are generated for selected years from 1990 to 2010. The results show that Singapore's energy security has remained fairly stable throughout the period. Further analysis shows that the energy supply chain and environmental sub-indexes have improved, but the improvement was offset by the decline in the economical sub-index. The proposed framework allows quick identification of deficiencies within the Singapore's energy supply chain in the context of energy security by pinpointing its main weaknesses. It is particularly suitable for quantifying energy security of countries that are highly dependent on energy imports to meet their energy requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Colorless distributed combustion (CDC) has been shown to offer enhanced combustor performance for stationary gas turbine application with near zero emissions, high combustion intensity and efficiency, thermal field uniformity, and enhanced stability. Mixture preparation to form hot and low oxygen concentration environment paves the path to achieve CDC conditions. In this paper, a new approach of air dilution in partially premixed combustion conditions is employed and the results compared to premixed and non-premixed injection of air and fuel. Portion of the fuel is introduced in the air stream and portion of the air is introduced in the fuel stream such that the local equivalence ratios for each stream is well outside the flammability limit to eliminate flashback and instabilities. The experimental data demonstrated ultra-low emissions with this injection scheme. At equivalence ratio of 0.6, NO emission was 63% lower than non-premixed combustion mode. Also NO emission was similar to the premixed combustion with the advantage of eliminating flashback and flame instabilities that often prevail in premixed combustion conditions. Dilution provided 50% CO reduction as compared to non-premixed combustion. Numerical simulations, validated through Particle Image Velocimetry, were performed to outline the mixing process in each of the three cases. The methane mixture fraction prior to ignition, determined numerically, was found to be one half of that for the non-premixed case and close to that of the premixed case. This enhanced mixture preparation, associated with the new air and fuel dilution technique, resulted in reduced emission. Also the jet momentum ratio (between both streams) is enhanced, mainly due to the air addition to the fuel stream, to result in better mixing and a better reaction distribution for ultra-low emissions. Further reduction of NOx is expected with improved distributed combustion condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A promising method of methane conversion by thermal plasma is presented. It allows syngas production with a set H-2/CO ratio of similar to 2.1 and with a similar to 95.2% H-2 + CO content. In comparison with other plasma methods, it differs in its high methane conversion level (91-98.3%), low energy consumption (31.8-35.9 MJ/kg) of converted methane and high selectivity on H-2 and CO. The influence of energy consumption and oxidizer excess on the key parameters of the process is studied. It is found that with a weak influence of heat losses and a volumetric flow of thermal energy (similar to 1 MW/m(3)), the optimum energy consumption is approximately 25.5-27.1 MJ/kg of injected methane and the optimum excess of oxidizer is 0-10%. The principal cause of the differences in experimental and calculated values is the wall influence (heat losses). The economic efficiency by combining the method and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is estimated for the USA, and the profits of end-product sales have exceeded the expenses by similar to 67%.

Abstract: This paper provides a production and consumption-based empirical macroeconomic-climate assessment of Sweden's CO2 emissions. The core methodology is based on three complementary quantitative methods, namely energy-economy-environment indicators, econometric analyses, and a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) sectoral model. Based on the latest available data (1971-2011), indicators show a sharp decarbonisation of Sweden's energy supply mix pre-1990, and reductions or reversals in energy intensity, CO2 intensity and energy use post-1990. Reductions in energy intensity are mostly attributed to substantial increases in economic activity rather than reductions in energy use. Econometric results show that variability of CO2 emissions is best explained by CO2 intensity than any other tested variable. The MRIO model shows that the Swedish emissions trading balance is negative with both the European Union and the rest of the world (i.e. embodied CO2 emissions in imports are higher than embodied emissions in exports). Sweden's low-carbon intensity is a critical and horizontal explanatory factor in our results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Shale gas, due to its clean-burning and efficient nature, is becoming an increasingly promising alternative energy resource, It is commonly held that promoting shale gas development will gradually play a significant role in meeting the energy needs of economic and social development as well as reducing harm to the environment. Given the significant implications, many countries are pursuing shale gas opportunities. However, numerous concerns have been raised about the economics of shale gas development, as it is difficult to evaluate. Accurately evaluating the economic viability of shale gas development to reduce investment risks and increase investment opportunity is the key issue that needs to be urgently addressed. This paper presents a systematic review and examination of the technical and economic evaluation techniques for the development of shale gas to provide an overview of their current status. Over time, some progress has been made in existing technical-economic evaluation techniques. It is worth noting that these techniques need to be further improved to more precisely assess the economic feasibility of developing shale gas for assisting investment decisions effectively. For this reason, various potentially useful ideas and approaches are presented to propose some potential improvement in evaluation techniques for shale gas development, which may materialize in possible future trends.

Abstract: The increasing demand on electric grids to support high penetrations of intermittent renewables, enhance power quality, increase reliability and resiliency, and provide ancillary services, is leading to local power generation on both sides of the meter. This paper describes the potential attributes of deploying 10-100 MW scale clusters of fuel cells installed at distribution substations to enable electric grid support through the provision of baseload and various levels of load following services. Such deployments, referred herein as Transmission Integrated Grid Energy Resource (TIGER) Stations, can also contribute to achieving air quality and climate goals through several high value attributes including high efficiency, ultra-low pollutant emissions, and near zero acoustic emissions. To quantitatively assess these benefits, a 5 GW deployment of TIGER Stations in the California electric system was analyzed using the Holistic Grid Resource Integration and Deployment (HiGRID) model at 33%, 43%, and 50% renewable penetration. The analysis establishes that (1) TIGER Stations have the potential to reduce carbon emissions and NOx emissions even when operated as baseload systems, and (2) TIGER Station load following capability is important for continued carbon emission reductions at higher renewable penetrations. Additional features of TIGER Stations, such as heat recovery or hybrid cycles, will further increase the attributes of TIGER Stations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Wind turbines are an energy conversion system having a low density on the territory, and therefore needing accurate condition monitoring in the operative phase. Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems have become ubiquitous in wind energy technology and they pose the challenge of extracting from them simple and explanatory information on goodness of operation and performance. In the present work, post processing methods are applied on the SCADA measurements of two onshore wind farms sited in southern Italy. Innovative and meaningful indicators of goodness of performance are formulated. The philosophy is a climax in the granularity of the analysis: first, Malfunctioning Indexes are proposed, which quantify goodness of merely operational behavior of the machine, irrespective of the quality of output. Subsequently the focus is shifted to the analysis of the farms in the productive phase: dependency of farm efficiency on wind direction is investigated through the polar plot, which is revisited in a novel way in order to make it consistent for onshore wind farms. Finally, the inability of the nacelle to optimally follow meandering wind due to wakes is analysed through a Stationarity Index and a Misalignment Index, which are shown to capture the relation between mechanical behavior of the turbine and degradation of the power output.

Their analysis led to some very unfavourable comparisons with other energy technologies and concluded that, for three types of impact (depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, photochemical pollution, and terrestrial eco-toxicity), shale gas is 'worse' even than coal as an energy source for generating electricity; furthermore, uncertainties in input data mean that it might also be worse than coal for three additional impacts (on global warming, acidification, and human toxicity). One of their principal inferences is, therefore, that shale gas development in the UK should be subject to stringent environmental regulation, to ensure that it is only developed where it can be demonstrated to regulatory authorities on a well-by-well basis that these and other impacts can be minimized. The present commentary reassesses some of the conclusions reached by this published analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources gain an increased importance in commercial and industrial building design. Combined heat and power (CHP) units are considered as one of the key technologies for cost and emission reduction in buildings. In order to make optimal decisions on investment and operation for these technologies, detailed system models are needed. These models are often formulated as linear programming problems to keep computational costs and complexity in a reasonable range. However, CHP systems involve variations of the efficiency for large nameplate capacity ranges and in case of part load operation, which can be even of non-linear nature. Since considering these characteristics would turn the models into non-linear problems, in most cases only constant efficiencies are assumed. This paper proposes possible solutions to address this issue. For a mixed integer linear programming problem two approaches are formulated using binary and Special-Ordered-Set (SOS) variables. Both suggestions have been implemented into the optimization model DER-CAM to simulate investment decisions of CHP micro-turbines and CHP fuel cells with variable efficiencies. The approaches have further been applied successfully in a case study with four different commercial buildings. Comparison of the results between the standard version and the new approaches indicate that total annual system costs remain almost unchanged. System performance is subject to change and storage technologies become more important. Part load operation has mainly been found important for fuel cell units. The micro-turbine is found almost exclusively in full load, thus rendering the application of the new approaches for this technology unnecessary for the considered unit sizes and building types. The approach using binary variables was the most promising method to model variable efficiencies in terms of computational costs and results. It should especially be considered for specific fuel cell technologies. Further investigation on the impacts of this approach on the prediction of fuel cell and micro-turbine performance is suggested. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) is one of the solar thermal energy applications, which focuses sunlight to heat the heat transfer fluid (HTF) circulating through the receiver. Researchers have put forward several heat transfer models for PTCs, basing on laws of conservation. This paper summarized the one-dimensional (1-D) mathematical models under different assumptions and details for PTCs. All the heat transfer processes were considered: convection within the absorber, in the annulus and between the glass and ambient; conduction through glass cover, absorber and support brackets; radiation in the annulus and from the glass to the sky. Moreover, a simple algorithm was adopted to make the control equations linear and solve easily. The difference in accuracy for diverse 1-D models were presented and analyzed on the basis of the experimental data from Sandia National Laboratories. The 1-D models with various details were different in accuracy and complexity. It can choose an appropriate 1-D model under a certain condition, which can be used in investigating the thermal performance of a PTC. In addition, the most accurate 1-D model presented in this paper were precise enough compared with the three-dimensional (3-D) model from other paper. The average difference of outlet temperature between the most accurate simulation in this paper and test data was 0.65 degrees C, however it was 2.69 degrees C between the 3-D model and experiment results. The reason may be that there were more assumptions for 3-D models than 1-D models, therefore the error was bigger. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, an optimization model on optical performance of parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) systems is developed, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) method. Since the computing time of a single MCRT simulation is always very critical to the whole optimization process and even to the feasibility of the optimization analysis if it is very time-consuming. Therefore, a MCRT runtime reduction method (RRM) was firstly proposed, by making a reasonable trade-off between the computational accuracy and the computing cost. Subsequently, the RRM was checked using well known statistical indices, due to the random number generation in the MCRT simulation and the statistical nature of the MCRT methodology. It is very significant that the corresponding calculation amount and computing time of a PTC MCAT simulation reduce by orders of magnitude and thus make the whole population-based PSO optimization process relative much feasible. Then a preliminary PSO-MCRT optimization analysis was carried out for an existing PTC system with known optimal optical performance, as it can be used to compare with the optimization results directly and thus to validate the PSO-MCRT optimization model. It is revealed that optimization results agree well with the reference data (Cheng et al., 2014), proving that the PSO-MCRT method and model used in the present study are feasible and reliable. In addition, error analysis and some further studies based on this proposed model are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Assessments of global wave power have been receiving increasing attention currently; however, a characterization of the global resources that holistically consider the different temporal scales that influence wave climate (monthly and seasonal, interannual and long-term) is still lacking. Moreover, the debate around the global figure of available resource is still widely open. This study provides a new global wave power assessment using a dataset that covers the period from 1948 to 2008, which was corrected using altimetry data and validated with buoys in terms of wave power. This study characterizes the mean wave power globally as well as its monthly and seasonal variability. Furthermore, it provides a link with the most relevant climate indices globally. The effect of the interannual variability is especially noteworthy for the Northern Hemisphere, where the seasonality is strongest. Additionally, we detect decadal long-term changes and determine that natural variability could explain a few of the differences found between decades. Lastly, we provide an assessment of the global theoretical wave power that covers the last six decades, compare approaches and estimates, and discuss factors of discrepancy. The global offshore wave power is estimated at 32,000 TW h/yr, which is reduced to 16,000 TW h/yr when considering the direction of the energy. The historical average change is 580 TW h/decade. Our results indicate that the global natural variability could be a more relevant factor in the lifetime of wave farms than the historical long-term changes in wave energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In the electricity market, customers have many choices to reduce electricity cost if they can economically schedule their power consumption. Renewable hybrid system, which can explore solar or wind sources at low cost, is a popular choice for this purpose nowadays. In this paper optimal energy management for a grid-connected photovoltaic-battery hybrid system is proposed to sufficiently explore solar energy and to benefit customers at demand side. The management of power flow aims to minimize electricity cost subject to a number of constraints, such as power balance, solar output and battery capacity. With respect to demand side management, an optimal control method (open loop) is developed to schedule the power flow of hybrid system over 24 h, and model predictive control is used as a closed-loop method to dispatch the power flow in real-time when uncertain disturbances occur. In these two kinds of applications, optimal energy management solutions can be obtained with great cost savings and robust control performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced desalination cycle called "MEDAD" desalination which is a hybrid of the conventional multi-effect distillation (MED) and an adsorption cycle (AD). The combined cycles allow some of MED stages to operate below ambient temperature, as low as 5 degrees C in contrast to the conventional MED. The MEDAD cycle results in a quantum increase of distillate production at the same top-brine condition. Being lower than the ambient temperature for the bottom stages of hybrid cycle, ambient energy can now be scavenged by the MED processes whilst the AD cycle is powered by low temperature waste heat from exhaust or renewable sources.
In this paper, we present the experiments of a 3-stage MED and MEDAD plants. These plants have been tested at assorted heat source temperatures from 15 degrees C to 70 degrees C and with portable water as a feed. All system states are monitored including the distillate production and power consumption and the measured results are expressed in terms of performance ratio (PR). It is observed that the synergetic matching of MEDAD cycle led to a quantum increase in distillate production, up to 2.5 to 3 folds vis-a-vis to a conventional MED of the same rating.

Abstract: Gedeon streaming can considerably deteriorate the thermal efficiency of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine employing a loop configuration. Introducing a jet pump into the loop configuration is one of the effective ways to suppress Gedeon streaming. This paper focuses on the performance comparison between the jet pumps with rectangular and circular tapered channels, by numerically simulating and analyzing the time-averaged pressure drop induced by the jet pumps. Three parameters, i.e., the coefficient of time-averaged resistance, the coefficient of overall resistance, and the coefficient of effectiveness, are proposed to evaluate the performance of a jet pump. The emphasis is put on the effects of cross-sectional shape, thickness-to-diameter ratio, and rounding radius of the tapered channels. In absence of rounding the edge of the tapered channel, the jet pump with a rectangular tapered channel is more efficient to produce the time-averaged pressure drop at a large thickness-to-diameter ratio, while the jet pump with a circular tapered channel is more efficient at a small thickness-to-diameter ratio. However, it should be noted that the directions of the induced time-averaged pressure drops in these two cases are opposite. Rounding the edge of the small opening of the tapered channel can effectively improve jet pump's performance. Upon rounding, the jet pump with a circular tapered channel can produce a higher time-averaged pressure drop and work more efficiently than the one with a rectangular tapered channel.

Abstract: Marine hydrokinetic turbine, when operating in a shallow channel is subjected to the boundary proximity effects from a deformable free surface on top and the channel bottom. A close proximity of turbine to these boundaries modifies the flow-field around the turbine and affects device performance. Significant flow acceleration occurs in and around the turbine rotation plane; the magnitude of which depends on size of the turbine relative to the channel cross-section and is commonly referred to as solid blockage. In addition, the wake behind the turbine creates a restriction to the flow called wake blockage. We focus on unraveling the influence of boundary proximity and blockage on the turbine performance through coupled experimental and computational studies. The experiments were carried out in an open surface water channel with a three bladed, constant chord, untwisted marine hydrokinetic turbine submerged at different depths and performance was evaluated under various operating conditions. The findings were complimented by a steady state computational fluid dynamics study that was carried out to understand the effect of flow Reynolds number and solid blockage on the turbine performance. A reduction in tip-depth of immersion was observed to improve the turbine performance until it reached an optimum depth beyond which a reduction in performance was observed due to free surface interaction with wake and bypass region. A transient CFD analysis with volume of fluid approach was performed to incorporate free-surface and buoyancy effects and augment flow-field characterization behind the turbine in the wake, upper bypass, and lower bypass regions. For low tip clearance ratios, a significant drop (up to 5-10% of channel depth) in free surface was observed behind turbine with complex three dimensional flow structures that lead to a skewed wake affecting its expansion and restoration process.

Abstract: This paper presents the novel MILE formulation of the Biomass Value Chain Model (BVCM), a comprehensive and flexible optimisation toolkit that models a large number of bioenergy system pathways. The model accounts for the economic and environmental impacts associated with the end-to-end elements of a pathway: crop production, conversion technologies, transport, storage, local purchase, import (from abroad), sale and disposal of resources, as well as CO2 sequestration by CCS technologies and forestry. It supports decision-making around optimal use of land, biomass resources and technologies with respect to different objectives, scenarios and constraints. Objectives include minimising cost, maximising profit, minimising GHG emissions, maximising energy/exergy production or any combination of these. These objectives are combined with a number of scenarios (such as including different CO2 prices, different technology and climate scenarios, import scenarios, waste cost scenarios), different credits (e.g. by-product and end-product, CCS and forestry carbon sequestration) and a number of constraints such as minimum levels of energy production and maximum environmental impacts.
The toolkit includes an extensive database of different biomass technologies including pretreatment, densification, liquid and gaseous fuel production, heat and power generation (separately or combined, biodedicated or co-fired), waste-to-energy conversion and carbon capture and sequestration. A large number of resources are considered including a variety of bio-resources (e.g. energy crops such as Miscanthus and SRC willow, arable crops such as winter wheat, sugar beet and oilseed rape and short and long rotation forestry), intermediates, products, by-products and wastes:
The BVCM is a spatio-temporal model: currently it is configured for the UK using 157 square cells of length 50 km and the planning horizon is from the 2010s to the 2050s, with seasonal variations considered. The framework is data-driven so the model can be easily extended: for example adding new resources, technologies, transport modes, etc. or changing the time horizon and the location to another country is only a matter of changing the data. Results of example UK case studies are presented to demonstrate the functionality of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The objective of this research was to develop a new high-performance CO2 adsorbent with a simple method. Amine hybrid resorcinol-formaldehyde/silsesquioxane composite aerogel (AH-RFSA) was developed through polymeric sal-gel process and supercritical drying (SCD) technique. CO2 adsorption performances of AH-RFSA in 1% CO2 gas mixture (CO2 + N-2) were investigated. A rise in adsorption temperature negatively affects the total CO2 adsorption capacity of Al-RFSA. However, the useful adsorption capacity does not change with adsorption temperature. Water is more positive to useful CO2 adsorption capacity than to total CO2 adsorption capacity. The total CO2 adsorption capacity achieved with the new adsorbent at 30 degrees C under dry and humid 1% CO2 is 3.57 and 4.43 mmol/g, respectively. The useful CO2 adsorption capacity for complete removal of CO2 from 1% CO2 is as high as 3.56 mmol/g. The adsorbent preparation method is inspiring and its resulting adsorbent is exceptional in capacity and regenerability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Air-source transcritical CO2 heat pump systems have found attractive applications in automobile air conditioning, regional heating and commercial water heating systems. The coefficient of performance (COP) of such systems is affected by several operational variables, such as ambient temperatures, water outlet temperature, and discharge pressure. For practical operation, it is desirable to maintain the maximum achievable efficiency or COP of such systems in real time. However, performance of model based control/optimization strategies can be quite limited by the difficulty in acquiring accurate system models due to system nonlinearity, large variations in ambient conditions and thermal load, as well as equipment variation and degradation. In this study, a self-optimizing control scheme is proposed to maximize the COP in real time by using the extremum seeking control (ESC) strategy. ESC is a class of self-optimizing control strategy that can search for the unknown or slowly varying optimum input with respect to certain performance index, which is effectively a dynamic realization of the gradient search based on a dither-demodulation scheme. For the air-source transcritical CO2 heat-pump water heater, the discharge pressure setpoint is taken as the input to the ESC controller, while the system COP is taken as the performance index, i.e. the feedback signal for the extremum seeking process. To evaluate the proposed ESC strategy, a Modelica based dynamic simulation model is developed for the plant to perform the simulation study. Simulations are conducted for several scenarios: a fixed operation condition, change of the water outlet temperature setpoint, change of ambient condition, and changes of both the ambient temperature and water outlet temperature setpoint. For all simulation cases, the water inlet temperature is fixed at 12 degrees C, the ambient temperature is assumed to range from -15 degrees C to -35 degrees C, while the water outlet temperature ranges from 55 degrees C to 80 degrees C. Simulation results show that ESC is able to search and even track both fixed and slowly varying optimum COP without need for system model. Significant recovery of energy efficiency can thus be obtained for practical operation of such systems in a nearly model-free fashion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper describes a quasi-steady-state simulation model for predicting the transient behavior of a two-door household refrigerator subjected to periodic door opening and evaporator frosting. A semi-empirical steady-state model was developed for the refrigeration loop, whereas a transient model was devised to predict the energy and mass transfer into and within the refrigerated compartments, and also the frost build-up on the evaporator. The key empirical heat and mass transfer parameters required by the model were derived from a set of experiments performed in-house in a climate-controlled chamber. In general, it was found that the model predictions followed closely the experimental trends for the power consumption (deviations within 10%) and for the compartment temperatures (deviations within +/- 2 K) when the doors are opened periodically and frost is allowed to accumulate over the evaporator.

Abstract: In this paper, the development of a general framework for building level power demand forecasting and its applications to supervisory control and demand management are presented. Models of thermal loads, while rigorous and insightful, do not directly extrapolate to measures of power consumption and cannot be easily applied to a variety of buildings. Ultimately, building operators are interested in managing power consumption as energy costs and opportunities are directly related to the power variable. Our work develops Auto-Regressive models with eXogeneous inputs (ARX) to forecast power demand in conjunction with existing physics based modeling approaches and enhances the current control framework for building energy management. The main contributions of this work are identifying and incorporating building level measurements as inputs, and evaluating the use of power forecast models for supervisory control and demand response (DR). The move towards a smarter grid is expected to provide extensive data on building conditions and power consumption, which we can include in the model development. Options for model inputs and outputs are investigated depending on possible measurements, and their effect (or sensitivity) on the modeling and decision making processes are evaluated. It is shown that an appropriate selection of exogenous inputs related to the control action is necessary to capture the effect of common demand management practices such as precooling. The forecasting capabilities are also demonstrated on a simplified building model and on data collected from a real building. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermically treated graphene oxides (TT-GOs) are synthesized at different temperatures, 100 degrees C, 150 degrees C, 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C in a reducing environment (20% H-2/He) and investigated as electrode materials for vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) applications. The treated graphene oxide-based electrodes are prepared by the wet impregnation method using carbon felt (CF) as support. The main aim is to achieve a suitable distribution of the dispersed graphene oxides on the CF surface in order to investigate the electrocatalytic activity for the VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox reactions in the perspective of a feasible large area electrodes scale-up for battery configuration of practical interest. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are carried out in a three electrode half-cell to characterize the electrochemical properties of the TT-GO-based electrodes. Physico-chemical characterizations are carried out to corroborate the electrochemical results. The TT-GO sample treated at 100 degrees C (TT-GO-100) shows the highest electrocatalytic activity in terms of peak to peak separation (Delta E = 0.03 V) and current density intensity (similar to 0.24 A cm(-2) at 30 mV/s) both toward the VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox reactions. This result is correlated to the presence of hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH) species that act as active sites. A valid candidate is individuated as effective anode and cathode electrode in the perspective of electrodes scale-up for battery configuration of practical interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A fast power demand response (DR) strategy involving both active and passive cold storages is presented. This control strategy provides an immediate and stepped power demand reduction through shutting chiller(s) down when requested. The results show that the power demand reduction and building indoor temperature during the DR event can be predicted accurately. The power demand reduction is stable which is more predictable for the grid management. The building indoor temperature rise is restrained and indoor thermal comfort is improved through use of a small scale active storage system during the DR event. The incentive bought by an existing DR program is used to calculate the economic benefit of the demand reduction controlled by the developed fast DR strategy. In addition, an electricity price structure in South China is introduced to calculate the cost saving potentials of the active storages, when a storage-priority control is used to shift peak demand in normal days. The results show that small scale active storages can also offer significant life-cycle cost saving for building demand management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Today's major developments in the production and demand of electricity in domestic areas make it increasingly important that domestic electricity demand can respond to the availability of electricity. Energy management systems and smart appliances can facilitate this by supporting the user to shift electricity demand of appliances to moments in time when electricity is abundantly available. However, the benefits resulting from domestic demand response depend on household acceptance and behaviour change. This paper explores the real electricity demand shift of households in time and the role of smart appliances to bring about this shift. A longitudinal study was conducted among Dutch households over a period of one year. The households received a dynamic electricity tariff, an energy management system and a smart washing machine. Results show that households shift their usage of the smart washing machine mostly to the day when the sun is shining and electricity is produced by their own solar panels. Households who regularly used automation of the smart washing machine, which implicates that the use of the washing machine is automatically shifted to time periods where electricity supply is abundantly available, were more likely to shift their electricity usage. Furthermore, during the course of one year, the results remained stable, indicating a structural shift in demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: China's cement industry is the world's largest and is one of the largest energy consuming, and GHG and air pollutant emitting industries. Actions to improve energy efficiency by best available technology can often bring co-benefits for climate change and air quality through reducing emissions of GHGs and air pollutants emission. In this study, the energy conservation supply curves (ECSC) combined with the GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies) was used to estimate the co-benefits of energy savings on CO2 and air pollutants emission for implementing co-control options of energy efficiency measures and end-of-pipe options in the China's cement industry for the period 2011-2030. Results show that there are large co-benefits of improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions of CO2 and air pollutants for the China's cement industry during the study period. The cost-effective energy saving potential (EEP1 scenario) and its costs is estimated to be 3.0 EJ and 4.1 billion $ in 2030. The technical energy savings potential (EEP2 scenario) and its costs amount to 4.2 EJ and 8.4 billion $ at the same time. Compared to the baseline scenario, energy efficiency measures can help decrease 5% of CO2, 3% of PM, 15% of SO2, and 12% of NOx emissions by 2030 in EEP1 scenario. If we do not consider costs (EEP2 scenario), energy efficiency measures can further reduce 3% of CO2, 2% of PM, 10% of SO2, and 8% of NOx by 2030. Overall, the average marginal costs of energy efficiency measures will decrease by 20%, from 1.48 $/GJ to 1.19 $/GJ, when taking into account avoided investments in air pollution control measures. Therefore, implementation of energy efficiency measures is more cost-effective than a solely end-of-pipe based policy. The plant managers and end users can consider using energy efficiency measures to reach new air pollutants emission standards in China's cement industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The Dual Hot-Gas Bypass Defrosting (DHBD) cycle is an effective defrosting method compared to a Reverse Cycle Defrosting (RCD) method to remove frost from the outdoor heat exchanger (HEX) of an air-to-air heat pump, especially the outdoor temperature is above 0 degrees C. However, the DHBD method has a drawback when the heat pump operates in cold outdoor environment, below 0 degrees C due to rapid decrease in refrigerant temperature followed by lower hot-gas bypass temperature. In order to overcome lower discharge temperature of compressor, a combined defrosting cycle with DHBD and the accumulator heating method is developed. An induction heater (IH) is adopted as the accumulator heater. The dynamic performance and defrosting time are compared between the conventional RCD method and the combined DHBD-IH method using a medium size air-to-air heat pump of 16 kW under the condition of -5 degrees C outdoor temperature. Due to the additional heater, the combined DHBD-IH method sustained higher discharge temperature of the compressor and reduced 15% of the defrosting time than that of the RCD method with nonstop indoor heating operation. The overall heating capacity of the DHBD-IH cycle including defrosting mode was 2.5 kW higher than that of the RCD cycle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Integration of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in coal gasification power plant technology would be one of the most promising technology in the coal utilization for power generation. The clean syngas from gas cleanup unit serves as fuel for SOFC in integrated gasification fuel cell power plant. The heat generated by SOFC can be utilized by heat recovery steam generator to drive steam turbine for electricity production. In this study, proposed plants consisting of coal gasifier and SOFC on the top of a steam turbine (ST), called light integrated gasification fuel cell (L-IGFC), are investigated thermodynamically by using Aspen Plus software to evaluate their performance. The analyses are based on the SOFC module considering ohmic, activation and concentration ldsses at a certain current density of the cell operating at the intermediate temperature. The influences of gas cleanup unit models were also investigated. The results indicated that the proposed atmospheric L-IGFC plant could achieve electrical efficiency in the range of 39-46.35% in lower heating value. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study a micro-combined-heat-and-power (micro-CHP) system is coupled to a vapor-compression heat pump to fulfill the residential needs for heating (space heating and water heating) and electricity in detached single-family households in Denmark. Such a combination is assumed to be attractive for application, since both fuel cell technology and electric heat pumps are found to be two of the most efficient technologies for generation/conversion of useful energy. The micro-CHP system is fueled with natural gas and includes a fuel cell stack, a fuel processor and other auxiliary components. The micro-CHP system assumes heat-led operation, to avoid dumping of heat and the use of complicated thermal energy storage. The overall system is grid-interconnected to allow importing and exporting of electricity as necessary. In this study emphasis is given on the operational characterization of the system. The variational loads are considered from full to quarter load, and the micro-CHP system is optimized in terms of operating thermophysical parameters for every different load. The results clearly indicate the capability of the proposed system to perform efficiently throughout all necessary load changes to fulfill the residential load profile. The average net electrical efficiency and average total system efficiency are 0.380 and 0.815, respectively. However cost analysis shows that certain synergies are necessary to allow the proposed system to make an entry to the energy market as a possible candidate to replace heat pump-only equipped households.

Abstract: This paper provides a review on the most relevant research works conducted to solve natural gas transportation problems via pipeline systems. The literature reveals three major groups of gas pipeline systems, namely gathering, transmission, and distribution systems. In this work, we aim at presenting a detailed discussion of the efforts made in optimizing natural gas transmission lines.
There is certainly a vast amount of research done over the past few years on many decision-making problems in the natural gas industry and, specifically, in pipeline network optimization. In this work, we present a state-of-the-art survey focusing on specific categories that include short-term basis storage (line-packing problems), gas quality satisfaction (pooling problems), and compressor station modeling (fuel cost minimization problems). We discuss both steady-state and transient optimization models highlighting the modeling aspects and the most relevant solution approaches known to date.
Although the literature on natural gas transmission system problems is quite extensive, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive review or survey covering this specific research area on natural gas transmission from an operations research perspective. The paper includes a discussion of the most important and promising research areas in this field. Hence, this paper can serve as a useful tool to gain insight into the evolution of the many real-life applications and most recent advances in solution methodologies arising from this exciting and challenging research area of decision-making problems.

Abstract: Battery storage technologies have developed to the point that some are mature enough to serve as a generation resource. However, whether a battery can generate profits by interacting solely in energy markets is unclear. Meanwhile, FERC order 784 requires electricity exchange markets in the U.S. to install the necessary technical equipment for batteries to supply ancillary services [12]. We suggest that current economic studies on the battery energy storage system (ESS) are limited because they do not explore possibilities to use battery storage in ancillary (reserve) markets. Applying battery ESS to ancillary service could be profitable enough to cover investment costs.
In this study, we consider a battery storage operator's best strategy each day, using backwards induction. We analyze the storage device as an exhaustible resource with a limited number of charging cycles and operating years. Based on this approach, we build a revenue model to maximized the net present value of the battery energy storage system revenues by applying the three-staged-method employed by Shcherbakova et al. [14]. We found that the battery in unable to cover its costs, and it does not use all the cycles available in its lifetime. This result, however, may be a function of the limits of our analytical approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Agricultural woody residues are available in massive quantities and provide a considerable potential for energy production. However, to encourage environmentally sustainable bioenergy strategies, it is necessary to assess the environmental performance of each specific bioenergy chain. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is recognized to be one of the best methodologies to evaluate the environmental burdens of bioenergy chains. The application of LCA to bioenergy from agricultural residues requires practitioners to make choices on how to interpret agricultural residues (i.e. by-products or co-products) and on how to allocate emissions among the different products generated along the bioenergy chain. These are among the most debated issues in the LCA community, given their potentially large influence on final LCA outcomes. A uniform consensus on these issues is still lacking, and no single method is equally suitable for all solutions.
The aim of this paper is to assess how different ways of agricultural residue interpretation and different allocation methods (both of upstream and downstream emissions), affect the environmental performance of bioenergy production fed by agricultural residues. In order to address the issue, we perform a full attributional LCA of the electricity production in a combustion combined heat and power plant (CHP) fed with woody residues from apple orchards (AWRs), as a case study. Bioelectricity production from CHP fed with agricultural residues is a good example of a multifunctional process, since multiple products (e.g. grain, fruit, straw, wood, etc.) and energy (e.g. heat and power) are co-produced along the whole chain. We solve the bioenergy system into two different ways, depending on the interpretation of AWRs as by-products or co-products, and we apply different allocation methods, partitioning the impacts according to different features of the co-products (mass, energy, exergy and economic value). The study focuses on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative energy demand, but other impact categories are investigated as well. The environmental impacts from two conventional fossil fuel systems are used to benchmark the environmental performance of the agricultural bio-energy chain. Our results show how different allocations, and especially allocation choices on upstream processes, can turn a benefit (i.e. a positive saving) to a disadvantage (i.e. an increased impact) and vice versa. Indeed, when AWRs are interpreted as a by-product or when upstream emissions are allocated on an economic base, the bioenergy chain guarantees significant GHG saving (up to 97%), primary energy demand reduction (up to 97%) and lower environmental impacts compared to the Italian non-renewable electricity grid mix. But, in the case of mass allocation of upstream emissions, the savings of GHG emissions and energy requirements drop to only 53% and 56%, respectively, and the figures of the bioenergy systems are similar or even worse than the fossil reference system for the majority of the other impact categories.

Abstract: Energy management system (EMS) within buildings has always been one of the main approaches for an automated demand side management (DSM). These energy management systems are supposed to increase load flexibility to fit more the generation from renewable energies and micro co-generation devices. For EMS to operate efficiently, it must learn ahead about the available supply and demand so that it can work on supply-demand matching and minimizing the imports from the grid and running costs. This article presents a simple efficient day-ahead electrical load prediction approach for any EMS. In comparison to other approaches, the presented algorithm was designed to be apart of any generic EMS and it does not require to be associated with a prepared statistical or historical databases, or even to get connected to any kinds of sensors. The proposed algorithm was tested over the data of 25 households in Austria and the results have shown an error range that goes down to 8.2% as an initial prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of building energy systems integrated with renewable energy systems requires essentially more intelligent scheduling strategy. The energy systems often have strong nonlinear characteristics and have discrete working ranges. The mixed-integer nonlinear programming approach is used to solve their optimal scheduling problems of energy systems in building integrated with energy generation and thermal energy storage in this study. The optimal scheduling strategy minimizes the overall operation cost day-ahead, including operation energy cost and cost concerning the plant on/off penalty. A case study is conducted to validate the proposed strategy based on the Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building. Four scenarios are investigated and compared to exam the performance of the optimal scheduling. Results show that the strategy can reduce operation energy cost greatly (about 25%) compared with a rule-based strategy and the reduction is even increased to about 47% when a thermal energy storage system is used. The strategy can also reduce the on/off frequency of chillers significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A spiral reactor is proposed as a novel reactor design for biodiesel production under supercritical conditions. Since the spiral reactor serves as a heat exchanger, it offers the advantage of reduced apparatus space compared to conventional supercritical equipment. Experimental investigations were carried out at reaction temperatures of 270-400 degrees C, pressure of 20 MPa, oil-to-ethanol molar ratio of 1:40, and reaction times of 3-30 min. An FAEE yield of 0.937 mol/mol was obtained in a short reaction time of 30 min at 350 degrees C and oil-to-ethanol molar ratio of 1:40 under a reactor pressure of 20 MPa. The spiral reactor was not only as effective as conventional reactor in terms of transesterification reactor but also was superior in terms of heat recovery. A second-order kinetic model describing the transesterification of canola oil in supercritical ethanol was proposed, and the reaction was observed to follow Arrhenius behavior. The corresponding reaction rate constants and the activation energies as well as pre-exponential factors were determined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Microturbines (MGTs) are power generation devices showing very interesting performance in terms of low environmental impact, high-grade waste heat and very low maintenance cost. One of the main issues that affect the output of MGTs is their strong sensibility to inlet air temperature. Both in literature and in practical applications, several solutions have been applied to control the inlet air conditions and reduce the sensibility of this kind of machines to ambient conditions. One of the most interesting technology is the refrigerating vapour compression technique. This solution has already been used for medium/large GTs, but there are very limited inlet air cooling applications on MGTs and few experimental data are documented. This paper describes a test bench that has been designed to apply the direct vapour expansion technique to a 100 kWe MGT and reports the power and efficiency augmentation of the machine when operating in hot summer days.
The chiller was designed to treat the MGT's air flow rate under specific working conditions and cool the inlet air temperature down to 15 degrees C. Thanks to the reduction of the inlet air temperature, the MGT showed a benefit in terms of electric power gain up to 8% with respect to the nominal power output in ISO conditions while the electric efficiency increased by 1.5%. Results indicate that an almost linear trend can be obtained both in the electric power increase and in the electric efficiency increase as a function of the inlet air temperature when the chiller operates under nominal working conditions. When the IAC device operates at a higher temperature or a higher humidity than the design one, the gain is limited; in some working conditions with high relative humidity, most of the beneficial effect can even be lost.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to develop a new low-cost, highly selective, and stable sorbent based pre-combustion CO2 capture. A high surface area titanium oxide (TiO2) prepared by a template method and amine modified TiO2 (M-TiO2) were investigated for CO2/CH4 adsorption at conditions relevant to pre-combustion CO2 capture. Single-component and binary CO2/CH4 adsorption tests at different operating conditions were performed in a fixed bed adsorber. Experimental results show that the selectivity of TiO2 for separation of CO2 from CO2/CH4 mixture can be significantly improved via amine modification. The selectivity of CO2 over CH4 for M-TiO2 is enhanced to 22.1 at 333 K and 35 bar. Pure CO2 or CH4 can be obtained from the adsorber packed with M-TiO2 through cyclic CO2/CH4 mixture gas adsorption and desorption. The study indicates that, as a pre-combustion sorbent, the inexpensive mesoporous M-TiO2 is not only capable and stable, but also easily regenerated without loss of capacity and selectivity.

Abstract: A free air cooling system that combines phase change material (PCM) with a natural cold source (i.e., cold air) was developed to reduce the space cooling energy consumption in telecommunications base stations (TBSs). Outside cold air, instead of air conditioning system was used to remove heat in the TBSs. In addition, a PCM technology was adopted to improve the mismatch between energy demand and supply on the electric grid. The proposed system was intended to operate in conjunction with existing air conditioning units within each TBS. Consequently, the running time the air conditioning units was reduced, resulting in energy and demand savings. A full scale prototype, herein referred. to as latent heat storage unit (LHSU), was designed, built and tested in TBSs located in five different climatic regions in southwest and eastern China during different seasons. In addition, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the operation of the proposed LHSUs. Energy savings ratio (ESR) was used as the criterion to evaluate LHSU's energy savings. The estimated average annual ESR in five climatic regions was approximately 50%, with a maximum value of 67%. The average percent running time in which the LHSU replaced the operation of conventional air conditioners was 82.6%, with values surpassing 75% in four of the five cities, and one city achieving a value of almost 100%.

Abstract: In the present study, the feasibility of combining dry dark fermentation and mechanical pretreatment of wheat straw was studied in order to improve substrate valorization, save energy input, decrease the environmental impact and diversify biofuels and volatile fatty acids production. To this end, dark fermentation of wheat straw was performed at 55 degrees C and 35 degrees C under solid-state conditions (23% of total solid content) and it was considered as a biological pretreatment. Both biologically treated and raw straws were reduced at four particles size to cover the range of fine (50 < X < 500 mu m) and ultrafine milling (<50 mu m). Biological pretreatment led to a substrate conversion of 16% and 14%, mainly into volatile fatty acids and biohydrogen. Biological pretreatment improved the substrate grindability with a reduction of mean particle size up to 31% and a reduction of the milling specific energy consumption up to 35% compared to untreated straw. Finally, related to untreated straw, this combination of biological and mechanical treatments improved the bioethanol yield up to 83%, which leads to an enhancement of the overall substrate conversion up to 131%. Based on these high yields, this combination of dry biological-mechanical pretreatments appears more attractive and efficient in terms of bioproducts production, energy efficiency and environmental impact, compared to conventional pretreatments.

Abstract: The primary challenge to the commercialization of any electric vehicle is the performance management of the battery pack. The performance of the battery module is influenced by the resistance of the intercell connecting plates (ICCP) and the position of the battery module posts (BMP). A new battery cell model based on the Matlab-Simscape platform is developed and validated using a constant current discharge test and a pulse discharge test. Taken the ICCP as resistors, a parallel-connected battery module model (PCBMM) is established based on the battery cell model. The effect of inter-cell connecting plate resistance (ICCPR) on the battery module performance is simulated. Simulation results indicate that the ICCPR causes unevenly current flow among the battery cells. The battery cell directly connected to the BMP is the first one reaching its end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage. Also, it presents the lowest terminal voltage and state of charge (SOC) during the discharge process. The battery cell directly connected to the BMP goes into deep discharge state more easily. Therefore, it performs higher aging rate. The aging of the battery cell causes over-discharge of the adjacent battery cells. The reasonable ratio of the ICCPR to the battery ohmic internal resistance (OIR) is discussed for different average currents and different numbers of battery cells, to guarantee the maximum SOC evaluation error within a target value of 0.05.

Abstract: Hydraulic fracturing of shale formations in the United States has led to a domestic energy boom. Currently, water is the only fracturing fluid regularly used in commercial shale oil and gas production. Industry and researchers are interested in non-aqueous working fluids due to their potential to increase production, reduce water requirements, and to minimize environmental impacts. Using a combination of new experimental and modeling data at multiple scales, we analyze the benefits and drawbacks of using CO2 as a working fluid for shale gas production. We theorize and outline potential advantages of CO2 including enhanced fracturing and fracture propagation, reduction of flow-blocking mechanisms, increased desorption of methane adsorbed in organic-rich parts of the shale, and a reduction or elimination of the deep re-injection of flow-back water that has been linked to induced seismicity and other environmental concerns. We also examine likely disadvantages including costs and safety issues associated with handling large volumes of supercritical CO2. The advantages could have a significant impact over time leading to substantially increased gas production. In addition, if CO2 proves to be an effective fracturing fluid, then shale gas formations could become a major utilization option for carbon sequestration. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Thermal response tests conducted to assess the subsurface thermal conductivity for the design of ground-coupled heat pump systems require a power source of about 7-12 kW to heat water circulating in a ground heat exchanger. This high power is commonly supplied with a fuel-fired generator, which is an important source of cost. An alternative method relying on a power source of less than 1 kW was consequently developed and used for a first field demonstration. Heat was injected along ten short sections of heating cable standing in the water column filling the pipe of the exchanger. Recovery temperatures measured at the middle height of each heating section were analyzed with a linear heat source solution of finite length. The ten local measurements distributed over a depth of 139 m and averaged according to the site stratigraphy revealed a subsurface thermal conductivity that is within an acceptable range of the bulk value determined with a conventional test. The new method has the potential to reduce the use of generators for thermal response tests since a low power source is common to construction sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Modern biomass energy sources account for less than 2% of primary world energy supplies while major economies have enabled legislation that aims to increase bioenergy production. In response to controversies over first generation biofuel, it has been argued that 'marginal land' should be used to produce dedicated energy crops (DECs). However, defining marginality of agricultural land is complex, and moreover, DECs would have to out-compete current agricultural production in these areas. Utilising a bio-economic farm-level modelling approach we investigate the impact that crop yield penalties resulting from production in marginal land contexts have on financially optimal farm-level crop plans. Where farm businesses choose to de-invest in own farm machinery, yield reductions of less than 10% for winter wheat result in a financially optimal switch to 100% miscanthus production. By contrast, in the presence of own farm machinery, winter wheat yield penalties of 30% are required before 100% miscanthus production is financially optimal. However, under circumstances where DECs also suffer yield penalties on marginal land, the financially optimal crop mix includes combinable crops. The results demonstrate that the optimal crop mix is dependent upon the relative combinable and DEC yields, together with farm-level decisions towards machinery ownership. The focus of much policy attention relating to production of DECs on 'marginal land' is therefore argued to be incomplete. Policies which encourage farmers to de-invest in own farm machinery, or incentivise the purchase of specific DEC machinery, may play an important role in assisting the development of DEC production.

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive supervisory controller, based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP), for on-line energy management optimization of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Using minimum driving information, such as the total trip length and the average cycle speed, the proposed algorithm relies on adaptation of the control parameter from state of charge feedback. The proposed strategy is referred in the paper to as Adaptive-PMP (A-PMP). The new controller is applied to a detailed forward vehicle simulator of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt manufactured by General Motors, where an experimentally validated LG Chem battery model is used. The strategy we propose aims at achieving a blended trajectory of the state of charge to minimize the consumed fuel, resulting in an overall better performance than the actual Charge Depleting/Charge Sustaining (CD/CS) strategy currently used on-board of the vehicle. A comparative analysis of three strategies, i.e., the optimal one (PMP), the proposed one (A-PMP) and the in-vehicle one (CD/CS), is conducted in simulation which shows that improvement above 20% in fuel consumption may be achieved when the proposed algorithm is used instead of the current on-board strategy.

Abstract: This study is a contribution to the analysis Of energy production by hybrid systems using renewable energy sources. It is realized within the framework of an isolated site, i.e., without any connection to an electrical network. Generally, with the conventional solutions for energy production, the needs in terms of electrical energy and thermal energy are met separately.
In this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on a strategy of hybridization which uses energy conversion to meet the energy needs. In this alternative approach, a large part of the directly produced thermal energy is replaced by electrical energy and an air/water heat pump variable input power is introduced to ensure a crossover between the thermal energy flow and the electrical energy flow.
The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. Firstly, we propose a methodology to control the functioning of the air/water heat pump variable input power. Secondly, we compare the potential of thermal energy production of two subsystems and we show the interest of using energy conversion according to the type of climate. Thirdly, we present a case study. More precisely, the study is realized for representative locations in France. The objective is twofold. First, an analysis of the energy potential at the representative sites is given. Second, it is established that the energy produced is increased by using the hybridization strategy based on energy conversion, especially in winter which is the critical period in terms of both electrical and thermal needs.
Simulation and experimental results are presented and analyzed to show the interest of introducing a pump heat in the hybrid system, mainly when using the technology with variable input power. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: EU targets require nearly zero energy buildings (NZEB) by 2020. However few monitored examples exist of how NZEB has been achieved in practise in individual residential buildings. This paper provides an example of how a low-energy building (built in 2006), has achieved nearly zero energy heating through the addition of a solar domestic hot water and space heating system ("combi system") with a Seasonal Thermal Energy Store (STES). The paper also presents a cumulative life cycle energy and cumulative life cycle carbon analysis for the installation based on the recorded DHW and space heating demand in addition to energy payback periods and net energy ratios. In addition, the carbon and energy analysis is carried out for four other heating system scenarios including hybrid solar thermal/PV systems in order to obtain the optimal system from a carbon efficiency perspective.

Abstract: This paper presents an economic outlook of the ethanol industry in Brazil considering different biomass feedstocks and different industrial processing options. A spreadsheet model was designed to account for different feedstocks and industrial processes, and expected trends in biomass yield, sugar- and fibre content, industrial scale and efficiency. Sugarcane and energycane cultivation costs may be reduced from 35 US$(2010)/TC in 2010 to 27 US$(2010)/TC and 22 US$(2010)/TC in 2030 respectively. Eucalyptus and elephant grass cultivation costs could be reduced from 32 to 23 US$(2010)/tonne wet and 38 to 26 US$(2010)/tonne wet for eucalyptus and elephant grass. Total ethanol production costs of first generation processing may decrease from 700 US$(2010)/1113 in 2010, to 432 US$(2010)/m(3) in 2030. First generation ethanol production costs may decrease by reduced feedstock costs, increase in sugar content, utilization of cane trash, and use of sweet sorghum. Furthermore, the improvement in industrial efficiency of the first generation process, increasing industrial scale and change to an improved technology are other measures. For second generation technology utilizing eucalyptus, the total ethanol production costs could be strongly reduced to 424 US$(2010)/m(3) in 2030. Costs reduction measures for second generation industrial processing include reduced feedstock costs, increasing industrial efficiency and scale, and a change to more advanced industrial process. Overall, biomass yield, increase in sugar content of sugarcane, and improved industrial efficiency are important parameters in total ethanol production costs. Ongoing RD&D effort and commercialization of second generation industrial processing may result in the lowest ethanol production costs for second generation processing in the future.

Abstract: Retrofitting existing residential buildings has been claimed as one crucial way to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions within the Chinese residential sector. In China's government-dominated retrofitting projects, the participation of residents is often neglected. The objective of this paper is to assess the influence level of public participation (before, during and after retrofit) on energy saving by comparing three Beijing neighborhoods with different retrofitting models: a central government-led model, a local government-led model, and an old neighborhood retrofit Model. In the three cases data were collected through interviews with neighborhood workers and residents. The results show that residents' involvement in pre-retrofit activities, in technology selection and in the use of technology differs greatly among the three cases. This study concludes that in order to improve the effectiveness of energy saving interventions, the motives, intentions and living habits of residents need to be given more consideration when designing and implementing retrofitting. By highlighting the importance of public participation this paper contributes to energy saving policy development in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A new skeletal mechanism of toluene reference fuels with nitric oxide (TRF-NO) in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion is presented to investigate the effects of NO in exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on combustion. The skeletal mechanism of TRF-NO, consisting of 80 species and 184 reactions, works in combination with the mechanisms of toluene and primary reference fuel (PRF). The toluene sub-mechanism is developed by simplifying detailed or semi-detailed mechanisms based on reaction paths and sensitivity analysis. Cross reactions are considered to show the interactions of the three TRF components when combined. The reaction paths of NO are summarized by analysis of the detailed NO mechanism to reflect the effects of NO on TRF. Combining reaction paths with sensitivity analysis at different conditions, the simplified NO sub-mechanism is proposed. Then, the final TRF-NO skeletal mechanism is formed by combining the NO sub-mechanism with the TRF mechanism. The new skeletal mechanism is validated by comparison of the experimental data in both a shock tube and an HCCI engine over a large range of temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios with single-fuel component and their blends of TRF. Furthermore, validations of the new skeletal mechanism also include the effects of NO on ignition delay times with different compositions, proportions of three TRF components, and under different operation conditions.

Abstract: Fuel cells are a promising technology for combined heat and power (CHP); however their efficiency and carbon benefits are often overlooked because of their reliance on fossil fuels. This paper sets out the numerical methods and evidence of real-world performance needed to compare fuel cells with other low-carbon technologies. It is demonstrated that firstly, the efficiency of present-day fuel cells is high enough to outperform the best electric heat pumps, even when these are powered exclusively by the best modern power stations. The equivalent COP (coefficient of performance) of today's fuel cells ranges from 5 to 00, compared to 3-4 for the best ground source heat pumps. Secondly, this high efficiency means that even when fuelled with natural gas, the heat from a fuel cell is zero- or even negative-carbon when electricity from central power stations is displaced.

Abstract: Due to its significant carbon footprint and cost-effectiveness for upgrades, the commercial property sector is important for climate change mitigation. Although barriers to energy system changes, such as funding, financing and information, are well recognized, Energy Star property owners and managers are successfully overcoming these barriers and instigating energy efficiency upgrades, renewable energy installations, and behavior and management programs. To examine the decision-making process that leads to energy performance improvements, a national survey of property owners and management organizations of buildings that earned an Energy Star score of 75 or higher was conducted. The extent to which energy upgrades were considered strategic investments motivated by environmental sustainability or corporate social responsibility, or financial investments motivated by payback period or return-on-investment criteria, was contingent upon the property type and type of energy project. Environmental sustainability was found to be an important motivation for energy projects in office spaces in general, but in the case of smaller office spaces was often combined with motivations for corporate social responsibility. Energy projects on education properties were motivated by financial investment. Building envelope and mechanical efficiency upgrades were considered financial investments, while renewable energy, green roofs, and water conservation technologies were considered environmental sustainability initiatives.

Abstract: Meeting time-varying peak demand poses a key challenge to the U.S. electricity system. Building-based electricity storage - to enable demand response (DR) without curtailing actual appliance usage - offers potential benefits of lower electricity production cost, higher grid reliability, and more flexibility to integrate renewables. DR tariffs are currently available in the U.S. but building-based storage is still underutilized due to insufficiently understood cost-effectiveness and dispatch strategies. Whether DR schemes can yield a profit for building operators (i.e., reduction in electricity bill that exceeds levelized storage cost) and which particular storage technology yields the highest profit is yet to be answered. This study aims to evaluate the economics of providing peak shaving DR under a realistic tariff (Con Edison, New York), using a range of storage technologies (conventional and advanced batteries, flywheel, magnetic storage, pumped hydro, compressed air, and capacitors). An agent-based stochastic model is used to randomly generate appliance-level demand profiles for an average U.S. household. We first introduce a levelized storage cost model which is based on a total-energy-throughput lifetime. We then develop a storage dispatch strategy which optimizes the storage capacity and the demand limit on the grid. We find that (i) several storage technologies provide profitable DR; (ii) annual profit from such DR can range from 1% to 39% of the household's non-DR electricity bill; (iii) allowing occasional breaches of the intended demand limit increases profit; and (iv) a dispatch strategy that accounts for demand variations across seasons increases profit further. We expect that a more advanced dispatch strategy with embedded weather forecasting capability could yield even higher profit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the present study, long term performance of an HT-PEM fuel cell based micro CHP system, considering the degradation within the HT-PEM fuel cell stack and the steam methane reformer has been investigated. The variations in the generated electrical and thermal power and the corresponding efficiencies, in the first 15,000 h of operation of the plant, have been studied. Two strategies have been proposed and applied in order to remedy the excursion of thermal and electrical generation of the plant from the steady state production. In the partialization strategy, by means of reducing the fuel fed to the system, the thermal generation of the plant is kept in a specified range. On the other hand, in the recovery strategy, the supplied fuel is gradually increased to suppress the progressive reduction in the power production.
The long term performance analysis of the system in normal condition reveals that, due to the degradation within the system, the power production diminishes from 28.2 kW to 23.4 kW while the thermal generation increases from 52.4 kW to 57.5 kW. The results of partialization strategy show that, in order to confine the thermal generation amplification, the partialization factor should be increased up to 7.2%. On the other hand, in the recovery strategy, the supplied fuel should be progressively increased up to 34.2% in order to preserve the electrical output at the initial level. Nevertheless, the recovery strategy has an adverse effect on the electrical efficiency as it diminishes the obtained efficiency to 21.6% compared to 24% obtained for the normal operation. In the last part of the study, the overall performance indexes of the plant, while operating in normal condition and under operational strategies, are compared. It is shown that operating under recovery strategy results in overall electrical efficiency of 24.7% which is notably lower than efficiencies of 26.1% and 26.4% obtained by operating in normal condition and under partialization strategy respectively. However, it was also demonstrated that applying this strategy results in generation of 422.6 MW h of electrical energy which is higher than the values obtained by normal operation (381.3 MW h) and partialization strategy (369.8 MW h).

Abstract: A thermoelectric (TE) cooler architecture is presented that employs thin film thermoelectric elements on a plastic substrate in a corrugated structure sandwiched between planar thermal interface plates. This design represents a hybrid of a conventional bulk TE device and an in-plane thin film TE design. This design is attractive as it may benefit from low cost thin-film processing in a roll-to-roll fashion onto low-cost plastics substrates while maintaining a cross-plane heat flux for large area applications and a geometry that assists in maintaining a significant temperature difference across the thermoelectric elements. First, the performance of a single thermocouple is analyzed and the effect of the parasitic heat loss through the plastic substrate is examined. The performance of an array of thermocouples is then considered and the effects of various geometric parameters are analyzed with particular focus on the packing density of thermoelectric legs. The results show that while the coefficient of performance (COP) is comparable to a conventional bulk element TE cooler, the cooling power density drops off dramatically with a decrease in stacking angle of the legs. A comparison is then made between the heat sink demands of the hybrid TE design and a conventional bulk TE device where it is found that the lower cooling power density of the hybrid TE results in a reduction of heat sink demands as compared to bulk TE modules. The modeled performance suggest that the hybrid TE device may be advantageous in low cooling power density applications over relatively large areas where the low-cost nature of the device is maximized and less elaborate heat sink designs work effectively, cumulatively improving cost competitiveness, (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: As devices move from full-scale prototype to commercial installations, it is important that developers have detailed knowledge of the tidal energy resource. Therefore, the spatial distribution of the tidal currents over the northwest European shelf seas has been examined to improve understanding of the tidal-stream energy resource. Using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ROMS) at 1 km spatial resolution, and applying device characteristics of the Seagen-S turbine, we show that the ratio of the amplitudes of the M-2 and S-2 tidal currents can lead to significant variability in annual practical power generation - variability that is not accounted for when considering only the mean peak spring tidal velocities, as is generally the case in resource feasibility studies. In addition, we show that diurnal inequalities (governed by K-1 and O-1 tidal constituents) and tidal asymmetries (governed by the relationship between My and its compound tide M-4) over the northwest European shelf seas can further affect power generation at potential high-energy sites. Based on these variabilities, the spatial distribution of the tidal-stream 'capacity factor' has been calculated. We find that mean peak spring tidal velocities can under-estimate the resource by up to 25%, and that annual practical power generation can vary by similar to 15% for regions experiencing similar mean peak spring tidal velocities, due to the influence of other tidal constituents. Therefore, even preliminary resource assessments should be based on annual average power density, rather than peak spring tidal velocity. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper, a prototype of methanol microfluidic fuel cell with vapor feed anode configuration is proposed to improve the fuel and energy efficiency of the conventional liquid feed methanol microfluidic fuel cells. Peak power density of 55.4 mW cm(-2) can be achieved with this prototype under room temperature, which is 30% higher than its conventional liquid feed counterpart. Moreover, an energy efficiency of 9.4% is achieved, which is 27.5 times higher than its liquid feed counterpart. This superiority on both cell performance and energy efficiency is directly benefitted from its vapor feed anode configuration, which alleviates the fuel crossover, eliminates the fuel depletion boundary layer, and avoids the bulk anolyte wastage. The tradeoff between cell performance and fuel utilization for conventional liquid feed microfluidic fuel cells is also evaded. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The current mode of economic development in China is typified by high growth, high energy consumption, and high pollution characteristics and this has caused great stress on both energy consumption and the environment. This paper focuses on a historical analysis of China's energy, environmental, and economic ('E3') efficiency and the sources of E3 productivity growth therein. A developed slacks-based measure is utilized to evaluate the performance of E3 efficiency and decompose the performance fluctuations into three components: energy, economy, and environmental efficiency fluctuations. By applying a method based on global data envelopment analysis, we also analyze the key factors responsible for the change in E3 productivity during 2002-11 from the point of view of technical progress, production scale, and management level. The results show that China performs well on the economic front, while the energy and environmental performances are not optimistic. Fortunately, energy and environmental efficiency have gradually improved in recent years. Further analysis shows that the trend in E3 productivity in China has begun to follow an ascending path. Technical progress is the most powerful contributor to China's E3 productivity growth, while falling scale and management efficiency are the two main obstacles preventing improvement in E3 productivity.

Abstract: Continuous laboratory-scale experiments were conducted on two-stage anaerobic systems treating vegetable waste (VW) to improve CH4 production. The acidogenic reactors were employed with a serial methanogenic reactor configuration with volume distribution ratios of 3 L/4 L and 3 L/7 L (acidogenic reactorimethanogenic reactor), as well as recirculation rates (RRs) of 0.8 and 1.6. Results showed that recirculation improved the performance of VW anaerobic digestion under an organic loading rate (OLR) of 2.6 g VS/L/d. The OLR increased from 2.6 g VS/L/d to 3.0 g VS/L/d to compare the stability of the processes and to study the behavior response of serial systems. System control without recirculation was susceptible to overloading and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) utilization was inhibited in the methanogenic reactor, which was implemented as a fixed-bed biofilm reactor with active carbon fiber textiles. These findings indicated overall process failure. The ratio of total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) and alkalinity gives a good indication of the process stability of anaerobic digestion. The TVFA/alkalinity ratio of the methanogenic reactor in the 3 L/4 L configuration, with RR of 1.6, increased to approximately 0.5, which indicates potential imminent failure of the methanogenic process. However, the methanogenic reactorin the 3 L/7 L configuration helped in utilizing the WA produced by the overloading in the acidogenic reactor, which improved the CH4 production and conversion efficiency of the system.

Abstract: Hydrogen production from beverage industry wastewater (20 g/L-hexose equivalent) using an immobilized cell reactor with a continuous mode of operation was studied at various hydraulic retention times (HRT, 8-1.5 h). Maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 55 L/L-d was obtained at HRT 1.5 h (an organic loading of 320 g/L-d(hexose equivalent)). This HPR value is much higher than those of other industrial wastewaters employed in fermentative hydrogen production. The cell biomass concentration peaked at 3 h HRT with a volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of 6.31 g/L (with presence of self-flocculating Selenomonas sp.), but it dropped to 3.54 gVSS/L at 1.5 h HRT. With the shortening of HRT, lactate concentration increased but the concentration of the dominant metabolite butyrate did not vary significantly. The Clostridium species dynamics was not significantly affected, but total microbial community structure changed with respect to HRT variation as evident from PCR-DGGE analyses. Analysis of energy production rate suggests that beverage wastewater is a high energy yielding feedstock, and can replace 24% of electricity consumption in a model beverage industry.

Abstract: Amine absorption is a common method for CO2 removal from flue gas of a power plant. The heat of regeneration, which is usually provided by steam extracted from the power cycle, reduces the power plant efficiency. In this paper, seven configurations of heat pumps integrated with CO2 capture plant of a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant were evaluated using HYSYS software. The heat pump provides the regeneration heat as well as processes heating and cooling. Forty-one working fluids were investigated, and the most promising ones were R-141b and NH3, with as much as 3.1% savings in the efficiency. When the heat pump cooling and heating capacities were to be,considered in the efficiency calculations, the enhancement in efficiency becomes as high as 13.6%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Photocatalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising technology to mimic photosynthesis by the conversion of solar energy into methanol (CH3OH) for the development of sustainable energy. This technology not only can potentially cut down the atmospheric CO2, but also reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuel. Using a novel twin reactor, the hydrogen, which is directly generated from the water splitting, could be utilized to hydrogenate CO2 into a desirable fuel and simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas. Remarkable result has been observed by using a gaseous mixture of CO/CO2 to yield CH3OH under artificial sunlight, compared with the one using solely CO or CO2. Although direct hydrogenation of CO to form CH3OH on either Pt/CuAlGaO4 or Pt/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalysts is not likely to occur, CO still plays an important role on the generation of either H-2 via water-gas shift reaction or methyl formate (HCOOCH3), the intermediate product of CH3OH. Nevertheless, adding too much CO as the co-feed will adversely decrease the yield of CH3OH. A possible mechanism of CO/CO2 photo-hydrogenation over Pt/CuAlGaO4 and Pt/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalysts is proposed to explain the key experimental trends observed as well as the species involved during the reaction.

Abstract: Limited dispatchability of wind parks and unexpected grid power injections create unbalances between the generated electric power and the actual required power that has to be reduced for proper operation of the electrical grid. The increasing amount of renewable energy sources stresses this problein in several countries, where the responses in terms of reinforcement of transmission lines and ancillary services are not sufficiently fast or effective. In this study, we analyze the potential of a grid balancing system based on different combinations of traditional gas turbine based power plants with innovative 'power-to-gas' plants. Power-to-gas is a promising solution to balance the electric grid, based on water electrolysis, which can effectively contribute to reducing the uncertainty of dispatch plans. According to this system, the excess power produced by renewables is converted into hydrogen, which can be then injected into the natural gas grid. Different economic scenarios are assessed in this work, leading to a set of optimal sizes of the proposed system, using a statistical approach in order to estimate wind farm productivity and forecasting errors, as well as each component load conditions. Economic parameters, equivalent operating hours, CO2 emissions and lost wind energy are the main performances indexes considered in this work to compare gas turbine and electrolysis balancing systems. From an economic point of view, hybrid systems including both balancing technologies generally lead to the best performances. The scenario which leads to the highest power-to-gas capacity (with installed electrolysis power of about 6% of wind park nominal power) is determined coupling a mid-term perspective of reduction in investment costs with favorable energy market conditions or with incentives ("green-gas" or carbon taxes). In such conditions, an equivalence between the two technologies in terms of optimum installed power can be reached at an electricity-to-natural gas cost ratio between 1.8 and 2. In most interesting scenarios, the P2G system brings about a lower total wind electricity injected in the grid, due to wind-to-gas energy conversion, while it allows reducing energy losses due to grid congestion and curtailment of the wind park; however, the additional CO2 emissions due to gas turbines operation and due to the reduced electricity production tend to offset or to limit the positive effect of the carbon-free gas production.

Abstract: In this study, a simplified methodology for the calculation of the balance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and corresponding saving compared with the fossil reference is presented. The proposed methodology allows the estimation of the anthropogenic GHG emissions of thermochemical biorefineries (net emitted to the atmosphere). In the calculation of the GHG balance, all relevant factors have been identified and analyzed including multiproduction, emissions from biogenic carbon capture and storage (Bio-CCS), co-feeding of fossil fuels (secondary feedstock) and possible carbon storage in biomass-derived products (chemicals). Therefore, it is possible to calculate the balance of GHG emissions of a hypothetical thermochemical biorefinery considering different alternatives of land-use, biomass feedstock, co-feeding of fossil fuels, Bio-CCS incorporation and final use of the products. The comparison of the estimated GHG balance with the corresponding fossil reference for each product is of special relevance in the methodology since it is the parameter used in European regulation for the fulfillment of sustainability criteria in biomass-derived fuels and liquids. The proposed methodology is tested using a previously assessed set of different process concepts of thermochemical biorefineries (techno-economic analysis). The resulting GHG balance and saving are analyzed to identify uncertainties and provide recommendations for future regulation. In all process concepts, the GHG savings are above the minimum requirement of GHG emissions for 2018. In the case of incorporating Bio-CCS, cradle-to-grave negative GHG emissions are obtained. However, in order to assess the role of chemical co-production from biomass, they need to be included in future regulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Photovoltaic panels used for power generation are subject to significant wind loads of concern to mounting systems. A novel method of arranging photovoltaic surface in layers of non-overlapping panels is proposed for tracking systems to reduce wind load forces. The potential of this approach is assessed for double layer systems called DLOOP using Computational Fluid Dynamic turbulence modelling and wind tunnel tests.
A consistent pattern of wind-force reduction is found as distance between double layers is increased up to and beyond the scale of the integrated panels' side length.
A 49 panel DLOOP arrangement when tested in high winds had the potential to carry 30% more panels than a single layer arrangement of side by side panels for equivalent wind loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: China is facing serious issues involving energy sufficiency, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution caused partly by the rapid growth of vehicles. In order to relieve those problems, new energy vehicles are introduced into the bus and car market. We adopt life cycle analysis to evaluate the well-to-wheels (WTW) energy consumption, CO2 emissions and pollutant emissions from the traditional diesel bus and new energy buses, including diesel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This study reports the current situation and projects future scenarios for the BEV bus for several regions in China due to significant regional differences in the power generation mix. Compared to the diesel bus, the HEV bus can reduce petroleum, fossil fuel use and CO2 emissions by about 20%, and, at the same time, produce stable reduction benefits for all air pollutants. The CNG bus achieves reductions of WTW primary PM2.5 emissions by 70% over its diesel counterpart and, of course, uses little petroleum; but increases fossil fuel consumption moderately and has no benefit in GHG emissions. The BEV bus can deliver a substantial petroleum consumption advantage and greatly reduce the WTW NOx, VOC and CO emissions; but, if the electricity is generated from burning coal, the BEV bus has no PM2.5 emission benefit compared to the conventional diesel bus. Currently, the BEV bus increases fossil energy use and CO2 emissions in the coal-dominated regions; but, in the future, it can achieve substantially lower fossil energy use and CO2 emissions with more penetration of clean electric energy. To reach the win-win strategy, a city's initial reliance on diesel buses for the public fleet has to give way to a mixture of these new energy buses; and the fleet mix should be diversified over the region and modified over time to accommodate changes in these energy and environmental parameters.

Abstract: Environmental performance (EP) uncertainties span a number of energy technology options, and pose planning risk when the energy system is subject to environmental constraints. This paper presents two approaches to integrating EP uncertainty into the long-term energy planning framework. The methodologies consider stochastic EP metrics across multiple energy technology options, and produce a development strategy that hedges against the risk of exceeding environmental targets. Both methods are compared within a case study Of emission-constrained electricity generation planning in British Columbia, Canada. The analysis provides important insight into model formulation and the interactions with concurrent environmental policy uncertainties. EP risk is found to be particularly important in situations where environmental constraints become increasingly stringent. Model results indicate allocation of a modest risk premium in these situations can provide valuable hedging against EP risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To obtain the cathode microporous layer (CML) with high mass transfer performance and high electronic conductivity, a pore-forming technology was introduced to optimize CML microstructure for direct methanol fuel cells. In this paper, the effects of carbon material type, carbon material loading and pore-forming agent loading in CML on fuel cell performance were discussed systematically. The results indicated that the optimized CML consisted of carbon nanotubes and ammonium oxalate with the loading of 1.5 and 3.5 mg cm(-2) respectively. The fuel cell performance was improved by 30.3%, from 224 to 292 mW cm(-2) at 80 degrees C under 03 MPa O-2. Carbon nanotube was found to be the most suitable carbon material for the CML due to its great specific surface area and small particle size, resulting in increasing the number of the hydrophobic sites and the contact area between the support and the catalyst layer. The carbon material and pore-forming agent loading directly influenced the pore distribution and the contact resistance of membrane electrode assembly. The water removal capacity and the gas mass transfer property of diffusion layer were improved by optimizing the amount of micropore and macropore structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The atomization of biodiesel, vegetable oil and glycerin has been studied in an atmospheric spray rig by using digital imaging (PDIA). Images of the spray were captured in the near field, just 18 mm downstream of the atomizer, and processed to automatically determine the size of both ligaments and droplets. The effect of the spray structure in this region is of major interest for the combustion of biofuels in gas turbines. The sprays were produced by a pressure-swirl atomizer that originates from the multifuel micro gas turbine (MMGT) setup. Various injection conditions have been tested to investigate the influence of viscosity on the spray characteristics and to assess the overall performance of the atomizer. The spray measurements have been compared to combustion experiments with biodiesel and vegetable oil in the micro gas turbine at similar injection conditions. The results show that the primary breakup process rapidly deteriorates when the viscosity is increased. A higher viscosity increases the breakup length, which becomes visible at the measurement location in the form of ligaments. This effect leads to an unacceptable spray quality once the viscosity slightly exceeds the typical range for conventional gas turbine fuels. The SMD in the investigated spray region was not significantly affected by viscosity, but mainly influenced by injection pressure. The data furthermore indicate an increase in SMD with surface tension. It was found that the penetration depth of ligaments can have major impact on the combustion process, and that the droplet size is not always the critical factor responsible for efficient combustion. The measured delay in primary breakup at increased viscosity shows that pressure-swirl atomization is unsuitable for the application of pure pyrolysis oil in an unmodified gas turbine engine.

Abstract: The reasons for the renewed interest in fast reactors and an overview of the progress in sodium cooled fast reactor operation in the last ten years are given. The excellent operational performance of sodium cooled fast reactors in this period is highlighted as a sound basis for the development of new fast reactors. The operational performance of the BN-600 is compared and evaluated against the performance of German light water reactors to assess the reliability. The relevance of feedback effects for safe reactor design is described, and a new method for the enhancement of feedback effects in fast reactors is proposed. Experimental reactors demonstrating the inherent safety of advanced sodium cooled fast reactor designs are described and the potential safety improvements resulting from the use of fine distributed moderating material are discussed.

Abstract: Western Canada is endowed with considerable reserves of deep un-mineable coal, which can be converted to syngas by means of a gasification process called underground coal gasification (UCG). The syngas can be transformed into hydrogen (H-2) through commercially available technologies employed in conventional fossil-fuel based H-2 production pathways. This paper presents a data-intensive model to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions in H-2 production from UCG with and without CCS. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) was considered as a sequestration method and included in the LCA. The life cycle GHG emissions are calculated to be 0.91 and 18.00 kg-CO2-eq/kg-H-2 in H-2 production from UCG with and without CCS, respectively. In addition, a detailed analysis of the influence of key UCG parameters, i.e., H2O-to-O-2 injection ratio, ground water influx, and steam-to-carbon ratio in syngas conversion, is completed on the results. The advantage of adopting UCG-CCS technology for H-2 production is realized over the predominant steam methane reforming (SMR) process; around 15.3 million tonnes of GHG emissions can be mitigated to achieve the projected SCO production rate from the bitumen upgrading in 2022. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed that the life cycle GHG emissions is sensitive to the heat exchanger efficiency and the separation efficiency of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit, with increasing values of these parameters causing an increase and a decrease in the magnitude of life cycle GHG emissions, respectively.

Abstract: Previously, we quantified a decline in the marginal economic value of wind and PV with increasing penetration levels based on a long-run equilibrium investment and dispatch model that accounted for operational constraints for conventional generation. We use the same model and data, based loosely on California in 2030, to evaluate several options to stem the decline in value of these technologies. The largest increase in the value of wind at high penetration levels comes from increased geographic diversity. The largest increase in the value of PV at high penetration levels comes from assuming that low-cost bulk power storage is an investment option. Other attractive options, particularly at more modest penetration levels, include real-time pricing and technology diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An experimental research with a solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) micro grid feeding a reversible air-water, 6 kW heating capacity heat pump, has been carried out from December 2012 to April 2013. Its purpose is to heat a laboratory that is used as a house prototype for the study of heating/cooling systems. It was built in accordance with the 2013 Spanish CTE, and has an area of 35 m(2) divided into two internal rooms: one of them housing the storage system, the solar controller, the inverter and the control system; the other one is occupied by three people. Its main thermal characteristics are: LIA = 125 W/degrees C and a maximum thermal load about 6.0 kW at the initial time. The PVT field consists of 12 modules, vvith a total area of 15.7 m(2) and useful area of 14 m(2). Each module is composed of 48 polycrystalline silicon cells of 243.4 cm(2), which with a nominal efficiency 14% can generate a power of 180 W, being the total nominal power installed 2.16 kW. The PV system stores electricity in 250 Ah batteries from where is converted from DC to AC through a 3.0 kW inverter that feeds the heat pump. This works supplying 8401/h of hot water at 35-45 degrees C to the radiant floor. The data storing system is recording variables such as solar radiation; temperatures; input power to batteries; heat produced; heat transferred by the radiant floor; heat pump's COP; isolated ratio; and solar fraction. The objective of this work is to present and discuss the experimental results and the emission reduction of CO2 obtained during the period from 01/12/2012 to 30/04/2013, including the detailed results of two representative days of Madrid's climate: 28/12/2012 using only PV electricity and 21/01/2013 mixing PV and conventional electricity.

Abstract: The use of Demand Side Integration (DSI) makes it possible to control electricity consumption and, at the same time, allows for different ancillary system (e.g. voltage and frequency control) or market services (e.g. load shifting) to be provided. In light of today's power system, which is faced with a high penetration of renewable energy (more than 20%), DSI has become even more important. These new power systems make it especially necessary to shift plenty of demand to times of high feed-in from wind and solar power plants in order to avoid wasting green energy. Additionally providing ancillary services using DSI can help balancing the system. This paper is focused on the analysis of load shifting potential in the residential and commercial sectors. Therefore a scenario based procedure was developed and applied. It uses a genetic algorithm to consider the time-dependent behavior of the different loads, which are modeled as load blocks. The investigation was conducted in the scope of a VDE/ETG working group in close cooperation with industrial partners. The results determined a practical shifting potential for the investigated sectors (residential and commercial) in Germany which could reach 8 GW in 2030. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We report a novel defrosting control method for refrigeration systems including refrigerators and heat pumps that commonly use time control or time-temperature control to determine the defrosting start-time. However, these methods do not provide accurate defrosting start-times due to variations in the operating conditions. Here, we describe the use of the effective mass-flow fraction (EMF) to determine the defrosting start-time; this method qualitatively detects variation trend of heat transfer rate based on only temperature measurements. The performance of the EMF control was compared with that of time control under varied frosting conditions of an experimental system. The time control method determined the defrosting start-time with an error of 50%, whereas the EMF control precisely determined the defrosting start-time with an error of 10%. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: During transesterification process in the fixed-bed reactor, traditional heterogeneous catalyst cannot stand the high pressure drop and would easily breaks at the reactor bottom thus blocking the outlets. KF/gamma-Al2O3/honeycomb ceramic (HC) monolithic catalyst which was prepared in this research can be utilized because of its thermal and mechanical stability. gamma-Al2O3 was deposited on the inert HC surface as a second carrier and KF acted as an active component. Loading ratio and loading intensity were both examined in order to select for catalyst with best catalytic performance. Optima reaction condition in the fixed-bed reactor was studied by investigating the effect of residence time, methanol/oil molar ratio and reaction temperature on oil conversion. Experiment results indicated that when the residence time was 33 min, the methanol/oil molar ratio was 18:1, the reaction temperature was 140 degrees C and with saturated vapor pressure, oil conversion could exceed 96%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that the KF/gamma-Al2O3/HC monolithic catalyst shared the same alkaline catalytic centers identical to KF/gamma-Al2O3.

Abstract: In this paper, to optimize the kind and capacity of renewable energy installed in each area, an optimization program was developed using a simple genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed algorithm, the kind and capacity of renewable energy was expressed using a chromosome model. The most efficient and economical system could be identified by applying the model in a random computer search. A case study was developed to test the proposed algorithm. In the case study, a solar power station was installed near 14 cities in Hokkaido, Japan, and a wind power station was installed seven areas. Using the algorithm, the system planning requirements for the interconnection of these renewable energy facilities over a large area were optimized. On the basis of these results, the kind and capacity of renewable energy considered to be the most economically advantageous to the region were identified and evaluated. Using the proposed optimization algorithm for planning and design, an efficient, economical, and interconnected system of electrical power could be realized from renewable energy over a large area.

Abstract: In electric vehicles, air-conditioning (AC) units and electric heaters have been used for dehumidifying and heating the cabin. However, the air heating process in the electric heater causes higher power consumption due to a lower air temperature entering the electric heater from the sensible cooling in the humidifying process. In this study, a heat pump (HP) and a dual-evaporator heat pump (DHP) combined with a heater are proposed as effective dehumidifying and heating units using waste heat recovery from the dehumidifying process. The performances of the AC, HP, and DHP systems were measured and compared by varying the indoor air wet bulb temperature and compressor speed ratio. Generally, the HP and DHP systems showed superior performance to the conventional AC system in the dehumidifying and heating operation. At the indoor air wet bulb temperature of 13 degrees C, the DHP system showed 53% and 62% higher specific moisture extraction rate and COP, respectively, than the HP system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The research focuses on the potential use of DGE (diethylene glycol diethyl ether), as a high-cetane number oxygenated additive to diesel-like fuels. Apart from evaluating its individual effects an investigation of how DGE can facilitate the use of bio-ethanol in diesel engines was conducted; which faces many technical difficulties, but can provide environmental advantages over biodiesel and conventional diesel fuel. Four partly renewable fuel blends with varying contents of DGE and ethanol were designed with overall diesel-replacement rate of 20%.
DGE was found to reduce gaseous emissions, achieving a simultaneous reduction in both soot and NO which highlighted the beneficial effects of its high cetane number and oxygen content. In ethanol-diesel blends small additions of DGE significantly enhanced blend stability and blend auto-ignition properties. Improvements in the NOx/soot trade-off characteristics were obtained for all blends. All tested blends produced lower particulate matter number concentrations and soot with characteristics that reduced their oxidation temperatures, hence providing benefits for diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration. Overall it was found that DGE fuel provides considerable energy and environmental benefits if used both as a single oxygenate with diesel or in multicomponent blends with ethanol and diesel.

Abstract: Using inexpensive and high-quality oil feedstock is an effective means to produce low-cost biodiesel. This work investigated the production and fuel properties of biodiesel derived from Hodgsonia macrocarpa (HM). The oil content of HM seed was 71.65 wt%, which is much higher than that of many potential oil plants. With traditional base-catalyzed transesterification, biodiesel was readily prepared from HM seed oil. The biodiesel yield was 95.46 wt% from HM seed oil. Biodiesel derived from HM met all ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications, except for oxidative stability (OS). The OS specifications of the two biodiesel standards were met after treatment of HM biodiesel with 400 ppm tertbutyl hydroquinone. The biodiesel exhibited excellent transportation safety and cold flow properties, with flash point of 153 degrees C, pour point of -9 degrees C, and cold filter plugging point of -7 degrees C.

Abstract: A solar-aided coal-fired power system (SACFPS) model with five load conditions (100%, 85%, 75%, 50%, and 40%) was built based on thermodynamic and thermoeconomic theories. SACFPS is a combination of a parabolic trough solar power system and a 660 MW coal-fired generation plant. The solar contribution evaluation method was introduced into the model to calculate the generation share of the solar power system. Results show that solar contribution decreases after an initial increase as effective solar normal irradiation increases. Optimization strategies, adjusting heat transfer fluid flow rate, have been proposed to maintain solar contribution at a high level. Thus, SACFPS with five load conditions has been optimized. This study also establishes a generation revenue function to evaluate the economics of SACFPS. Income generation of SACFPS after optimization is significantly higher than that without optimization.

Abstract: This work aims at optimizing life cycle performance of a hybrid combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) system incorporating with solar energy and natural gas. A basic natural gas CCHP system containing power generation unit, heat recovery system, hybrid cooling system and storage tank, is integrated with solar photovoltaic (PV) and/or heat collector. LCA optimization methodology is proposed to optimize the configuration and variable load operation of the solar-assisted CCHP system to minimize the life cycle environmental impact. CCHP schemes in following electrical load (FEL) and following thermal load (FTL) strategies are optimized by different objectives respectively.

Abstract: The objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of diesel fuel blend with n-butanol on the emission of turbocharged common rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engine and to compare the results with the neat diesel fuel operation case. The blends considered here were blends of diesel fuels with 10% and 20% (by volume) n-butanol. Engine performance and emission characteristics were measured by the European Stationary Cycle (ESC) test. Emissions of HCs, CO, NOx, HCHO, HCOOH and NH3 were measured by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Size and number distribution of particulate matter (PM) were measured by the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). From the results, for the n-butanol blend, NOx emission increased compared with the neat diesel fuel case. At the case of 20% butanol, both THC and CO emissions increased significantly, and both HCHO and HCOOH increased modestly under the low loading of ESC 7, 9 and 11 mode compared with the neat diesel fuel case. Higher blending ratio (>20%) of butanol fuels could contribute to the precursor of PAHs formation such as toluene and benzene in diesel combustion. BUS blend could be a better option to reduce the PM mass and the emissions of nanosized PM under 50 nm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Dual application of biomass for biohydrogen and biodiesel production could be considered a feasible option for economic and sustainable energy production from microalgae. In this study, after a large screening of fresh water microalgal isolates, Scenedesmus sp. NBRI012 and Chlorella sp. NBRIO29 have exhibited high biomass (1.31 +/- 0.11 and 2.62 +/- 0.13 g/L respectively) and lipid (244.44 +/- 12.3 and 587.38 +/- 20.2 mg/L respectively) yield with an organic carbon (acetate) source. Scenedesmus sp. NBRI012 has shown the highest H-2 (maximum evolution of 17.72% v/v H-2 of total gases) production; it produced H-2 continuously for seven days in sulfur-deprived TAP media. Sulfur deprivation during the H-2 production was found to increase the lipid content (410.03 +/- 18.5 mg/L) of the residual biomass. Fatty acid profile of the lipid extracted from the residual biomass of Scenedesmus sp. NBRI012 has showed abundance of fatty acids with a carbon chain length of C16 and C18. Cetane number, iodine value, and saponification value of biodiesel were found suitable according to the range given by the Indian standard (IS 15607), Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP255) and the European biodiesel standard EN14214.

Abstract: A general mathematical framework for the optimization of compressors operations in air separation plants that considers operating constraints for compressors, several types of maintenance policies and managerial aspects is presented. The proposed approach can be used in a rolling horizon scheme. The operating status, the power consumption, the startup and the shutdown costs for compressors, the compressor-to-header assignments as well as the outlet mass flow rates for compressed air and distillation products are optimized under full demand satisfaction. The power consumption in the compressors is expressed by regression functions that have been derived using technical and historical data. Several case studies of an industrial air separation plant are solved. The results demonstrate that the simultaneous optimization of maintenance and operational tasks of the compressors favor the generation of better solutions in terms of total costs.

Abstract: Since solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) produce electricity with high energy conversion efficiency, and chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a process for fuel conversion with inherent CO2 separation, a novel combined cycle integrating coal gasification, solid oxide fuel cell, and chemical looping combustion was configured and analyzed. A thermodynamic analysis based on energy and exergy was performed to investigate the performance of the integrated system and its sensitivity to major operating parameters. The major findings include that (1) the plant net power efficiency reaches 49.8% with similar to 100% CO2 capture for SOFC at 900 degrees C, 15 bar, fuel utilization factor = 0.85, fuel reactor temperature = 900 degrees C and air reactor temperature = 950 degrees C, using NiO as the oxygen carrier in the CLC unit. (2) In this parameter neighborhood the fuel utilization factor, the SOFC temperature and SOFC pressure have small effects on the plant net power efficiency because changes in pressure and temperature that increase the power generation by the SOFC tend to decrease the power generation by the gas turbine and steam cycle, and v.v.; an advantage of this system characteristic is that it maintains a nearly constant power output even when the temperature and pressure vary. (3) The largest exergy loss is in the gasification process, followed by those in the CO2 compression and the SOFC. (4) Compared with the CLC Fe2O3 and CuO oxygen carriers, NiO results in higher plant net power efficiency. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first analysis synergistically combining in a hybrid system: (1) coal gasification, (2) SOFC, and (3) CLC, which results in a system of high energy efficiency with full CO2 capture, and advances the progress towards the world's critically needed approach to "clean coal".

Abstract: In this paper, we experimentally investigated the time evolution of compositions in the gas phase and the hydrate slurry during long-term operations of hydrate-based CO2 separation. We performed continuous gas separation experiments at pressure of 2.3 MPa and temperature of 273.2 K. We continually analyzed the compositions in the gas phase and the hydrate slurry formed from CH4 + CO2 gas mixture (CH4:CO2= 0.40:0.60). We also carried out thermodynamic simulations under the same conditions to confirm the reliability of thermodynamic simulations for hydrate-based CO2 separation. We experimentally succeeded in separating CO2 from CH4 + CO2 gas mixture and understanding the time evolutions of compositions in the gas phase and the hydrate slurry. The compositions in the gas phase and the hydrate slurry reached a steady state in 15 h. The composition of CH4 in the gas phase and that of CO2 in the hydrate slurry reached 0.61 and 0.76 at the steady state, respectively. The deviations of the compositions in the gas phase and the hydrate slurry between the continuous gas separation experiments and thermodynamic simulations are 0.01 and 0.02, respectively. These results demonstrated that long-term operations of hydrate-based CO2 separation can be put into practice and support the reliability of thermodynamic simulations for hydrate-based CO2 separation.

Abstract: Three phase battery energy storage (BES) installed in the residential low voltage (LV) distribution network can provide functions such as peak shaving and valley filling (i.e. charge when demand is low and discharge when demand is high), load balancing (i.e. charge more from phases with lower loads and discharge more to phases with higher loads) and management of distributed renewable energy generation (i.e. charge when rooftop solar photovoltaics are generating). To accrue and enable these functions an intelligent scheduling system was developed. The scheduling system can reliably schedule the charge and discharge cycles and operate the BES in real time. The scheduling system is composed of three integrated modules: (1) a load forecast system to generate next-day load profile forecasts; (2) a scheduler to derive an initial charge and discharge schedule based on load profile forecasts; and (3) an online control algorithm to mitigate forecast error through continuous schedule adjustments. The scheduling system was applied to an LV distribution network servicing 128 residential customers located in an urban region of South East Queensland, Australia. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Demand-side management programs such as load shifting utilise the flexibility in the load consumption pattern of consumers to enable the effective capacity utilisation of renewable energy sources. The locational and temporal characteristics of renewable energy sources cause forecasting and operational challenges in the implementation of such a renewable energy program. In this paper, a dynamic load-shifting program using real-time data in a cloud computing framework is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. A new dynamic renewable factor is proposed to facilitate on-time incentive based load shifting program. The effectiveness of the dynamic load-shifting program was evaluated using simulated case studies. The case study indicates that PV energy utilisation at the consumer side is increased by 18% by the application of the proposed load-shifting program. The study result in Kerala, India, consisting of more than 7.5 million domestic consumers, indicates that demand reduction of 250-300 MW at times of peak demand can be achieved by using load shifting in the domestic sector.

Abstract: Metal-based fuel-borne catalysts (FBCs) have been used with diesel fuels to effectively reduce soot and diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions from both on-road and off-road applications. However, there is a lack of detailed investigations on the potential changes in the properties of particulates, when FBCs-doped fuels are combusted in diesel engines. This study fully evaluates the potential impacts of ferrocene-doped ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuels on physical, chemical and toxicological characteristics of the particulates emitted by a single cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine working at a constant speed and at three engine loads. The results indicated that ferrocene-doped fuels could effectively reduce the particulate mass and elemental carbon (EC) emissions, while increasing the proportion of both organic carbon (OC) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in particles. Particle-phase PAHs and n-alkanes emissions increased with an increase of Fe in the fuels. Ferrocene addition also led to lower soot ignition temperature and activation energy. However, the total number emissions of particles from ferrocene-doped fuels dramatically increased due to the formation of Fe-rich nuclei mode particles. Compared to pure ULSD, the particles emitted from ferrocene-doped fuels showed a slight decline in cell viability. The Fe in the particles and the changes in chemical composition of particulates are thought to be responsible for the variation of cell viability. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is attracting increasing attention since it can assist to improve the efficiency and reliability of power grid, as well as reduce the operating cost and greenhouse gas emission of electric vehicles. Within the scheme of V2G operation, PEVs are expected to serve as a novel distributed energy storage system (ESS) to help achieve the balance between supply and demand of power grid. One of the key difficulties concerning its practical implementation lies in that the availability of PEVs as ESS for grid remains highly uncertain due to their mobility as transportation tools. To address this issue, a novel event-triggered scheduling scheme for V2G operation based on the scenario of stochastic PEV connection to smart grid is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the mathematical model is formulated. Secondly, the preparation of input data for systematic evaluation is introduced and the case study is conducted. Finally, statistic analysis results demonstrate that our proposed V2G scheduling scheme can dramatically smooth out the fluctuation in power load profiles. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There is a strong motivation to explore the possibility of harnessing solar thermal energy around the world, especially in locations with temperate weather. This review discusses the current status of heat transfer fluid, which is one of the critical components for storing and transferring thermal energy in concentrating solar power systems. Various types of heat transfer fluids including air, water/steam, thermal oils, organic fluids, molten-salts and liquid metals are reviewed in detail, particularly regarding the melting temperature, thermal stability limit and corrosion issues. Stainless steels and nickel based alloys are the typical piping and container materials for heat transfer fluids. Stability of the stainless steels and alloys while in contact with heat transfer fluids is very important for the longevity of concentrating solar power systems. Corrosion properties of stainless steels and nickel based alloys in different heat transfer fluids are discussed in terms of corrosion rates. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Wireless charging, as opposed to plug-in charging, is an alternative charging method for electric vehicles (EVs) with rechargeable batteries and can be applicable to EVs with fixed routes, such as transit buses. This study adds to the current research of EV wireless charging by utilizing the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to provide a comprehensive framework for comparing the life cycle energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions associated with a stationary wireless charging all-electric bus system to a plug-in charging all-electric bus system. Life cycle inventory analysis of both plug-in and wireless charging hardware was conducted, and battery downsizing, vehicle lightweighting and use-phase energy consumption were modeled, A bus system in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti area in Michigan is used as the basis for bus system modeling. Results show that the wirelessly charged battery can be downsized to 27-44% of a plug-in charged battery. The associated reduction of 12-16% in bus weight for the wireless buses can induce a reduction of 5.4-7.0% in battery-to-wheel energy consumption. In the base case, the wireless charging system consumes 0.3% less energy and emits 0.5% less greenhouse gases than the plug-in charging system in the total life cycle. To further improve the energy and environmental performance of a wireless charging electric bus system, it is important to focus on key parameters including carbon intensity of the electric grid and wireless charging efficiency, If the wireless charging efficiency is improved to the same level as the assumed plug-in charging efficiency (90%), the difference of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions between the two systems can increase to 6.3%.

Abstract: Both numerical and experimental studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of an omni-flow wind turbine designed to provide renewable electricity on the top of urban buildings like skyscrapers. The numerical approach was based on Finite Volume Method (FVM) and the turbulence flow was studied with several commonly used Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models. The results of the study were evaluated with the wind tunnel test results over a range of tip speed ratios. The numerical results showed the effect of blade number on both power output and starting capability. Although both the power and torque coefficient were improved significantly by the optimisation of the blade number, there was only a slight change when the blade number was greater than twenty. The results from wind tunnel testing also showed excellent starting capability with a starting wind velocity as low as 1.6 m/s. A numerical simulation was also conducted for the wind turbine working under non-uniform flow conditions. The numerical results have shown that the peak power coefficient of such a wind turbine under non-uniform flow, was lower than that under the uniform flow. Additionally, the applied thrust on a blade was subject to frequent and periodical changes. However, the effect of the change of thrust in magnitude and frequency was not significant. Therefore the omni-flow wind turbine has the potential to meet the challenge of unpredictable wind velocity and direction as a consequence of the urban environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The effects of the use of low biodiesel blends in performance, fuel consumption and NO emissions was investigated during tests carried out with a Renault Megane 1.5 dCi equipped with recent injection and exhaust emission control technologies. To accomplish this goal, several tests were performed using the European homologation cycle concerning CO2 emissions of vehicles, known as the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). This was executed using a chassis dynamometer, a fuel weighting equipment, an exhaust emissions analyzer and the software developed to acquire data and control the execution of the cycle. Besides the accomplishment of the NEDC cycle tests with three diverse fuel blends, performance tests were also realized, enabling to get the full load engine response considering the use of different fuels.
The chosen biodiesel produced from original oils of soybean (84%) and palm (16%), was mixed in proportions of 0%, 7%, and 20% on a volumetric basis, allowing to test comparatively the results for these different fuel blends (B0, B7 and B20).
The obtained results reveal some interesting findings regarding all the involved aspects. The consumption was not consistently increased with the use of biodiesel, revealing the existence of other factors besides the lower heating value to explain the fuel consumption differences. Likewise, the NOx emissions with biodiesel use does not present significant raise. In fact, when B20 was used, the levels of NOx emitted by the vehicle present a reduction in all the NEDC, which was more pronounced in the urban part of the NEDC. The performance analysis did not reveal any relevant differences, however the use of B7 promote an improvement on torque and power in the order of 2% relatively to B0. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Analytical expressions for the electrical efficiencies (eta(m)) of building integrated opaque photovoltaic thermal (BIOPVT) systems based on thin film photovoltaic (PV) modules have been derived. The expressions are valid for different climatic conditions and different design parameters of the building. The systems based on a-Si, CdTe and CIGS thin film solar modules have been analyzed for their energy, exergy and characteristics performance with and without air duct, for a typical day of Srinagar, India. The module daily average electrical efficiency (eta(m)) and average room temperature (T-r) of a BIOPVT system based on a-Si solar modules without air duct were found to be 7.25% and 18.7 degrees C respectively, whereas with air duct the eta(m) and T-r of the same system have been found to be 7.57% and 15.2 degrees C respectively. The number of air changes (N) and mass flow rates ((m) over dot(f)) have been found to have a significant effect on T-r. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy storage may serve as a solution to the integration challenges of high penetrations of wind, helping to reduce curtailment, provide system balancing services, and reduce emissions. This study determines the minimum cost configuration of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), wind turbines, and natural gas reciprocating engines in an off-grid model. A life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to determine the system configuration needed to achieve a variety of CO2-eq emissions targets. The relationship between total system costs and life cycle emissions are used to optimize the generation mixes to achieve emissions targets at the least cost and determine when VRFBs are preferable over wind curtailment. Different greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets are defined for the off-grid system and the minimum cost resource configuration is determined to meet those targets. This approach determines when the use of VRFBs is more cost effective than wind curtailment in reaching GHG emissions targets. The research demonstrates that while incorporating energy storage consistently reduces life cycle carbon emissions, it is not cost effective to reduce curtailment except under very low emission targets (190 g of CO2-eq/kW h and less for the examined system). This suggests that "overbuilding" wind is a more viable option to reduce life cycle emissions for all but the most ambitious carbon mitigation targets. The findings show that adding VRFB as energy storage could be economically preferable only when wind curtailment exceeds 66% for the examined system. The results were most sensitive to VRFB costs, natural gas upstream emissions (e.g. methane leakage), and wind capital cost. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In two earlier papers we proposed a process assumption-based design method, one aim of which is the determination of the thermal requirement of a building by investigating the building functioning as a dynamic thermal system. The principal constraint of that determination is the building indoor temperature range to be no more than 2 degrees C. In this paper we focus on the thermal requirement of maximum WWR (window-to-wall ratio) allowed by the constraint as a function of envelope U-value and ambient temperature amplitude. Seven US cities are studied to represent a range of ambient temperature amplitudes. As the window part of a building's envelope is a prominent architectural feature of the building, WWR and its allowed maximum in terms of thermal autonomy are the signature/reflection of local ambient temperature amplitude and the variety of envelopes of building stock in each locality. Such signal characteristics are otherwise referred to as regional architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A limited hydrogen (H-2) energy share due to knocking is the major hurdle for effective utilization of H-2 in compression ignition (CI) engines under dual-fuel operation. The present study aims at improvement of H-2 energy share in a 7.4 kW direct injection Cl engine under dual-fuel mode with two low temperature combustion (LTC) strategies; (i) retarded pilot fuel injection timing and (ii) water injection. Experiments were carried out under conventional strategies of diesel dual-fuel mode (DDM) and B20 dual-fuel mode (BDM); and LTC strategies of retarded injection timing dual-fuel mode (RDM) and water injected dual-fuel mode (WDM). The results explored that the H-2 energy share increased significantly from 18% with conventional DDM to 24, and 36% with RDM, and WDM respectively. The energy efficiency increased with increasing H-2 energy share under dual-fuel operation; however, for a particular energy share of 18% H-2, it decreased from 34.8% with DDM to 33.7% with BDM, 32.7% with WDM and 29.9% with RDM. At 18% H-2 energy share, oxides of nitrogen emission decreased by 37% with RDM and 32% with WDM as compared to conventional DDM due to reduction of in-cylinder temperature, while it increased slightly about 5% with BDM. It is emerged from the study that water injection technique is the viable option among all other strategies to enhance the H-2 energy share in the engine with a slight penalty of increase in smoke, hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide emissions.

Abstract: This paper aims to present an investigation into the operational performance of a novel heat pump assisted solar facade loop-heat-pipe (LHP) water heating system using both theoretical and experimental methods. This involved (1) development of a computer numerical model; (2) simulation of the operational performance of the system by using the model; (3) test rig construction; and (4) dedicated experiment for verification of the model. It was found that the established model is able to predict the operational performance of the system at a reasonable accuracy. Analyses of the research results indicated that under the selected testing conditions, the average thermal efficiency of the LHP module was around 71%, much higher than that of the loop heat pipe without heat pump assistance. The thermal efficiency of the LHP module grew when the heat pump was turned-on and fell when the heat pump was turned-off. The water temperature remained a steadily growing trend throughout the heat pump turned-on period. Neglecting the heat loss of the water tank, the highest coefficient of the performance could reach up to 6.14 and its average value was around 4.93. In overall, the system is a new facade integrated, highly efficient and aesthetically appealing solar water heating configuration; wide deployment of the system will help reduce fossil fuel consumption in the building sector and carbon emission to the environment.

Abstract: In the current situation of the energy crisis, the mining industry has been identified as a promising area for application of demand side management (DSM) techniques. This paper investigates the potential for energy-cost savings and actual energy savings, by implementation of variable speed drives to ventilation fans in underground mines. In particular, ventilation on demand is considered in the study, i.e., air volume is adjusted according to the demand at varying times. Two DSM strategies, energy efficiency (EE) and load management (LM), are formulated and analysed. By modelling the network with the aid of Kirchhoffs laws and Tellegen's theorem, a nonlinear constrained minimization model is developed, with the objective of achieving EE. The model is also made to adhere to the fan laws, such that the fan power at its operating points is found to achieve realistic results. LM is achieved by finding the optimal starting time of the mining schedule, according to the time of use (TOU) tariff. A case study is shown to demonstrate the effects of the optimization model. The study suggests that by combining load shifting and energy efficiency techniques, an annual energy saving of 2540035 kW h is possible, leading to an annual cost saving of USD 277035.

Abstract: Renewable energy in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, particular solar energy, can be connected to Europe to provide the Northern neighbouring countries with electricity. To achieve this long term objective, it is necessary to understand the local domestic consumption of electricity in the MENA region as the main consumer of energy. The understanding of current and future trends could help to provide a complete picture of the energy situation in MENA region and the feasibility of exporting energy to Europe. For this reason, this paper investigates the domestic energy use and occupants' energy behaviour in Libya. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of domestic energy consumption and householders' awareness, attitudes and behaviour on the overall energy consumption in Libya and how this could affect the peak demand, capacity, future trends and government energy budget. The paper also investigates the sustainability aspect of consumer products and the awareness and attitude of consumers towards consumption and demand. A comprehensive survey has been conducted to evaluate several aspects of domestic energy demand and characteristics in Libya. The findings have indicated that there is a significant increase in energy demands in the household sector in Libya and it is significant to have a clear strategy to reduce carbon emission and energy use by improving occupants' behaviour as well as utilising other sustainable measures. Minor adjustment in householders' energy consumption behaviour and the technology used to generate energy could provide significant financial savings and contribute significantly to the reduction in carbon emission and energy consumption. This will allow significant benefit to the local economy and the energy sector in Libya but at the same time could provide sustainable energy resources for Europe on the long term.

Abstract: The potential to reschedule part of the electricity demand in energy systems is seen as a significant opportunity to improve the efficiency of the systems, especially on remote and isolated systems. From the supply point of view, that flexibility might bring significant improvements to the generation dispatch, especially when in the presence of renewable resources; from the demand point of view, that flexibility could allow customers to benefit from reducing their energy bills. To study these types of implications, modeling tools have been introducing the possibility to include flexible loads on the optimization process, although some use very simplified methodologies to do it. This study compares how different modeling tools consider fixed and flexible loads in the dispatch optimization, analyzing their different strategies. Three different scenarios were simulated in HOMER, EnergyPLAN and an economic dispatch self-built model in Matlab, using as case study the Corvo Island, Portugal. The comparison results indicate that HOMER and EnergyPLAN still assume that flexible loads are a second priority load that are met in off-peak hours or in the presence of excess electricity from renewable sources, not taking directly into account the economic impact of such decision. On the other hand, the self-built model that is more flexible on the optimization approach is the more close to the actual operation and presents the best savings when using demand response strategies, albeit representing only a 0.3% decrease in the operation costs. We conclude that the modeling tools should evolve and refine their optimization strategies to capture the total benefits of using demand response to improve energy systems performance.

Abstract: This paper develops a robust multi-criteria Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based building energy efficiency benchmarking approach. The approach is explicitly selective to address multicollinearity trap due to the subjectivity in selecting energy variables by considering cost-accuracy trade-off. It objectively weights the relative importance of individual pertinent efficiency measuring criteria using either multiple linear regression or principal component analysis contingent on meta data quality. Through this approach, building energy performance is comprehensively evaluated and optimized. Simultaneously, the significant challenges associated with conventional single-criterion benchmarking models can be avoided. Together with a clustering algorithm on a three-year panel dataset, the benchmarking case of 324 single-family dwellings demonstrated an improved robustness of the presented multi-criteria benchmarking approach over the conventional single-criterion ones.

Abstract: China has shown growing interest in market-based CO2 pricing and is expected to establish a nationwide emission trading system by 2016. This study investigates the implications of CO2 price for China's power sector decarbonization up to 2050, incorporating different scenarios of fuel prices and the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. An adapted low-carbon generation expansion planning (GEP) model is used to determine the least-cost decarbonization pathways. The implications of the CO2 price are analyzed from the technical, environmental and economic perspectives for 32 scenarios. This study finds that, first of all, a high CO2 price is conducive to achieve a high degree of decarbonization in a cost-effective way, but only if CCS technology is available. Secondly, higher fuel prices undermine or nullify the effect of CO2 pricing on the power decarbonization. Thirdly, the optimal share of renewable energy source (RES) power generation depends on its comparative cost-advantage over CCS-integrated power generation in this study, and the cost-advantage is largely influenced by CO2 prices. Hence, policy makers should coordinate the mandatory targets for RES power generation with CO2 pricing, otherwise, these targets might become redundant or entail extra costs. The findings can be used for China's policy makers regarding the design of cost-effective power sector decarbonization packages complementing CO2 pricing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A conceptually simple and powerful method to reduce CO2 emissions from Alberta oil sands operations by decarbonizing natural gas (NG) fuel prior to combustion is proposed, thus removing carbon from the process up front. The natural gas decarbonization (NGD) process can be integrated with either in situ bitumen recovery or upgrading processes or both. The process generates hydrogen and carbon black, a stable marketable form of carbon. Decarbonizing the NG fuel to hydrogen reduces downstream CO2 emissions and obviates the requirement for CO2 sequestration since the carbon is stored in a solid form. The hydrogen can be used as either a fuel for steam generation or for hydrotreating. In addition, steam is generated from the hydrogen combustion reaction itself. A near-zero emissions process is achievable by using the hydrogen generated as the fuel for decarbonization. We used process modeling to assess the performance of hydrogen production and steam generation using two major process integration concepts: (i) Oxy-NG combustion integrated with the NGD process and (ii) Substantially zero emissions concept via an autothermal process using hydrogen product as the energy source for the process NGD process. Though energy penalties are incurred in the decarbonization process, we identify several potential practical process options. The proposed technology is particularly suitable for heavy oil recovery and upgrading, and fuel combustion for power generation. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The study presents the use of genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the bipolar plate channel geometry of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Contrary to previous optimization techniques, laborious fuel cell design steps, including boundary setting, mesh generation, and numerical computation at every design parameter variation step, are avoided by developing an automated program via Matlab and Comsol Multiphysics software. GA with Matlab automatically checks the optimality of the present fuel cell design with a performance index obtained from Comsol Multiphysics. If a global optimal is not reached, the new geometry set of a fuel cell is generated according to GA rules toward better fuel cell performance. The new set is then fed back to Comsol Multiphysics to have the new performance index calculated through updated boundary conditions, element and mesh generations, and numerical analysis. This automated optimization technique not only saves numerous calculations, but also obtains the global optimal result of a given fuel cell geometry. Therefore, it provides a fast and efficient optimization process and renders optimal results. In this study, two channel and rib geometry arrangements are studied: one with a symmetric anode and cathode channel arrangement, wherein channels and ribs face each other; and another with an asymmetric arrangement, wherein a channel faces a rib and vice versa. First, the two-dimensional (2D) CFD model is used to obtain the optimal result in order to speed up the optimization calculation, slightly sacrificing the model accuracy. Afterwards, the three-dimensional CFD model is utilized and experimental verification is made with the same geometries to support the validation of the 2D optimization result. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study MgO-promoted Fe2O3 hematite oxygen carriers were synthesized from various Mg sources and evaluated for methane chemical looping combustion. Particles suitable for fluidized bed flow reactor studies were prepared in the lab. Cyclic CLC tests conducted in the fluidized bed with MgO promoted hematite showed better performance than that with hematite. Attrition resistance of laboratory prepared MgO promoted hematite was excellent. Reactivity and stability of the oxygen carrier materials were also tested in the thermogravimetric analyzer and bench-scale reactors. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used to study the morphology and elemental compositions present in the hematite and promoted hematite oxygen carriers prior to and following the multi-cycle chemical looping reaction. The incorporation of 5 wt% MgO led to an increased reaction rate and an increase in oxygen utilized as compared to the pure hematite oxygen carrier. Possible reasons for the promotion effect by MgO were evaluated. These studies reveal that the best performing oxygen carrier was the 5 wt% MgO/Fe2O3 which exhibited no observed degradation in the kinetics and conversion performance in the methane step over 15 reduction and oxidation cycles. The Mg promoted oxygen carrier also showed reduced coke formation as compared to the pure hematite carrier. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Integration of fluctuating renewables like wind and solar power is nowadays a hot topic, but this comes at a cost of decreased stability of the power system. The deterioration often translates into so-called spikes and drops in the electricity spot price, very large (even extreme) deviations from the regular spot price, followed by a reversion to roughly the original level a few days later. We use the spikes and drops as an strong indication that there is an imbalance in the physical power system in this paper.
Independent Spike Models (ISM) is a popular class of models for the electricity spot price that uses regime switching, typically having three regimes (base regime, spikes and drops). We fit a such model to Nord Pool spot data to characterize the size and intensity of these deviations, and proceed by augmenting the standard second generation, three factor Independent Spike Model by relating the spike and drop intensity to several factors and find strong statistical support for relating the consumption to the spike and drop intensity.
The model is then used to quantitatively evaluate the effects when modifying the consumption in order to mimic how additional renewables are integrated into the power system or conversely the effects when smoothing consumption using 'strategies that can be implemented in smart grids. We use this tool to obtain a direct measure of how much the spike and drop intensity can be reduced by smoothing the consumption and see that even a small increase in the variability of the consumption translates into decreased stability (more spikes and/or drops) of the power system.

Abstract: Energy sources are scarce in the chilly, high mountains of the developing world, Solar-assisted biogas digesters have recently been adapted to this climate providing an alternative cooking fuel for some rural families, but little is known about the thermal performance of these digesters. Internal slurry temperature is one of the important design factors in bio-digesters. This study conducted a series of field experiments on an experimental bio-digester in Cusco, Peru to investigate the thermal performance of these affordable bio-digesters. The study further improved and validated a one-dimensional thermal computer simulation model using the experimental results. A set of design recommendations for small-scale, cold-climate digesters is presented based on parametric analysis of the validated model for several key design parameters. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The development of hybrid electric two wheelers in recent years has targeted the reduction of on road emissions produced by these vehicles. However, added cost and complexity have resulted in the failure of these systems to meet consumer expectations. This paper presents a comparative study of the energy economy and essential costs of alternative forms of small two wheelers such as scooters or low capacity motorcycles. This includes conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric variants. Through simulations of vehicle driving range using two popular driving cycles it is demonstrated that there is considerable benefit in fuel economy realised by hybridising such vehicles. However, the added costs associated with electrification, i.e. motor/generator, power electronics, and energy storage provide a significant cost obstacle to the purchase of such vehicles. Only the pure electric configuration is demonstrated to be cost effective over its life in comparison to conventional two wheelers. Both the hybrid electric and plug-in equivalents must overcome significant upfront costs to be cost competitive with conventional vehicles. This is demonstrated to be achieved if the annual driving range of the vehicle is increased substantially from the assumed mean. Given the shorter distances travelled by most two wheeler drivers it can therefore be concluded that the development of similar hybrid electric vehicles are unlikely to achieve the desired acceptance that pure electric or conventional equivalents currently achieve.

Abstract: Malaysia has abundant potentials of renewable energy resources mainly because of its rich agriculture that makes high potential in bio-power and its tropical climate, which provides sufficient sunlight for utilization of solar systems. Feed in Tariff mechanism has been applied since 2011 in Malaysia to expand utilization of renewable energy for electricity generation. In this study, a broad range of data is gathered to develop a comprehensive system dynamics model to evaluate the impacts of Feed in Tariff mechanism on the generation mix of Malaysia during a 20-year period between 2011 and 2030. Results demonstrate that although the policy may lead to a satisfactory level of target achievement but the Malaysian government may face an increasing shortage in its RE fund budget starting around 2019 unless it increases its income sources by rising the surcharges on electricity bills or decreases its expenditures by optimizing the amount of FiT payments in different periods. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that the more funding will not lead to a more sustainable generation mix unless it is paid in the right time and in the right direction. Using this model, policymakers can carry out analysis to determine the amount of money that must be collected from the electricity consumers through the surcharges on electricity bills as well as the amount of feed in tariff to be paid for different renewable resources in different periods.

Abstract: The study tests two behavioral intervention programs that were aimed at changing energy-related behaviors in an office setting. Participants were 93 office employees in three different departments of a construction company. Each department was randomly assigned to a four-week intervention to one of the following three conditions: control, intervention program or intervention program with group identity salience. The first intervention condition consisted of goal-setting, feedback, information and prompts. The second condition was identical to the first, with an additional group-identity manipulation. Three different types of data were collected: consumption of electricity and paper, pre- and post-questionnaires and weekly observations. The results show that the employees in the two experimental conditions perceived themselves to have changed their behaviors more than the control group. This is supported by the observational data for the intervention program, but could not be shown in the measures of energy consumption, which showed a decrease for all three departments. The implications of these results are discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study examines and decomposes dynamic changes in total factor carbon emissions performance within the transportation sector in China, incorporating the impact of regional heterogeneity. For this purpose, we combine the metafrontier approach with the non-radial Luenberger productivity indicator to propose a new definition named the metafrontier non-radial Luenberger carbon emission performance index (MNLCPI). This total factor index includes the efficiency change, best-practice gap change, and metafrontier technology gap change indexes. This method is capable of measuring dynamic changes in total factor carbon emissions performance over time via the production frontier framework and can incorporate group heterogeneity and non-radial slack into its measurement of total factor carbon emission performance. Empirical results applying this method show a 6.2% increase in overall total factor carbon emissions performance for the 2000-2012 period. This growth in carbon emissions performance is mainly driven by technological innovation, and different growth patterns are observed across China's three main areas in transport sector.

Abstract: A new analytical model is presented for simulation of ground thermal effects from vertical borehole heat exchangers (BHEs). It represents an extension of the moving line source equation and efficiently describes the coupled transient effects from geothermal energy extraction, subsurface heat conduction, horizontal groundwater flow and spatially variable land use. It is successfully verified by comparison with an equivalent numerical model and validated by application to a field case with detailed long-term temperature monitoring. Non-dimensional sensitivity analysis reveals the coupled influence of advection and conduction for different assumptions of the land surface. Especially accelerated heat flux from asphalt or buildings at the land surface is shown to have a remarkable impact on the thermal conditions in the ground. Together with the flow velocity of the groundwater, it determines the intensity, form and steady-state of the thermal anomaly induced from BHE operation. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Demand Response (DR) is one of the typical methods for optimizing load characteristics in power systems. Utilities offer DR schemes to generate incentives toward consumers' power consumption behavior for load optimization. In tariff planning, power consumption variation is an important issue which is difficult to be analyzed quantifiably. This paper develops a boundary model for analyzing consumers' power consumption behaviors, with a particular focus on residential home appliances. Candidate tariffs are analyzed in this model for their load variation potentials. Using three case studies, this paper reflects the potential for practical applications of the model on pricing and smart meter deployment. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel linear Fresnel reflector which employs the evacuated tube, CPC secondary reflector, and uses molten salt as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) was designed and studied in this paper. A 3D optical model was developed to simulate the radiation transmission within the system with Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method. Based on the model, firstly, the optical performance of the systems using cylindrical and parabolic mirrors was compared. Then the local solar flux distribution on the absorber surface and the optical efficiency were computed. Then the effects of the slope error, time and location, etc. were investigated. Finally, the thermal performance was investigated by coupling the MCRT with the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The optical simulation results indicate that the system with optimized cylindrical mirrors can achieve nearly the same performance as the one with parabolic mirrors. The solar flux distribution on the absorber exhibits a non-uniform characteristic which can be improved by using mirrors with proper slope error. The instantaneous optical efficiency of 65.0% at normal incidence and the annual mean optical efficiency which ranges between 55.2% and 34.8% from the equator to N50 degrees can be achieved. The numerical results indicate that the temperature profiles on the absorber follow the non-uniform solar flux. The collector efficiencies are all above 46.0% under the studied conditions. Both the thermal efficiency and the collector efficiency increase with decreasing salt temperature and with increasing radiation. These results suggest that the introduced system is a feasible choice for using molten salt as the HTF in Fresnel system. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Oxidation behavior of dodecane and two mixtures of dodecane and m-xylene (90/10 wt.% and 80/20 wt.%) over an Rh catalyst in a meso-scale heat recirculating combustor was examined to isolate the effect of aromatic content on performance. The fuel conversion, product selectivities, and reaction kinetics were calculated, and the global combustion behavior observed. The results showed that increasing the amount of m-xylene in the fuel increased the fuel conversion from 85% (pure dodecane) to 92% (90/10) and further to 98% (80/20). The presence of xylene also significantly increased CO2/H2O selectivity and decreased CO/H-2 selectivity. Global activation energy increased linearly with increase in xylene content, supporting that addition of aromatic species to fuel lowers the overall reactivity. The non-catalytic reaction was also simulated using Chemkin software to determine the effect of the Rh catalyst on the combustor performance and to analyze the difference in chemical mechanisms. The results revealed that the catalyst promotes total oxidation over partial oxidation, and lowers the global activation energy by up to 70%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Exploitation of natural gas hydrate is expecting to be an important strategic way to solve the problem of energy depletion. Understanding the effectiveness of the well configuration plays a pivotal role in gas production from the hydrate reservoir. This study evaluates the methane hydrate dissociation behaviors using both vertical well and horizontal well experimentally. Methane hydrate in porous media has been synthesized in a 117.8 L pilot-scale hydrate simulator (PHS), which is equipped with 9 (3 x 3) vertical wells and 9 (3 x 3) horizontal wells. The condition of hydrate formation is corresponding to the ocean depth of 1200 m and it is similar to the hydrate characteristics of the South China Sea. Hydrate is dissociated under depressurization and thermal stimulation. The results indicate that, for the depressurization and thermal stimulation methods, the gas production rate, the heat transfer rate, and the accumulative dissociation ratio with the horizontal well pattern are higher than those with the vertical well pattern. Meanwhile, the evaluations of the energy ratio and the thermal efficiency indicate that the horizontal well pattern has the advantage of higher production efficiency by the thermal stimulation. Thus, it is determined that the production performance is better using the horizontal well pattern. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper shows a new advanced control approach for operations in hybrid systems equipped with solid oxide fuel cell technology. This new tool, which combines feed-forward and standard proportional-integral techniques, controls the system during load changes avoiding failures and stress conditions detrimental to component life. This approach was selected to combine simplicity and good control performance. Moreover, the new approach presented in this paper eliminates the need for mass flow rate meters and other expensive probes, as usually required for a commercial plant. Compared to previous works, better performance is achieved in controlling fuel cell temperature (maximum gradient significantly lower than 3 K/min), reducing the pressure gap between cathode and anode sides (at least a 30% decrease during transient operations), and generating a higher safe margin (at least a 10% increase) for the Steam-to-Carbon Ratio.
This new control system was developed and optimized using a hybrid system transient model implemented, validated and tested within previous works. The plant, comprising the coupling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack with a microturbine, is equipped with a bypass valve able to connect the compressor outlet with the turbine inlet duct for rotational speed control. Following model development and tuning activities, several operative conditions were considered to show the new control system increased performance compared to previous tools (the same hybrid system model was used with the new control approach). Special attention was devoted to electrical load steps and ramps considering significant changes in ambient conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Desiccant wheels are effective dehumidification devices. The performance of desiccant dehumidification and cooling systems is examined in this paper. Based on a theoretical investigation, six kinds of systems (systems A-F) were analyzed as the system changed from being reversible to being irreversible, which sharply reduced performance. The performance of system E, which is composed of an actual desiccant wheel, an actual heat recovery exchanger, and an actual single-stage heat pump, represents the relatively high standards that actual systems can achieve. Under the designed working conditions, COP and exergy efficiency of system E were 5.0 and 18.3%, respectively. Based on the analysis of a real ventilation cycle, it was found that to improve the system's performance, over-dehumidification should be avoided, and heat sources with low exergy destruction should be utilized. To avoid over-dehumidification, the direct evaporative cooler at the processed air side should be replaced by a sensible heat exchanger. When the electrical heater is replaced by a heat pump system, the performance of such a system can be improved, especially when pre-cooling is adopted. The proposed heat pump-driven system had similar schematic and performance characteristics as system E, with COP and exergy efficiency being 5.01 and 18.0%, respectively, under the same working conditions.

Abstract: A new Wind Speed Forecasting (WSF) model, suitable for a short term 1-24 h forecast horizon, is developed by adapting Hammerstein model to an Autoregressive approach. The model is applied to real data collected for a period of three years (2004-2006) from two different sites. The performance of HAR model is evaluated by comparing its prediction with the classical Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and a multi-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Results show that the HAR model outperforms both the ARIMA model and ANN model in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). When compared to the conventional models, the new HAR model can better capture various wind speed characteristics, including asymmetric (non-gaussian) wind speed distribution, non-stationary time series profile, and the chaotic dynamics. The new model is beneficial for various applications in the renewable energy area, particularly for power scheduling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To achieve clean energy targets, more renewable generators - mainly wind and photovoltaic (PV) - are being integrated into electricity networks. However, wind and PV are non-synchronous generators to the grid and they traditionally have neither enough inertia response nor governor support to control major frequency excursions under most situations. Currently in South Australia, the combined generation of wind and rooftop PV has nearly reached the level of average demand with minor support through interconnection import. In such a situation it is likely that there may be fewer synchronous machines online for frequency regulation. Under such a scenario, a contingency could produce a more severe frequency excursion, violating in place frequency standards. Further, many distributed PV systems in South Australia may have a default under-frequency protection setting, which could be higher than the under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) threshold. Hence, a moderate generation/import trip may cause a massive secondary PV trip, which may result in an unacceptably low frequency, triggering further load shedding. This will certainly have an adverse impact on network security. A similar issue of secondary PV trip is not restricted to South Australia and may occur in other regions and countries as well. In this paper, a network which loosely represents the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is selected and modified to investigate and analyze network frequency response under high non-synchronous machine penetration. This network contains all necessary models for a comprehensive frequency response study, such as synchronous machine, governor, stabilizer and wind generator. The relevant functions such as load frequency relief, PV tripping and load shedding which are essential for frequency response evaluation are established in the approved and well-accepted platform - PSS (R) E. The results show that low inertia and secondary PV tripping can become serious issues for network frequency regulation and in some situations they can even cause system oscillation and stability concerns.

Abstract: In this paper, an energy management strategy is proposed for a series plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. A number of quadratic equations are employed to determine the engine fuel-rate with respect to battery power. The problem is solved by using quadratic programming and simulated annealing method together to find the optimal battery power commands and the engine-on power. The influences induced by the inertias of the engine and generators are analyzed to improve the calculation precision. In addition, the state of health of the battery is taken into account to extend the application of the proposed method. Simulations were performed to verify that the proposed algorithm can decrease fuel consumption of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The hypothesis of this paper is that in order to identify least cost solutions of the integration of fluctuating renewable energy sources into current or future 100% renewable energy supplies one has to take a Smart Energy Systems approach. This paper outline why and how to do so. Traditionally, significant focus is put on the electricity sector alone to solve the renewable energy integration puzzle. Smart grid research traditionally focuses on ICT, smart meters, electricity storage technologies, and local (electric) smart grids. In contrast, the Smart Energy System focuses on merging the electricity, heating and transport sectors, in combination with various intra-hour, hourly, daily, seasonal and biannual storage options, to create the flexibility necessary to integrate large penetrations of fluctuating renewable energy. However, in this paper we present the development and design of coherent Smart Energy Systems as an integrated part of achieving future 100% renewable energy and transport solutions. The transition from fossil fuels towards the integration of more and more renewable energy requires rethinking and redesigning the energy system both on the generation and consumption side. To enable this, the Smart Energy System must have a number of appropriate infrastructures for the different sectors of the energy system, which are smart electricity grids, smart thermal grids (district heating and cooling), smart gas grids and other fuel infrastructures. It enables fluctuating renewable energy (such as wind, solar, wave power and low value heat sources) to utilise new sources of flexibility such as solid, gaseous, and liquid fuel storage, thermal storage and heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. Smart Energy Systems also enable a more sustainable and feasible use of bioenergy than the current types allow. It can potentially pave the way to a bioenergy-free 100% renewable energy and transport system.

Abstract: The iron-based Coal-Direct Chemical Looping (CDCL) combustion process is an alternative to conventional oxy-combustion technologies, where the oxygen used for fuel conversion in the CDCL process is provided by an iron-oxide based oxygen carrier instead of an air separation unit. The iron oxide is reduced using coal in the reducer reactor, producing highly-pure CO2 in the flue gas, and the reduced iron oxide is regenerated in a separate combustor reactor using air. The CDCL process at Ohio State has been developed and demonstrated in a 25 kW(th) sub-pilot unit, and it is the first chemical looping demonstration unit with a circulating moving bed reactor for solid fuel conversion. To date, the CDCL sub-pilot unit at OSU has been operated for more than 680 h, with a 200-h continuous operation, providing important data on long term operability as well as parametric optimization. This paper discusses recent parametric operational experience with sub-bituminous coal as the fuel, where dynamic changes in variables were performed to observe the effects on the unit itself. Measurements included temperature, pressure, and gas concentrations from the reducer and combustor. Furthermore, effects of different variables, such as flue gas recycle ratios (enhancer gas flow rates), feed port injection, and temperature, were observed. Tests confirmed high coal conversions with high purity of CO2 achieved in the flue gas. Overall, the moving bed design of the reducer results in nearly full coal conversion with a high purity of CO2, eliminating the need for additional down-stream fuel polishing and/or separation units. The combustor gas contained lean oxygen concentrations with minute amounts of carbonaceous gases detected, indicating proper regeneration of the oxygen carrier as well as good gas sealing between the reducer and combustor.

Abstract: Adequate hydration of the membrane is required to ensure high proton conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which, in turn, is required for achieving high cell performances. While external humidifiers are typically used to humidify the supplied air in conventional systems, their use increases the complexity, weight, volume, and parasitic power loss in fuel cell systems, rendering them unviable in some systems, particularly for portable applications. In this study, the structure of a gas diffusion backing layer (GDBL) was modified to enhance the self-humidification effect in PEMFCs. Three types of GDLs were prepared for the experiments: a conventional GDL (GDL-A with uniform single GDBL) and two modified GDLs (GDL-A'B with uniform double GDBL and GDL-A'C with heterogeneous double GDBLs). In order to evaluate the effect of stacking and structural design on the self-humidification characteristics, some characteristics of the GDLs such as contact angle, resistance, and vapor permeation rate were measured. The electrochemical performances of the fuel cells were also measured at various relative humidity (RH) and stoichiometric ratio (SR) conditions. The results showed that stacking had a negligible effect, whereas the structural design of the GDBL had a significant effect on self-humidification. The self-humidification effect and the cell performance were improved significantly in the structurally modified GDBL. In addition, considering the actual field conditions and the results of the present study, it was concluded that the structural modifications made to the GDBL would be beneficial in improving the performance of the self-humidified PEMFCs.

Abstract: Fuel cells are one of the most efficient means of converting chemical energy into electrical energy. The major deterrents to the commercialisation of fuel cell technologies, especially for the transport sector, are the hydrogen storage and almost non-existence of hydrogen transportation and distribution infrastructure. The utilisation of bio-fuels such as methanol and ethanol instead of hydrogen as a fuel in fuel cells, not only reduces issues with fuel transportation and storage, but can also provide a CO2 neutral power generation technology and lead to a reduction in CO2 and other pollutants. In particular bioethanol is attractive as it is non-toxic, inexpensive, renewable and readily available. Currently around 90 billion litres per annum of ethanol is produced globally. It can be produced from a range of feedstock which includes sugar-cane, wheat, corn and low grade biomass such as woodchips, bagasse, waste from agroindustries, organic fractions from municipal waste or forestry residue. These factors make ethanol, especially when used with a low emission technology such as fuel cells, attractive from both an economic and environmental perspective. This has lead to a considerable interest in developing fuel cell systems operating directly on bioethanol. In this paper various types of direct ethanol fuel cells currently under development have been reviewed with emphasis on ethanol sources and production methods, cell construction materials, operating regime, cell and stack fabrication, performance and life time issues, technology status and market applications.

Abstract: This study numerically investigated knocking phenomenal of a RCCI (Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition) engine fuelled with biodiesel and methanol. A reduced biodiesel/methanol chemical reaction mechanism coupled with 3D-CFD model was developed and applied to capture local pressure and species concentrations at 10 different regions in the computational domain. A Butterworth band-pass filter was used to process local pressure traces and the maximum peak-to-peak of the filtered data was used to quantify the knocking intensity. Species concentrations analysis was applied to identify the engine knocking occurrence. Finally, knocking mitigations strategies using cooled EGR were assessed. In addition, based on numerical analysis, the effect of SOI (Start of Injection) and premixed methanol mass fraction on engine knocking were evaluated. The results showed that the filtered pressure signals and intermediate chemical species are favored methods to identify and predict engine knocking. Moreover, cooled EGR is an effective way to attenuate engine knocking. Retarded SOI and lower premixed methanol mass fraction could also suppress the engine knocking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method suitable for any application in which very fast changing and not uniform shading conditions continuously occur, as in case of photovoltaic systems (PVs) installed in the roof of electric vehicles. Basically, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach is utilized to automatically detect the global maximum power point of the PV array by using a preselected number of power measurements of the PV system. The method requires only the measure of PV voltages and currents, thus avoiding the use of additional sensors providing information about the environmental operating conditions and temperature of PV modules. The time interval required to achieve the maximum power generation from the PV modules is about constant and established a priori. The greater the number of power-voltage characteristic scansions, the greater the ANN's ability to meet the maximum and its prediction accuracy. The algorithm is cost-effective, with no additional hardware requirements and limited dependence on system parameter variations. Numerical simulations have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method, and have highlighted the tradeoff between the preselected number of power-voltage characteristic scansions, the size of the ANN and its prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Experimental results are presented on the role of benzene addition to H2S combustion at an equivalence ratio of three With respect to H2S (Claus condition) and complete combustion of benzene. The results are reported with 0.3%, 0.5% and 1% benzene addition to H2S/O-2 flame. Combustion of H2S and benzene mixtures is of practical value for sulfur recovery during combustion of acid gases. The results showed that H2S combustion caused H2S to decompose to a minimum mole fraction with high conversion of H2S while the SO2 mole fraction reached a maximum value. Addition of benzene decreased the conversion of H2S with reduced mole fraction of SO2 in the reactor to subsequently reduce the formation of elemental sulfur. Benzene also caused significant production of H-2, CO and COS formation along with faster decomposition of the formed SO2. Presence of benzene, even in trace amounts, in acid gas hinders sulfur conversion in a Claus reactor and increases emission of unwanted sulfur bearing compounds. Increased hydrogen production with benzene offers potential value for hydrogen recovery under certain conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: To investigate the gas production from methane hydrate-bearing sediments, the gas production processes from methane hydrate in porous media using depressurization, two-cycle warm-water injection and a combination of the two methods were characterized in this study. The methane hydrates were formed in porous media with various initial hydrate saturation (SO in a pressure vessel. The percentage of gas production, rate of gas production, and energy efficiency were obtained and compared using the three methods. The driving force of the hydrate dissociation at different stages of depressurization was analyzed and ice formation during the gas production was observed. For the two-cycle warm-water-injection method, the percentage of gas production and the energy efficiency increased with increasing of S-hi. However, due to the large amount of warm water needed to heat the porous media at the dissociation site, the percentage of gas production was lower than the other two methods under the same experimental conditions. The experimental results proved that the combined method had obvious advantages for hydrate exploitation over the depressurization and warm-water-injection method in terms of the energy efficiency, percentage of gas production and average rate of gas production, and with increasing of Shi, the advantages are enhanced. For the S-hi of 51.61%, the percentage of gas production reaches 74.87%, which had increments of 18.63% and 31.19% compared with the depressurization and warm-water-injection methods. The energy efficiency for the combined method were 31.47, 49.93 and 68.13 for S-hi of 31.90%, 4131% and 51.61%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study focuses on improving the efficiency of the microwave (MW) pretreatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) through deflocculation mediated by sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), a cationic binding agent. Deflocculated sludge was subjected to MW pretreatment to assess its impact on biomass disintegration. At the optimised energy for MW pretreatment (14,000 kJ/kg TS), the chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation was 28% and 21% and the reduction in suspended solids (SS) was 38% and 26%, respectively, for deflocculated (treated with a cationic binding agent followed by microwaves) and flocculated (treated by microwaves alone) sludge samples. The formation of volatile fatty acids in the deflocculated sludge medium (840 mg/L) was comparatively higher than that in the flocculated sludge (420 mg/L) and the control (62 mg/L). This study indicates that deflocculated sludge is more amenable to hydrolysis. The results of a test of biochemical methane potential also confirmed the greater amenability of deflocculated sludge for anaerobic degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The rate of the reduction reaction of a low cost natural hematite oxygen carrier for chemical looping combustion was investigated in a fixed bed reactor where hematite samples of about 1 kg were exposed to a flowing stream of methane and argon. The investigation aims to develop understanding of the factors that govern the rate of reduction with in larger reactors as compared to mostly TGA investigations in the literature. A comparison of the experimental data with a model indicated that reaction between the methane and the iron oxide shows multi-step reactions. The analysis also shows that the conversion occurs with a process that likely consumes all the oxygen close to the surface of the hematite particles and another process that is likely controlled by the diffusion of oxygen to the surface of the particles. Additional analysis shows that the thickness of the fast layer is on the order of 8 unit crystals. This is only about 0.4% of the hematite; however, it comprises about 20-25% of the conversion for the 10 min reduction cycle. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A new CO2 sorbent was prepared from carbide slag, aluminum nitrate hydrate and glycerol water solution by combustion synthesis method. The effects of the sorbent preparation conditions (glycerol addition, combustion synthesis temperature, ratio of carbide slag to aluminum nitrate hydrate) and carbonation/calcination conditions (temperature, atmosphere and time) on CO2 capture performance of the synthetic sorbent were investigated in the calcium looping cycles. The addition of glycerol during the sorbent preparation exhibits an improvement on the cyclic CO2 capture capacity. It was also found that the optimal combustion synthesis temperature for the synthetic sorbent was in the range of 750-800 degrees C. The synthetic sorbent contained the mass ratio of CaO derived from carbide slag to Al2O3 derived from aluminum nitrate hydrate = 90:10 exhibited higher CO2 capture capacity (038 g CO2/g sorbent after 50 cycles). X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the main compounds of the synthetic sorbent were CaO and Ca(3A)l(2)O(6) by X-ray diffraction analysis. The synthetic sorbent showed higher CO2 capture capacity than the carbide slag under severe calcination conditions (950 degrees C, CO2) and at short carbonation time (<5 min). From the present investigation, it shows that a high active synthetic CO2 sorbent could be obtained using the carbide slag in the calcium looping technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this study, n-butanol (nB) was used as the common solvent and crude canola (Cn), soybean (Sb), sun-flower (Sf), corn (Cr), olive (Ol), and hazelnut oil (Hn) as the vegetable oil components were used for making microemulsification of diesel Wel (D)-vegetable oil blends. The blend ratios of 70% vol. D, 20% vol. vegetable oil and 10% vol. nB were determined to increase concentration of biofuels in ternary blends. Six different ternary blends were prepared via the splash blending method. Engine performance tests of the ternary blends were carried out on a four-cylinder, four-cycle turbocharged direct-injection diesel engine at full load with various engine speeds. Test fuels were kept stationary at ambient temperature and the long-term stabilities were observed at 60 days. There were not any phase separations in the ternary blends. Fuel properties of the test fuels were examined and determined to be in agreement with the fuel standards. According to engine performance test results of the ternary blends, brake torque, brake power, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and exhaust gas temperatures decreased while brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased as compared to those of diesel fuel. In terms of basic exhaust gas emissions, ternary blends increased nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions while reducing hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as compared to diesel.

Abstract: A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of ion crossover through the membranes in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) is critically important in making improvements to the battery's efficiency and cycling performance. In this work, we develop a 2-D VRFB model to investigate the mechanisms of ion crossover and the associated impacts it has on the battery's performance. Unlike previously described models in the literature that simulated a single cell by dividing it into the positive electrode, membrane, and negative electrode regions, the present model incorporates all possible ion crossover mechanisms in the entire cell without a need to specify any interfacial boundary conditions at the membrane/electrode interfaces, and hence accurately captures the Donnan-potential jumps and steep gradient of species concentrations at the membrane/electrode interfaces. With our model, a particular emphasis is given to investigation of the effect of the electric field on vanadium ion crossover. One of the significant findings is that an electric field exists in the membrane even under the open-circuit condition, primarily due to the presence of the H+ concentration gradient across the membrane. This finding suggests that vanadium ions can permeate through the membrane from H+-diluted to H(+-)concentrated sides via migration and convection. More importantly, it is found that the rate of vanadium ion crossover and capacity decay during charge and discharge vary with the magnitude of the electric field, which is influenced by the membrane properties and operating conditions. The simulations suggest that enhancing the electric-field-driven flow is a potential approach to minimizing the battery's capacity decay. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The research aims to develop control strategies for intelligent glazed facades and investigate the influence of different control strategies on energy and comfort performance in office buildings. The intelligent glazed facade is capable of controlling the thermal, solar and mass transmittance by controlling shutters, blinds and openings. The facade and building services are designed and controlled holistically to optimize the indoor comfort (thermal, visual comfort and indoor air quality) and minimize the energy demand by heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation. The study is conducted numerically utilising a simplified hourly calculation method developed to calculate yearly energy and comfort performance of an office room equipped with an intelligent facade. The simplified method is verified by the Danish dynamic building simulation tool BSim and experimental test in a full scale test facility at Aalborg University (Cube).
Results show that the annual primary energy demand of an office building with intelligent glazed facade can be reduced by approx. 60% compared with the same building with a static facade. Utilising the properties of an intelligent glazed facade, buildings can more easily comply with the future Danish Building Class 2020 as stipulated in the Danish Building Regulation 2010, BR10. The comfort performance of the building can also be improved using an intelligent glazed fa ade. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Nowadays, many countries adopt an active agenda to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions by moving towards less polluting energy generation technologies. The environmental costs, directly or indirectly generated to achieve such a challenging objective, remain however largely underexplored. Until now, research has focused either on pure economic approaches such as Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium (PE) models, or on (physical) energy supply scenarios. These latter could be used to evaluate the environmental impacts of various energy saving or cleaner technologies via Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. These modelling efforts have, however, been pursued in isolation, without exploring the possible complementarities and synergies. In this study, we have undertaken a practical combination of these approaches into a common framework: on the one hand, by coupling a CGE with a PE model, and, on the other hand, by linking the outcomes from the coupling with a hybrid input-output process based life cycle inventory. The methodological framework aimed at assessing the environmental consequences of two energy policy scenarios in Luxembourg between 2010 and 2025.
The study highlights the potential of coupling CGE and PE models but also the related methodological difficulties (e.g. small number of available technologies in Luxembourg, intrinsic limitations of the two approaches, etc.). The assessment shows both environmental synergies and trade-offs due to the implementation of energy policies. For example, despite the changes in technologies towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, only marginal improvements are observed in the climate change mitigation scenario as compared to the Business-As-Usual. The energy related production and imports are indeed expected to increase over time and represent a large contribution to the country's impacts. Interestingly, side effects on other impacts than climate change or fossil resource depletion (e.g. ionising radiation and water depletion) may also occur mainly due to the use of nuclear energy in neighbouring countries.

Abstract: A novel organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with multiple expanders used in parallel (PE-ORC) is proposed for the efficient recovery of waste heat in applications in which there are typically large variations in the amount of heat produced, such as in heavy vehicles and in distributed energy systems with multiple internal combustion engines. The feasibility and the fundamental characteristics of the proposed PE-ORC were experimentally evaluated by establishing an ORC loop with two parallel expanders and testing the performance of the system in different operating modes and in dynamic tests. The PE-ORC was found to be capable of achieving a higher efficiency and a higher total power output than was achieved using a basic ORC configuration when conditions changed from those for which the basic ORC was designed, but the PE-ORC operating mode was changed to suit the new conditions. The proposed PE-ORC could therefore be a better design than is currently available for ORCs that are subject to large variations in the amounts of waste heat produced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A copper based oxygen carrier prepared by impregnation on a highly porous alumina support (14.2 wt% active CuO) has been tested in a 120 kW chemical looping pilot plant. This oxygen carrier has already been under investigation in other pilot plants up to 10 kW fuel power and showed very good performance, i.e. full fuel conversion was achieved. During the experiments, natural gas has been used as fuel and variations of several process parameters like temperature, fuel power, solids inventory and solids circulation rate have been performed. The copper particles showed good performance regarding conversion of CO and H-2 (almost full conversion) but only moderate conversion of CH4 (up to 80%) was achieved. The three process parameters fuel reactor temperature, solids circulation between air and fuel reactor and solids inventory have been identified as significant parameters for fuel conversion, i.e. increasing one of these parameters improves fuel conversion. Continuous analysis of the oxygen carrier particles revealed an initial decay of active CuO content caused by attrition on the external surface of the particles. The CuO content stabilized after 30 h of operation at around 9 wt% and no further decrease was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We present a general method, based on controlled static aberrations induced in the reflectors, to boost receiver performances in solar concentrators. Imaging mirrors coupled with dense arrays suffer from severe performance degradation since the solar irradiance distribution is bell-shaped: mismatch losses occur in particular when the cells are series connected. The method consists in computing static deformations of the reflecting surfaces that can produce, for an adopted concentration ratio, a light spot matching the receiver features better than conventional reflectors. The surfaces and the deformations have been analytically described employing the Zemike polynomials formalism. The concept here described can be applied to a variety of optical configurations and collecting areas. As an example, we extensively investigated a dense array photovoltaic concentrator, dimensioned for a nominal power of about 10 kWe. The. "flat" distribution of light we obtain can exploit the PV device cells close to their efficiency limit. A significant gain is thus obtained, with no need of secondary optics or complex dish segmentation and of special features in the receiver electrical scheme. In the design, based on seven 2.6 m mirrors, we addressed also non-optical aspects as the receiver and the supporting mechanics. Optical and mechanical tolerances are demonstrated not to exceed accurate, but conventional, industrial standards. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel, integrated and unified process is proposed, modeled and studied for converting biomass to methanol (MeOH)/dimethylether (DME) to demonstrate its feasibility and applicability for the global industrial sector. The unified process consists of a concentrating solar power (CSP) plant, which supplies the produced steam to the biomass gasification process as well as to the downstream conversions to chemical commodities and energy carriers. To preserve the effectiveness of the biomass gasification with low-temperature solar-powered generated steam (approximately 400-410 degrees C), the gasification process is studied by means of a multi-complex (multi-scale, multi-phase, and multi-component) model and adapted to the novel proposed conditions. The syngas generated in the biomass gasification unit is then converted into MeOH/DME by means of one-step synthesis technology to improve the overall yield of the biomass-to-methanol process.

Abstract: In ground source heat pump (GSHP) applications, borehole drilling cost constitutes an important part of the investment cost and it can be reduced by improving borehole performance. In vertical GSHP applications, usually double-U tube configurations are used to improve the heat transfer rate per unit length of a borehole, (unit HTR value). To determine the optimal number of U-tubes which maximizes the commercial and engineering benefits of multi U-tube applications, cost and performance analyses of multi U-tube boreholes are crucial. In this study, a triple U-tube is used in a borehole of 50 m depth. Time variation of unit HTR value of the borehole is experimentally measured when single, double and triple U-tubes are in operation separately. Furthermore a computational model is calibrated by fitting the computational results to the experimental ones, and effects of using four and five U-tubes in a borehole are computationally investigated. The relations between number of U tubes and time variation of unit HTR value of a borehole as well as investment cost are analyzed. Long term borehole performance predictions are made and compared for multi U-tube applications. Both experimental and computational results showed that performance improvements are remarkable for 2U-tube and 3U-tube configurations while it is nearly insignificant for 4U and 5U ones. If the investment cost per thermal power is considered, 2U-tube configuration is the optimal one if the prices of polyethylene pipes are relatively high, like in Turkey. When the cost of pipes decreases, then 3U-tube or even 4U-tube configuration can be the cheapest solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Cell inconsistency is inevitable due to manufacturing constraint. Therefore, cell equalization is essentially required. In this paper, we propose a novel active equalization method based on the remaining capacity of cells which is feasible for lithium-ion battery packs in electric vehicles (EVs). The cell models are established based on a combined electrochemical model of lithium-ion batteries. The remaining capacity and state-of-charge (SOC) of cells are observed at the beginning of equalization. The particle filter (PF) method is employed to estimate the cell SOCs during equalization in order to eliminate the drift noise of the current sensor. The first high-SOC cell discharge (FHCD) and first low-SOC cell charge (FLCC) equalization algorithms are proposed and compared with 1% and 3% SOC bounds, respectively. The validation experiment results have shown that the proposed algorithm is suitable for equalization of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The optimization of optical properties of buildings' envelope and urban paving represents an important research field for reducing the urban heat island effect. The overheating of a surface exposed to sunlight can be reduced by improving solar reflectance. In this sense, several studies have demonstrated the positive effect of cool materials on UHI mitigation.
In addition to traditional cool materials, retroreflective (RR) materials have been recently proposed for this application. The present paper aims at the assessment of angular reflectance of RR films for several inclination angles of solar radiation. To reproduce variation of solar radiation's inclination during the daytime, an ad hoc experimental setup was designed and used. Characterization of RR materials when hit by solar radiation with different inclinations allows to assess their behaviour on daytime if used as novel urban coatings for mitigation of the UHI phenomenon.
Measurement results are used as input for an original algorithm which allows to quantify cooling potential of RR materials in terms of energy reflected and sent beyond the urban canyon. The experimental characterization and energy evaluations showed that RR materials could be effectively applied as coatings on urban paving and building envelope, in order to reduce the circulating energy into the canyon.

Abstract: The reduction of energy consumption for heating and cooling services in the existing building stock is a key challenge for global sustainability today and buildings' envelopes retrofit is one the main issues. Most of the existing buildings' envelopes have low levels of insulation, high thermal losses due to thermal bridges and cracks, absence of appropriate solar control, etc.
Further, in building refurbishment, the importance of a system level approach is often undervalued in favour of simplistic "off the shelf" efficient solutions, focused on the reduction of thermal transmittance and on the enhancement of solar control capabilities. In many cases, the importance of the dynamic thermal properties is often neglected or underestimated and the effective thermal capacity is not properly considered as one of the design parameters.
The research presented aims to critically assess the influence of the dynamic thermal properties of the building fabric (roof, walls and floors) on sensible heating and cooling energy demand for a case study. The case study chosen is an existing office building which has been retrofitted in recent years and whose energy model has been calibrated according to the data collected in the monitoring process.
The research illustrates the variations of the sensible thermal energy demand of the building in different retrofit scenarios, and relates them to the variations of the dynamic thermal properties of the construction components.
A parametric simulation study has been performed, encompassing the use of calculation tools and performance metrics at the different scales of the building (envelope-zone-overall building) considering the realistic operating conditions assumed for the initial calibrated model and different climate conditions, typical of the Italian territory and, more in general, of the Southern European and Mediterranean area.

Abstract: In the context of decaying capital cost and uncertain revenues, prospective valuation of a wind power distributed generation (DG) project is difficult. The conventional net present value (NPV) presents a static picture that does not account for the value of waiting for better market conditions to proceed with a DG investment. On the contrary, real options (RO) analysis does account for the managerial flexibility to switch between options over the investment horizon.
In this paper we argue that the value of a DG wind-based project can be revisited by means of Longstaff-Schwartz method, originally intended for the evaluation of American financial options. The adaption of this method to the wind power DG setting provides a means for (i) efficiently dealing with the several stochastic processes involved (spot electricity prices and possibly various wind speed processes) avoiding the curse of dimensionality, (ii) accounting for the decaying capital cost of DG, and (iii) solving the perfect foresight problem presented by Monte Carlo conventional simulations.
We present in this paper the procedure to follow when applying the method to the wind power DG setting. Particularly, we discuss the standardization of the wind speed and spot price processes, and the advantages of building a state space model that includes all the correlated processes by adequately transforming Box-Jenkins and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Also we discuss the representation of the capital cost forecast by means of learning curves. On the whole, we put together this multivariate setting and show how it is translated to the Longstaff-Schwartz framework.
The developed methodological approach allows us analyzing the sensitivity of the RO value to the site and DG capacity factor, the risk-free rate, the current forward projections of global installed capacity, and the aggregation of DGs under a common owner. On the whole, we conclude that the RO analysis is best employed to analyze DG settings in which the NPV yields a close to negative assessment: low power production, for instance. In such cases, RO analysis shows advantages in producing delayed optimal investment times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Metal hydride bed is an important component for the deuterium-tritium fusion energy under development in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), in which the hydrogen recovery and delivery properties are influenced by the bed configuration, operation conditions and the hydrogen storage materials contained in the bed. In this work, a thin double-layered annulus bed configuration was adopted and full-scale beds loaded with ZrCo and depleted uranium (DU) for fast recovery and delivery of hydrogen isotopes were fabricated. The properties of hydrogen recovery/delivery together with the inner structure variation in the fabricated beds were systematically studied. The effects of operation conditions on the performances of the bed were also investigated. It was found that both of the fabricated ZrCo and DU beds were able to achieve the hydrogen storage target of 17.5 mol with fast recovery rate. In addition, experimental results showed that operation of employing extra buffer vessel and scroll pump could not only promote the hydrogen delivery process but also reduce the possibility about disproportionation of ZrCo. Compared with ZrCo bed, DU bed exhibited superior hydrogen delivery performances in terms of fast delivery rate and high hydrogen delivery amount, which,could deliver over 16.4 mol H-2 (93.7% of recovery amount) within 30 min at the average delivery rate of 20 Pa m(3)/s. Good reversibility as high as 10 cycles without obvious degradation tendency in both of hydrogen delivery amount and delivery rate for DU bed was also achieved in our study. It was suggested that the fabricated thin double-layered annulus DU bed was a good candidate to rapidly deliver and recover massive hydrogen isotopes for fusion energy application.

Abstract: Impurities such as N-2 and O-2 can be co-injected with CO2 to cut the overall cost of carbon capture and geological storage by lowering the CO2 capture cost. However, only few field-scale studies have focused on the effect of these impurities, such as N-2 and O-2, with low solubility and a low reaction rate in a CO2 stream. A pilot-scale experiment on impure CO2 aquifer storage containing N-2 and O-2 was conducted in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, China, where 200 tonnes of CO2 and 30 tonnes of air were injected into the upper Yaojia Formation. The geochemical characteristics of flow-back formation fluid in three monitoring wells were investigated by using a U-tube-based sampling system. The following conclusions can be drawn from the preliminary geochemistry analysis: (1) The underground chemical reactions in the CO2 and air co-injection process are clearly pH and redox sensitive, which is in contrast with pure CO2 aquifer storage. Oxygen enhances the remobilization of certain minerals in the aquifer formation and provides new reactive tracers such as uranium and SO. (2) The migration pattern of the formation fluid and the geochemical components in the fluid are very complex, particularly when the reservoir exhibits high heterogeneities of geology, mineralogy, and groundwater chemistry. (3) Chromatographic partitioning processes of chemical components occur in both aqueous and gaseous phases. In the aqueous phase, the dissolved O-2 and CO2 arrive at the monitoring wells earlier than they do in the gaseous plume. The CO2-induced ions arrive at the monitoring wells earlier than the O-2-induced ions; however, the dissolved O-2 arrives earlier than the dissolved CO2. The N-2 and O-2 in the gas mixture arrive at the monitoring wells earlier than CO2 and form the migration front of the underground gas stream. This study provides a new dataset for evaluating possible scenarios of underground migration behavior and metal remobilization in response to the co-injection of CO2 with O-2, and N-2.

Abstract: A number of studies have examined the effect of nuclear energy on CO2 emissions, and a lot has been learned from these studies. Due to their weaknesses in modeling approaches and variable uses, however, properly constructed and comprehensive analyses are limited. The main objective of this study is thus to contribute to the debate over nuclear energy and the environment with an enhanced model and variables. For this, a panel cointegration analysis is applied to quantify the effects of nuclear energy, energy consumption and income on CO2 emissions in 12 major nuclear generating countries. The results show that nuclear energy tends to reduce CO2 emissions. It is also found that CO2 emissions tend to decrease monotonically with income growth, providing no evidence in support of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for CO2 emissions.

Abstract: CO2 gasification of a sub-bituminous Wyodak coal from the Powder River Basin (PRB) was conducted in a fixed-bed laboratory gasifier at atmospheric pressure with FeCO3 as a catalyst precursor. The effect of iron on the coal pyrolysis was evaluated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the iron performance in the char gasification. The iron species and oxidation states during the coal gasification, characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Mossbauer spectroscopy, indicate a complex interaction between the reaction atmosphere and temperature, but generally proceed through reduction to FeO and metallic iron during pyrolysis, followed by subsequent reoxidation to Fe3O4 during gasification with CO2. The catalytic effect of iron was also quantitatively evaluated by kinetic analysis using shrinking core and random pore models, with the shrinking core model providing superior results. Results show that the apparent activation energy was 92.7 kJ/mol for the untreated coal, which decreased to 58.3 kJ/mol for the coal with 3 wt% Fe. FeCO3 was shown to have a significant catalytic effect on the Wyodak coal gasification with CO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We present a methodology to evaluate the accuracy of baseline energy predictions. To evaluate the predictions from a computer program, the program is provided with electric load data, and additional data such as outdoor air temperature, from a "training period" of at least several months duration, and used to predict the energy use as a function of time during the subsequent "prediction period." The predicted energy use is compared to the actual energy use, and errors are summarized with several metrics, including bias and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). An important feature of this methodology is that it can be used to assess the predictive accuracy of a model even if the model itself is not provided to the evaluator, so that proprietary tools can be evaluated while protecting the developer's intellectual property. The methodology was applied to evaluate several standard statistical models using data from four hundred randomly selected commercial buildings in a large utility territory in Northern California; the result is a statistical distribution of errors for each of the models. We also demonstrate how the methodology can be used to assess the uncertainty in baseline energy predictions for a portfolio of buildings, which is an issue that is important for the design of utility programs that incentivize energy savings. The findings of this work can be used to (1) inform technology assessments for technologies that deliver operational and/or behavioral savings; and (2) determine the expected accuracy of statistical models used for automated measurement and verification (M&V) of energy savings.

Abstract: The collective behavior of wind farms in seven Independent System Operator (ISO) areas has been studied. The generation duration curves for each ISO show that there is no aggregated power for some fraction of time. Aggregation of wind turbines mitigates intermittency to some extent, but in each ISO there is considerable fraction of time when there is less than 5% capacity. The hourly wind power time series show benefit of aggregation but the high and low wind events are lumped in time, thus indicating that intermittency is synchronized in each region. The timeseries show that there are instances when there is no wind power in most ISOs because of large-scale high pressure systems. An analytical consideration of the collective behavior of aggregated wind turbines shows that the benefit of aggregation saturates beyond a certain number of generating units asymptotically. Also, the benefit of aggregation falls rapidly with temporal correlation between the generating units. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As one of the significant parameters to characterize the motor performance, motor efficiency changes under variable speed and load conditions. Although there are many methods to measure the partial load motor efficiency under the full speed condition, few of them are available to estimate the efficiency under partial speed conditions. In this paper, a new and original concept of "load ratio" is brought forward to describe the motor performances. A simple method is proposed to estimate the motor efficiency under variable speeds operations and partial load conditions using load ratio, speed ratio, rated motor power and rated motor efficiency. To validate the accuracy of this method, the partial loads full speed operation data from the MotorMaster+ database and the published data under the variable speed conditions from other researcher's tests are used for demonstration. The results indicate that the relative errors using the proposed method at full speed are within 5%. Under variable speed conditions, the relative error is within 10% when the speed ratio is above 0.5. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The presented paper focuses on different control strategies of a solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) for cold climate. Dynamic simulation approach has been used through TRNSYS software. In particular, a SAGSHP solution operating with the strategies suitable for cold climate found in literature, a conventional ground source heat pump (GSHP) solution and a GSHP with solar thermal system only for building heating supply have been compared to the SAGSHP proposed system. The impact of the considered system solutions on seasonal performance factor and primary energy ratio in case of a gas boiler as auxiliary system has been evaluated as a function of the boreholes depth, the conventional solar thermal collector typologies and the size of the solar thermal system.
Results have shown that the proposed strategy is effective from a specific borehole depth. Moreover, the solar thermal collector typology has to be selected accordingly to the borehole depth and to the used auxiliary source. Furthermore, the temperature difference between solar collectors and the ground, which has to be exceeded for driving solar heat into it, has to be kept low for system with short borehole in order to drive more heat into the ground and it has to be incremented with the increasing of borehole length, especially for small solar thermal system size when flat plate and evacuated tube solar collector typologies are adopted.

Abstract: This paper aims at introducing a novel methodology to calculate the distribution of incoming solar energy on the internal surfaces of closed spaces with an opening at various orientations and placements. While the incoming diffuse solar radiation and the reflected solar radiation are as usually distributed with the use of absorptance-weighted area ratios the penetrating direct radiation is distributed according to the formed sunlit areas on the interior surfaces. The determination of the sunlit areas into the enclosure is accomplished by forming at each time step a, so-called, "sunlit pattern" with four letter-characters specifying the particular illuminated interior surfaces that are stricken by the sun's rays. Though this study is carried out for the Mediterranean climatic conditions, the methodology is general and can be applied to other regions. Following this methodology the optimum glazing setup to maximize the solar heat gain per square meter during the heating period is formulated and solved as a constrained optimization problem. To this effect, the well-known pattern search methodology has been appropriately adapted to deal with the highly nonlinear nature of this problem, particularly when the glazing distance from the right sidewall is variable. Representative computer results are provided showing the optimization problem complexity by varying the glazing width to height and the floor width to floor depth ratios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the design of a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) on its dynamic behaviour under the boundary condition of a gas turbine start-up. For that purpose, a validated HRSG model with three pressure stages and reheater section is modified by replacing the once-through evaporator in the high pressure circuit with a natural circulation evaporator, including the associated control circuits. Both models are designed to supply equal steam mass flows with equal steam parameters (temperature, pressure) at full load, which enables a balanced assessment of the two technologies. After an extensive description of the modelling approach and its practical realisation, detailed simulation results for start-up procedures from warm and hot initial conditions are presented. Differences in the transient behaviour of the HRSGs are highlighted and discussed. In industrial practice, frequent startups cause increased material fatigue, which in turn has an adverse effect on the operating lifetime of a power plant. Hence, the present work is complemented by an analysis of the temperature gradients in the most critical components with respect to thermal stress. Results generally show similar responses of the high pressure systems to gas turbine start-up with the exception of accelerated pressure build-up in the once-through evaporator. Greater temperature deviations are observed in the natural-circulation HRSG across the wall of the high-pressure drum. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The main drawbacks of developing carbon adsorbents from pine sawdust, an abundant biomass feedstock, are the low carbon yield of the process and the poor mechanical properties of the resulting carbons. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, the effect of the addition of coal tar pitch was assessed. Adsorbent pellets were produced from pine sawdust and coal tar pitch by activation with CO2. The preparation process was optimized by using as decision variables the carbon yield and the adsorption performance of the adsorbents in conditions representative of post-combustion capture applications (10% CO2 at atmospheric pressure and at 50 degrees C). Subjecting the composite pellets to a preoxidation treatment with air increased the carbon yield of the production process, and also improved the adsorption kinetics and capacity of the final adsorbents. The prepared adsorbents present a high carbon yield, a superior mechanical resistance and a competitive adsorption performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a methodology for optimizing the operation of compressors in parallel in process industries. Compressors in parallel can be found in many applications for example in compressor stations conveying gas through long pipelines and in chemical plants in which compressors supply raw or processed materials to downstream processes. The current work presents an optimization framework for compressor stations which describe integration of a short term and a long term optimization approach. The short-term part of the framework suggests the best distribution of the load of the compressors (where the time scale is minutes) and the long-term optimization provides the scheduling of the compressors for large time periods (where the time scale is days). The paper focuses on the short-term optimization and presents a Real Time Optimization (RTO) framework which exploits process data in steady-state operation to develop regression models of compressors. An optimization model employs the updated steady-state models to estimate the best distribution of the load of the compressors to reduce power consumption and therefore operational costs. The paper demonstrates the application of the RTO to a network of parallel industrial multi-stage centrifugal compressors, part of a chemical process in BASF SE, Germany. The results from the RTO application showed a reduction in power consumption compared to operation with equal load split strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Dark fermentation of organic biomass, i.e. agricultural residues, agro-industrial wastes and organic municipal waste is a promising technology for producing renewable biohydrogen. In spite of its potential, this technology needs further research and development to improve the biohydrogen yield by optimizing substrate utilization, microbial community enrichment and bioreactor operational parameters such as pH, temperature and H-2 partial pressure. On the other hand, the technical and economic viability of the processes need to be enhanced by the use of valuable by-products from dark fermentation, which mostly includes volatile fatty acids. This paper reviews a range of different organic biomasses and their biohydrogen potential from laboratory to pilot-scale systems. A review of the advances in H-2 yield and production rates through different seed inocula enrichment methods, bioreactor design modifications and operational conditions optimization inside the dark fermentation bioreactor is presented. The prospects of valorizing the co-produced volatile fatty acids in photofermentation and bioelectrochemical systems for further H-2 production, methane generation and other useful applications have been highlighted. A brief review on the simulation and modeling of the dark fermentation processes and their energy balance has been provided. Future prospects of solid state dark fermentation are discussed.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of an ejector refrigeration system using conventional and advanced exergy analysis. Splitting the exergy destruction within each system component into endogenous/exogenous and avoidable/unavoidable parts provides additional useful information and improves the quality of the exergy analysis. Detailed calculations of the exergy destruction parts are schematically illustrated. Conventional exergy analysis indicates that about half of the total exergy destruction is caused by the ejector and about one quarter occurs in the generator. The advanced exergy analysis reflects the strong interactions between system components. The ejector has the highest priority to be improved, followed by the condenser and then the generator. The temperature difference in the condenser has the largest influence on the exergy destruction compared to that in the generator and the evaporator, and the ejector efficiencies are also very crucial for the exergy destruction. The system performance can be largely enhanced through improvements of the ejector and the condenser as well as the generator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel air-gap-lens-walled compound parabolic concentrator incorporated with photovoltaic/thermal system (ALCPC-PV/T) was proposed. The optical, electrical and thermal performances of the ALCPC-PV/T under the outdoor condition were analyzed for building integrated concentrating photovoltaic/thermal application. The simulation and experiment were carried out to reveal the optical characteristics of ALCPC-PV/T on two typical days. The experiment results verified the optical simulation results that the ALCPC-PV/T system had a half acceptance angle of 35 and an average optical efficiency of 83.0% within the half acceptance angle for direct incidence. Furthermore, the average optical efficiencies on the two typical days were all above 60% under the actual outdoor condition considering direct and diffuse solar radiation. Details of electrical characteristics affected by the temperature of circulating cooling water were also displayed. The electrical and thermal efficiencies of the ALCPC-PV/T system during the test were 6.0% and 35.0% respectively with the final water temperature of 70 degrees C. In addition, the fitted results indicated that under the zero reduced temperature condition, the thermal efficiency of the ALCPC PV/T system was 52.0%, and the corresponding electrical efficiency was 6.6%.

Abstract: Intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) are increasingly used in many energy systems. The higher capacity of intermittent RES increases the importance of introducing flexible generation units into the electricity system balancing. Distributed district heating plants with combined heat and power (CHP) can provide this flexibility. However, in electricity systems with a high penetration of intermittent RES, CHP units are currently experiencing decreasing hours of operation, making it likely that existing CHP capacity will be phased out from the energy system. Furthermore, when the plants provide balancing for the electricity system, the complexity of their daily operation planning is increased. This article analyses and discusses how these units can improve their economic feasibility by providing balancing services to the electricity system, benefitting both each individual plant and the system as a whole. This is done by using the case of the Danish district heating plant, Ringkebing District Heating, which has a relatively high capacity of solar heating installed and is located in an area with a high penetration of wind power. It is found that the plant can increase the economic feasibility of the CHP unit by participating in the electricity balancing tasks; however, it is uncertain whether the benefits are substantial enough to keep the distributed CHP capacity in operation.

Abstract: The major challenge to the large-scale commercialisation of hybrid electric vehicles is their high initial and operating costs, although a mild hybrid is generally cheaper than a full hybrid of the same performance. Hence, the average operating efficiency of the internal combustion engine of a parallel hybrid and the energy saved by its battery modules when running on urban roads have been key research subjects. In this paper, a method for maximising the performance of heavyweight hybrid vehicles is proposed. Because the manipulation of the thresholds of the state of charge window of the battery of a parallel hybrid affects the performance of the vehicle when using the commonly employed electric power-assist strategy, we developed a method for determining the optimal sizes of the vehicle components that afford the most feasible operations using the conventional and modified power-assist strategies. Furthermore, the performances of the vehicle in both modes were analysed for various urban driving conditions representative of those encountered in the USA, Europe, and India. The results showed that energy saving in the battery pack after a typical urban driving cycle was higher in India than in the USA and Europe. The saving in India was determined to be 3.34%, whereas those in the USA and Europe were 3.13% and 0.23%, respectively. The energy savings in the battery pack of the same vehicle under identical conditions were determined using a simple internal resistance battery model and a resistance-capacitance battery model. The performance of a typical parallel mild hybrid capable of operating in the modified power-assist mode was also compared with that of an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle presently on the Indian market.

Abstract: Public acceptance is one of the most important issues when considering the sustainability of anthropogenic systems. The development of energy systems in the future will depend on the balance of environmental impact, economic feasibility, and public acceptance. On the basis of existing inclusive environmental impact indices, such as the Inclusive Impact Index (Triple I) and emergy, in the present work we propose two novel indices, Triple I-social and Triple Iemergy-social that can be used to evaluate public acceptance together with economic and environmental aspects simultaneously. This is the claim of originality of this work. In this study, we applied these indices to eight power generation technologies and, to quantify public expectations and concern, we conducted a questionnaire survey about these technologies. The conjoint analysis reveals the marginal rate of allowance to compensate (MRAC), a term we propose as a replacement of the marginal willingness to pay, in units of monetary value, ecological footprint, or emergy for six attributes considered to affect public acceptance. Triple I-social and Triple Iemergy-social of the power generation technologies are calculated using MRAC, and it suggests that only the geological thermal energy is sustainable while the others need to be improved in terms of monetary, environmental, and/or social costs to reach a level at which these technologies are regarded as sustainable.

Abstract: Given the complexity of generating energy from biomass, the need has arisen for support tools to assist in balancing energy and forestry policies which are sufficiently flexible to address the issues of planning and management at small and large scales.
The present study aims to adapt WISDOM GIS methodology for application in the autonomous region of Asturias (Northern Spain) and thereby, by creating a geodatabase, to contribute to a support tool for investigating the potential of woodfuel. This will aid the public administration by providing information on woodfuel supply and demand at the regional, municipality and site-specific level, and thus assist in decision making in terms of formulating new energy strategies.
In terms of supply (t year(-1)), in this work, woodfuel from forest area is defined as the crown fraction only (branches and leaves), although in the case of Eucalyptus spp., bark is also included as it is remains on-site following extraction of eucalypts for the pulp industry. Non-Forest Direct Supply was calculated on the basis of the relevant categories from an agricultural land use inventory and average woodfuel productivity. In addition, physical and legal constraints related to accessibility of the woodfuel were considered, the former applying restriction filters with values weighted depending on the interaction between slope map, road networks and centres of population, and the latter considering legal limitations in protected areas. In addition, unused waste from the wood processing industry was included. To calculate total woodfuel demand (t year-1) for energy generation (heat and electricity), both the residential and industrial sector were taken into account.
All data was georeferenced through Geographic Information Systems (GISs), which allow operations between raster maps to be performed to generate numeric and spatial results focusing on logistics and biomass strategies, depending on the inputs data and scale employed for each scenario considered. In addition, the application of the methodology at the site-specific level illustrates the practical implementation at the small scale of the geodatabase created, by evaluating the woodfuel available to feed, in case 1, a wood-fired power plant in a specific proposed location and, in case 2, this plant combined with a second plant in a different municipality, both cases also taking into consideration industrial demand.

Abstract: The present work considers a T-shaped standing-wave thermoacoustic system with an electrical heater confined in the bottom stem and two temperature-controllable heaters (TCHs) enclosed in the bifurcating branches. With the heater placed at the bottom stem set to 1100 K and TCHs be adiabatic, self-sustained limit cycle oscillations are generated. To gain insights on the effect of TCHs on damping or amplifying the oscillations, thermodynamic analysis and 2D numerical investigations are conducted. Three parameters are examined: (1) the number N of TCHs, (2) the surface temperature T-l,T-r of TCHs and (3) the TCHs location x(l,r)/L. As each of the parameters is varied, the heat-driven acoustic signature is found to change. Flow reversal is observed during part of the limit cycle oscillations. The main nonlinearity is identified in the heat fluxes. In addition, such limit cycle oscillations are found to be mitigated or amplified, depending strongly on the heat flux and the locations of the TCHs. Placing the TCHs at proper locations in the bifurcating branches can lead to a maximum 'destructive' interaction and reducing the sound pressure level by more than 60 dB. To gain insight on the damping effect of the TCHs, Rayleigh index as a critical indicator of the coupling between heat and sound is defined and characterized. The present work opens up new applicable way to minimize standing-wave oscillations in a practical engine system by simply implementing additional heat sources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Conversion of woody biomass to chemicals, materials and energy requires at least three steps: pretreatment, cracking and conversion. Size reduction is the minimum required pretreatment step prior to further processing. Cracking step is the middle step in woody biomass conversion whereby solid woody biomass is reduced to small building blocks (molecules) or intermediates. The last step in woody biomass conversion is the generation of desired products from the building blocks or intermediates. Reactions involve woody biomass usually as a solid. The (solid liquid or solid gas) surface reactions have an apparent zeroth order owing to the complete renewal of surfaces during the dissolution. A vast array of products (chemicals, energy and materials) can be produced from woody biomass based on its four major components: extractives, hemicellulose, lignin and cellulose. Each of these four components has a different degree of resistance to chemical, thermal and biological degradation. The pretreatment step is designed to improve the efficiency of the cracking step. Waste products are commonly produced during pretreatment step for a sugar-based biorefinery due in part to the desire to maximize (or degrade cellulose to) glucose production. Non cellulose components in a sugar-based biorefinery were commonly discarded, starting from the pretreatment step. A synergetic approach is to eliminate the waste generation in pretreatment and inserting a step to turn the otherwise waste into value-added product(s). Hot-water extraction can serve this purpose. With a hot-water extraction process as a pretreatment step, size reduction can be enhanced after the high pressure operation. Value-added products can be produced from the hot-water extraction and the treated woody biomass can be more efficiently transformed in the cracking step: either be sugar-based, or gasification, or pyrolysis, or direct conversion to solid wood products. The synergy stems from the selective separation/removal of components from woody biomass. The reaction of solid component dissolutions from the woody biomass is of zeroth order, following a surface renewal mechanism during the bulk of the hot-water extraction process.

Abstract: With fast economic development, industrialization and urbanization, China faces increasing pressures on carbon emission reduction, and especially on air pollutants (SO2, NOx, PM) reduction, particularly the notorious haze issue caused by air pollution in recent years. Pursuing co-benefits is an effective approach to simultaneously respond to both carbon and air pollutant problems. In this paper, the AIM/CGE (Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment Model/Computational General Equilibrium) model and GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies)-China model are combined together to project future CO2 and air pollutants emissions in China, as well as reduction costs and co-benefit effects. Considering implementation of carbon mitigation policy and air pollutant mitigation technologies, four scenarios (S1, S2, S3 and S4) are analyzed. Results indicate that by implementing both carbon and air pollutant mitigation (S4), CO2 emission per GDP can be reduced by 41% by 2020, compared with the 2005 level, and SO2, NOx and PM2.5 emissions would change by a factor 0.8, 1.26 and 1.0 of the 2005 level, respectively in 2030. The real co-benefits of emission reductions (S-2 minus S4) for SO2, NOx and PM2.5 are 2.4 Mt, 2.1 Mt and 03 Mt in 2020, and the corresponding cost reduction co-benefits are 4, 0.11, and 0.8 billion (sic), respectively. Provincial disparity analysis reveals that regions with higher co-benefits are those with higher GDP such as Guangdong, Shandong and Jiangsu, energy production bases such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi, low coal quality provinces such as Sichuan (for SO2), and industrial base provinces such as Liaoning. Cost-effectiveness is finally discussed for policy implications, which suggests that investment in less developed western regions is more cost-effective and easier in reducing CO2 or air pollutant emissions than in developed eastern regions.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to quantify the trade-off between selecting a distributed generation (DG) smarter connection with limited export capacity and a more expensive firm DG connection with a guarantee of full export capacity. The study is part of the analysis of a customer funded network innovation project in the UK. A cost-benefit analysis of the different connection options for connecting DG customers in a specific constrained area in the UK is performed. The study not only requires the identification of the main cost drivers and revenues (including embedded benefits and those allowed by regulation) for getting a new DG connection but also illustrates the interaction (operational and contractual) between the different parties involved (generators, distribution network operators, electricity suppliers, and demand). This study provides empirical evidence, under a number of scenarios, of the potential savings when a smart connection option is available. The results suggest that in general small wind DG customers will always have an advantage in selecting a smarter connection over large ones. We also examine the type of connection that would be preferred by solar PV DG customers and Anaerobic Digestion (AD) DG customers. The study shows that lower curtailment levels tend to substantially reduce the value of firm connections. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of weather variation on energy use by using 5-minutes interval weather-energy data obtained from two residential houses: house 1 is a conventional house with advanced efficiency features and house 2 is a net-zero solar house with relatively more advanced efficiency features. Our result suggests that energy consumption in house 2 is not as sensitive to changes in weather variables as the conventional house. On average, we find that a one unit increase in heating and cooling degree minutes increases energy use by about 9% and 5% respectively for house 1 and 5% and 4% respectively for house 2. In addition, our findings suggest that non-temperature variables such as solar radiation and humidity affect energy use where the sensitivity rates for house 2 are consistently lower than that of house 1. Furthermore our result suggests that the sensitivity of energy use to weather depends on the season and specific time of the day/night. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Wind turbine wakes have significant effects on the production efficiency and fatigue loads, and these effects should be considered in the optimization of wind turbine structure and wind farm layouts. In this paper, a numerical model combining Lagrangian dynamic large-eddy models and actuator line methods (ALMs) is implemented to investigate the wind turbine near wakes at three representative tip speed ratios (TSRs). In the model, several model parameters that have been. justified based on the existing literature and experiments are utilized to enhance the numerical stability and accuracy. These parameters are related to a physically meaningful length scale in the Gaussian smoothing function, a Prandtl tip/hubloss factor and a 3D correction for airfoil data. The model is compared to the MEXICO measurements, in which a detailed stereo Ply measurement is carried out. According to the comparison of rotor power coefficients between the prediction and the measurements, there is a slight overestimate at TSRs of 6.67 and 10, while a slight underestimate at TSR of 4.17. Additionally, according to the comparison of streamwise traverses and spanwise distribution of axial velocities, good agreement is achieved at both TSRs of 4.17 and 6.67, while visible difference is found at TSR of 10. Moreover, the simulation result shows a helical behavior of wake tip vortices induced by the turbine rotor. This behavior gets more pronounced with a decreasing TSR. The tip vortices also give a reasonable explanation of why the maximum velocity deficit and turbulence intensity occur near the blade tip of wind turbines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A kind of heat conduction-enhanced shape-stabilized PCM (HCE-SSPCM) was utilized in the under-floor heating system for house heating in winter. This system charges heat by using cheap nighttime electricity and provides heating needs throughout all day. The effect of thermal conductivity of the PCM on energy savings and economic benefits of the system were theoretically and experimentally studied. HCE-SSPCM plates, made of (solid paraffin + liquid paraffin)/high density polyethylene/expanded graphite, were introduced to a test room with under-floor heating system. And the operating characteristics of the system were compared with that of the non-phase change energy storage system and the conventional air conditioning system. The results showed that enhancing the thermal conductivity of PCM in a certain range could significantly improve the energy efficiency of the heating system and reduce the thickness of thermal insulating materials. But the improving effect was not obvious when the thermal conductivity was beyond 1.0 W/m K. The phase change energy storage system had a comfortable temperature environment and the best economic benefits among the three different heating types especially when the ratio of peak-valley electric price was high. Therefore, increasing the thermal conductivity of SSPCM will be of great significance for house heating. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy consumption forecasting is a critical and necessary input to planning and controlling energy usage in the building sector which accounts for 40% of the world's energy use and the world's greatest fraction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, due to the diversity and complexity of buildings as well as the random nature of weather conditions, energy consumption and loads are stochastic and difficult to predict. This paper presents a new methodology for energy demand forecasting that addresses the heterogeneity challenges in energy modeling of buildings. The new method is based on a physical-statistical approach designed to account for building heterogeneity to improve forecast accuracy. The physical model provides a theoretical input to characterize the underlying physical mechanism of energy flows. Then stochastic parameters are introduced into the physical model and the statistical time series model is formulated to reflect model uncertainties and individual heterogeneity in buildings. A new method of model generalization based on a convex hull technique is further derived to parameterize the individual-level model parameters for consistent model coefficients while maintaining satisfactory modeling accuracy for heterogeneous buildings. The proposed method and its validation are presented in detail for four different sports buildings with field measurements. The results show that the proposed methodology and model can provide a considerable improvement in forecasting accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The estimation of the value of carbon emissions has become a major research and policy topic since the establishment of the Kyoto Protocol. The shadow price of CO2 provides information about the marginal abatement cost of this pollutant. It is an essential element in guiding environmental policy issues, since the CO2 shadow price can be used when fixing carbon tax rates, in environmental cost-benefit analysis and in ascertaining an initial market price for a trading system. The water industry could play an important role in the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper estimates the shadow price of CO2 for a sample of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), using a parametric quadratic directional distance function. Following this, in a sensitivity analysis, the paper evaluates the impact of different settings of directional vectors on the shadow prices. Applying the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests, factors affecting CO2 prices are investigated. The variation of CO2 shadow prices across the WWTPs evaluated argues in favour of a market-based approach to CO2 mitigation as opposed to command-and-control regulation. The paper argues that the estimation of the shadow price of CO2 for non-power enterprises can provide incentives for reducing GHG emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Photovoltaic energy has experienced tremendous growth in terms of implementation at facilities for power supply in rural areas and for energy dispatch to grid. The relative position of the fixed panels can present the problem of varying amounts of shadowing among them, which can reduce the overall energy produced from the array of photovoltaic panels on specific dates and times, in addition to the problems in each of the panels themselves. The existing methods calculate the distances between the rows of PV panels using a fixed height of the sun, such that the rays always strike perpendicular to the panels, thereby limiting the duration of solar gain to 4 h. This paper proposes a method that optimises the minimisation of the distance between the rows of fixed photovoltaic panels. The proposed method is based on the exact calculation of the shadows of the panels for the different positions of the sun, which depends on the latitude of the facility, throughout the course of the day and for all of the planned hours of solar gain. To illustrate the proposed method, it has been applied to a case study for which the solutions obtained using the traditional methods are compared, indicating that the distance can be reduced by up to 40% when the tilt angle of the panel is 60. In conclusion, the proposed general method for optimally minimising the distance between the PV panels in solar arrays, which is of particular interest for stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems in remote areas that act as isolated small power producing units for the supply of electricity.

Abstract: One of the issues concerning the replacement of natural gas by green gas is the seasonal pattern of the gas demand. When constant production is assumed, this may limit the injected quantity of green gas into a gas grid to the level of the minimum gas demand in summer. A procedure was proposed to increase the gas demand coverage in a geographical region, i.e., the extent to which natural gas demand is replaced by green gas. This was done by modeling flexibility into farm-scale green gas supply chains. The procedure comprises two steps. In the first step, the types and number of green gas production units are determined, based on a desired gas demand coverage. The production types comprise time-varying biogas production, non-continuous biogas production (only in winter periods with each digester having a specified production time) and constant production including seasonal gas storage. In the second step locations of production units and injection stations are calculated, using mixed integer linear programming with cost price minimization being the objective. Five scenarios were defined with increasing gas demand coverage, representing a possible future development in natural gas replacement. The results show that production locations differ for each scenario, but are connected to a selection of injection stations, at least in the considered geographical region under the assumed preconditions. The cost price is mainly determined by the type of digesters needed. Increasing gas demand coverage does not necessarily mean a much higher cost price. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: India's recent macro-economic and structural changes are transforming the economy and bringing significant changes to energy demand behaviour. Life-style and consumption behaviour are evolving rapidly due to accelerated economic growth in recent times. The population structure is changing, thereby offering the country with the potential to reap the population dividend. The country is also urbanising rapidly, and the fast-growing middle class segment of the population is fuelling consumerism by mimicking international life-styles. These changes are likely to have significant implications for energy demand in the future, particularly in the residential sector. Using the end-use approach of demand analysis, this paper analyses how residential energy demand is likely to evolve as a consequence of India's transformation and finds that by 2030, India's commercial energy demand in the residential sector can quadruple in the high scenario compared to the demand in 2010. Demand for modern fuels like electricity and liquefied petroleum gas is likely to grow at a faster rate. However, there is a window of opportunity to better manage the evolution of residential demand in India through energy efficiency improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: What are the most viable global pathways for a major expansion of zero-carbon emissions electricity sources given the diversity of regional technical, socio-political and economic constraints? We modelled a range of zero-emissions energy scenarios across nations that were designed to meet projected final energy demand in 2060, and optimised to derive the best globally aggregated results in terms of minimising costs and land use (a surrogate for environmental impacts). We found that a delayed energy transition to a zero-emissions pathway will decrease investment costs (-$3,431 billion), but increase cumulative CO2 emissions (additional 696 Gt). A renewable-only scenario would convert >7.4% of the global land area to energy production, whereas a maximum nuclear scenario would affect <0.4% of land area, including mining, spent-fuel storage, and buffer zones. Moreover, a nuclear-free pathway would involve up to a 50% greater cumulative capital investment compared to a high nuclear penetration scenario ($73.7 trillion). However, for some nations with a high current share of renewables and a low projected future energy demand (e.g., Norway), pursuit of a higher nuclear share is suboptimal. In terms of the time frame for replacement of fossil fuels, achieving a global nuclear share of about 50% by 2060 would be a technically and economically plausible target if progressing at a pace of the average historical growth of nuclear power penetration in France from 1970 to 1986 (0.28 MWh person(-1) year(-1)). For effective climate-change mitigation, a high penetration of nuclear in association with a nationally appropriate mix of renewables achieves far superior cost and land effectiveness compared to a renewables-only future to reduce emissions.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to systematically formulate a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES), which consists of solar, wind and diesel generator as a backup resource as well as battery storage, from the preliminary design stage to the optimal operation. Detailed modeling of each system component is introduced as the basis for the simulation study. System sizing considering energy flows is conducted to obtain the optimal combination of photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines. Energy management strategies from both the demand-side and generation-side are developed to realize the objectives of meeting the electricity demand while minimizing the overall operating and environmental costs. Day-ahead and real-time weather forecasting, demand response and model updating are also integrated into the proposed methodology using a receding horizon optimization strategy. The method is demonstrated through an application to a single-family residential home. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: An effective combination of district cooling with electric power production in an integrated solar combined cycle is presented and evaluated. A remote area in hot climate is assumed as location to highlight the importance of peak shaving strategy in an isolated or weakly interconnected power system. Two solutions for handling peak power demand are taken into account in the present investigation. On the one hand, the integration of a Concentrated Solar Power system (CSP) with a combined cycle power plant is considered to match peak power demand on the grid. On the other hand, the adoption of a district cooling system where cooling energy is produced by absorption chillers is proposed, instead of mechanical refrigeration, to reduce and flatten the load profile.
The case study refers to a combined cycle (CC) based on a 46 MW Siemens SGT-800 gas turbine. The CC plant is integrated with a parabolic trough collectors (PTC) solar field and double-effect steam driven absorption chillers feeding a district cooling network. The solar combined cooling and power (SCCP) system is designed to operate in "island mode" to match both electrical and cooling demand on an hourly basis, on a typical winter and summer day. A modeling procedure is applied to accurately simulate the plant operation, including off-design behavior of all plant components. During the day the solar source has the highest priority, whilst the gas turbine (GT) is operated at part-load to follow the load profile.
Electric efficiency and fuel savings for the SCCP plant are computed and compared against the ones resulting from a conventional pure fossil system based on analogous combined cycle and compression refrigeration units. Results show that a SCCP system can significantly reduce fossil fuel consumption in both summer and winter peak hours, while providing higher overall efficiency through the whole day, both in summer and winter.

Abstract: A process system is designed for material transformations that produce certain functional chemicals while usually consuming large amounts of energy. Materials in process systems have long been the major focus of investigation to achieve better economic performance. Rising energy prices and stricter limitations on greenhouse gas emissions have also led to greater attention on energy savings. The configuration of process units in a total refining site has a great impact on both material and energy requirements. The simultaneous optimization of materials and energy is highly important for an enterprise. Hence, material and energy integration is proposed in this study for a total refining site to minimize costs. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed that includes four parts: production planning for materials, energy requirements of process units on the basis of pinch analysis, operational planning for utility systems, and balance of utility streams in total sites. An industrial example is studied to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and the advantages of simultaneous optimization of materials and energy. Significant economic benefits are demonstrated by the simultaneous optimization in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) concept has arisen as a solution to control premixed combustion (PCI) strategies, which avoids soot and NOx formation by promoting a lean air-fuel mixture and low temperature combustion. Thus, this study is focused on investigating the effects of different engine operating variables over combustion, to be able to suggest suitable strategies for extending the RCCI operation from low to full load, in a HD single-cylinder research engine.
Different strategies are implemented at low, medium and high load, varying fuel and air reactivity, by means of parametrical studies. Performance and emissions results are analyzed combining engine testing with 3D-CFD modeling. Based on those results, an overlimit function is used to select the best engine settings for each operating point. Finally, engine emissions and performance results from that RCCI operation are compared with conventional Diesel combustion (CDC).
Results suggest that double injection strategies should be used for RCCI operation from low to mid load. However, from high to full load operation, single injection strategies should be used, mainly to avoid excessive in-cylinder pressure gradients. In addition, it is confirmed the suitability of RCCI combustion to overcome the soot-NOx trade-off characteristic of CDC, from 6 to 24 bar of BMEP, while improving fuel consumption.

Abstract: Stricter emissions control and the increasing pressure for a common European energy market have stimulated new comprehensive methods for the estimation of national CO2 emissions that capture trade balances and introduce life-cycle implications for various sectors and products. In this study we adopt a new estimation framework for national electricity sector emissions which takes into account the cross-border electricity trade. Most importantly, we consider a novel aspect of how can utility-scale energy storage increase its value in its effort to serve the purpose of large-scale integration of renewables and system flexibility. For different levels of energy storage we assess the potential to prevent electricity trade flows from countries with higher CO2 emission factor to countries with lower CO2 emission factor. Optimum assessment of energy storage capacity in European countries is looked at from the viewpoint of maximum CO2 emission savings and the technically realizable pumped hydro storage at the national level. This is associated with the break-even CO2 price that can marginally support new investment in this domain. Our results show that the use of grid-scale energy storage could provide the framework for a fair burden sharing of emissions' allocation in Europe and support a flexible and resilient energy supply system.

Abstract: The premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) combustion represents a possible solution for decreasing the pollution with respect to diesel engine, while maintaining the efficiency rate at values that are comparable, and in some cases higher, than those of a diesel engine. This paper investigates the operation of an optical-access compression ignition engine (bore: 82 mm, stroke: 90 mm) running at PCCI combustion with neat bio-ethanol and European commercial diesel fuel injected in the intake manifold and into the cylinder, respectively. In its original configuration, the engine burned diesel and this case was used as reference of compression ignition combustion. Then, different amounts of bio-ethanol were injected varying the energizing time of the injector set in the intake manifold. This allowed to create PCCI combustion with high levels of pre-combustion mixing, and to ensure low equivalence ratio and low flame temperatures too. Moreover, both the amount and the start of diesel injection was varied to investigate their effects on the several combustion phases. UV-Visible imaging and spectroscopic measurements were performed in the engine and the autoignition of the charge, the combustion process and the chemical species involved were detected and analysed. In particular, optical diagnostics allowed to observe how the mixture burned: no luminous flame emission in the visible range was recorded; while in the ultraviolet wavelength range numerous species, like HCO, HCOH, OH, and CO and others were detected. Varying the in-cylinder premixed ratio the combustion retarded and the rate of heat release passed from single to three-phase premixed combustion, so revealing a phase due to intermediate temperature reactions. The same behavior was observed varying the start of injection and the quantity of diesel that affected the premixed ratio. Spectroscopic measurements revealed that during the intermediate temperature heat release large amount of radical governed the start of combustion of the charge. It was also observed that the preignition combustion was mainly due to the stratified mixing of the diesel fuel close to the bowl wall. Finally the presence of OH radical was monitored for the whole combustion process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A multi-agent system based energy management system (EMS) is proposed in this paper for implementing a PV-small hydro hybrid microgrid (MG) at high altitude. Based on local information, the distributed generation (DG) sources in the MG are controlled via the EMS to achieve efficient and stable system operation. Virtual bidding is used to quickly establish the scheduling of system operation and capacity reserve. In addition, real-time power dispatches are carried out through model predictive control to balance load demand and power generation in the MG. The dynamic model and the energy management strategy of the MG have been simulated on a RTDS-PXI joint real-time simulation platform. The simulation results show that the proposed energy management and control strategy can optimally dispatch the DG sources in the MG to achieve economic and secure operations of the whole system.

Abstract: The integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) is getting much more attention due to the rich reserves of coal around the world. In general, the absorption rate of a physical method such as the IGCC system is weaker than that of a chemical method, but it needs much less energy during the regeneration process. In this study, the main objective is to estimate the performance enhancement for CO2 gas absorption and regeneration by using SiO2/DI water and Al2O3/DI water nanofluids. The key parameters are the concentrations of SiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles and the system pressure during the regeneration process. It is found that the maximum CO2 absorption and regeneration performance enhancements are 23.5% and 11.8% at 0.01 vol% of SiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. However, in the case of Al2O3 nanoparticles, the CO2 absorption performance increases 23.5% at 0.01 vol%, but the regeneration performance decreases 11.2% at 0.01 vol%, respectively. The enhancement mechanisms for CO2 absorption and regeneration by nanoparticles are summarized and proposed in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Using GPS data logged for a representative sample of individual vehicles in private use, we assess the viability of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in Sweden for a wide range of techno-economic conditions. We determine requirements for PHEVs with the aid of a simple parameterization used to analyze the GPS data covering number of trips, driving distance per trip, and parking times, logged for 30 days or longer, for 432 conventional Swedish cars.
Good opportunities for charging and regular distances traveled between rechargings increase the potential for battery-powered driving and, along with a high annual mileage, enhance the viability of the PHEV. Therefore, commuters are likely to be the first drivers for whom the PHEV will be cost-effective. Making charging infrastructure available at work places would enhance the opportunity for this group of early adopters, as we show that charging while at work is comparable at the-initial stage to halving the marginal battery costs for the average commuter.

Abstract: The life cycle carbon emission factor (measured by t-CO2/GW h) of nuclear power is much lower than those of fossil fueled power generation technologies. However, the fact of nuclear energy being a low carbon power source comes with many assumptions. These assumptions range from system and process definitions, to input-output definitions, to system boundary and cut-off criteria selections, and life cycle inventory dataset. However, there is a somewhat neglected but critical aspect - the design aspect. This refers to the impacts on the life cycle carbon emissions from the change in design parameters related to nuclear power. The design parameters identified in this paper include: (1) the uranium ore grade, (2) the critical process technologies, represented by the average initial enrichment concentration of U-235 in the reactor fuel, and (3) the size of the nuclear power reactor (measured by the generating capacity). If not properly tested, assumptions in the design aspect can lead to an erroneous estimation on the life cycle carbon emission factor of nuclear power. In this paper, a methodology is developed using the Process Chain Analysis (PCA) approach to quantify the impacts of the changes in the selected design parameters on the life cycle carbon emission factor of nuclear power. The concept of doing so broadens the scope of PCAs on energy systems from "one-off" calculation to analysis towards favorable/preferred designs. The findings from the analyses can serve as addition to the life cycle inventory database for nuclear power as well as provide indications for the sustainability of nuclear energy systems.

The fuel processor section of each APU is characterized by a reformer (autothermal ATR or steam SR), a non-isothermal water gas shift (NI-WGS) reactor and a final syngas catalytic dean-up step: the CO preferential oxidation (PROX) reactor or the CO selective methanation (SMET) one. Furthermore, three hydrocarbon fuels, the most commonly found in service stations (gasoline, light diesel oil and natural gas) are considered as primary fuels. The comparison is carried out examining the results obtained by a series of steady-state system simulations in Aspen Plus (R) of the four different APU schemes by varying the fed fuel. From the calculated data, the performance of CO-PROX is not very different compared to that of the CO-SMET, but the performance of the SR based APUs is higher than the scheme of the ATR based APUs. The most promising APU scheme with respect to an overall performance target is the scheme fed with natural gas and characterized by a fuel processor chain consisting of SR, NI-WGS and CO-SMET reactors. This processing reactors scheme together with the fuel cell section, notwithstanding having practically the same energy efficiency of the scheme with SR, NI-WGS and CO-PROX reactors, ensures a less complex scheme, higher hydrogen concentration in the syngas, lower air mass rate consumption, the absence of nitrogen in the syngas and higher potential power of the stack anode exhaust. The stack anode exhaust, in fact, is recycled to the fuel processor section, thanks to the presence of methane produced in the final clean-up methanation reactor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Biofuels from microalgae are currently the subject of many research projects to determine their feasibility as a replacement for fossil fuels. In order to be a successful candidate, there must be enough fertilizers available to support large scale production. Commercial fertilizers are available for biofuel production from the world fertilizer surplus, but due to nitrogen and phosphorus future production limitations, biofuels would ideally not use any of these resources to be a long term sustainable fuel. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium requirements were determined for two algal species, Chlorella and Nannochloropsis, to produce 19 billion 1 per year (BLPY). At this scale, both algal species would use 32-49%, 32-49% and less than 1% of the world surplus values of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, respectively. Nutrient recycling options and alternative sources of nutrients were evaluated to determine their potential contribution of lowering the synthetic fertilizer requirement. Results show that all of the recycling scenarios reduce the nutrient requirements, but catalytic hydrothermal gasification has the largest reduction of 95% of the nitrogen and 90% of the phosphorus. Contributions from all alternative sources can also provide only 5% or less of the required nitrogen when produced in the gulf region. For phosphorus in the same region, poultry concentrated animal feeding operations can provide up to 28% of the requirement of Chlorella. To find the least amount of nitrogen that may be used, catalytic hydrothermal gasification was combined with all of the alternative nutrients available in the gulf region. The maximum amount of biofuels that could be produced in this location without using any synthetic fertilizers is 50 20 BLPY from Chlorella and 45 19 BLPY from Nannochloropsis. This study shows that the nutrient requirement for biofuel production from microalgae will not be a limitation if recycling methods within the process chain and alternative sources of nutrients are utilized.

Abstract: Cycle-by-cycle variations in some parameters of the combustion and performance during a dual-fuel premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) combustion process were investigated on a modified direct injection diesel engine with dimethyl ether (DME) as premixing fuel. Experiments were conducted under the two different loads with the different DME quantities at a constant engine speed (1700 r/min). Data of in-cylinder pressure of 100 consecutive combustion cycles for each test condition were recorded. The cycle-by-cycle variations of the maximum pressure (p(max)), the maximum mass-averaged temperature (T-max), the maximum rate of pressure rise ((dp/d phi)(max)), the maximum rate of heat release (dq/d phi)(max) and the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) were analyzed and evaluated using the coefficient of variation (COV) of each parameter. The results show that both COVpmax (<3%) and COVTmax (<3%) are rather small with the different DME quantities. The varying trend of (dp/d phi)(max) is similar to that of (dq/d phi)(max). The COVs of (dp/d phi)(max) and (dq/d phi)(max) decrease slightly but then increase with an increase in DME quantity. With a large DME quantity, a relatively wide range of cycle-by-cycle variations in IMEP and a higher COVIMEP can be observed in the engine operated in a DME-diesel dual fuel PCCI combustion mode, limiting an operating range of the engine. The results indicate that the DME quantity should be optimized under the different conditions to minimize the cycle-by-cycle variations and concurrently extend the operating range of the diesel-DME PCCI engines.

Abstract: The present study aims to numerically investigate the impacts of ethanol blend ratio together with advanced fuel injection timings on biodiesel's performance, combustion and emission characteristics. Simulations were conducted using coupled KIVA-CHEMKIN code for neat biodiesel and its blend fuels with 5%, 10% and 20% (vol.%) of ethanol at a fix engine speed of 2400 rpm under 10%, 50% and 100% engine load conditions, with and without advanced fuel injection timings of 2 degrees, 3 degrees and 5 degrees crank angle. A skeletal reaction mechanism was constructed to include the significant oxidation and emission formation kinetics of biodiesel and ethanol fuels, and it was validated by performing the 0-D ignition delay predictions, as well as 3-D numerical simulations against the experimental results. The results indicate that peak cylinder pressure and indicated thermal efficiency generally decrease with the increasing ethanol blend ratio due to its prolonged ignition delay and reduced heating value. In terms of emissions, the CO emissions generally increase as the ethanol blend ratio increases, while the NOx emissions are reduced. The soot emissions increases under 10% load conditions, but reduced under 50% and 100% load conditions. With advanced fuel injection timings, the combustion process seems to be improved under 10% and 100% engine load conditions. For the efficient use of biodiesellethanol blend fuels, it is suggested that the ethanol blend ratio and advanced fuel injection timing should be carefully selected based on the engine operating conditions.

Abstract: This paper develops a practical miniature and portable vapor compression refrigerator. The dimensions of the refrigerator are 190 mm x 190 mm x 100 mm and its weight is 2.75 kg. It integrates a miniature variable speed rotary compressor with a miniature electronic expansion valve (EXV) operating in pulse width modulation (PWM) mode. Besides, a new type of miniature microchannel plate-fin evaporator is developed with vacuum bonding technology and a brazed aluminum parallel flow microchannel condenser is applied. Experiments are conducted to explore the operating performance of the prototype miniature refrigerator, especially the effects of EXV duty cycle and working conditions on the cooling performance. Experiments find that the operation of the system is smooth and reliable; the results show that it has a cooling capacity of 260 W which is high enough for cooling one person with moderate working load, where the ambient temperature is as high as 50 degrees C and the inlet cold water temperature of the evaporator is 24 degrees C, respectively. Under these operation conditions, the system COP can reach 1.62 and the reversible efficiency is 0.324. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work analyses the impact of different support schemes on the retail price of micro-combined heat and power units based on solid oxide fuel cells in the residential sector. The implications of each incentive toward the technical implementation of the technology are also analyzed.
A detailed techno-economic assessment of the micro-combined heat and power unit is provided considering the best-in-class ceramic fuel cell technology and today's costs for gas and electricity in the residential sector. The Italian case study was used to evaluate the impact of different supporting schemes. In order to further extend the validity of our research, scenarios for Germany and Denmark are simulated and discussed.
For large-family residential users consuming 9000 kWh of electricity yearly, the retail price that yields a five year pay-back-time - without any incentive - is similar to 2500 (sic). Under the same assumptions, for the average family with a consumption of around 3500 kWh, the required price is similar to 650 (sic). In both cases, a retail price that is four and seven time higher respectively is achieved with the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme of the type currently in use in the United Kingdom. A modified Feed-in Tariff is finally proposed to support on-site consumption rather than generation with export to the grid. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Given the current increasingly serious energy crisis, the development and utilization of new energy resources are attracting increasing attention, and wind power is widely used among these renewable energy resources. However, the randomness of wind power can cause a series of problems in the power system. Furthermore, the integration of large-scale wind farms into the whole power grid can place a great burden on stability and security. Accurate wind speed forecasting would reduce the randomness of wind power, which could effectively alleviate the adverse effects on the power system. In this paper, a hybrid wind speed forecasting model is proposed with the hope of achieving better forecasting performance. Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) was employed to decompose the wind speed series into several series with different frequencies. A Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), the parameters of which were tuned by a particle swarm optimization based on simulated annealing (PSOSA), was built to model those series. The optimal input form of the model was determined by Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the daily average wind speed series from four wind farms in Gansu Province, Northwest China, were used as a case study. The results of the simulation and Grey Relational Analysis indicate that the proposed model outperforms the comparison models, and the null hypothesis of the predicted series having the same mean of the real series was accepted.

Abstract: This paper provides a review on three streams of life cycle studies that have been frequently applied to evaluate the environmental impacts of building construction with a major focus on whether they can be used for decision making. The three streams are Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) and Life Cycle Carbon Emissions Assessment (LCCO(2)A). They were compared against their evaluation objectives, methodologies, and findings. Although they share similar objectives in evaluating the environmental impacts over the life cycle of building construction, they show some differences in the major focuses of evaluation and methodologies employed. Generally, it has been revealed that quite consistent results can be derived from the three streams with regard to the relative contribution of different phases of life cycle. However, discrepancies occur among the findings obtained from the three streams when different compositions of fuel mixes are used in power generation, or when the overall impacts are not contributed mostly by greenhouse gases emissions. The use of different functional units in different studies also makes it difficult to compare results with benchmarks or results from previous studies. Besides, there are drawbacks in boundary scoping, methodology framework, data inventory and practices which impair their usefulness as a decision making support tool for sustainable building designs.

Abstract: A model - FUNNEL-GHG-OS (FUNdamental ENgineering PrinciplEs-based ModeL for Estimation of Green-House Gases in the Oil Sands) was developed to estimate project-specific energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in major recovery and extraction processes in the oil sands, namely surface mining and in situ production. This model estimates consumption of diesel (4.4-7.1 MJ/GJ of bitumen), natural gas (52.7-86.4 MJ/GJ of bitumen) and electricity (1.8-2.1 kW h/GJ of bitumen) as fuels in surface mining. The model also estimates the consumption of natural gas (123-462.7 MJ/GJ of bitumen) and electricity (1.2-3.5 kW h/GJ of bitumen) in steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), based on fundamental engineering principles. Cogeneration in the oil sands, with excess electricity exported to Alberta's grid, was also explored. Natural gas consumption forms a major portion of the total energy consumption in surface mining and SAGD and thus is a main contributor to GHG emissions. Emissions in surface mining and SAGD range from 4.4 to 7.4 gCO(2)eq/MJ of bitumen and 8.0 to 34.0 gCO(2)eq/MJ of bitumen, respectively, representing a wide range of variability in oil sands projects. Depending upon the cogeneration technology and the efficiency of the process, emissions in oil sands recovery and extraction can be reduced by 16-25% in surface mining and 33-48% in SAGE). Further, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effects of key parameters on the GHG emissions in surface mining and SAGD. Temperature and the consumption of warm water in surface mining and the steam-to-oil ratio (SOR) in SAGD are major parameters affecting GHG emissions. The developed model can predict the energy consumption and emissions for surface mining and SAGD for oil sands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The development of a sustainable power generation using fossil fuels will be strongly encouraged in the future in order to achieve European targets in terms of CO2 emissions. In this context, sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SE-SR) is a promising process that can be implemented as a CCS pre-combustion methodology. Regarding conventional catalyst-CO2 sorbent materials, main challenges concern the development of innovative CO2 sorbents with higher stability and regeneration temperature lower than CaO one. In recent study, a high-performance material based on incorporation of CaO particles into calcium aluminates was developed by authors exhibiting high sorption capacity and stability in multi cycle process. In this study, such a sorbent was packed, together with the catalyst, in a fixed bed reactor and tested in multi-cycle SE-SR process optimizing the operating conditions. Sensitivity analysis was carried out in reference to feeding flow rate, steam to carbon molar ratio and material particle size. The innovative sorbent exhibits, in optimized process, significant performance improvements (in terms of H-2 purity and total CO2 amount adsorbed in each carbonation cycle) respect similar approaches available in the technical literature.

Abstract: Since 2009, global financial crisis has eased gradually and world economy has begun to recover slowly. Meanwhile, both Brent and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil prices have entered into a new round of increase and volatility, and the abnormal price spreads between them have been identified. Under this circumstance, this paper employs the Markov regime switching model with dynamic autoregressive coefficients to explore the price regimes of Brent and WTI after the financial crisis. Then it analyzes the causes of the abnormal spreads between the two benchmark crude oil prices based on the statistical observations of their typical regime differences. The results show that there are three main regimes in both Brent and WTI crude oil price returns, i.e., sharply downward, slightly downward and sharply upward regimes for Brent whilst sharply downward, relatively stable and sharply upward regimes for WTI. Meanwhile, the typical price regimes of Brent and WTI are the "sharply upward" and "relatively stable" regimes after the financial crisis, respectively. Besides, their different movement regimes in recent years are mainly attributed to their different market fundamental situations and the dynamics in crude oil markets, which also lead to the occurrence of their abnormal price spreads.

Abstract: Improvements in cooling system efficiency are required in modern internal combustion engines (ICE). Optimal thermal management presents several advantages in terms of lower pump mechanical power, reduced friction losses and shorter warm-up time, which result in reduced fuel consumptions and CO2 emissions. These goals can be achieved by adopting lower coolant flow rates, which give rise to nucleate boiling regime. The key requirement for a precision cooling strategy is the capability of developing a reliable, model-based control of the cooling regime. However, there is no model of the cooling system of an Si engine, which identifies precisely the onset of the nucleate boiling. This work fills this void.
This paper presents an original zero-dimensional model of the cooling system of an ICE that predicts dynamically the onset of the nucleate boiling phenomenon and calculates the spatial-averaged metal temperature, the engine-out coolant temperature and the fraction of wall metal area subjected to nucleate boiling. Owing to the little computational effort required, the model is particularly suitable for the development of control algorithms, which can be used to optimize the thermal management strategies in real time and can be easily implemented in the ECU of a modern engine.
The model has been validated by means of experimental tests under several operating conditions, involving variations in coolant flow rate, engine speed and fuel flow rate. The comparison with experimental data shows a very good agreement. Maximum and average deviation in engine-out coolant temperature are 0.61% and 0.44% respectively under steady-state conditions. The coolant flow rate, which determines the on-set of nuclear boiling computed by the proposed model, is well within the uncertainty range of the experimental evidence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The thermal conductivity (lambda) and thermal diffusivity (a(T)) of the solid/liquid phase change linear n-alkanes were measured simultaneously by the transient multi-current hot wire technique at atmospheric pressure in the range 258-348 K. The same set-up was used to measure lambda and a(T) of the liquid and the solid states at different electrical currents. Three n-alkanes, n-hexadecane (C16H34), n-octadecane (C18H38) and n-eicosane (C20H42) were studied. Differential scanning calorimetry was applied at the temperature range 248-348 K to determine the melting/crystallization temperature, the heat of melting/crystallization and the specific heat of both the solid and liquid phases. Some results were compared with available literature data. The density of the n-alkanes at liquid state was also measured at different temperatures and their thermal diffusivity was estimated and compared to that obtained by the hot wire technique. The cumulative energy stored was estimated over a definite range of temperature for the three n-alkanes and this was found to be higher for eicosane. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The ultimate purpose of this study is the reduction of exhaust emissions from a dimethyl ether (DME) fueled diesel engine without deterioration of engine performance, such as indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC). In this study, we applied multiple injection strategies to achieve the research goal. In a comparison between diesel and DME single injection combustion, the IMEP in both fuels was similar around the top dead center (TDC) injection condition (this is the typical injection timing). However, the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission in DME was higher than that in diesel. The single injection combustion in DME and diesel was compared on the basis of the same energy input condition. When the injection timing was advanced in order to reduce the DME NOx emission, the IMEP in DME decreased below the diesel level. Therefore, multiple injection strategies, including pilot injection, split injection, and advanced + post injection, were applied in this study. In the experimental results, the pilot injection strategy with advanced main injection (2nd injection) resulted in the lowest NOx, HC, and CO emissions. In the case of soot emission, DME itself has soot free combustion, and emitted an ignorable amount of soot. Moreover, the pilot injection strategy showed the highest IMEP level and the lowest ISFC level in the test conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Australia has some of the best solar energy resources on the planet. With a Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme designed to ensure that 20% of Australia's electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020, these resources are rapidly being developed. Although not yet widespread, Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants are expected to play a significant role in Australia's future solar-derived electricity. The variability of Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) is largely responsible for the fluctuations in solar energy outputs from CSP plants. The temporal and spatial variability of DNI over Australia provides an assessment of the solar resource for future deployment of CSP plants. As such, this study analyses recent trends in the hourly solar DNI resource using data from 1990 to 2012 obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). The deseasonalized DNI anomaly trends were significant over the west, southeast and northeast of Australia for all seasons. Knowledge of these trends is extremely important for siting and the prediction of CSP plant outputs. DNI increased by 50 W m(-2) over west and southeast of Australia, whereas it decreased by 100 W m(-2) over northeast of Australia - representing approximately +5% and -12% deviations from the long-term averages, respectively. Seasonal analysis also showed significant DNI trends, especially during the summer and winter. Most of the changes seen in DNI over Australia were modulated by changes in cloud amount over the region. The cloud amount obtained from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Product (ISCCP) showed high negative correlations associated with DNI anomalies over Australia. The anomaly in cloud amount is highly correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) obtained from BOM. The strengthening convective activity over Indonesia associated with strong La Nina events modulates cloud coverage teleconnecting towards northern Australia. This increases cloud cover and lowers the DNI significantly over these regions during the summer and autumn season. Although the change in DNI associated with cloud amount is clear, the effect of change in aerosols over these years still needs to be investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As a recently increasing trend among different applications of smart grid vision, smart households as a new implementation area of demand response (DR) strategies have drawn more attention both in research and in engineering practice. On the other hand, optimum sizing of renewable energy based small scale hybrid systems is also a topic that is widely covered by the existing literature. In this study, the sizing of additional distributed generation (DG) and energy storage systems (ESSs) to be applied in smart households, that due to DR activities have a different daily demand profile compared with normal household profiles, is investigated. To the best knowledge of the authors this is the first attempt in the literature to investigate this issue, also including step-wise decreasing cost functions for DC and ESS, varying load and DG production profiles seasonally, and weekday-weekend horizons for a long-term analysis period. The study is conducted using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework for home energy management system (HEM) modeling and techno-economical sizing. Also, different sensitivity analyses considering the impacts of variation of economic inputs on the provided model are realized. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Abattoirs have a large number of energy intensive processes. Beside energy supply, disposal costs of animal by-products (ABP) are the main relevant cost drivers. In this study, successful implementation of a new waste and energy management system based on anaerobic digestion is described. Several limitations and technical challenges regarding the anaerobic digestion of the protein rich waste material had to be overcome. The most significant problems were process imbalances such as foaming and floatation as well as high accumulation of volatile fatty acids and low biogas yields caused by lack of essential microelements, high ammonia concentrations and fluctuation in operation temperature. Ultimately, 85% of the waste accumulated during the slaughter process is converted into 2700 MW h thermal and 3200 MW h electrical energy in a biogas combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The thermal energy is optimally integrated into the production process by means of a stratified heat buffer. The energy generated by the biogas CHP-plant can cover a significant share of the energy requirement of the abattoir corresponding to 50% of heat and 60% of electric demand, respectively. In terms of annual cost for energy supply and waste disposal a reduction of 63% from 1.4 Mio (sic) to about 0.5 Mio (sic) could be achieved with the new system. The payback period of the whole investment is approximately 9 years. Beside the economic benefits also the positive environmental impact should be highlighted: a 79% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 4.5 Mio kg CO2 to 0.9 Mio kg CO2 annually was achieved. The realized concept received the Austrian Energy Globe Award and represents the first anaerobic mono-digestion process of slaughterhouse waste worldwide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a new numerical simulation method to calculate transient voltage profiles of lithium-ion secondary batteries. The method employs circuit analysis of an internal equivalent electric circuit composed of an electromotive force, an LR parallel circuit, and eight CR parallel circuits. To demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of this approach, the authors measured the transient voltage responses of three types of test batteries with different output power densities, and compared these experimental data with simulation results. Battery performance was tested using different charge/discharge current patterns and a range of values for state of charge (SOC) and operating temperature. The accuracy of the proposed simulation method was confirmed for all test cases using the three different batteries and charge/discharge current patterns, demonstrating that the method is versatile and applicable to various lithium-ion secondary batteries regardless of type. Since the employed internal equivalent electric circuit is composed of only DC voltage source and linear R, L and C elements, all of general purpose software for electric circuit simulations can easily deal with the circuit. This advantage and the obtained results indicate that the proposed simulation method is a useful technique and offers a powerful tool to develop sophisticated battery control systems for various applications.

Abstract: In this paper, a common rail diesel research engine was converted to operate in dual-fuel mode and extensive experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of natural gas injection timing on the combustion and emissions performance under different pilot injection pressure and timing at low load conditions. The presented results include the cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), ignition delay, combustion duration and brake thermal efficiency, as well as CO, HC and NOx emissions at different natural gas injection timing under pilot injection pressure (46 and 72 MPa) and pilot injection timing (-8 degrees and -17 degrees ATDC) operation conditions at low load (BMEP = 0.24 MPa). The results indicated that retarded natural gas injection timing can achieve a stratified-like air-fuel mixture in cylinder under the different pilot injection conditions, which provided a method to improve the combustion performance and exhaust emissions at low load. Moreover, under higher pilot injection pressure (72 MPa) conditions, better combustion performance, such as shorter ignition delay and combustion duration, higher brake thermal efficiency, were achieved; however, the exhaust emissions significantly increased compared with those under lower pilot injection pressure (46 MPa). On the other hand, under the advanced pilot injection timing (-17 degrees ATDC), the combustion performance was radically better, THC and CO emissions were lower but the NOx emissions were significantly higher compared with those under the regular pilot injection timing (-8 degrees ATDC). This is attributed to faster flame propagation speed, better combustion phasing and higher volumetric efficiency. Consequently, employing appropriate natural gas injection timing accompanied with reasonable pilot injection parameters is critical to further improve combustion performance and exhaust emissions of a dual-fuel engine at low loads.

Abstract: China's past economic development policies resulted in different energy infrastructure patterns across China. Regional disparities in China's current energy flow are rarely visualised and quantified from a system-wide perspective. This study therefore constructs Sankey diagrams for three sub-regions of China in 2010, benchmarks those to the corresponding national Sankey diagram, and quantifies the following major regional disparities: (i) West- and Central-China account for about 89% of the country's coal production. (ii) About 50% of coal fired power generation and about 90% of refining can be mapped to East-China. (iii) East-China also dominated the country's industrial energy consumption, accounting for about 70% of oil, about 58% of coal and about 53% of electricity consumption in industry. This paper highlights the need to combine national and regional energy planning to account for this spatial heterogeneity in China's energy infrastructure, such as future energy intensity and CO2 emission reduction targets. More comparable statistical research is needed to better understand inconsistencies between China's provincial and national energy statistics, in particular for coal. We find data differences of up to 46% for coal, which are due to statistical inconsistencies and assumptions in our methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper outlines the results for a set of experiments carried out on Vertical Axis Autorotation Current Turbine (VAACT) which is an innovative concept among the other low-head hydrokinetic energy converters. The VAACT is a one degree of freedom hinged plate which utilizes the autorotation phenomenon to rotate about its vertical axis in uniform water current. The state of the art on this turbine is application of the extra moment of inertia and also flapped shape of the rotor blade to improve the autorotation characteristics as the principle of operation of the turbine. Investigation of the effect of the extra moment of inertia and the flap on the operational characteristics such as maximum attainable angular velocity and tip speed ratio, obtainable torque of the turbine and its performance is the main objective of this paper.
The VAACT harvests energy efficiently from very low head current. The performance of the flapped configuration of this turbine reaches up to 33% in the very low current velocity. The highest efficiencies occur in the range of 0.65-0.85 of tip speed ratio and also in the range of 0.6-0.7 of the non-dimensional moment of inertia. Furthermore, this study has shown that the flap increases the power coefficient significantly by a factor of up to 5 compared to flat plate type. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Three-dimensional numerical studies were performed for latent heat storage (LHS) process of salt in a horizontal concentric tube to investigate the effects of liquid phase change material (PCM) natural convection on LHS performance. The results show that due to the effects of natural convection, the high temperature molten salt flows upward which enhances the PCM melting rate in upside and weakens the melting rate in downside. So, although the natural convection can enhance the heat transfer performance of liquid PCM, it also causes larger non-uniformity for the solid-liquid interface and temperature distribution during the PCM melting process. Then a local enhanced fin-tube was designed to improve the uniformity of the melting process. The effects of fin geometric parameters on the LHS performance were numerically investigated. The results show that the local fins can improve the uniformity of the LHS process. However, the fin parameters should be appropriately selected because the excessive large fin parameters will break the uniformity again. In present paper, the following fin parameters are recommended: fin number, 7; dimensionless fin thickness, 0.1; dimensionless fin height, 0.8. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Recently, significant reserves of natural gas have been identified in Mozambique and Tanzania. These resources may support a pathway to both economic growth and a low-carbon future. This natural gas could be used locally for a host of different applications such as cooking, power generation, transportation and fertilizer production. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the potential future demand for natural gas across sectors and countries might impact the economic viability of an investment in a new regional transmission and distribution gas network in Eastern and Southern Africa. We analyze the economic viability by using future demand and pricing data inferred for biomass, charcoal, LPG and liquid fuels currently being used in the continent. The investment and transmission costs are assessed for various scenarios of transmission pipeline networks. Then, a detailed analysis for a gas transmission network across eight Eastern African countries is presented. Results suggest that the development of a regional gas pipeline network within the continent is an attractive investment (based on internal regional demand as well as co-benefits to economy, environment and health) that can complement LNG export, which is the dominant market option being considered to enable the large upstream investments.

Abstract: The present study performed a three-dimensional numerical simulation to observe how trapezoid baffles affect non-isothermal reactant transports and cell net power in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) by the SIMPLE-C method. The geometric parameters of trapezoid baffles installed in the gas channel employed in this study include the angle and height with the same gas diffusion and catalyst layers to realize the cell net power considering the effect of liquid water formation on the fluid flow field. The cell net power is adopted to evaluate the real enhancement of cell performance due to the additional pumping power induced by the pressure loss through the PEMFC. The results illustrated that compared with traditional gas channel without baffles, the novel gas channel with trapezoid baffles, whose angle is 60 degrees and height is 1.125 mm, enhances the cell net power best by approximately 90% among all trapezoid baffle designs.

Abstract: A system optimization of ORCs cooled by air-cooled condensers or wet cooling towers and powered by low-temperature geothermal heat sources is performed in this paper. The configuration of the ORC is optimized together with the geometry of all the components. The objective is to minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the performance of ORCs with different types of cooling systems are compared to each other. The results show that it is economically more interesting to use mechanical-draft wet cooling towers instead of air-cooled condensers. The difference in performance is especially large for a low brine-inlet temperature. The investment cost of wet cooling towers is much lower than the one of air-cooled condensers, so the discount rate has less influence on the former type of cooling. The effect of the water price and the climate conditions on the economics of ORCs is also investigated. Both the brine-inlet temperature and the dry-bulb temperature of the surroundings have a strong influence and values of the optimized LCOE between about 55 and 185 (sic)/MW h are obtained.

Abstract: Mechanical size reduction is considered as a primordial step of current and future lignocellulosic biorefinery. In this sense, it is of high interest to understand who are the biochemical and structural features of the lignocellulosic biomass, which affect the Specific Energy Requirement (SER), and in consequence the cost of mechanical size reduction processes. First, it was shown that the initial moisture content of the lignocellulosic biomass affect the SER and the final particle size distribution. The highest the moisture content gives raise the highest SER. Then, at fixed initial moisture content (approximate to 7% DW), structural and biochemical features of lignocellulosic biomass that can affect the SER were determined. It was noticed that both arabinose/xylose ratio and accessible surface area lead to increasing the SER. On the contrary, the content of cellulose, lignin, crystallinity and p-coumaric acids links were found to have a positive effect on the reduction of the SER. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Though it is far from obvious, concepts from justice, philosophy, and ethics can significantly inform energy consumers and producers. This study details how energy justice can serve as a novel conceptual tool for philosophers and ethicists that better integrates usually distinct distributive and procedural justice concerns. Energy justice serves as an important analytical tool for energy researchers striving to understand how values get built into energy systems or to resolve common energy problems. Energy justice presents a useful decision-making tool that can assist energy planners and consumers in making more informed energy choices. Our energy justice framework has elements of Kantian ethics, which takes each person as an end. It has libertarian elements of freedom and choice, suggesting that good societies present people with a set of opportunities or substantial freedoms, so they can choose to exercise these or not. It is pluralist about value, holding that capabilities for people are different and also that their own interests vary. It is concerned with justice as recognition, noting that failures of procedural justice can result in discrimination and marginalization. It, also, has elements focused on utilitarianism and welfare, attempting to improve the quality of life for all people, as defined by their capabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Dual-media molten-salt thermocline thermal energy storage (TES) systems can be used to maintain constant power production at Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants independent of weather changes at costs less than that of traditional two-tank molten-salt storage systems. The flow distribution is a critical parameter affecting the thermal performance but has rarely been considered for dual-media TES systems in previous studies. This study analyzes the influence of the flow distributions at the inlet and outlet of a salt-rock dual-media thermocline TES tank on the thermal performance. The flow distribution is characterized by radial component, and a two-temperature model is used to investigate the thermal performance of the thermocline tank. The model is first validated against experiment data available in the literature and then used to study the discharge process of the thermocline thermal storage tank for various flow distributions. The results show that even with a large (80% of the area) flow blockage at the inlet, the flow distribution has only a limited influence on the useable energy output (<3% change) of the dual-media storage tank. In fact, the flow non-uniformities reduce the thickness of the thermocline layer and slightly increase the useable energy output, whereas non-uniformities at the top outlet slightly decrease the output. An entropy generation analysis, including the effects from diffusion and interstitial heat transfer, is performed to further explain these phenomena. The interstitial heat transfer is found to be the main cause for the entropy generation in the discharge. Flow non-uniformities are also found to reduce the entropy generation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a probability distribution model combining household power consumption, electric vehicle (EV) home-charging and photovoltaic (PV) power production. The model is set up using a convolution approach to merge three separate existing probability distribution models for household electricity use, EV home-charging and PV power production. This model is investigated on two system levels: household level and aggregate level of multiple households. Results for the household level show the power consumption/production mismatch as probability distributions for different time bins. This is further investigated with different levels of PV power production. The resulting yearly distribution of the aggregate scenario of multiple uncorrelated households with EV charging and PV power production is shown to not be normally distributed due to the mismatch of PV power production and household power consumption on a diurnal and annual basis.

Abstract: Smart grid technology is considered as the ultimate solution to challenges that emerge from the increasing power demands, the subsequent increase in pollution, and the outmoded power grid infrastructure. The successful implementation of the smart grid is mainly driven by the utilization of modern communication technologies, which aim at the provision of advanced demand side management mechanisms, such as demand response. In this paper, we present and analyze four power-demand scheduling scenarios that aim to reduce the peak demand in a smart grid infrastructure. The proposed scenarios consider that each consumer is equipped with a certain number of appliances of different power demands and different operational times, while the percentage of consumers that agree to participate in the demand scheduling program is also incorporated in our models. We provide the analysis for the determination of the peak demand in a residential area, based on recursive formulas. The proposed analysis is validated through simulations; the accuracy of the analytical models is found to be quite satisfactory. Moreover, we unveil the consistency and necessity of the proposed scenarios and corresponding analytical models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Biomass-fueled combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system is a sustainable distributed energy system to reduce fossil energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. This study proposes a biomass CCHP system that contains a biomass gasifier, a heat pipe heat exchanger for recovering waste heat from product gas, an internal combustion engine to produce electricity, an absorption chiller/heater for cooling and heating, and a heat exchanger to produce domestic hot water. Operational flows are presented in three work conditions: summer, winter, and the transitional seasons. Energy and exergy analyses are conducted for different operational flows. The case demonstrated that the energy efficiencies in the three work conditions are 50.00%, 37.77%, and 36.95%, whereas the exergy efficiencies are 6.23%, 12.51%, and 13.79%, respectively. Destruction analyses of energy and exergy indicate that the largest destruction occurs in the gasification system, which accounts for more than 70% of the total energy and exergy losses. Annual performance shows that the proposed biomass-fueled CCHP system reduces biomass consumption by 4% compared with the non-use of a heat recovery system for high-temperature product gas.

Abstract: To curb CO2 emissions, the Chinese government has announced ambitious goals to reduce the CO2 intensity of GDP, and the total target has been allocated to all Chinese provinces during the twelfth "Five-year Plan" period (2011-2015). Although setting the target allocation plan is an efficient way to achieve this goal, some key questions, including how the plan is designed, remained unanswered. From an economic perspective, this requires us to test for the existence of convergence in the CO2 intensity of GDP because the convergence is one of the most important intrinsic economic characteristics that policy makers should take into account: if the convergence exists, the provinces with a higher CO2 intensity of GDP tend to experience a more rapid reduction in the intensity and therefore could share a heavier burden of the intensity reduction. The existence of stochastic convergence and beta-convergence is verified by employing different estimation methods and using various estimation specifications. As a result, the direct policy implication is that provinces with high CO2 intensity should be assigned tougher reduction targets to cut CO2 intensity at higher speeds, while the provinces with low carbon intensity should be allowed to reduce the CO2 intensity at a relatively lower speed. Because some social and economic indicators such as GDP per capita, industrial structure and population density may influence CO2 intensity, the policy makers should take all these factors into consideration to design reasonable reduction target allocation plan.

Abstract: A proposed dual-loop exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) system that combines the features of high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) systems is considered a key technology for improving the combustion behavior of diesel engines. The fraction of HP and LP flows, known as the EGR split, for a given dual-loop EGR rate play an important role in determining the engine performance and emission characteristics. Therefore, identifying the proper EGR split is important for the engine optimization and calibration processes, which affect the EGR response and cieNO(X) efficiencies. The objective of this research was to develop a dual-loop EGR split strategy using numerical analysis and one-dimensional (1D) cycle simulation. A control system was modeled by coupling the 1D cycle simulation and the control logic. An EGR split index was developed to investigate the HP/LP split effects on the engine performance and emissions. Using the model-based control system, a multi-objective Pareto (MOP) analysis was used to minimize the NOX formation and fuel consumption through optimized engine operating parameters. The MOP analysis was performed using a response surface model extracted from Latin hypercube sampling as a fractional factorial design of experiment. By using an LP rich dual-loop EGR, a high EGR rate was attained at low, medium, and high engine speeds, increasing the applicable load ranges compared to base conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Molten salts consisting of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate have been used successfully as a thermal energy collection and storage fluid in different solar thermal plants. However, the relatively high melting point of this mixture (221 degrees C) represents an important risk of local solidification in the operation of the solar power plants during standby periods. In this work, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to analyze the cooling process of representative state-of-the-art molten salt thermal storage tanks during these standby periods. A comprehensive set of operating conditions is analyzed, covering both hot and cold storage tanks, charging levels, and heat losses. Results show that the onset of local crystallization is highly influenced by the tank charging level. While the risk is relatively high in the case of the minimum charging level, in the case of maximum charging level the risk is minimal as it would require a very long standby period. To summarize the results, this work presents a safe charging level calculation, as a function of the operation temperature and the expected standby duration, which could be used as part of an appropriate operational strategy to avoid the risk of freezing for long standby periods. The model assumptions, the different configurations studied and their results are presented and discussed in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In electric vehicles (EVs), several battery cells are connected in parallel to establish a battery module. The safety of the battery module is influenced by inconsistent battery cell performance which causes uneven currents flowing through internal in-parallel battery cells. A battery cell model is developed based on the Matlab-Simscape platform and validated by tests. The battery cell model is used to construct simulation models for analyzing the effect of battery cell inconsistency on the performance of an in-parallel battery module. Simulation results indicate that the state-of-charge (SOC) of a battery module cannot characterize the SOC of ALL the internal battery cells in the battery module. When the battery management system (BMS) controls the end-of-charge (EOC) time according to the SOC of a battery module, some internal battery cells are over-charged. To guarantee the safety of ALL battery cells through the whole battery life, a safety EOC voltage of the battery module should be set according to the number of battery cells in the battery module and the applied charge current. Simulations reveal that the SOC of the "normal battery module" is related to its charge voltage when aged battery module is charged to the EOC voltage. Then, a function describing their relationship is established. Both the capacity and the charge voltage shift are estimated by comparing the measured voltage-to-capacity curve with the standard one provided by the manufactory. A battery pack capacity estimation method is proposed according to the SOC and the capacity of the "normal battery module". Experimental results show that battery pack capacity estimation difference between the proposed method and the standard current integration method is to within 0.35%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: We introduce an integrated model for characterization of spatiotemporal building energy consumption patterns in neighborhoods and city districts. The model addresses the need for a comprehensive method to identify present and potential states of building energy consumption in the context of urban transformation. The focus lies on determining the spatiotemporal variability of energy services in both standing and future buildings in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. This detailed characterization facilitates the assessment of potential energy efficiency measures at the neighborhood and city district scales. In a novel approach we integrated existing methods in urban and energy planning domains such as spatial analysis, dynamic building energy modeling and energy mapping to provide a comprehensive, multi-scale and multi-dimensional model of analysis. The model is part of a geographic information system (GIS), which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. The model is validated against measured data and a peer model for a city district in Switzerland. In this context, we present practical applications in the analysis of energy efficiency measures in buildings and urban zoning. We furthermore discuss potential applications in educational, urban and energy planning practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The heat transfer through a vertical stack of rectangular cavities filled with phase change materials (PCMs) is experimentally analysed in terms of both melting and solidification processes. This paper provides data that are useful for benchmarking and validation of numerical models that account for natural convection in the molten PCM. Two different PCMs are investigated: the free-form PCM-Rubitherm (R) RT 28 HC; and the microencapsulated PCM-Micronal (R) DS 5001 X. In terms of practical applications, the main goal is to discuss which PCM type is better for building applications. The time required for the melting and solidification fronts to reach the mid-plane of the cavities is presented as a function of the PCM type. During charging, the control-temperature value on the hot surface of the test-sample and the period of thermal-regulation are investigated. It is shown that the free PCM is preferable for the thermal control of vertical systems as both parameters are improved due to natural convection. The use of microencapsulated PCMs allows accelerating the charging process with almost no thermal stratification. However, in this case the control-temperature effect and the thermal-regulation period are both reduced. Regarding the discharging process, subcooling plays an important role during the solidification of the free PCM and its effect cannot be neglected when modelling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas; hence, processes are needed to remove it from the environment. Here, CO2 was used as the substrate to generate methane (CH4) by using enriched methanogens after anaerobic enrichment of waste activated sludge (WAS); therefore, we demonstrate that methanogens from WAS have significant potential for converting the greenhouse gas CO2 into the fuel methane. Methane production was found to increase 70 fold by active methanogens in the enriched methanogens culture after 3 days in the presence of Hy and CO2. Throughout the process, CO2 was completely consumed after 4 days of incubation in the vials after sparging with a mixture of Hy and CO2, resulting in significant biological CO2 sequestration by methanogens. Using a mixture of H-2 and (CO2)-C-13, we also demonstrated that the methane produced is due to the utilization of CO2. Microbial community studies via by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicate the dominance of archaea in the enriched methanogens culture of WAS. Archaeal community studies of the enriched methanogens via highthroughput 16S rRNA sequencing also showed that the archaea consist mainly of hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogens such as Methanobacteriaceae, Methanospirillaceae and Methanosarcinaceae spp. which are actively grown in H-2 and CO2. We envision that CO2 gas from power plants can be directed to enriched methanogens of WAS to prevent release of this greenhouse gas while generating a useful biofuel (methane) or other valuable products using this single carbon atom.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method of optimizing financial subsidies and public research and development investments for renewable energy technologies, rather than optimizing financial subsidy alone. By combining system dynamics with real option models, we capture dynamic complex interactions among investors, consumers, and policymakers, as well as future uncertainties of key energy, economic, and environmental factors. Our method thereby makes subsidy optimization more accurate and flexible. To evaluate our model, we apply it to the Korean photovoltaic subsidy and determine that the government can achieve the photovoltaic diffusion target, even if it reduces the total subsidy by $US 359.5 million. The optimal approach is to increase research and development funding by $US 310.4 million while reducing the financial subsidy by $US 669.9 million. Our method helps policymakers optimize their subsidy allocation and therefore reduces subsidy inefficiencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Aerogel granulate glazing systems for energy efficient buildings have various promising properties, including their thermal insulation properties and translucent features. In this study, the energy performance of aerogel granulate glazing systems was evaluated by considering an office facade consisting of a translucent aerogel granulate glazing system at spandrels. The results indicate that such a glazing facade can achieve a lower energy demand than a double glazing facade in cooling dominated climates, such as Tokyo and Singapore. It is also possible to secure better energy savings owing to increased daylight passing through translucent spandrels. In heating dominated climates, such as Oslo, the aerogel granulate glazing facade does not attain the same performance as the glazing facade currently most popular, triple glazing facades. However, a combination of aerogel and triple glazing systems may offer an energy efficient facade for cold climates. From an energy saving perspective, aerogel granulate glazing systems have the potential to become a solution in not only cold climates, but also hot and warm climates. These new findings may contribute to new architecture techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Lifetime and cost are two main factors that restrict the commercialization of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. This paper mainly studies the prediction and the evaluation methods of PEM fuel cell lifetime. A formula to predict the PEM fuel cell lifetime is presented. The formula is based on the vehicular operation records and the tested results in the lab. Also the difference between the vehicular operation condition and the test is taken into consideration. The formula realizes the PEM fuel cell lifetime rapid prediction. A PEM fuel cell residual life evaluation method is also presented. The evaluation method realizes online forecasting of the residual life through updating the environmental affecting factor and voltage degradation rate caused by the operating conditions. Furthermore, the PEM fuel cell economic lifetime is studied. The economic lifetime is the working lifetime which gains the lowest average cost. The synthesis of the lifetime and the cost provides a basis to confirm the best design lifetime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Air solar heaters have more and more applications in many areas, including the building sector, food industry, and agricultural sector. This paper presents a novel construction of a forced air solar heater based on a confined single slot jet of air impinging on the flat surface of an absorber plate. The heat exchanger structure comprises two parallel air ducts (a supply channel and a return channel) in the shape of a triangular prism that are physically separated from one another. Results of experimental research showed that the efficiency of energy conversion ranged from 66% up to 90%. A comparison of results of thermal-flow performance of different types of air solar heaters, including the newly-developed heat exchanger indicated that the tested device can compete with the best commercially available solutions. It was found that the single glass covering significantly improves the efficiency of solar energy conversion from 16% up to 24%. As it turned out, the pressure losses associated with air passing through the device under test were the lowest of five selected solar air heaters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In many countries, the electricity supply and power plant operation are challenged by increasing amounts of fluctuating renewable energy sources. A smart energy system should be developed to integrate as much energy supply from fluctuating renewable sources and to utilise the scarce biomass resources as efficiently as possible. Using the advanced energy systems analysis tool EnergyPLAN and Denmark as a case, this analysis defines which of the three assessed types of CHP plants connected to district heating systems is most feasible in terms of total socioeconomic costs and biomass consumption. It is concluded that the CCGT CHP plant is the most feasible both from a technical analysis and a market economic analysis with electricity exchange. It is found that the current economic framework for large CHP plants in Denmark generates a mismatch between socio economy and business economy as well as an unsustainable level of biomass consumption. Therefore, the regulatory framework should generally be considered in long-term planning of sustainable CHP systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Distinct responses of electricity demand to temperature changes are usually assumed for residential, industrial, and service sectors. However, available empirical studies on the temperature effect of electricity demand provide only partial evidence or evidence at a very aggregate level. Our paper aims to partially fill this existing gap in the literature. Using disaggregated data by sectors, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of the sectorial breakdown of temperature effects on firms' electricity demand. In-depth knowledge of sectorial demand responses to temperature changes is fundamental for improved energy planning because such responses represent a potential source of demand price inelasticity, one of the main obstacles for developing adequate demand response planning mechanisms. Our findings indicate that in Spain firms' aggregate electricity demand is rather insensitive to temperature. However, there are marked differences among sectors, with the highest sensitivity found for firms in the service sector. We show that the aggregate insensitiveness of firms' electricity demand to temperature is mainly due to a demand composition effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The leaching and carbonation performances of indirect mineral carbonation are investigated using coal fly ash (FA) as the raw source and water as the solvent. The reactions were conducted at ambient temperature and pressure with a gas mixture comprised of 15 and 33 mol% CO2. The overall CO2 storage and mineral carbonation capacities of FA suspended solution in which alkaline components had been previously leached for 2 h (2533) were 31.06 and 17.36 mg CO2/g FA, respectively. The mineral carbonation capacity of FA in 2S33 was 18% of the theoretical value and its mineral carbonation storage capacity ratio was 55.9%. The performance of 2S33 was higher than that of its filtrate because the alkaline components were leached from the suspended FA simultaneously with the mineral carbonation. Submicrometer-sized particles were present in raw FA and their size was reduced by stirring during the leaching, as well as slightly increased, compared to the original raw FA, due to the carbonation. These submicro FA particles strongly affected the performance of the mineral carbonation of the FA-water solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Natural gas hydrate is a vast energy resource with global distribution in permafrost regions and in the oceans; its sheer volume demands that it be evaluated as a potential energy source. Understanding the mechanisms of natural gas extraction from hydrate-bearing sediments is critical for the utilization of hydrate accumulations. In this work, methane hydrate dissociation was performed in three kinds of porous media at production pressures of 2.2 MPa, 2.6 MPa, and 3.0 MPa. Results show that the methane gas production process can be divided into three main stages: free gas liberation, hydrate dissociation sustained by the sensible heat of the reservoir, and hydrate dissociation driven by ambient heat transfer. In the process of gas production, hydrate dissociation occurs simultaneously throughout the hydrate zone along the phase equilibrium curve, and then spreads radially from the outside as a result of ambient heat transfer. Hydrate reformation and ice generation always occur in the reservoir interior due to insufficient heat transfer. The use of porous media with increased thermal conductivity accelerates the gas production rate; however, it has little influence on the final percentage of gas production. Furthermore, the Stefan (Ste) number and dissociation rate constant were employed to evaluate the impact of the sensible heat of the reservoir and ambient heat transfer. Results indicate that the sensible heat of the reservoir and ambient heat transfer play a dominant role in hydrate dissociation, and that both are dependent on production pressures.

Abstract: This paper disaggregates energy consumption and GDP data according to end-use to analyze a broad number of developed and developing countries grouped in panels by similar characteristics. Panel long-run causality is assessed with a relatively under-utilized approach recommend by Canning and Pedroni (2008) [1]. We examine (i) reduced form production function models for both the industry and service/commercial sectors, where aggregate energy consumption is expected to cause aggregate output; and (ii) reduced form demand models, where income is expected to cause (separately) per capita residential electricity consumption and per capita gasoline consumption. We uncover for 12 different panels a set of super-consistent causality findings across two demand models that income "Granger-causes" per capita consumption. By contrast, the results from the production function models suggest that a different modeling framework is required to glean new, useful insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Amine-functionalized sorbents prepared by wet impregnation method shows great promises for CO2 capture from real flue gas in power plants. The objective of this work is to understand CO2 adsorption thermodynamics and mechanisms at varied polyethylenimine (PEI) loadings on mesoporous MCM-41 by wet impregnation method using a computational approach for the first time. The structures of PEI/MCM-41 sorbents were optimized using molecular dynamics (MD), and the CO2 adsorption thermodynamics at varied PEI loadings was simulated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method. Results showed a good agreement between experiments and simulation. On the surface of the MCM-41, there are high CO2-philic sites for CO2 adsorption, which were firstly covered by PEI molecular. The functionalization groups increased the interactions of the CO2 with more PEI molecular deployed on the surface of the MCM-41, then to the center of the pore. The adsorption performance of the composite sorbents depended on the adsorption cites and the space for CO2 diffusion. The CO2 adsorption thermodynamics and mechanisms at varied PEI loadings shed lights on tuning CO2 capture performance with amine-functionalized sorbents for power plant greenhouse gas control.

Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a genetic algorithm and neural network (GA-NN) for the prediction of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price. Comparative simulation results suggested that the proposed GA-NN approach is better than the baseline algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Mann-Whitney test results indicated that the WTI crude oil price predicted by the proposed GA-NN and the observed price are statistically equal. Further comparison of the proposed GA-NN with previous studies indicated performance improvement over existing results. The proposed model can be useful in the formulation of policies related to international crude oil price estimations, development plans and industrial production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was modified to describe the long-term process stability of a two-stage agricultural biogas system operated for 494 days with a mono-substrate. The ADM1 model fraction for carbohydrates was divided into a slowly and readily degradable part. Significant different hydrolysis rate constants were found for proteins and single fractions of carbohydrates in batch experiments. Degradation of starch, xylan (hemicellulose), cellulose and zein (protein) were modeled with first order hydrolysis rate coefficients of 1.20 d(-1), 0.70 d(-1), 0.18 (1-1 and 0.30 d(-1), respectively. While the hydrolysis rate coefficients found in batch experiments could be used for predicting continuous process data, the statistically calculated confidence regions (nonlinear parameter estimation) showed that the upper limits were unbounded. Single discrepancies between measured and modeled process data of the two-stage pilot system could be explained by the lack of bioavailability of trace elements. Addition of iron, as Fe(III)C13, allowed stable process conditions for an organic loading rate (OLR) up to 2.5 g(vs) L-1 d(-1). Additional supplement of trace elements was necessary for process operation at OLRs above 2.5 g(vs) L-1 d(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Providing information on the temporal distributions of residential electricity end-uses plays a major role in determining the potential savings in residential electricity demand, cost, and associated emissions. While the majority of the studies on disaggregated residential electricity end-use data provided hourly usage profiles of major appliances, only a few of them presented analysis on the effect of hourly electricity consumption of some specific end-uses on household costs and emissions. This study presents side-by-side analysis of energy, cost, and environment effects of hourly electricity consumption of the main electricity end-uses in a sample of homes in the Canadian province of Ontario. The data used in this study are drawn from a larger multi-stakeholder project in which electricity consumption of major end-uses at 25 homes in Milton, Ontario, was monitored in five-minute intervals for six-month to two-year periods. In addition to determining the hourly price of electricity during the monitoring period, the hourly carbon intensity is determined using fuel type hourly generation and the life cycle greenhouse gas intensities specifically determined for Ontario's electricity fuel mix. The hourly load, cost, and emissions profiles are developed for the central air conditioner, furnace, clothes dryer, clothes washer, dishwasher, refrigerator, and stove and then grouped into eight day type categories. The side-by-side analysis of categorized load, cost, and emission profiles of the seven electricity end-uses provided information on when the maximum usage of specific end-uses occurs and which end-uses are "behaviour based" and which are "outdoor temperature based". The share of each end-use in total household load, cost, and emissions is determined and load, cost, and emission share distributions are compared. The results of this study present valuable information to homeowners for reducing their electricity consumption and to system operators for reducing peak loads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: India needs to significantly increase its electricity consumption levels, in a sustainable manner, if it has to ensure rapid economic development, a goal that remains the most potent tool for delivering adaptation capacity to its poor who will suffer the worst consequences of climate change. Resource/supply constraints faced by conventional energy sources, techno-economic constraints faced by renewable energy sources, and the bounds imposed by climate change on fossil fuel use are likely to undermine India's quest for having a robust electricity system that can effectively contribute to achieving accelerated, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. One possible way out could be transitioning into a sustainable electricity system, which is a trade-off solution having taken into account the economic, social and environmental concerns. As a first step toward understanding this transition, we contribute an indicator based hierarchical multidimensional framework as an analytical tool for sustainability assessment of electricity systems, and validate it for India's national electricity system. We evaluate Indian electricity system using this framework by comparing it with a hypothetical benchmark sustainable electrical system, which was created using best indicator values realized across national electricity systems in the world. This framework, we believe, can be used to examine the social, economic and environmental implications of the current Indian electricity system as well as setting targets for future development. The analysis with the indicator framework provides a deeper understanding of the system, identify and quantify the prevailing sustainability gaps and generate specific targets for interventions. We use this framework to compute national electricity system sustainability index (NESSI) for India. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermocline storage concept has been considered for more than a decade as a possible solution to reduce the huge cost of the storage system in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. However, one of the drawbacks of this concept is the decrease in its performance throughout the time. The objective of this paper is to present a new thermocline-like storage concept, which aims at circumventing this issue. The proposed concept consists of a storage tank filled with a combination of solid material and encapsulated PCMs, forming a multi-layered packed bed, with molten salt as the heat transfer fluid. The performance evaluation of each of the prototypes proposed is virtually tested by means of a detailed numerical methodology which considers the heat transfer and fluid dynamics phenomena present in these devices. The virtual tests carried out are designed so as to take into account several charging and discharging cycles until periodic state is achieved, i.e. when the same amount of energy is stored/released in consecutive charging/discharging cycles. As a result, the dependence of the storage capacity on the PCMs temperatures, the total energy and exergy stored/released, as well as the efficiencies of the storing process are compared for the different thermocline, single PCM, cascaded PCM and the proposed multi-layered solid-PCM (MLSPCM) configurations. The analysis shows that the multi-layered solid-PCM concept is a promising alternative for thermal storage in CSP plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A transient two dimensional local thermal non-equilibrium model is developed to investigate the influences of heat transfer and operating parameters on the dynamic behavior of a cylindrical adsorbent bed during the adsorption process. Local volume averaging method is used to drive the macro scale governing conservation equations from the micro scale ones. In the model, linear driving force model and Darcy's equation are considered to account for the resistances to internal and external mass transfer, respectively. Silica gel-water pair widely used in the adsorption cooling systems is chosen to be an adsorbent-adsorbate working pair. The parameters of interest are convective heat transfer coefficient, solid phase thermal conductivity, bed thickness, evaporator pressure, condenser pressure, driving heat source temperature and cooling source temperature. It is found that amount of refrigerant circulated through the system increases with increasing evaporator pressure-driving heat source temperature and decreasing condenser pressure-cooling source temperature. The duration of adsorption process is more sensitive to heat transfer resistances than to mass transfer resistances. The conductive and convective resistances need to be reduced to reach the equilibrium conditions in a short period of time and hence to have a better specific cooling power. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The interest in self-consumption of PV electricity from grid-connected residential systems is increasing among PV system owners and in the scientific community. Self-consumption can be defined as the share of the total PV production directly consumed by the PV system owner. With decreased subsidies for PV electricity in several countries, increased self-consumption could raise the profit of PV systems and lower the stress on the electricity distribution grid. This review paper summarizes existing research on PV self-consumption and options to improve it. Two options for increased self-consumption are included, namely energy storage and load management, also called demand side management (DSM). Most of the papers examine PV-battery systems, sometimes combined with DSM. The results show that it is possible to increase the relative self-consumption by 13-24% points with a battery storage capacity of 0.5-1 kW h per installed kW PV power and between 2% and 15% points with DSM, both compared to the original rate of self-consumption. The total number of papers is however rather limited and further research and more comparative studies are needed to give a comprehensive view of the technologies and their potential. Behavioral responses to PV self-consumption and the impact on the distribution grid also need to be further studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The high degree of non-uniformity in the irradiance distribution over series-connected solar cells is the main obstacle to the development of concentration photovoltaic (CPV) systems using parabolic dishes. In order to overcome the power loss resulting from the current mismatch due to illumination inhomogeneity, we propose a new cell connection with individual DC-DC converters. The aim of this work is to present an experimental procedure to implement this new approach and to demonstrate its advantages with a basic CPV array prototype. Two separate experiments are carried out respectively with real and equivalent-circuit solar cells in order to study the I-V behavior of the connection under different irradiance distributions. The cells working points which yield the highest net power are determined by maximizing the array efficiency by means of a calculation algorithm. The effectiveness of the system is then proved by comparing the output power obtained by field measurement, with the maximum power that could be delivered by the cells array connected in series. In this study, a possible path towards the development of a more effective CPV receiver prototype is outlined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper concerns heat exchange devices with a zigzag configuration containing multi-phase change materials (m-PCMs). A two dimensional mathematical model was established to model the charging behaviour. An experimental system was built to validate the model. The modelling results agree reasonably well with the experimental data for a single PCM, establishing confidence in the model. Extensive modelling was then carried out under different conditions. The results show that the use of m-PCMs intensifies the charging process in comparison with the use of a single PCM. Given other conditions, a larger phase change temperature difference between the m-PCMs gives a more remarkable enhancement of the charging process, and the use of m-PCMs with an unequal mass ratio gives further intensification. The modelling results also show that, for a given input power, an optimal fluid velocity exists for obtaining a high rate of the melting process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As conventional oil production becomes limited, transportation fuels are being produced from other unconventional fossil resources such as oil sands. Oil sands are a combination of clay, sand, water and bitumen. Vast quantities of oil sands resources have been found worldwide. The largest known reservoir of oil sands in the world is located in the province of Alberta (Canada). Several techniques for the extraction of the oil from oil sands have been developed in recent decades. Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is the most promising approach for recovering heavy and viscous oil resources. In SAGD, two closely-spaced horizontal wells, one above the other, form a steam-injector and producer pair. The reservoir oil is heated by the injected steam and drains to the producer under the effect of gravity. First aim of this work is an economic optimization and evaluation of an hypothetical industrial scale facility (named LINK), located in Alberta. All data relating to LINK plant have been obtained from a review of the existing literature references or have been assumed. A Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCFA) of LINK plant has been performed. Costs of existing projects have been found in literature. The results show that the hypothetical plant LINK is a profitable investment and that the investment cost has a significant effect on the competitiveness of the LINK facility. Second purpose of the present work is an environmental analysis of the LINK plant: in order to evaluate GHG emissions from LINK plant, a LCA analysis has been carried out. The calculated emissions from oil sand production by SAGD technology have been compared with values relating to conventional crude oil pathways and to recovery and extraction of bitumen through surface mining from literature. The comparison demonstrated that SAGD is a promising technology also from an environmental point of view. An economic-environmental model for SAGD technology optimization has been developed.

Abstract: This paper examines the dynamic cell performance of a kW-grade proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack with anode dead-ended mode fuel supply. A self-made kW-grade 40 cells stack with reaction area of 112.85 cm(2) has been used in the experiment. A single-chip (DSPIC30F4011) is utilized for establishing a control circuit to monitor the voltage and current with constant-current loading. The stack temperature is controlled at a low-level temperature rise. To enhance the hydrogen utilization and reduce the water flooding in the fuel cell stack, the dead-ended anode operation is accomplished by controlling the open or close of the anode outlet solenoid valve. As the loading is heavy, the anode outlet solenoid valve is purged frequently to force the water to flow out. While a light load, the anode outlet solenoid valve is shut down for a period time for hydrogen saving. The solenoid valve is controlled to be opened, referred as purge interval, reaching the discharge amount for 1000 C, 1500 C, and 2000 C as parameter, respectively. The open period of solenoid valve, referred as purge duration, is set as 1 s, 3 s, and 5 s for this study. Experimental results indicate an optimal purge interval and duration for water management and cell performance of the fuel cell stack. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: It is important for an architect or a construction manager to easily and accurately estimate the heating and cooling demand of a residential building with a different envelope design in the early design phase. To achieve this objective, this study aimed to develop a nine-node-based Lagrangian finite element model for estimating the heating and cooling demand of a residential building with a different envelope design, which can be useful for an architect or a construction manager in the early design phase. This study was conducted in the following steps: (i) definition of the building envelope design elements; (ii) establishment of a standard database through energy simulation; and (iii) development of a Lagrangian finite element model. The prediction performance of the proposed nine-node-based model was improved in comparison with the four-node-based model. It was concluded that the prediction performance of the proposed nine-node-based model was superior to that of the four-node-based model. For the heating demand, RMSE(9-node, heating) (61.2), MAE((9-node, heating)) (45.1), and MAPE((9-node, heating)) (1.18%) of the proposed nine-node-based model was lower than that of the four-node-based model (73.9, 53.2, and 1.36%). For the cooling demand, RMSE(9-node, cooling) (71.5), MAE((9-node, cooling)) (55.3), and MAPE((9-node, cooling)) (8.24%) of the proposed nine-node-based model was lower than that of the four-node-based model (84.1, 61.1, and 8.71%). The series of processes used in this study could be applied to any other energy-saving technique or to a new/renewable energy system. It could also be extended to any other country or sector in the global environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a review of the optimization techniques and strategies applied to wind turbine performance optimization. The topic is addressed by identifying the most significant objectives, targets and issues, as well as the optimization formulations, schemes and models available in the published literature.
The current energy demand combined with depletion of fossil-fuel reserves and stricter environmental regulations have led to the development of alternative renewable energy solutions like wind energy. The current 2030 United States target is to have at least 20% of the US energy supply by onshore and offshore wind farms. To meet these demands, wind energy costs have to be able to compete with traditional fossil fuel sources. Hence, it is essential and vital that wind turbine designers and manufactures search the optimal solution that fits the objectives under a set of design constraints. Throughout the last 30 years, the objective function has evolved from the earlier maximized metric of the power coefficient to the maximization of the annual energy production. Common alternatives such as blade mass minimization and maximization of the rotor thrust and torque have been examined. However, the main objective has been focused on the minimization of the cost of energy in order for wind energy to become more competitive and economically attractive.
The purpose of this paper is to review previous work that undertakes the performance optimization of horizontal wind turbines by highlighting the main aspects when tackling the wind turbine optimization problem such as: objective functions, design constraints, tools and models and optimization algorithms. In addition, in a conclusion of the review, a discussion and argument about the challenges, issues and future developments are identified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Positive displacement compressors lead the market of compressed air production for industrial applications. Among them, sliding vane rotary compressors represent an energetically virtuous alternative to the current compression technologies. In the present work, the effects of compressor design parameters were investigated through a comprehensive approach that aimed at addressing more efficient machines to promote sliding vane compressors as the key enabling technology in compressed air systems. A comprehensive mathematical model was developed to study the main phenomena occurring in this kind of compressors. The model provides the cell volume evolution over a whole rotation during which filling, compression and discharge processes occur. The first and latter phases are described by the quasipropagatory approach that represents the inertial, capacitive and resistive features of one-dimensional unsteady flows. The dynamics of the compressor blades led to four different arrangements inside the rotor slots while an analysis of the hydrodynamic lubrication established between blade tip and stator wall focused on the oil film thickness evolution to prevent dry contacts. An extensive experimental campaign on a mid-size industrial compressor allowed the model validation at different outlet pressure levels and revolution speeds using a direct measurement of mechanical power and the reconstruction of the indicator diagram from piezoelectric pressure transducers. The friction coefficient at the contact points between blades with stator and rotor was estimated in 0.065 and further improvements of the mechanical efficiency were eventually addressed considering the roles of compressor aspect ratio, revolution speed, and blade tilt. The first two theoretical optimizations might lead to an increase of the compressor efficiency of 2 and 9 percentage points respectively. On the other hand, acting on the blade tilt would not produce relevant improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Membrane based indirect contact liquid desiccant dehumidification technology subsides the serious concern of liquid desiccant droplet carryover observed in conventional direct contact liquid desiccant systems. In the membrane contactor the air and liquid desiccant streams flow in alternate channels in cross-flow arrangement, separated by micro-porous semi-permeable hydrophobic membranes. Only water vapor can pass through the membranes but liquid desiccant cannot permeate. A two-dimensional steady-state mathematical model for semipermeable membrane based indirect contactors as dehumidifiers for liquid desiccant dehumidification applications has been developed. The model can predict the air and desiccant parameters inside the dehumidifier and the outlet parameters for a given input parameters. Five different membrane contactors have been fabricated and series of experiments have been conducted to validate the mathematical model. Aqueous solution of lithium chloride has been used as desiccant. The maximum deviations between experimental and predicted values are within +/- 10% for outlet specific humidity and outlet enthalpy of air, +/- 15% deviation in dehumidification effectiveness and +/- 20% deviation in enthalpy effectiveness. The distributions of major parameters viz, temperature, humidity, concentration, etc., within the contactor have been presented. Parametric analysis has been carried out to study the effects of membrane characteristics, contactor design, fluid flow rates, ambient conditions and desiccant concentration on the performance of the contactors.

Abstract: Serious char formation caused by the repolymerization of unsaturated decomposition products is a considerable challenge for current lignin utilization. Here, a novel and efficient base-catalyzed depolymerization and in situ hydrogenolysis process for lignin decomposition and char elimination was proposed using the synergic catalyst of NaOH coordinated with Ru/C. In which, lignin was first depolymerized to phenolic monomer and its oligomer, and then the oligomer was further converted to more stable aliphatic alcohols simultaneously. The results showed that more than 92.5% of lignin was converted, giving 12.69% phenolic monomer, 6.12% aliphatic alcohol and less than 14.03% residual solid. This residual solid selectivity was far lower than it from the single catalyst condition. Furthermore, the products were analyzed using GC-MS, GPC, HPLC-MS and H-1 NMR. The synergistic effect between depolymerization and hydrogenolysis was also investigated through comparative analysis of the feed-stock, products, and the recovered lignin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The availability of increasing amounts of data to electricity utilities through the implementation of domestic smart metering campaigns has meant that traditional ways of analysing meter reading information such as descriptive statistics has become increasingly difficult. Key characteristic information to the data is often lost, particularly when averaging or aggregation processes are applied. Therefore, other methods of analysing data need to be used so that this information is not lost. One such method which lends itself to analysing large amounts of information is data mining. This allows for the data to be segmented before such aggregation processes are applied. Moreover, segmentation allows for dimension reduction thus enabling easier manipulation of the data.
Clustering methods have been used in the electricity industry for some time. However, their use at a domestic level has been somewhat limited to date. This paper investigates three of the most widely used unsupervised clustering methods: k-means, k-medoid and Self Organising Maps (SOM). The best performing technique is then evaluated in order to segment individual households into clusters based on their pattern of electricity use across the day. The process is repeated for each day over a six month period in order to characterise the diurnal, intra-daily and seasonal variations of domestic electricity demand. Based on these results a series of Profile Classes (PC's) are presented that represent common patterns of electricity use within the home. Finally, each PC is linked to household characteristics by applying a multi-nominal logistic regression to the data. As a result, households and the manner with which they use electricity in the home can be characterised based on individual customer attributes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Integrating solar thermal technologies with gas turbine cogeneration plants reduces fuel consumption and consequently results in a considerable reduction in gas emissions. These technologies are expected to play an important role in solving the global environmental and energy problems. The present work provides a detailed investigation of the technical and economic feasibility of integrating a Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) system with gas turbine cogeneration system. In this regard, different generating capacities of gas turbine and areas of solar collectors have been examined and presented for a hybrid solar gas turbine cogeneration system that produces electricity and process steam at a rate of 81.44 kg/s at 394 degrees C and 45.88 bar. Thermoflex with PEACE simulation software has been used to assess the performance of each proposed integration design option. Optimum solar field size for each considered gas turbine generating capacity (size) has been identified. Also, the reduction in CO2 emissions due to the integration of PTC systems has been calculated as percentage of the CO2 emissions from the conventional system for each gas turbine generating capacity size. The results indicated that hybrid solar gas turbine cogeneration systems with gas turbine generating capacities less than 90 MWe demonstrate a negligible increase in the levelized electricity cost (LEC), which was between 5 US phi and 10 US phi/kWh. It was demonstrated also that integrating a PTC system with a gas turbine cogeneration system of less than 110 MWe generating capacity has more economic feasibility compared to CO2 capturing technologies.

Abstract: Energy storage units have become important components in residential micro-cogeneration (MCG) systems. As MCG systems are often connected to single residences or buildings in a wide variety of settings, they are frequently unique and highly customized. Lithium-ion batteries have recently gained some profile as energy storage units of choice, because of their good capacity, high efficiency, robustness and ability to meet the demands of typical residential electrical loads. In the present work, modeled scenarios are explored which examine the performance of a MCG system with an internal combustion engine, photovoltaic input and a Li-ion storage battery. An electricity demand profile from new data collected in Ottawa, Canada is used to provide a full year energy use context for the analyses. The demands placed on the battery are examined to assess the suitability of the battery size and performance, as well as control related functionalities which reveal significantly varying battery use, and led to a quantitative expression for equivalent cycles. The energy use simulations are derived from electrochemical fundamentals adapted for a larger battery pack. Simulation output provides the basis for techno-economic commentary on how to assess large-scale Li-ion batteries for effective electrical storage purposes in MCG systems, and the impact of the nature of the control strategy on the battery service life.

Abstract: The efficient utilization of the solar spectrum has been intensively addressed by solar researchers in the last decades. For instance, many efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of PV cells and to allow their operation at high temperatures and concentration ratios (CR). On the other hand, solar thermal collectors are generally mature technologies which can be selected according to the outlet temperature required. The study of hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors using beam splitting has gained particular interest since the photovoltaic cells can be thermally decoupled from the thermal receiver allowing operation at significantly different temperatures; in addition, the PV receiver is illuminated only with the region of the solar spectrum that matches well with its spectral response curve. In this work, a general methodology for the determination of the optimal spectral splitting parameters in hybrid PV/T collectors is presented. The method is applied in the design of a novel PV/T collector which is also modeled in detail using the ray tracing software Zemax 12. The optimal wavelengths for the spectrum division in this collector correspond to 732 and 1067 nm, which represents the region of the spectrum that should be directed to the PV cells. Moreover, the method indicates that under this particular partition, 47% more power can be delivered from the collector in relation to a concentrating PV stand-alone system under the same CR. The design of the beam splitting devices was addressed by using SiNx and SiO2 as high and low refractive index materials respectively, in a multilayer thin film filter profile that was included in the ray tracing model. Finally, the ray tracing model suggests that the optical efficiency of the collector is approximately 65% in real operational scenarios and that the concentrated light can be successfully split independently of the light angle of incidence.

Abstract: Quantitative thermography is now mostly accepted as a reliable method to measure energy performance of existing buildings, in particular the thermal transmittance U-values of opaque elements. Some researches have been conducted in this field, each presenting a different procedure verified by the application on simple case studies. Anyway, a comprehensive approach, based on a parametric analysis of walls with different typologies and exposure, but same boundary conditions, is still missing. This study proposes a systematic approach to the problem, based on a three years research activity carried on an experimental building where timber (light) and brick (heavy) structures were tested simultaneously with Infrared Thermovision Technique (ITT), also equipped with heat flow meter (HFM) sensors and a nearby meteo station. Standard deviation of U-values measured with ITT is given as well as absolute deviation against values calculated following international standards and measured with HFM method. Parameters having high significance for the achievement of good results compared to the expected U-values are assessed through a sensitivity analysis. Influence of weather conditions during the survey are also considered and a repeatable procedure is finally set up. The findings presented in the study show that the method gives good results for heavy constructions, while further studies are still needed for light and super-insulated walls. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The use of industrial coal char as a fuel source for an anode-supported solid oxide-based carbon fuel cell (SO-CFC) with a yttrium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode was investigated. Both the Boudouard reactivity and electrochemical performance of the coal char samples are higher than those of activated carbon samples under the same conditions. The inherent catalytic activity of the metal species (Fe-m, O-n, CaO, etc.) in the coal char mineral matter leads to good cell performance, even in the absence of an external catalyst. For example, the peak power density of a cell fueled with pure coal char is 100 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, and that of a cell fueled with coal char impregnated with an FemOn-alkaline metal oxide catalyst is 204 mW cm(-2). These results suggest that using coal char as the fuel in SO-CFCs might be an attractive way to utilize abundant coal resources cleanly and efficiently, providing an alternative for future power generation.

Abstract: This paper present short-term combined economic and emission hydrothermal optimization, addressing total fuel costs and emissions minimization. This paper uses the fuel cost function with valve-point effect, which increases the degree of optimization problem difficulty. The optimal balance between the addressed objectives, that conflict with each other, can be obtained with appropriate hydro and thermal generation schedules. A surrogate differential evolution is applied in order to satisfy 24-h system demand and final states of hydro power plant reservoirs by minimized total fuel costs and emissions. This paper proposes a novel master-slave model optimization algorithm, where the optimal thermal schedules are obtained within the slave model. The data obtained from the slave model are saved into a matrix, which serves as a surrogate model for a master model, where the hydrothermal optimization with all objectives and constraints is conducted by using a parallel self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, different case studies are used: economic load scheduling, economic emission scheduling, and combined economic emission scheduling. The proposed method is verified on a model consisting of four hydro power plants and three thermal power plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As energy heating is one of the main production costs, many efforts have been made to reduce the energy consumption of agricultural greenhouses. Herein, a novel control method of greenhouse heating using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and energy prediction model (EPM) is proposed for energy savings and system performance. Based on the low-Reynolds number k-epsilon turbulence principle, a CFD model of heating greenhouse is developed, applying the discrete ordinates model for the radiative heat transfers and porous medium approach for plants considering plants sensible and latent heat exchanges. The CFD simulations have been validated, and used to analyze the greenhouse thermal performance and the priority of fan coil units (FCU) loops under the various heating conditions. According to the heating efficiency and temperature uniformity, the priorities of each FCU loop can be predicted to generate a database with priorities for control system. EPM is built up based on the thermal balance, and used to predict and optimize the energy demand of the greenhouse online. Combined with the priorities of FCU loops from CFD simulations offline, we have developed the CFD-EPM-based heating control system of greenhouse with surface water source heat pumps system (SWSHPS). Compared with conventional multi-zone independent control (CMIC) method, the energy savings potential is between 8.7% and 15.1%, and the control temperature deviation is decreased to between 0.1 degrees C and 0.6 degrees C in the investigated greenhouse. These results show the CFD-EPM-based method can improve system performance with more accurate temperature, more rapid responses and lower energy consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The solid oxide fuel cell triple combined cycle (SOFC-TCC) power generation system considered in this study is of rated power 1.4 MW, and it consists of SOFC (542 kW), a gas turbine (G/T, 550 kW), and a steam turbine (S/T, 308 kW). The relation of the frequency deviation based on the difference between supply and demand of an independent microgrid that interconnects the SOFC-TCC system and large-scale photovoltaics was investigated through numerical analysis. Because the stabilization of the load fluctuations of the SOFC and S/T required 1.8 to 2 h, control of load fluctuations occurring over periods of 2 h or less was mainly determined by the governor-free control of the G/T. Furthermore, the power characteristics (frequency) owing to cyclic fluctuations (changes occurring over a period of several minutes or less) to sustained fluctuations (changes occurring over a period exceeding 20 min) of a microgrid with large-scale photovoltaics was found to be strongly influenced by the magnitude of the inertial force of the G/T and SIT. From the analysis results, long-term supply-and-demand fluctuations, such as changes occurring seasonally and down to a period of 1 day, are mainly controlled by output adjustment of the SOFC and S/T, whereas the operation controlled by the setting of the governor-free control of the G/T and the inertial system of rotary machines is appropriate for short-term power fluctuations.

Abstract: More knowledge on combustion of agricultural crops is needed because of increased interest in using farm-grown biomass for energy production purposes. Presently, uncertainty regarding fuel quality and combustion-related emissions hinders the sustainable development of the agricultural biomass industry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of physicochemical properties of biomass on gas, namely carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen chloride (HCl), and particulate emissions during on-farm combustion of wood and four dedicated energy crops: short-rotation willow, miscanthus, switchgrass and reed canary grass. Different shapes (pellets, chips and chopped grasses) and harvest seasons (fall and spring) were investigated. The thermal efficiency of the 29-kW boiler (63-75%) varied depending on energy load, excess air and fuel ash content. Wood emitted less CO (57-94%), NOx, (64-74%), SO2 (0-93%) and PM (49-82%) during combustion than the four other solid biofuels. Higher emissions from the latter are due to their higher nutrient content. Pelletized products usually generated less CO (27-86%), CH4 (15-98%) and PM (28-50%) than uncompressed materials. Reaching a constant combustion process with chopped biomass fuels turned out very difficult because of their heterogeneous particles and low density. The present work also revealed that delaying harvest from fall to spring reduced NOx (0-11%), SO2 (11-54%) and PM (0-37%) emissions. The 20-60% decrease of several chemical elements in the biomass due to leaching is likely responsible. Wood, willow, fall- and spring-harvested switchgrass and miscanthus pellets and willow chips seemed suitable to be burned in appropriate small-scale combustion units according to fuel indexes evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, transportation carbon efficiency is redefined, and its inputs and outputs are obtained from a literature review. Carbon, capital and labor are selected as the inputs, and passenger turnover volume and freight turnover volume are defined as the outputs. A new model, a virtual frontier DEA (virtual frontier Data Envelopment Analysis), is applied to evaluate transportation carbon efficiencies, and cases from 15 countries during the period of 2003-2010 are analyzed to verify the results. Next, a Tobit regression model is applied to identify the important influencing factors of transportation carbon efficiency. The results indicate that compared to the technology factor and management factor, the influencing degree of a structure factor is relatively small. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ground source heat pump systems are an energy efficient heating and cooling technology for residential and commercial buildings. The main barrier to adoption is the higher investment cost compared to conventional systems. Where available land area permits, horizontal ground heat exchangers are generally less expensive than vertical borehole-type ground heat exchangers (GHXs). A further cost reduction can be made by using Slinky(TM) GHXs, which require less trench space and hence reduce the installation cost, in many cases. It is desirable to formulate an accurate model for simulation purposes; such simulations can be used in both design tools and in energy analysis programs.
The model formulated in this paper relies on analytical ring source solutions to compute temperature response functions for both horizontal and vertical Slinky(TM) heat exchangers. The algorithms used to calculate the response factors have several features that significantly increase computation speed. The thermal effect of the ground surface temperature variation on the GHXs is considered by superimposing the undisturbed ground temperature, which is calculated using the numerical approach. For use in system simulations where the GHX may be connected to other components, the model is formulated to calculate both heat transfer rate and exiting fluid temperature, given entering fluid temperature. The model has been validated against the previously published field test data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Linear Fresnel collectors are identified as a technology that should play a main role in order to reduce cost of Concentrating Solar Power. An optical and thermal analysis of the different blocks of the solar power plant is carried out, where Fresnel arrays are compared with the most extended linear technology: parabolic trough collectors. It is demonstrated that the optical performance of Fresnel array is very close to that of PTC, with similar values of maximum flux intensities. In addition, if the heat carrier fluid flows in series by the tubes of the receiver, relatively high thermal efficiencies are achieved. Thus, an annual solar to electricity efficiency of 19% is expected, which is similar to the state of the art in PTCs; this is done with a reduction of costs, thanks to lighter structures, that drives to an estimation of LCOE of around 6.5 c(sic)/kWh.

Abstract: We quantify energy return on energy investment (EROI) as one metric for the sustainability of alternative jet fuel production. Lifecycle energy requirements are calculated and subsequently used for calculating three EROI variants. EROI1 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to lifecycle (direct and indirect) fossil fuel energy inputs, excluding the energy content of fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. EROI2 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to total fossil fuel energy inputs, including the energy content of fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. EROI3 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to lifecycle (direct and indirect) fossil and non-fossil energy inputs, excluding the energy content of fossil and non-fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. We also define an approximation for EROI1 using lifecycle CO2 emissions. This approach agrees to within 20% of the actual EROI1 and can be used as an alternative when necessary. The feedstock-to-fuel pathways considered include conventional jet fuel from crude oil; Fischer Tropsch jet (FT-J) fuel from natural gas (NG), coal and/or switchgrass; hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids jet (HEFA-J) fuel from soybean, palm, rapeseed and jatropha; and advanced fermentation jet (AF-J) fuel from sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass. We find that EROI1 for jet fuel from conventional crude oil ranges between 4.9 and 14.0. Among the alternative fuel pathways considered, FT-J fuel from switchgrass has the highest baseline EROI1 of 9.8, followed by AF-J fuel from sugarcane at 6.7. HEFA-J fuel from oily feedstocks has an EROI1 between 1.6 (rapeseed) and 2.9 (palm). EROI2 differs from EROI1 only in the case of fossil-based jet fuels. Conventional jet from crude oil has a baseline EROI2 of 0.9, and FT-J fuel from NG and coal have values of 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. EROI3 values are on average 36% less than EROI1 for HEFA-J pathways. EROI3 for the AF-J and FT-J fuels considered is 50% less than EROI1 on average. All alternative fuels considered have a lower baseline EROI3 than conventional jet fuel. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Lighting accounts for 19% of total U.S. electricity consumption and 6% of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions. Existing technologies, such as compact fluorescent lamps and light emitting diodes, can substitute low-efficiency technologies such as incandescent lamps, while saving energy and reducing energy bills to consumers. For that reason, lighting efficiency goals have been emphasized in U.S. energy efficiency policies. However, incandescent bulbs release up to 95% of input energy as heat, impacting the overall building energy consumption: replacing them increases demands for heating service that needs to be provided by the heating systems and decreases demands for cooling service that needs to be provided by the cooling systems. This work investigates the net energy consumption, CO(2)e emissions, and savings in energy bills for single-family detached houses across the U.S. as one adopts more efficient lighting systems. In some regions, these heating and cooling effects from more efficient lighting can undermine up to 40% of originally intended primary energy savings, erode anticipated carbon savings completely, or lead to 30% less household monetary savings than intended. The size of the effect depends on regional factors such as climate, technologies used for heating and cooling, electricity fuel mix, emissions factors, and electricity prices. However, we also find that for moderate lighting efficiency interventions, the overall effect is small in magnitude, corresponding at most to 1% of either total emissions or of energy consumption by a house.

Abstract: The effect of steam explosion pretreatment on the physical and mechanical properties of the pellets made from empty fruit bunch (EFB) and palm kernel shell (PKS) was investigated and compared to that of softwood Douglas fir (DF). It was found that the high heating value of the empty fruit bunch was increased by 21% after steam explosion pretreatment. The pellet density of EFB and Douglas fir pellets did not change while the pellet density of PKS increased from 1.13 to 1.21 g/cm(3) after steam explosion. That may be attributed to the rapid volatilization of high mass fraction extractives during high pressure steaming and lead to the shrinkage of micropores of the PKS fibers. The maximum brealdng strength of steam exploded EFB and PKS were increased by 63% and 45%, respectively. The required compaction energy for the steam exploded EFB pellet is 44.50 J/g while that of the untreated EFB pellet is 30.15 J/g. Similar to Douglas fir, the required extrusion energy for the steam exploded EFB pellet was about 6 times than that of the untreated EFB pellet. The increased extrusion energy is mainly contributed by the increase in mono-saccharides by auto-hydrolysis during steam explosion pretreatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A novel compressed air drying method using pressurized liquid desiccant is proposed in this paper. The compressed air drying system is consisted of a compressed air module, a pressurized liquid desiccant dehumidifier, a liquid desiccant regenerator working in an atmospheric pressure, and other auxiliary components. An experimental apparatus of the pressurized liquid desiccant dehumidifier associated with a compressed air module is established to verify the proposed air drying method experimentally. The results show that, under the pressure of 0.5 MPa, the moisture content in the outlet air can reach 0.9 g/kg. The moisture content of the outlet air reaches 1.4 g/kg under the pressure of 0.3 MPa, and the power consumption of the drying system is 6.17 kJ/g, which is 0.69 kJ/g and 10.1% lower than the conventional compressed air cooling drying system. The dehumidification efficiency is around 0.90, indicating the sufficiently mass transfer between compressed air and solution in pressurized dehumidifier. Besides, the proposed compressed air drying system can use the low-grade heat from the air compressor to regenerate the diluted desiccant solution. The novel air drying method is verified to offer very dry air for industrial application, and shows significant energy saving potential compared with the conventional compressed air cooling drying system.

Abstract: Energy-efficient renovation of existing residential buildings is an important energy policy in China, but financing difficulties seriously hinder the promotion of the policy. In this article, novel indices based on benefit-cost analysis are presented to overcome the barriers. Firstly, benefit-cost analysis is expanded to include the ratio of energy-saving benefit to investment cost (EnIR), the ratio of environmental benefit to investment cost (EvIR), and the ratio of economic benefit to investment cost (EcIR). The above ratios are applied to determine the optimum plans with the highest cost-effectiveness for the buildings to be renovated. Secondly, according to the actual situation regarding both the government and residents, EnIR is modified to the ratio of energy-saving benefit from the retrofit plan to the part of the investment cost undertaken by the government (EnIgR), EvIR to the ratio of environmental benefit from the retrofit plan to the part of the investment cost undertaken by the government (EvIgR), and EcIR to the ratio of economic benefit from the retrofit plan to the part of the investment cost undertaken by residents (EcIrR). The modified ratios can increase awareness of residents in respect of their individual benefits from the adoption of the optimum plans, and can attract them to co-invest. Through these two steps, financing difficulties could be eased or even no longer considered as obstacles to some extent. The ratios are applied to a case study building in Hangzhou. Based on the results, a "win-win" model, consistent with market principles, is developed, in which both the government and residents can co-invest and co-benefit. The model has proven to be an effective decision-making tool in promoting the building renovation policy in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study aimed to document the material balance and evaluate the energy profit ratios (EPRs) of two processes for recovering hydrocarbon from the green microalgae Botiyococcus braunii, which produces hydrocarbon intercellularly, releases it extracellularly, and accumulates it in the extracellular matrix in colony-form. The first is a wet process that elutes an extraction inhibitor through heat, eliminates it through solid-liquid separation, and extracts a hydrocarbon using hexane. The second is a dry process that extracts hydrocarbon by hexane after drying. The EPR of the wet process (3.5) was approximately twice that of the dry process (1.8). Therefore, hydrocarbon can be efficiently recovered from B. braunii without drying. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The new numerical thermal model based on polytropic expansion/compression processes was developed for predicting thermal performance of Stirling engines. In this regard, differential governing equations of early adiabatic model of Stirling engines were modified to consider polytropic heat transfers of the working fluid to the surrounding through expansion/compression cylinder walls. Therefore, adiabatic expansion/compression processes of the early adiabatic model were substituted with polytropic expansion/compression processes in the new thermal model. In order to increase accuracy of the thermal model, various loss mechanisms including effect of mass leakage from working to buffer spaces and heat leakage from expansion to compression spaces, due to thermal conductivity (shuttle heat transfer effect) of the displacer, were implemented in basic differential equations of polytropic analysis. In addition, in a similar manner to the early simple analysis, effect of non-ideal heat recovery of the regenerator and hydraulic pressure drop were considered in heater, cooler and regenerator. Also, magnitude of the piston back pressure was corrected in terms of piston velocity using the principle of finite speed thermodynamics (FST) and mechanical friction between piston and cylinder was taken into account in the new thermal model. On the other hand, longitudinal heat conduction between the heater and cooler through the regenerator wall was modeled as an additional loss mechanism. Finally, the new model called polytropic analysis of Stirling engine with various losses (PSVL) mechanisms was applied to a prototype Stirling engine, namely GPU-3 Stirling engine, and the obtained results were evaluated through comparison with previous thermal models and experimental results. Based on the new PSVL model, the output power and thermal efficiency of the GPU-3 engine were predicted with +14.34% and +3.14% (as a difference), respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Building plays a significant role for energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission in the United States. Extensive researches are conducted to develop effective operation strategy for the building system. However, less study is to investigate the energy sharing among a cluster of multiple buildings (aka building clusters) under uncertainty. In this research, we propose to develop a data-driven feed-forward decision framework for building clusters operation, through the use of noise-tolerant data fusion techniques. Three stages are implemented in the proposed framework which include: (1) decisions generation stage that employs an augmented multi-objective particle swarm optimization based decision framework to obtain operation decisions for the next future L hours; (2) execution stage that implements the first l hours decisions; and (3) calibration stage that employs data fusion techniques to calibrate the building clusters model in a l' hour scale. The calibrated model is fed back to the decisions generation stage for the next period decisions. Unscented Kalman filter which is demonstrated to outperform other data fusion techniques in terms of accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency based on our experimental results is employed in the calibration stage. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we compare the operation decisions with and without calibration stage. It is demonstrated that the proposed feed-forward framework can obtain operation decisions to achieve more cost savings. The impacts of different time lengths l in the execution stage are investigated which indicate the selection of l depends on the trade-offs between decision solution quality and computational performance.

Abstract: As an important policy instrument for climate mitigation, the carbon tax policy design and its consequent social-economic impact calls for more research. In this paper, a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model - CASIPM-GE model is applied to explore the impact of a carbon tax and different tax revenue recycling schemes on China's economy. Simulation results show that the carbon tax is effective to reduce carbon emissions with mild impact on China's macro economy. In particular, a production tax deduction can be used to recycle the carbon tax revenue if the government wants to reduce the cost of a carbon tax; however, a consumption tax deduction may help the economy to restructure and may benefit the long-run emissions reduction. In terms of industrial output, most industries are negatively affected; sectors with large share of exports are subjected to negative shocks if there is consumption tax deduction financed by the carbon tax revenue. The study suggests that carbon revenue recycling scheme is important in designing the carbon tax policy: a well-designed scheme can help reduce the cost of a carbon tax. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Gene Expression Programming was employed to express the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a single cylinder four-stroke CRDI engine coupled with EGR. The performance and emission parameters (BSFC, BTE, CO2, NOx and PM) have been modelled by Gene Expression Programming where load, fuel injection pressure, EGR and fuel injected per cycle were chosen as input parameters. From the results it was found that the GEP can consistently emulate actual engine performance and emission characteristics proficiently even under different modes of CRDI operation with EGR with significant accuracy. Moreover, the GEP obtained results were also compared with an ANN model, developed on the same parametric ranges. The comparison of the obtained results showed that the GEP model outperforms the ANN model in predicting the desired response variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Exploring and developing sustainable and efficient technologies for biofuel production are crucial for averting global consequences associated with fuel shortages and climate change. Optimization of sugar liberation from wastewater algae through acid hydrolysis was determined for subsequent fermentation to acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) by Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4. Acid concentration, retention time, and temperature were evaluated to determine optimal hydrolysis conditions by assessing the sugar and ABE yield as well as the associated costs. Sulfuric acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.5 M, retention times of 40-120 min, and temperatures from 23 degrees C to 90 degrees C were combined to form a full factorial experiment. Acid hydrolysis pretreatment of 10% dried wastewater microalgae using 1.0 M sulfuric acid for 120 min at 80-90 degrees C was found to be the optimal parameters, with a sugar yield of 166.1 g for kg of dry algae, concentrations of 5.23 g/L of total ABE, and 3.74 g/L of butanol at a rate of USD $12.54 per kg of butanol.

Abstract: This work investigates post-combustion CO2 capture at ambient temperature in a fixed bed by means of CaO-based sorbents. Two sorbents were used: limestone and pellets prepared from powdered limestone using calcium aluminate cement as a binder. The results showed that pre-hydration had a significant effect on CO2 capture performance of the two sorbents. For instance, after 8 h pre-hydration, the breakthrough time increased from 21 min to 660 min for lime, and from 19 min to 750 min for pellets. The performance of pellets was more sensitive to hydration conditions than for the lime. At breakthrough, full carbonation conversion over half of the reactor was achieved in a pre-hydrated bed of pellets exposed to a feed with 0.5% CO2, resulting in an average specific capture of 0.51 g CO2/g bed material. This was considered a sufficient capture performance, with a distinct mass transfer zone (MTZ) located in the upper half of the reactor. However, increasing CO2 inlet concentration to 2% shortened the breakthrough time and shifted the MTZ toward the entrance zone of the reactor. It was concluded that capturing CO2 from low-CO2 flue gases at ambient temperature using a fixed bed of pre-hydrated CaO-based pellets is a promising approach that has the potential to achieve reasonable capture performance at relatively low cost. The proposed process can be used for CO2 capture from CO2-depleted flue gases (residual CO2) from processes such as amine scrubbing and calcium looping. And it would allow for the possibility that capture could be increased to any given level required by new legislation for plant with carbon capture. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Selection of appropriate climatic variables for prediction of electricity demand is critical as it affects the accuracy of the prediction. Different climatic variables may have different impacts on the electricity demand due to the varying geographical conditions. This paper uses multicollinearity and backward elimination processes to select the most appropriate variables and develop a multiple regression model for monthly forecasting of electricity demand. The former process is employed to reduce the collinearity between the explanatory variables by excluding the predictor which has highly linear relationship with the other independent variables in the dataset. In the next step, involving backward elimination regression analysis, the variables with coefficients that have a low level of significance are removed. A case study has been reported in this paper by acquiring the data from the state of New South Wales, Australia. The data analyses have revealed that the climatic variables such as temperature, humidity, and rainy days predominantly affect the electricity demand of the state of New South Wales. A regression model for monthly forecasting of the electricity demand is developed using the climatic variables that are dominant. The model has been trained and validated using the time series data. The monthly forecasted demands obtained using the proposed model are found to be closely matched with the actual electricity demands highlighting the fact that the prediction errors are well within the acceptable limits.

Abstract: In this paper, a storage system has been considered to be added to a private electricity facility in order to reduce the electricity bill. This kind of system could make sense with a time-of-use (TOU) tariff (with two or three periods of different electricity price) or a real-time pricing (RTP) tariff (which can vary hourly depending on wholesale market), where each day, electricity is bought from the AC grid during off-peak hours (at low price) to store energy, and during on-peak hours (at high price), the storage supplies the whole load or a part, avoiding the purchase of expensive electricity from the AC grid. A new optimisation model to obtain the best storage size and control of the charge-discharge process under RTP tariff has been developed, minimising the net present cost of the system. This methodology allows the electricity consumer to evaluate the profitability of adding storage. A case study of battery storage with a hypothetical hourly RTP tariff based on the Spanish electricity market pool of 2013 is shown. Considering the cost of batteries per kW h cycled expected in the near future (0.045 (sic)/kW h(cycled)), even the optimal storage size with the optimal control is not profitable compared to the system without storage. A much lower battery cost (0.0225 (sic)/kW h(cycled)) would be needed so that the storage system could be economically profitable. Considering a stretched RTP hourly pricing tariff (hourly prices higher than the average of each day multiplied by 1.3 and the lower ones by 0.7), the storage system with the costs expected in the near future (0.045 (sic)/kW h(cycled)) is profitable. We conclude that an hourly tariff that takes the base of the Spanish electricity market pool is not adequate to stimulate this technology, as the difference between maximum and minimum prices during the day is too low to compensate the capital cost plus replacement, operation, and maintenance of the storage system. In other countries, with much higher difference between minimum and maximum electricity price of the day, present battery cost could make it profitable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Torrefaction of plant biomass has the capacity to produce a fuel with increased energy density and homogeneity, but there are reports that it changes the pelletizing properties of the biomass, making it more difficult to obtain high quality pellets. A parametric study was therefore conducted in which three key qualitative parameters, degree of torrefaction (250-300 degrees C), moisture content (0-10%) and pelletizing temperature (125-180 degrees C), were varied according to a five level fractional factorial design, also including particle size as a qualitative parameter. Pelletizing at 300 MPa (pellet densities: 1.0-1.2 mg/mm(3)) was undertaken using a single pellet press and the responses recorded were compression work (W-comp), maximal force to overcome static friction (F-max), kinetic friction work (W-fric), single pellet dimensions and strength. Small particles reduced W-comp and F-max, but increased strength. As expected, all other parameters also had significant effects. In general, less energy was required for W-comp, W-fric and F-max at lower degrees of torrefaction and higher moisture contents and when pelletizing was conducted at higher temperatures. The process window to optimize pellet strength was narrow and, surprisingly, somewhat higher moisture content at higher degrees of torrefaction increased strength. This narrow production window in combination with feedstock variations may, in practical pelletizing situations, result in varying quality. Furthermore, the study illustrates that factorial experiments using single-pellet devices provide new insights that are of importance for the next generation of pelletizing of torrefied biomass.

Abstract: This paper investigates the anode electrokinetics during the start-up or warm-up period of a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) from a temperature above 100 degrees C, to the desired temperature of 180 degrees C, where carbon monoxide (CO) contaminated hydrogen (H-2) is used as the fuel. The heating strategy considered in this study involves an initial heating of the HT-PEMFC by an external source to a temperature above 100 degrees C, after which current is drawn, where electrochemical reaction heating is expected to contribute to the heating process. Thus, a numerical transient three-dimensional model is derived addressing the anode electrokinetics under a specific temperature increase rate during the warm-up process. Operational parameters such as temperature increase rate, initial start-up temperature, CO volume fraction and extracted current density are varied and their effects on the CO and hydrogen coverage fractions on the electrode, the anode overpotential and the cell potential with respect to time, are studied. The results indicate that parameters such as temperature increase rate, initial start-up temperature, CO volume fraction and extracted current density would significantly affect the anode overpotential and the cell potential. Specifically, it is critical to reduce the extracted current density and CO volume fraction, and increase the temperature increase rate, to avoid a sudden shoot up of the anode overpotential that can result in the premature shutdown of the fuel cell. Having a low initial start-up temperature does result in a higher base value of the anode overpotential. The results also indicate that if the fuel cell reaches 130 +/- 5 degrees C before the anode overpotential is overly high, then the fuel cell would not shut down prematurely due to the high anode overpotential.

Abstract: A 3D numerical model for flat-plate liquid solar collectors has been developed. This model is envisioned for predicting the efficiency curve of the collector, for which the different heat transfer mechanisms involved are simultaneously taken into account: solar radiation absorption, transmission and reflection; natural convection in the air cavity; heat conduction across the tube-absorber welded junction; mixed convection flow in the risers; and heat losses by convection and radiation to the ambient. To ensure the reliability of the model, the heat transfer results inside the risers and in the air cavity were contrasted with well-known experimental correlations available in the open literature.
The thermal efficiency obtained with this numerical model is successfully validated against own experimental data. This heat transfer model is intended for evaluating the impact of different operating conditions and design features on the overall performance of solar collectors, reducing costs in prototype construction and experimentation.

Abstract: The design and optimization of ground source heat pump systems require the ability to accurately reproduce the dynamic thermal behavior of the system on a short-term basis, specially in a system control perspective. In this context, modeling borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) is one of the most relevant and difficult tasks. Developing a model that is able to accurately reproduce the instantaneous response of a BHE while keeping a good agreement on a long-term basis is not straightforward. Thus, decoupling the short-term and long-term behavior will ease the design of a fast short-term focused model. This work presents a short-term BHE dynamic model, called Borehole-to-Ground (B2G), which is based on the thermal network approach, combined with a vertical discretization of the borehole.
The proposed model has been validated against experimental data from a real borehole located in Stockholm, Sweden. Validation results prove the ability of the model to reproduce the short-term behavior of the borehole with an accurate prediction of the outlet fluid temperature, as well as the internal temperature profile along the U-tube.

Abstract: In contrast to conventional hydrothermal systems or enhanced geothermal systems, CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG) systems generate electricity by using CO2 that has been geothermally heated due to sequestration in a sedimentary basin. Four CPG and two brine-based geothermal systems are modeled to estimate their power production for sedimentary basin reservoir depths between 1 and 5 km, geothermal temperature gradients from 20 to 50 degrees C km(-1), reservoir permeabilities from 1 x 10(-15) to 1 x 10(-12) m(2) and well casing inner diameters from 0.14 m to 0.41 m. Results show that CPG direct-type systems produce more electricity than brine-based geothermal systems at depths between 2 and 3 km, and at permeabilities between 10(-14) and 10(-13) m(2), often by a factor of two. This better performance of CPG is due to the low kinematic viscosity of CO2, relative to brine at those depths, and the strong thermosiphon effect generated by CO2. When CO2 is used instead of R245fa as the secondary working fluid in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), the power production of both the CPG and the brine-reservoir system increases substantially; for example, by 22% and 20% for subsurface brine and CO2 systems, respectively, with a 35 degrees C km(-1) thermal gradient, 0.27 m production and 0.41 m injection well diameters, and 5 x 10(-14) m(2) reservoir permeability.

Abstract: The development of CO2 pipelines for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) raises new questions regarding the control of ductile fracture propagation and fracture arrest toughness criteria. The decompression behaviour in the fluid must be determined accurately in order to estimate the proper pipe toughness. However, anthropogenic CO2 may contain impurities that can modify the fluid decompression characteristics quite significantly. To determine the decompression wave speed in CO2 mixtures, the thermodynamic properties of these mixtures must be determined by using an accurate equation of state. In this paper we present a new decompression model developed using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package ANSYS Fluent. The GERG-2008 Equation of State (EOS) was implemented into this model through User Defined Functions (UDF) to predict the thermodynamic properties of CO2 mixtures. The model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental data of two 'shock tube' tests. A range of representative CO2 mixtures was examined in terms of the changes in fluid properties from the initial conditions, with time and distance, immediately after a sudden pipeline opening at one end. Phase changes that may occur within the fluid due to condensation of 'impurities' in the fluid were also investigated. Simulations were also conducted to examine how the initial temperature and impurities would affect the decompression wave speed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: With an auxiliary large capacity thermal storage using phase change material (PCM), Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is a promising technology for high efficiency solar energy utilization. In a thermal storage system, a dual-media thermal storage tank is typically adopted in industry for the purpose of reducing the use of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) which is usually expensive. While the sensible heat storage system (SHSS) has been well studied, a dual-media latent heat storage system (LHSS) still needs more attention and study. The volume sizing of the thermal storage tank, considering daily cyclic operations, is of particular significance. In this paper, a general volume sizing strategy for LHSS is proposed, based on an enthalpy-based 1D transient model. One example was presented to demonstrate how to apply this strategy to obtain an actual storage tank volume. With this volume, a LHSS can supply heat to a thermal power plant with the HTF at temperatures above a cutoff point during a desired 6 h of operation. This general volume sizing strategy is believed to be of particular interest for the solar thermal power industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The massive data centre energy consumption has motivated significant efforts to use energy efficiency strategies and the implementation of renewable energy sources that reduce their operational costs and environmental impact. Considering that the potential of many of these measures is often closely linked to the climate conditions, the location of data centres can have a major impact on their energy demand. Moreover, from a holistic approach, differences among regions become even more important when accounting for the electricity attributes from the grid. To assess these differences this work compares by the use of energy indicators the behaviour of a data centre located at different representative emplacements in Europe. To do so, a dynamic energy model which incorporates free cooling strategy and photovoltaic energy is developed. The paper concludes by suggesting that future data centre developments could consider site selection as a new strategy to limit the environmental impact attributable to this sector.

Abstract: To evaluate the effect of phase change materials (PCMs) on the indoor thermal environment of greenhouses under different weather conditions and over a long time in the heating season, a study was carried out using both experimental method and numerical method. The study was conducted in a typical greenhouse located in Beijing, China, and important parameters have been monitored continuously for 61 days, including indoor air temperature, outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, surface temperature of greenhouse envelopes and soil temperature. Based on these parameters, a number of indicators, namely, operative temperature, daily effective accumulative temperature, irradiated surface temperature of the north wall, average temperature of PCMs, and daily heat storage and release, have been used to evaluate the performance of PCMs in greenhouses. All indicators have provided consistent results that confirm the positive effect of PCMs on improving the indoor thermal environment of greenhouses over a long time. Additionally, the paper has demonstrated that a sunny weather could help to promote the efficiency of PCMs, comparing to a cloudy weather. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Large quantities of fruit waste are generated from agricultural processes worldwide. This waste is often simply dumped into landfills or the ocean. Fruit waste has high levels of sugars, including sucrose, glucose, and fructose, that can be fermented for bioethanol production. However, some fruit wastes, such as citrus peel waste (CPW), contain compounds that can inhibit fermentation and should be removed for efficient bioethanol production. We developed a novel approach for converting single-source CPW (i.e., orange, mandarin, grapefruit, lemon, or lime) or CPW in combination with other fruit waste (i.e., banana peel, apple pomace, and pear waste) to produce bioethanol. Two in-house enzymes were produced from Avicel and CPW and were tested with fruit waste at 12-15% (w/v) solid loading. The rates of enzymatic conversion of fruit waste to fermentable sugars were approximately 90% for all feedstocks after 48 h. We also designed a D-limonene removal column (LRC) that successfully removed this inhibitor from the fruit waste. When the LRC was coupled with an immobilized cell reactor (ICR), yeast fermentation resulted in ethanol concentrations (14.4-29.5 g/L) and yields (90.2-93.1%) that were 12-fold greater than products from ICR fermentation alone.

Abstract: A preliminary techno-economic evaluation of retrofitting reciprocating internal combustion engine based cogeneration into existing Canadian houses for the purpose of achieving or approaching net-zero energy rating is presented. Primary energy and electricity consumption, associated greenhouse gas emissions and tolerable capital cost are used as indicators. A whole building simulation model was used to simulate the performance of a commonly used cogeneration system architecture with thermal storage in "typical" single storey houses located in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver, representing the five major climatic regions of Canada. The system is assumed to sell excess electricity to the grid at the purchase price. A high efficiency auxiliary boiler is included to supply heat when cogeneration unit capacity is not sufficient to meet the heating load. The effect of thermal storage capacity, interest rate and acceptable payback period on the overall performance was evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. The findings suggest that internal combustion engine based cogeneration provides a promising option to achieve net-zero energy rating for Canadian houses, and therefore more detailed studies focusing on the entire Canadian housing stock are needed.

Abstract: In this study, a fuzzy-interval possibilistic programming (FIPP) method is developed for supporting sustainable electric power system (EPS) planning with carbon emission abatement under uncertainty. In FIPP, systematic uncertainties expressed as crisp intervals and fuzzy-boundary intervals can be effectively tackled. A FIPP-based clean development mechanism (FIPP-CDM) model is formulated for realizing CO2-emission reduction and adjusting energy mix of Shenzhen's EPS with cost-effective and sustainable ways. Located in the south of Guangdong Province of southern China, the City of Shenzhen is one of fastest-growing cities in the world and has experienced high-speed economic development, accelerated industrialization process, and increased population growth. This is the first attempt to introduce CDM into Shenzhen's EPS with carbon emission abatement, while sustainable EPS's transition pathways are explored through FIPP-CDM model. Results demonstrate that (a) city's energy supply structure tends to the transition from coal-dominated into clean energy-dominated; (b) local renewable energy development is motivated through CDM projects; (c) city's power generation mix is diversified by wind power and solar power, while renewable energy accounts for 2.12%; (d) an additional capacity of [4.88, 5.82] GW of CDM projects is added, contributing to a [15.91, 17.221 % reduction in CO2 emission of fossil fuel-fired power (i.e., corresponding to emission-reduction of 171.59, 85.511 million tonne). Decision alternatives under CDM can facilitate policy enactment of carbon-emission abatement, reformation of Shenzhen's EPS through market-oriented mechanism, as well as achievement of sustainable EPS planning.

Abstract: Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a clean coal technology to utilize deep coal resources effectively. In-situ CO2-oxy coal gasification may eliminate the operational difficulty of the steam gasification process and utilize CO2 (greenhouse gas) effectively. Furthermore, it is necessary to convert the clean gasified energy from the UCG into clean combustion energy for an end-use. In order to achieve efficient clean power production, the present work investigates the thermodynamic feasibility of integration of CO2 based UCG with power generating systems operating in a chemical looping combustion (CLC) of product gas. The use of CO enriched syngas from O-2/CO2 based UCG reduces the difficulty of the heat balance between a fuel reactor and an air reactor in a nickel oxygen-carrier based CLC system. Thermodynamic analyses have been made for various routes of power generation systems such as subcritical, supercritical and ultra-supercritical boiler based steam turbines and gas turbines for the UCG integrated system. It is shown, based on mass and energy balance analysis, that the integration of CO2 based UCG with the CLC system reduces the energy penalty of carbon capture and storage (CCS) significantly. A net thermal efficiency of 29.42% is estimated for the CCS incorporated system, which operates in a subcritical condition based steam turbine power plant. Furthermore, it is found that the efficiency of the proposed steam turbine system increases to 35.40% for an ultra-supercritical operating condition. The effect of operating temperature of the air reactor and the fuel reactor of the CLC system on the net thermal efficiency of combined cycle power plant is investigated. It is found that a net thermal efficiency of 42.53% can be obtained for the CCS incorporated combined cycle power system operating at an air reactor temperature of 1200 degrees C.

Abstract: The Rankine cycle remains the dominant method of thermal plant electricity generation in the world today. The cycle was described over 150 years ago and significant performance advances continue to be realised. On-going metallurgy research has enabled the operating pressure and temperature of the boiler and turbine to be increased, thereby improving the cycle efficiency. The ubiquitous use of the Rankine cycle on a massive scale in conjunction with fossil fuels as the energy source continues to motivate further efficiency improvements in the cycle.
Previous work established a theoretical basis for the use of thermoelectric heat pumps (THPs) in the condensation process of the Rankine cycle to positively impact cycle efficiency. The work presented here experimentally validates this prior work and provides performance metrics for current commercially available THPs and quantifies how their use can increase the efficiency of the Rankine cycle as implemented in a large power plant.
A commercial THP is characterised to obtain its Coefficient of Performance (COP) variation with input current and the amount of thermal energy transported. A larger-scale system comprising of a multistage thermoelectric heat pump is then considered, demonstrating that using commonly available THPs a fuel load reduction of over 1.5% is achievable for a typical 600 MWe generating set whilst simultaneously increasing the overall plant cycle efficiency from 44.9% to 45.05%.
The paper concludes with a cost-benefit analysis of the system, showing that over a four year period the saving in fuel used can easily re-coup the capital cost incurred by the addition of the condenser heat pump. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Cogeneration of heat and electricity constitutes an important pillar in energy and climate policy. The optimal dimensioning and operation of residential micro-combined heat and power (mCHP) systems is an important area of ongoing research, especially because these systems are prohibitively expensive. This paper presents an optimisation model for the capacity and dispatch planning of residential mCHP systems, which is applied with field data from the UK. The method possesses several novelties, including the consideration of technical and economic constraints previously overlooked, such as economies of scale for investments. The application of the model to empirical data demonstrates that economic savings of up to 30% in total annual costs can be achieved through an optimal sizing and operation of a system consisting of a mCHP unit, a peak load boiler and a hot water storage tank. The CO2 emissions in this optimised case are approximately the same as in the case with a mCHP unit only, but substantially (around 22%) below those in a case with a separate generation of heat and electricity from the grid. The new method has been validated in several ways, including a comparison to investments based on constant specific investments, which demonstrate that the latter consistently underestimated the total annual cost by up to 17%. This figure would be higher for larger, or a higher range of electrical CUP capacities. The largest uncertainty relates to the assumed load profiles, from one year, which are taken as representative for the whole time horizon of several years. Further research should focus on more accurately representing discrete operating modi as well as applying the method to other building objects and CHP technologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Biofuel production from food crops leads to debates about the increase in food prices and security of the food supply. On the other hand, biofuels derived from cellulosic (energy) crops offer positive environmental impacts. In this study, we develop a multi-objective mixed-integer optimization model to investigate the trade-offs and competition between biofuel and food production using switchgrass and corn. This model maximizes total economic and environmental benefits and provides optimal decisions regarding land allocations to food and energy crops, seeding time, harvesting time and amount, and budget allocations to farm operations. A piecewise linear lower approximation is developed to linearize the nonlinear revenue curve of corn grain sales. Spatio-temporal environmental impacts such as soil erosion prevention, carbon sequestration and emissions, and nitrogen pollution are included in the model. The application of the model in Kansas indicates that switchgrass is more profitable than corn in cropland, while it requires Conservation Research Program (CRP) incentives for production on marginal land unless priority is given to the environment. In order to ensure food security, our study advises managers and policy makers to provide CRP incentives or to adjust the sustainability factor, which restricts cropland availability for biofuel production. Our spatio-temporal optimization model can also be adapted to different regions with alternative energy and food crops under various management scenarios. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Building energy data has been used for decades to understand energy flows in buildings and plan for future energy demand. Recent market, technology and policy drivers have resulted in widespread data collection by stakeholders across the buildings industry. Consolidation of independently collected and maintained datasets presents a cost-effective opportunity to build a database of unprecedented size. Applications of the data include peer group analysis to evaluate building performance, and data-driven algorithms that use empirical data to estimate energy savings associated with building retrofits. This paper discusses technical considerations in compiling such a database using the DOE Buildings Performance Database (BPD) as a case study. We gathered data on over 750,000 residential and commercial buildings. We describe the process and challenges of mapping and cleansing data from disparate sources. We analyze the distributions of buildings in the BPD relative to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), evaluating peer groups of buildings that are well or poorly represented, and discussing how differences in the distributions of the three datasets impact use-cases of the data. Finally, we discuss the usefulness and limitations of the current dataset and the outlook for increasing its size and applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) recast imposed on all Member States to establish representative reference buildings as an important step in drawing up a methodology for calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and building elements. In this paper, the concept of "reference buildings" and the methodologies used to characterize it are defined. A methodology for defining reference buildings in the national building stock is also proposed. This methodology consists essentially of the creation of a virtual building based on statistical data and, exceptionally, on experts' knowledge and other sources of information. The parameters necessary for distinguishing samples of buildings and the detailed parameters for characterizing each building are defined and listed. These parameters make it possible to know the most relevant information to be drawn up for each of the buildings and how to standardize the model of data collection for all the existing reference buildings for all categories in the EU. The proposed methodology meets the needs and the existing lack of information in the definition of reference buildings in Portugal. This methodology was successfully implemented so as to define a reference building representative of the residential buildings constructed in Lisbon between 1961 and 1990. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In this paper the results of an on-site experimental analysis carried out on a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) fed by different fuels (hydrogen, landfill gas and different mixtures of them) are presented. The examined MCFC is one of the experimental devices of an innovative power plant located at the urban landfill of Giugliano in Campania (Naples, Italy). Here, electricity is produced through four cogenerative reciprocating engines and one cogenerative gas turbine fed by landfill gas, operating since 2003. At the same site, two different fuel cells are installed for scientific purposes.
During the considered experimental campaign, the MCFC is initially supplied by hydrogen for testing the system at the best operating conditions. Afterward, the fuel cell is fed by mixtures of different ratios of hydrogen and reformed landfill gas. For this reason, the system is equipped with an external reformer and a suitable gas cleaning. In order to analyse the system energy performance under varying electricity loads (obtained through an electronic device), several tests were carried out. In addition, several stress tests were also performed aiming at analysing the system endurance when fed by landfill gas. The experimental results concerning the produced electric currents and voltages show satisfactory performance of the system, while the obtained operating temperatures and cell reliability still need to be improved.

Abstract: In the current context of thermal improvement in the building sector, research of new solutions to integrate to the retrofitting process is an essential step in the way of saving energy. With the purpose of maintaining or improving the summer comfort after a retrofitting in a residential building, Phase Change Materials (PCM) could be used to bring enough inertia to use the freshness of night for cooling during the warmest hour in the day. Passive solutions of PCM integration have demonstrated their limited benefits. Using PCM in the way proposed in this article goes through the design of a PCM/air system able to store latent heat. This unit is coupled to the ventilation system to ensure that the heat transfers between the ventilated air and the PCM stock are forced convection and then higher than the ones with natural convection. The fusion and solidification temperature for the PCM needs to be carefully chosen to allow the latent heat storage.
To analyze the behavior of such a system in a retrofitted house with the climate of 4 different French cities, simulations in different configurations have been carried out. According to these climates, we analyze the necessary conditions for the improvement of efficiency of PCM use. Also, the appropriate PCM melting temperature range is defined with corresponding existing PCM characteristics. After, optimal thickness is obtained considering the diurnal temperature evolutions.
The TRNSYS software runs the modeled house, coupled with Matlab for the PCM/air system model. The number of units of such a system can be changed and adapted to the different climates.
Results are expressed in terms of percentage of the time when the indoor operative temperature reaches a certain level. Comparisons are made with classical systems without PCM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We present experimental evaluation of two occupancy-based control strategies for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) systems in commercial buildings that were proposed in our earlier simulation work. We implement these strategies in a test-zone of Pugh Hall at the University of Florida campus. By comparing their performance against a conventional baseline controller (that does not use real-time occupancy measurements) on days when exogenous inputs-such as weather-are similar, we establish the energy savings potential for each of these strategies. The two control strategies are of vastly different complexity: one is a rule-based feedback controller while the other is based on MPC (model predictive control) that requires real-time optimization based on dynamic models. The results of the evaluation are consistent with those of our prior simulation work, that (i) both occupancy based controllers yield substantial energy savings over the baseline controller without sacrificing thermal comfort and indoor air quality, and (ii) the much higher complexity MPC controller yields negligible benefit over the simple rule-based feedback controller. The experimental evaluation provides further confidence that high degree of energy savings is possible with simple control algorithms that use real-time occupancy measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The enclathration of guest gases such as CH4 and CO2 in tetra-n-butyl ammonium chloride (TBAC) semiclathrates and their potential application to natural gas storage and CO2 capture were examined with a primary focus on stability condition measurements and cage filling characteristics. The phase behaviors clearly demonstrated that the double CH4 (or CO2) + TBAC semiclathrates yielded a significantly enhanced thermodynamic stability. In particular, the highest stabilization occurred at 3.3 mol%, the stoichiometric concentration of TBAC center dot 29.7H(2)O. The cage-dependent C-13 NMR chemical shift identified CH4 molecules enclathrated in the small 5(12) cages of the double TBAC semiclathrates. CO2 inclusion in the double TBAC semiclathrate was also confirmed using Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the dissociation enthalpy and the dissociation temperature of the TBAC semiclathrate under atmospheric pressure were measured to be 204.8 +/- 1.7 J/g and 288.0 K, respectively, by a differential scanning calorimeter. The experimental results demonstrate that TBAC semiclathrates can potentially be used for gas storage and CO2 capture due to their high thermodynamic stability and favorable enclathration characteristics of guest gases.

Abstract: Hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) devices can simultaneously generate thermal and electrical energy, but have been limited to low temperature applications. This is done to avoid performance degradation of the PV cell at high temperatures. While the low temperature approach limits PV losses, it would be desirable to develop concentrating photovoltaic/thermal (CPV/T) systems which operate at higher temperatures where the thermal energy can be utilized for electricity production. In addition to using more of the sunlight, these systems may help realize low costs as well as dispatchability through thermal energy storage. Presented here are two primary configurations: the first where the PV cell and thermal system are decoupled, and the second where the PV cell acts as the high temperature absorber. The efficiency of these systems and their ratio of thermal to electrical energy produced are reported as a function of architecture, cell bandgap, and thermal system peak temperature. The studies provide a basis to understand and compare the performance of CPV/T at different operating conditions and architectures. The results indicate that the configurations that utilize recovery of waste heat off the PV cell can achieve the highest efficiency at low concentration ratios, but it remains to be seen if PV cells can survive the temperatures necessary. The thermally decoupled case is attractive in terms of efficiency and operating temperature of the PV cell, but requires significantly higher concentration ratios. Both configurations can achieve exergetic efficiencies exceeding 40% and greater than 50% of the solar energy converted to dispatchable thermal exergy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction and cost price of a green gas supply chain were evaluated. The considered supply chain is based on co-digestion of dairy cattle manure and maize, biogas upgrading and injection into a distribution gas grid. A reference scenario was defined which reflects the current state of practice, assuming that input energy is from fossil origin. Possible improvements of this reference scenario were investigated. For this analysis two new definitions for energy input-output ratio were introduced; one based on input of primary energy from all origin, and one related to energy from fossil origin only. The influence of the improvements on greenhouse gas reduction and cost price was assessed too. Results show that electricity (from fossil origin) is the major contributor to energy input in the reference scenario. Switching to green electricity significantly improves the energy efficiency (both definitions) and greenhouse gas reduction. Preventing methane leakage during digestion and upgrading, and re-using heat within the supply chain also show improvements on these parameters as well as on cost price, although their influence is smaller. Decreasing the share of energy crops in the substrate mix shows a negative effect. It is shown that greenhouse gas reduction of more than 80% is possible with current technology. To meet this high sustainability level, multiple improvement options will have to be implemented in the green gas supply chain. Doing so will result in a modest decrease of the green gas cost price.

Abstract: The economic feasibility of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation is greatly affected by the type of raw material used. The easy availability of eucalyptus from marginal environments is an alternative feed-stock for use as raw material to reduce the production cost. In this study, hydrolyzed eucalyptus was used for ABE production without any nutrients supplementation. Increasing the solid concentration in the eucalyptus slurry from 6.7% (w-dry matter/v) to 25% led to an increase in the initial glucose concentration from 33.7 g/L to 86.7 g/L after enzymatic hydrolysis. Dosed cellulases not only hydrolyzed cellulose but also supplied nitrogen source for ABE producing strain. However, ABE production from the obtained hydrolysate decreased when the solid concentration was increased to more than 10%. The maximum ABE of 12.3 g/L was obtained at 10% solid concentration, with an initial glucose concentration of approximately 40 g/L. In addition, the fermentation capability of eucalyptus hydrolysate was found to be improved by diluting the hydrolysate, which prevented inhibition by substrate and fermentation inhibitors. Finally, ABE concentration was improved to 13.1 g/L by diluting the hydrolysate from the initial solid concentration of 25% to an initial glucose concentration of 45 g/L, which resulted in ABE productivity of 0.109 g/L/h and ABE yield of 0.413 g/g. Thus, the high ABE production from eucalyptus makes it a potential feedstock for biofuel production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The high cost of microalgae cultivation is one of the major hurdles in large scale production of microalgal biofuels. Cultivation in closed photobioreactors (PBR) to achieve high culture concentrations is a potential solution. However, existing PBR designs do not have the desired efficiencies, and lead to high material and energy costs. Therefore, novel PBR designs need to be developed and benchmarked against existing designs. This work has proposed a novel PBR design by combining two existing designs, namely, the airlift and flat plate PBRs. The novel design uses the concept of riser and downcomer from the airlift PBR. However, the downcomer has flat surfaces resembling a flat plate PBR The hydrodynamic performance of the novel PBR was studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and the performance was compared with that of the conventional airlift PBR. The dimensions of the novel design were then optimized using CFD simulations. The results showed that the novel design had superior liquid circulation properties that resulted in a regular and alternative exposure to light and dark regions of the PBR. The novel design also had about 7% higher surface area to volume ratio as compared to a conventional airlift PBR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Recent environmental regulatory sharp curbs on fossil fuel power plants have obliged industries to incorporate alternative sources of fuels for energy production. Cost and recovery of synthetic catalysts are major challenges in carbonaceous materials catalytic gasification. Biomass rich in alkali metals can be added as fuel and also to provide inexpensive natural catalysts to boost fossil fuel gasification. Biomass/fossil fuel co-gasification could provide bridging energy production based on renewable and fossil fuels. In this work, CO2 co-gasification of switchgrass and sawdust with coal and fluid coke was conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer. Gasification kinetics were inhibited or enhanced, depending on the potassium concentration in the mixture. For low K/Al and K/Si molar ratios, the coal ash sequestered the biomass potassium needed for KAlSiO4 formation, and thus, no catalytic effect was observed until the biomass-to-coal mass ratio reached 3:1, where the switchgrass ash supplied enough potassium to more than satisfy the minerals in the coal ash. For high K/Al and K/Si molar ratios, unreacted residual potassium acted as catalyst, enhancing coal gasification. Fluid coke contained much lower Al and Si than for the coal. Hence, the gasification kinetics of fluid coke were significantly augmented by blending the coke with switchgrass due to the abundance of potassium in the biomass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The modelling of fluid flow and heat transfer under coupled conditions remains a challenging issue particularly for industrial-scale enhanced geothermal systems. This paper proposes a simplified approach to model the coupled hydro-thermal system for hot dry rock geothermal applications. The simplified heat exchange model is based on the first principle of heat exchange between two media (fluid and rock) and Newton's law of cooling so that it simplifies significantly the modelling process that otherwise requires the solution of a complex coupled system. The proposed approach has been implemented in an in-house geothermal simulation system that is based on an equivalent pipe network model. The approach is validated against detailed prediction of fluid flow and heat transfer in a public domain fracture network using finite volume based ANSYS/CFX results. It is then applied to modelling heat extraction from the Geodynamics Habanero reservoir in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The application demonstrates that the proposed approach is an efficient and effective means of modelling heat transfer in industrial-scale EGS reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to evaluate three different phase change models used to predict the energy behaviour of a PCM cement mortar sample. Reference data are measured on large samples of composite material using a special experimental set-up. The phase change models tested are: the apparent specific capacity method, the enthalpy method assuming a pure body and the enthalpy method assuming a binary mixture. Numerical results are compared to the reference data of heat flux and energy stored/released. The main conclusions of the study are: (1) the thermodynamically inconsistent apparent specific capacity method is not suitable, (2) the enthalpy method gives better results than the specific capacity method and (3) the enthalpy method gives better results with an appropriate guess of the enthalpy curve.

Abstract: A district cooling system supplies cooling to a group of buildings in a district. It has been widely used for its high energy and economic performance, especially in Asian and European countries. It is supposed that a district cooling system can achieve good performance when used in the subtropical area like Hong Kong, where the cooling is required throughout the year and the building density is very high. This study aims to quantitatively assess the performance of the district cooling system in a new development area in Hong Kong. By modeling the buildings and cooling systems of the new district based on the current plan, the performance of district cooling system is compared with the conventional cooling system, which refers to individual in-building cooling systems. Three cases with different chilled water systems are simulated and analyzed. Results show that the district cooling system is more efficient than the individual cooling system, with less energy consumption and operational cost. Energy consumption of main subsystems is compared and the energy saving potential of district cooling system is analyzed. Sensitivity study of district cooling system performance at partial load is conducted and results show that the district cooling system is more efficient under different load conditions during night time.

Abstract: Wall-flow type diesel particulate filter (DPF) is a required aftertreatment system for particle emission abatement and standards fulfilment in Diesel engines. However, the DPF use involves an important flow restriction, especially as the substrate gets soot and ash loaded. It gives as a result the increase of the exhaust back-pressure and hence a fuel consumption penalty. The increasing damage of fuel consumption with DPF soot loading leads to the need of the regeneration process. Usually based on active strategies, this process involves an additional fuel penalty but prevents from excessive DPF pressure drop and ensures secure soot burnt out.
Under this context, new solutions are required to improve the state of the art DPF soot loading to pressure drop ratio. This paper presents a novel technique based on pre-DPF water injection to reduce the DPF pressure drop under soot loading conditions by disrupting its dependence on soot/ash loading. It provides benefits to engine fuel economy and also higher flexibility for DPF regeneration and maintenance. The work covers a test campaign performed in a passenger car turbocharged Diesel engine equipped with a wall-flow DPF. The main objective is to describe the technique, to provide a figure of its potential for pressure drop control and fuel consumption reduction. The results of the experiments also confirm soot and ash loading capacity increase and demonstrate the lack of negative effects on filtration efficiency and active and passive regeneration.

Abstract: The worldwide interest in thermoelectric waste heat recovery is constantly growing, with a wide range of applications ranging from small harvesters integrated into wireless sensor networks all the way to larger harvesters such as the ones that can potentially be integrated into cars. The wide range of applications makes a requirement for studying the dynamic response of TEGs. The aim of this work is to develop a mathematical model to accurately simulate the thermal and electrical behaviours of a longitudinal thermoelectric energy harvester (LTEH). In order to implement the theoretical analysis, a new TRNSYS component has been developed so this new model can also be used as a design tool.
The LTEH model presented in this paper is validated through the comparison of results between theoretical analysis and experimental data. Testing results and discussion show the reasonability of this new model and also their use as a simulation tool. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to model the multi-criteria decision problem of identifying the most suitable facility locations for biogas plants under an integrated decision support methodology. Here the Geographical Information System (GIS) is used for measuring the attributes of the alternatives according to a given set of criteria. Measurements are taken in interval form, expressing the natural imprecision of common data, and the Fuzzy Weighted Overlap Dominance (FWOD) procedure is applied for aggregating and exploiting this kind of data, obtaining suitability degrees for every alternative. The estimation of criteria weights, which is necessary for applying the FWOD procedure, is done by means of the Analytical Hierarchy Process CARP), used jointly with the LLSM-AHP for the estimation of upper and lower bounds for the weights. Then, a combined AHP-FWOD methodology allows identifying the more suitable sites for building biogas plants. We show that the FWOD relevance-ranking procedure can also be successfully applied over the outcomes of different decision makers, in case a unique social solution is required to exist.
The proposed methodology can be used under an integrated decision support frame for identifying the most suitable locations for biogas facilities, taking into account the most relevant criteria for the social, economic and political dimensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Based on analysis of input-output energy and household expenditure data (IO-EA-expenditure), this paper calculates China's indirect carbon emissions from residential consumption in 2002 and 2007, by region. Then a new Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) model is proposed to investigate the regional variations of impacts of urbanization, consumption ratio and consumption structure on residential indirect CO2 emissions in China during 2002-2007. As the results suggest, expansion of urbanization and upgrade of consumption structure play important roles in the growth of residential indirect emissions. Transformation of consumption ratio, contributing the most to emissions in the eastern region, reduces indirect emissions in all regions to a certain extent. The persistent decline of carbon emission intensity still contributes significantly to the decrease in emissions and the rise of per capita consumption plays a dominant role in the growth of residential indirect emissions. Based on empirical results, this article provides policy suggestions which can help reduce China's residential indirect CO2 emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: While most research concerning thermoelectrics has focused on the enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, the $/W is a direct indication of its practical use. It is suggested that in the conventional device architecture, it is better to reduce thermoelectric material consumption rather than to increase zT for higher conversion efficiency, i.e., higher power output with given heat input for lower costs, in certain cases. As a result of this, a thermoelectric device with low $/W suffers from its low power output. Here, we present another way to lower the $/W value, while maintaining a decent power output of a thermoelectric device by changing the device architecture. In the analytical expression which we deduced, we demonstrated that the $/W value can be reduced to around 10% while maintaining similar to 65-70% of the maximum possible power output with a given zT. The device architecture we propose should be useful to recover low quality waste heat, which is abundant and could be harvested as long as the $/W value is low enough in general.

Abstract: Varying water/air volume (VWV/VAV) favors the performance improvement of central chiller systems. However, due to the lack of an intrinsic relation connecting these design parameters to the requirements, both the operating parameters of variable speed pumps/fans (VSP/VSF) and the structural parameters of heat exchangers are usually designed empirically or semi-empirically, which offers a huge potential for energy conservation. Therefore, through analyzing the heat transfer processes in each heat exchanger of a central VWV/VAV chiller system by the entransy-dissipation-based thermal resistance (EDTR) and studying the fluid flow processes by the characteristics of VSPs/VSFs and pipeline pressure drops, respectively, we yield the formulas connecting the areas of each heat exchanger and the rotating speeds of each VSP/VSF directly to the design requirements. Combining these formulas with the conditional extremum method gives several optimization equations corresponded to different optimization objectives. Simultaneously solving these equations directly gives the optimal area allocation of each heat exchanger and the operating parameters of VSPs and VSFs, which successfully avoid the limitation of the trial-and-error method. Finally, a simple central VWV/VAV chiller system is taken as an example to illustrate the applications of the newly proposed optimization method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Previously, the authors have designed and implemented an active motion control "virtual crankshaft" for a free piston engine, which enables precise piston tracking of desired trajectories. With this mechanism, the volume of the combustion chamber can be regulated, and therefore the pressure, temperature and species concentrations of in-cylinder gas can be adjusted in real-time which affect the combustion process directly. This new degree of freedom enables us to conduct piston trajectory-based combustion control. In this paper, a model of the free piston engine running homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion under various piston trajectories is presented. The various piston trajectories have the ability to change the compression ratio and accommodate different piston motion patterns between the top dead center and the bottom dead center. Six reaction mechanisms are employed in the model in order to demonstrate the multi-fuel combustion ability of the free piston engine, and to describe the chemical kinetics of different fuels under various piston trajectories. Analysis of the simulation results is then presented which reveals the piston trajectory effects on the combustion in terms of in-cylinder gas temperature trace, indicated output work, heat loss and radical species accumulation process.

Abstract: The importance of household behavior in energy consumption is regularly raised in literature. Nevertheless energy-economy long-term planning models still often represent energy demand by a single mean household and thus fail to capture household behavior. This paper describes the original modeling approach developed within the TIMES model framework in order to take household behavior and heterogeneity into account: the TIMES-Households model. This model depicts both household daily energy consumption and equipment purchasing behavior and focuses on the French residential and transport sectors. We show the importance of taking household heterogeneity into account in long-term planning models within the comparison of two energy price scenarios applied to two different models. Finally, thanks to the highly disaggregated representation of households and their behavior in the model, we address the problem of unrealistic technology diffusion pathways often obtained when using an optimization bottom-up model.

Abstract: The production of hydrogen is a highly researched topic for many reasons. First of all, it is a clean fuel that can be used instead of hydrocarbons, which produce CO2, a greenhouse gas emission that is thought to be the reason for climate change in the world. The largest source of hydrogen is the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, where CO and water are mixed over a catalyst to produce the desired hydrogen. Many researchers have focused on development of WGS catalysts with different metals. The most notable of these metals are precious and rare earth metals which, when combined, have unique properties for the WGS reaction. Research in this area is very important to the energy industry and the future of energy around the world. However, the progress made recently has not been reviewed, and this review was designed to fill the gap. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper deals with an optimization of the Stirling engine regenerator's. Firstly, different materials are experimented (Stainless Steel, Copper, aluminum and Monel 400). The engine performances and the state of each material after 15 h of use are considered. The Stainless steel was the material that best satisfies these two conditions. Five regenerators in stainless steel with different porosities were manufactured and experimented (95%, 90%, 85%, 80% and 75%). Porosity that gives the best trade-off between maximizing the engine brake power, maximizing the heat transfer and minimizing the pressure drops, was retained. Thus, the regenerator in stainless steel with porosity of 85% was considered as the most suitable matrix maximizing the Stirling engine performances and minimizing heat and friction losses.

Abstract: Solid sensible heat storage is an attractive option for high-temperature storage applications in terms of investment and maintenance costs. Typical solid thermal energy storage systems use a heat transfer fluid to exchange heat as the fluid flows through a tubular heat exchanger embedded in the solid storage material. The modified lumped capacitance method is used with an effective heat transfer coefficient in a simplified analysis of the heat transfer in solid thermal energy storage systems for a solid cylindrical heat storage unit. The analytical solution was found using the Laplace transform method. The solution was then used to develop an optimization method for designing solid storage modules which uses the system requirements (released energy and fluid outlet temperature) as the constraint conditions and the storage module cost as the objective function for the optimization. Optimized results are then given for many kinds of system configurations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Lithium ion (Li-ion) battery, consisting of multiple electrochemical cells, is a complex system whose high electrochemical and thermal stability is often critical to the well-being and functional capabilities of electric devices. Considering any change in the specifications may significantly affect the overall performance and life of a battery, an investigation on the impacts of electrode thickness on the electrochemical and thermal properties of lithium-ion battery cells based on experiments and a coupling model composed of a 1D electrochemical model and a 3D thermal model is conducted in this work. In-depth analyses on the basis of the experimental and simulated results are carried out for one cell of different depths of discharge as well as for a set of cells with different electrode thicknesses. Pertinent results have demonstrated that the electrode thickness can significantly influence the battery from many key aspects such as energy density, temperature response, capacity fading rate, overall heat generation, distribution and proportion of heat sources.

Abstract: Fermentative hydrogen production from biomass wastes is a promising technology combining waste treatment and clean fuel production. Biomass wastes have various types and components, while the fundamental fermentation reactions involve monosaccharides and amino acids. In this study, typical monosaccharides (glucose and xylose) and amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, glycine, arginine and alanine) were mixed and fermented by anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB) obtained from heat pre-treated anaerobic digestion sludge, to directly examine the substrate consumption and hydrogen production during the co-fermentation of monosaccharides and amino acids. Hydrogen was mainly produced from the fermentation of monosaccharides, but not from the fermentation of amino acids. Monosaccharide consumption generally preceded amino acid consumption. Glucose was more readily utilised by AFB than xylose. The maximum volumetric hydrogen productivity and production rate from the co-fermentation of glucose and mixed amino acids was 2.7 times and 3.1 times higher than those from the co-fermentation of xylose and mixed amino acids. Glutamic acid, serine and alanine were more readily utilised by AFB than aspartic acid, glycine and arginine. The co-fermentation of monosaccharides and amino acids showed efficient energy conversion and carbon conversion, with the maximum efficiencies of 83.3% and 93.3%, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Critical materials as well as rare earth elements and precious metals such as platinum, gold and silver are used significantly for computer hard disk drives, mobile phones, hybrid electric vehicles, batteries, renewable energy system and many other applications. It is therefore important to quantify and estimate both current stocks and flows of such materials, as well as future requirement for industries and economies. In this study, which is focused on wind energy system in the European Union (EU) 27, the current consumption and future requirement of critical and precious materials were calculated and estimated using the wind power production dataset from ecoinvent and data from National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP). It is shown that fluorspar has been the most consumed material to date, and will probably be the most required material in the future. Among other critical and valuable materials, the main materials used for current wind energy system are silver, magnesium, indium, gold and tantalum. These materials will also be required significantly by 2020 for the wind energy system in the EU 27. It is argued that these results should be connected to the future energy and material policy and management. (C) 20114 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper utilizes the dynamic programming (DP) approach to deal with the integrated optimization problem for deriving the best configuration and energy split strategies of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), including a battery and a supercapacitor (SC), for an electric city bus. Within the optimization process, a preset cost function is employed to evaluate the HESS life cycle cost based on a dynamic degradation model of the LiFePO4 battery, which is initially proposed by us. For system hybridization, the battery size is optimized according to the requested minimal mileage, while the optimal configuration of the SC pack (i.e., the numbers of the SC modules in series and parallel) is determined using the DP approach. It is shown that the life cycle cost of the HESS initially decreases rapidly with the addition of SCs, though the rate of this reduction decreases as the amount of SC increases. The HESS candidates occurring in the transition area can therefore be regarded as the best solutions. For the energy split strategy, several control rules can be extracted from the DP results, and a near-optimal rule-based strategy is proposed in this paper. When compared to the battery-only configuration, the HESS controlled by the rule-based strategy can reduce 47% and 60% of the ESS life cycle cost along the typical China Bus Driving Cycle and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, respectively. This paper also proves that a well-tuned rule-based strategy, which can be easily implemented in a vehicle, presents rather good performance when compared to the DP approach. In addition, the proposed strategy performance can be further improved by increasing the SC usage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Among the key barriers to profit in Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) are uncertainties about attaining the realized energy cost savings and potential disputes over the guaranteed cost savings. In this paper, a methodology has been proposed to assist the Energy Service Company (ESCO): (1) to evaluate the risk threshold if the guarantee has already been made, and (2) to determine the guarantee design, if the guarantee has not been made yet, that not only promises the ESCO's profitability from EPC but also maintains its competitiveness to win the bid. Uncertainties within the energy cost savings are modeled stochastically using Monte-Carlo simulation, taking both the energy price fluctuation and the facility performance variability into account. Based on that, a strategic energy savings guarantee design curve is derived, that all the points on it would return as appropriate guarantees. Finally, a campus case is presented to demonstrate the applicability for finding the appropriate guaranteed savings value. This method is also worth popularizing in similar performance-based projects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A rapid increase in household solar PV uptake has caused concerns regarding intermittent exports of electricity to the grid and related balancing problems. A microgeneration system combining solar PV, combined heat and power plant (CHP) and battery storage could potentially mitigate these problems whilst improving household energy self-sufficiency. This research examines if this could also lead to lower environmental impacts compared to conventional supply of electricity and heat. Life cycle assessment has been carried out for these purposes simulating daily and seasonal energy demand of different household types. The results suggest that the impacts are reduced by 35-100% compared to electricity from the grid and heat from gas boilers. The exception is depletion of elements which is 42 times higher owing to the antimony used for battery manufacture. There is a large variation in impacts with household energy demand, with higher consumption resulting in a far greater reduction in impacts compared to the conventional supply. CHP inefficiency caused by user maloperation can decrease the environmental benefits of the system significantly; for example, the global warming potential increases by 17%. This highlights the need for consumer information and training to ensure maximum environmental benefits of microgeneration. Appropriate battery sizing is essential with the 10-20 kWh batteries providing greatest environmental benefits. However, any reduction in impacts from battery storage is heavily dependent on the assumptions for system credits for electricity export to the grid. Effective management of the battery operation is also required to maximise the battery lifetime: a reduction from 10 to five years increases depletion of elements by 45% and acidification by 32%. Increasing the recycling of metals from 0% to 100% reduces the impacts from 46% to 179%. If 90% of antimony is recycled, the depletion of elements is reduced by three times compared to the use of virgin antimony. However, this impact is still 12 times higher than for the conventional system owing to the use of other metals in the system. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The challenge of developing clean and renewable energy sources is becoming ever more urgent. Over the last decade, the concept of carbon footprint has been used to report direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and as a support for sustainable consumption decisions. However, the discrepancies in the approaches based on either the product or corporate carbon footprint can seriously hinder its successful implementation. The so-called compound method based on financial accounts is a tiered hybrid method which enables the calculation of both the product and corporate carbon footprint. This work aims to assess this method as a tool for carbon footprint through its implementation in a comprehensive life-cycle assessment of the Osorio Wind Farms in Brazil. The total cumulative life-cycle emissions are 362.455 t CO(2)eq, representing 18.33 gr CO(2)eq per kW h delivered to the Brazilian national power grid. The difference with regard to previous works derives from its broader scope and different assumptions. In this study the comparable value from wind turbine manufacture, transport and construction is 8.42 gr CO(2)eq per kW h, 56% lower than the mean figure reported by Arvesen and Hertwich (2012). This study includes sources, phases and areas previously unreported in the carbon footprint reviews for the wind power sector. We conclude that the compound method based on financial accounts is a practical method that allows the definition of a more comprehensive goal and scope. Its implementation at Osorio Wind Farms demonstrates the method's suitability for application-in major international projects and institutions interested in closely monitoring their carbon footprint.

Abstract: Low gas wellhead prices in North America have put its shale gas industry under high competitive pressure. Rapid technology innovation can help companies to improve the economic performance of shale gas fields. Cash flow models are paramount for setting effective production and technology innovation targets to achieve positive returns on investment in all-global shale gas plays. Future cash flow of a well (or cluster of wells) may either improve further or deteriorate, depending on: (1) the regional volatility in gas prices at the wellhead - which must pay for the gas resource extraction, and (2) the cost and effectiveness of the well technology used. Gas price is an externality and cannot be controlled by individual companies, but well technology cost can be reduced while improving production output. We assume two plausible scenarios for well technology innovation and model the return on investment while checking against sensitivity to gas price volatility. It appears well technology innovation - if paced fast enough - can fully redeem the negative impact of gas price decline on shale well profits, and the required rates are quantified in our sensitivity analysis.

Abstract: Electrical circuit analogy is an effective method for the performance analysis of various heat transfer processes, whereas there is no equivalent thermal circuit for heat exchanger networks (HENs). In view of this limitation, and based on the concept of entransy-dissipation-based thermal resistance (EDTR), we introduce an equivalent thermal circuit to represent the heat transfer process in a heat exchanger, and then analyze the temperature variations of all the working fluids in each heat exchanger to establish the equivalent thermal circuits for such three basic layouts of HENs as multiple-loop, series, and parallel. The combination of these equivalent thermal circuits gives the overall equivalent thermal circuit for any HEN consisting of the three basic layouts. Accordingly, the inherent relationships, i.e., the constraint equations, of all the parameters in a HEN are built by circuitous philosophy. Based on these constraint equations together with the Lagrange multiplier method, we propose a mathematical method for the optimization of heat transfer performance in HENs. Finally, as an example, the heat transfer processes in a district heating system is analyzed and optimized by the newly proposed equivalent thermal circuit and the corresponding optimization method to show the applications.

Abstract: Brown algae, considered as the third generation biomass, offer several advantages over lignocellulosic biomass. However, the current high cost of seaweed cultivation hampers the industrialization of macroalgae-based biofuel production. The aim of this study is to determine the maximum dry seaweed price (MDSP) as an upper limit for purchasing price of brown algae at bioethanol plant gates. In addition, a minimum ethanol-selling price (MESP) was calculated by considering the state-of-the-art bioethanol production technology and current brown algae-cultivation costs. A new simple pretreatment process was economically validated and compared with the traditional acid thermal hydrolysis known as combined pretreatment. The processes were simulated at the scales of 80,000 and 400,000 ton/year of dry brown algae using the Aspen Plus v.8.4 software, and techno-economic models were developed based on mass and energy balance. MDSP for the simple and combined processes was calculated as 64.6 and 26 $/ton (80,000 ton/year) and 91.3 and 71.5 $/ton (400,000 ton/year), respectively. In addition, MESP for the simple and combined processes was determined as 2.39 and 2.85 $/gal (80,000 ton/year) and 2.08 and 2.33 $/gal (400,000 ton/year), respectively. These results indicate that the simple pretreatment is economically superior to the combined pretreatment. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis showed that seaweed price had the highest impact on MESP, thereby confirming that the cost-effective large-scale seaweed cultivation is the key to the success of macroalgae-based biofuel production.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of exhaust emissions and the fuel economy of a compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle fueled with biogas and natural gases. A large CNG vehicle currently used as a city bus in Korea was tested on a chassis dynamometer under the European Transient Cycle (ETC) and the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) 06 cycles. One CH4-enriched biogas (97.6% CH4) and 5 natural gases with different CH4 contents (81.6-94.0% CH4) were used as test fuels. Total hydrocarbons (THC), CO, NOx and CO2 emissions in the NIER 06 cycle were higher than those in the ETC cycle for all tested fuels, while the fuel economy in the NIER 06 cycle was 43.7-51.5% lower than that in the ETC cycle. Total VOC emissions increased with increasing CH4 content in the fuel, with toluene being the highest proportion of the BTEX emissions in both the ETC cycle (72-80%) and the NIER 06 cycle (73-78%). Emissions of elemental/organic carbon exhibited a similar trend to that of nanoparticle emissions. Total organic carbon was mainly comprised of organic compounds at 97-99% (ETC cycle) and 95-99% (NIER 06 cycle). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in the NIER 06 cycle were 133.3-577.8% higher than in the ETC cycle because of incomplete combustion and an increase in unburned fuel in the NIER 06 cycle, which is a low-speed driving mode. Nanoparticle number concentrations were lowest for M91 among the 6 tested fuels; the total number of particles in the NIER 06 cycle was 33.2-123.8% higher than in the ETC cycle.

Abstract: Combined parallel and serial two shell-pass shell-and-tube heat exchangers (CPTSP-STHXs & CSTSP-STHXs) whose outer shell pass are set up continuous helical baffles have been proposed to enhance the heat transfer performance. The CPTSP-STHX and CSTSP-STHX are compared with the segmental baffled shell-and-tube heat exchanger (SG-STHX) by computer simulation. The results of simulation present that, total heat transfer rate Q of the CPTSP-STHX and CSTSP-STHX-1 raise nearly 5.1% and 9.5% respectively, and the heat transfer coefficient h of the CPTSP-STHX and CSTSP-STHX-1 enhance nearly 7.6% and 14.8% than that of SG-STHX, while all of them have the same mass flow rate M, the same heat transfer area A, and the same pressure drop Delta p. Also under the same mass flow rate M and the same heat transfer area A, the Q and the Delta p of the CSTSP-STHX-2 increase nearly by 46.3% and 130.9% than those of the SG-STHX, respectively. As to the comprehensive performance, under the same heat transfer area A and overall pressure drop Delta p, the heat transfer coefficient h of the CPTSP-STHX, CSTSP-STHX-1 and CSTSP-STHX-2 raise nearly 7.6%, 14.8% and 31.2% respectively compared with the SG-STHX. Thereby the CPTSP-STHX and CSTSP-STHX have better comprehensive performance than that of SG-STHX, and furthermore the CSTSP-STHX is the best one among three. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Experimental identification of the dynamic models of heat transfer in walls is needed for optimal control and characterization of building energy performance. These models use the heat equation in time domain which can be put in matrix form and then, through state-space representation, transformed in a transfer function which is of infinite order. However, the model acts as a low-pass filter and needs to respond only to the frequency spectrum present in the measured inputs. Then, the order of the transfer function can be determined by using the frequency spectrum of the measured inputs and the accuracy of the sensors. The main idea is that from two models of different orders, the one with a lower order can be used in building parameter identification, when the difference between the outputs is negligible or lower than the output measurement error. A homogeneous light wall is used as an example for a detailed study and examples of homogeneous building elements with very high and very low time constants are given. The first order model is compared with a very high order model (hundreds of states) which can be considered almost continuous in space. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The production of regular clean fuels is faced with a problem of declining profit under more strict and costly environmental regulations. To satisfy the desire for higher profit and the firm requirements of environmental protection, it is imperative to improve the efficiency of energy systems within refineries. Over the past decade numerous attempts were made to enhance the energy system, addressing the steam power system and hydrogen system in particular. However, the fuel gas system, which serves as the dominant energy source of refineries, has drawn little attention in the research community. Industrial practices indicate that the energy efficiency of the fuel gas systems can be improved remarkably by optimizing the operation schedules. This paper presents a multi-period optimizing model for the scheduling of fuel gas system within refineries. Modeling of the pipeline system is considered important, which was usually ignored in the former studies. Flow reversal and flow transition in the pipe segments are taken into consideration. Pipelines with branching structure and loop structure can be easily modeled and solved with rational computation effort. Complementarity formulations are utilized in modeling of discrete decisions instead of the commonly used binary variables. Application of this method is illustrated with a case study.

Abstract: Despite the low-carbon environmental policies, coal is expected to remain a main source of energy in the coming decades. Therefore, efficient and environmentally friendly power systems are required. A design process based on the deterministic models and application of the safety factors leads to the equipment oversizing, hence fall in the efficiency and increase in the capital and operating costs. In this work, applicability of a non-intrusive stochastic methodology to determine the probability of the power plant equipment failure was investigated. This alternative approach to the power plant performance assessment employs approximation methods for the deterministic prediction of the key performance indicators, which are used to estimate reliability indices based on the uncertainty of the input to a process model of the coal-fired power plant. This study revealed that high reliability indices obtained in the analysis would lead to reduced application of conservative safety factors on the plant equipment, which should result in lower capital and operating cost, through a more reliable assessment of its performance state over its service time, and lead to the optimisation of its inspection and maintenance interventions.

Abstract: The present study focuses on a numerical investigation of thermal stratification in HCCI combustion. The simulation is conducted with a multi-zone model, which incorporates heat and mass transfer between zones and to the combustion chamber walls. The multi-zone model is used to study the effect of three different initial thermal stratifications on the combustion duration and the pressure rise rate, while considering heat transfer effects. Subsequently, the assumption of adiabatic zones and combustion chamber is applied in the model, while maintaining the initial thermal stratifications. The results obtained are compared to the ones in which heat transfer is included, thereby elucidating the consequences of the adiabatic assumption when examining thermal stratification effects on HCCI combustion. An investigation is also conducted to determine the effect of engine speed on the thermal stratification of the charge, for the closed part of the engine cycle. Since engine speed directly affects the time available for all rate processes, including heat transfer and combustion, the investigation is conducted under motoring conditions. Lastly, the effect of wall temperature on the thermal stratification of an originally homogeneous mixture is examined under firing conditions, for the closed part of the engine cycle.

Abstract: A high-energy-efficient process for empty fruit bunch drying with integration to gasification and combined cycle processes is proposed. The enhancement is due to greater exergy recovery and more effident process integration. Basically, the energy/heat involved in a single process is recovered as much as possible, leading to minimization of exergy destruction. In addition, the unrecoverable energy/heat is utilized for other processes through process integration. During drying, a fluidized bed dryer with superheated steam is used as the main evaporator. Exergy recovery is performed through exergy elevation via compression and effective heat coupling in a dryer and heat exchangers. The dried empty fruit bunches are gasified in a fluidized bed gasifier using air as the fluidizing gas. Furthermore, the produced syngas is utilized as fuel in the combined cycle module. From process analysis, the proposed integrated processes can achieve a relatively high energy efficiency. Compared to a standalone drying process employing exergy recovery, the proposed integrated drying can reduce consumed energy by about 1/3. In addition, the overall integrated processes can reach a total power generation efficiency of about 44%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The choice of an assessment criterion for heat exchangers is crucial regarding the sustainability of processes and has troubled engineers for decades. In this paper it is shown that the basis for a physically meaningful assessment of every energy transfer (including conversions from one form of energy to another) lies in the correct interpretation of entropy generation. First it is shown that the effect of components in energy transfer situations on the available work (e.g. the power outcome of a working process) results from the flows of energy and entropy and the generation of entropy in a component. Next the entropic potential loss number assessment criterion is introduced, based on the entropic potential of an energy flow. It is explained how this universal criterion allows the assessment of arbitrary situations in energy transfer, illustrated by showing the advantages over the often used thermo-hydraulic performance parameter. Two examples show how the concept can be applied in numerical assessments and optimizations of heat exchangers and other components as well as in the assessment of processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Buildings are responsible for some 40% of the total final energy consumption in the European Union and about 40% of the world's primary energy consumption. Hence, the reduction of primary energy consumption is important for the overall energy chain. The scope of the current work is to assess the energy efficiency measures in the residential and small commercial sector and to develop a methodology and a software tool for their optimal prioritization.
The criteria used for the prioritization of energy efficiency measures in this article are the primary energy consumption and the initial investment cost. The developed methodology used is generic and could be implemented in the case of a new building or retrofitting an existing building. A multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) needs to be solved and the weighted sum method is used. Moreover, the novelty of this work is that a software tool has been developed using 'Matlab (R)' which is generic, very simple and time efficient and can be used by a Decision Maker (DM). Two case studies have been developed, one for a new building and one for retrofitting an existing one, in two cities with different climate characteristics. The building was placed in Edinburgh in the UK and Athens in Greece and the analysis showed that the primary energy consumption and the initial investment cost are inversely proportional.

Abstract: Relatively cheap, poor quality, unprepared biomass materials can be difficult to burn efficiently on a large commercial scale because of their variable composition, relatively low calorific values and high moisture contents. Consequently it is often necessary to co-fire these materials with a hydrocarbon support fuel to ensure stable and efficient combustion. Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) is a promising method for burning mixtures of fuels with widely differing individual characteristics although there is a need for further information on the "optimum" conditions for efficient operation as well as on the proportions of support fuel which should be used in particular applications. This paper is therefore concerned with co-firing of coal with pressed sugar beet pulp, (a solid biomass with an average moisture content of 71%), in a lab scale (<25 kW net thermal input) fluidised bed combustor.
The project was undertaken in collaboration with British Sugar plc. who operate a large coal-fired fluidised bed, with a nominal thermal rating of 40 MW, to generate hot combustion gases for use in subsequent drying applications. The combustion characteristics of different coal and pressed pulp mixtures were investigated over a wide range of operating conditions. For stable combustion the maximum proportion of pulp by mass in the blended fuel was limited to 50%. However under these co-firing conditions a fixed bed temperature can be achieved with 20% lower fluidising air (when compared with coal alone) since evaporation of the moisture in the pressed pulp provides additional cooling of the bed. This reduction in excess air will be beneficial for the output of the full scale plant at British Sugar since at present the flow rate of the fluidising air and hence the amount of coal which can be burnt is limited by high pressure drops in the bed air distributor system. The pressed pulp has relatively low nitrogen levels and hence a further benefit of co-firing is that NOx emissions are reduced by about 25%.
Agglomeration of the bed can be a problem when co-firing biomass because of the formation of "sticky" low melting point alkali metal silicate eutectics which result in subsequent adhesion of the ash and sand particles. Consequently, longer term co-firing tests were undertaken with a 50/50 blended fuel by mass. Problems of bed agglomeration were not observed over the duration of these tests and moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies indicated that the levels of alkali metals in the ash were relatively low.

Abstract: Air-source heat pump (ASHP) often operates with substantial frost formation on the outdoor heat exchanger at low ambient temperature in winter, it insulates the finned surface and also reduces heat transfer rate, leading to performance degradation or even shutdown of ASHP systems. Although several defrosting methods have been reported, the frosting and defrosting processes reduced energy efficiency and resulted in, in some cases, heat pump breakdown. To solve this problem, a novel frost-free air-source heat pump water heater (ASHPWH) system has been developed, which coupled with an extra heat exchanger coated by a solid desiccant (EHECSD) with an energy storage device (ESD). Based on the previous studies, a further analysis and comprehensive research on the novel frost-free ASHPWH system is presented in this paper. The dynamic characteristics of the novel system are investigated experimentally in different ambient conditions. An experimental setup and experimental procedures are described in detail. Thereafter, the dehumidification efficiency and regeneration efficiency of EHECSD, suction and discharge pressures of the compressor, the temperature of PCM are evaluated during the heating and regeneration modes respectively. Results indicate that the system can keep the evaporator frost-free for 32, 34, 36 min during heating mode at the ambient temperatures of -3 degrees C, 0 degrees C and 3 degrees C and 85% RH. Compared with the reverse-cycle defrosting (RCD), COP of the frost-free ASHPWH are 17.9% and 3.4% higher at the ambient temperature of -3 degrees C and 3 degrees C respectively. With this innovative technology, it has been proved that the new system can realize continuous heating and excellent performance at a low ambient temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: As flame kernel growth plays a major role in combustion of premixed-charge in spark ignition engines for higher energy efficiency and less emission, the experimental study was carried out on a single cylinder spark ignition research engine for measurement of flame kernel growth rate (FKGR) using spark plug fibre optics probe (VisioFlame sensor). The FKGR was measured on the engine at different power output with varied spark ignition timings and different engine speeds. The experimental results indicate that the FKGR was the highest with the maximum brake torque (MBT) spark timing and it decreases with increase in the engine speed. The FKGR at engine speed of 1000 RPM was the highest of 1.81 m/s with MBT timing (20 degrees bTDC) as compared to 1.6 m/s (15 degrees bTDC), 1.67 m/s (25 degrees bTDC), and 1.61 m/s (30 degrees bTDC) with retarded and advanced timing. In addition to this, a phenomenological model was developed for calculation of FKGR. It was observed from the model that FKGR is function of equivalence ratio, engine speed, in-cylinder pressure and charge density. The experimental results and methodology emerged from this study would be useful for optimization of engine parameters using the FKGR and also further development of model for alternative fuels.

Abstract: The paper proposes a method to evaluate the potential for electric power production at any site of possible geothermal interest. Accounting for geological data of the reservoirs, the method allows the computation of the available electrical power of the investigated. site. Electrical energy production from geothermal sources is realized through different techniques, such as single flash and double flash, dry steam, and binary ORC plants. The technique chosen to be the most productive is determined by analyzing a specific range of geofluid properties, mainly temperature and pressure. Moreover, each plant typology has a global efficiency that may be correlated to geofluid enthalpy by empiric relations available in literature. The proposed evaluation method brings together all these correlations, yielding the power availability from a geosource, once its temperature and pressure are known. The method takes as input the geofluid available flow rate, its pressure, temperature and non-condensable gas content. It defines the best plant option from these parameters, calculates its global efficiency and finally returns the actual available power. For sites of geothermic interest, such as the volcanic island of Ischia in Southern Italy, the results of the application of this new method clearly highlight the most suitable zones for power plants installations.

Abstract: This paper presents a generic bulk energy storage dispatch model for production costing simulation, and assesses the performance and economics of storage under various system scenarios. The storage model presented captures the dynamic relationship between the reservoir energy status and the storage commitments in energy and ancillary co-optimization market, thereby enabling the dispatch of storage for both energy and cross-market arbitrage opportunities. The paper also presents a methodology to quantify the cycling costs incurred by conventional generating units due to frequent start-shut cycles and ancillary services. The bulk storage technology modeled is compressed air energy storage (CAES), and it is represented within the IEEE 24 bus reliability test system. Simulations are performed to quantify the impacts of bulk energy storage in terms of reduction in market prices, system production and cycling costs, and also to investigate the economic viability of storage projects in terms of payback periods under increasing wind penetration levels.

Abstract: In-wheel motors (IWMs) substantially influence the output performance of electric vehicles (EVs). Size design and control issues are two critical factors to be explored. This paper proposes the use of hybridization for integrating dual motors to enhance EV system dynamics. A combined optimal sizing/control approach was developed using the global search method (GSM). The optimal control (torque ratio) of dual motors was first proposed using the nested-structure for-loop program to minimize the consumed power according to various power ratios. The next combined sizing/control developed using the GSM facilitated the search for the optimal control, power ratios, and T-N (Torque-Speed) ratios to minimize the accumulated energy consumed during ECE40 and UDDS driving cycles. The results from simulations of these two cycles indicated that the energy consumption during optimal control improved by 1.23% and 1.40%, 8.34% and 7.16% after optimal sizing, and the combined optimization improved total consumed energy by 15.31% and 15.16%, respectively. These results suggest that employing the novel hybrid IWM powertrains while using the combined sizing/control method can facilitate energy conservation. A real testing platform will be developed in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper addresses the technical and economic issues associated with waste heat recovery in data centers through the use of absorption cooling machines. The theoretical possibility of utilizing the heat dissipated by a server, or a number of servers, to power an absorption system, which in turn produces cooling for other servers in the data center, is investigated. For this purpose, a steady-state thermodynamic model is developed to perform energy balance and exergy analyses for a novel configuration of an on-chip two-phase cooling system and an absorption refrigeration system. This combination is created by replacing the condenser in the on-chip cooling circuit with the generator of an absorption refrigeration cycle. The performance of the developed model in simulating both LiBr-water and water-ammonia absorption cooling systems is examined through verification of the model results against the reference data available in the literature. The verification indicates the superiority of LiBr-water absorption system for data center/server operating conditions. Therefore, a LiBr-water absorption refrigeration system is modeled in the novel combined heat recovery system. For these systems it is shown that the traditional definition for the coefficient of performance (COP) is not appropriate to evaluate the performance and, in its place, introduce a new figure of merit. Through a sensitivity analysis, the effects of server waste heat quality, server coolant type, solution peak concentration, solution heat exchanger effectiveness, evaporator temperature, and operating pressures on the performance of the novel system are investigated. Finally, using the thermodynamic model and cost information provided by the absorption refrigeration industry, an economic analysis is carried out to calculate the payback period when this technology is used for data center waste heat recovery.

Abstract: Structural-functional integrated materials are one of directions of rapid development for saving-energy materials. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are latent thermal storage materials possessing a large amount of heat energy stored during its phase change stage. Porous lightweight aggregate (LWA) can serve as the carrier for PCM. In this research, a structural concrete with function of indoor temperature control were prepared by using macro encapsulated PCM-LWA. The indoor and outdoor tests were performed to determine the thermal performance of the lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) containing macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA. The compressive strength and shrinkage strain of LWAC with macro encapsulated PCM-LWA were evaluated. Finally, the economic and environmental aspects of application of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in a typical floor area of public housing rental flat in Hong Kong were assessed.
From indoor thermal performance test, it was found that LWAC incorporated with macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA has a function of reducing the energy consumption by decreasing the indoor temperature; flatten the fluctuation of indoor temperature and shifting the loads away from the peak periods. Moreover, from outdoor thermal performance test, it was found that the performance of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in adjusting the room temperature was optimized when there was a remarkable temperature difference between the day and night. Test results showed that the compressive strengths of LWAC incorporating macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA at 28 days was higher than control LWAC (without macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA) and was found to be over 15 MPa. The shrinkage strain reduced with the incorporation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in LWAC and therefore has a beneficial effect on the volume stability of LWAC. From simple economic evaluation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in a typical floor area of public housing rental flat in Hong Kong, the recovery or payback period was found to be less than the average life span of a residential building in Hong Kong. Therefore, incorporation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in LWAC building walls is economically feasible. Finally, from environmental prospect, a reduction of 465 kg CO2-eq/year or 12.91 kg CO2-eg/year/m(2) was achieved. This reduction would contribute to mitigate Greenhouse Gases emissions over the life span of building. It can therefore be concluded that the developed macro encapsulated PCM LWAC can be used for thermal and structural applications in buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In order to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets the Great Britain (GB) future electricity supply will include a higher fraction of non-dispatchable generation, increasing opportunities for demand side management to maintain a supply/demand balance. This paper examines the extent of flexible domestic demand (FDD) in GB, its usefulness in system balancing and appropriate incentives to encourage consumers to participate. FDD, classified as electric space and water heating (ESWH), and cold and wet appliances, amounts to 59 TW h in 2012 (113 TW h total domestic demand) and is calculated to increase to 67 TW h in 2030. Summer and winter daily load profiles for flexible loads show significant seasonal and diurnal variations in the total flexible load and between load categories. Low levels of reflective consumer engagement with electricity consumption and a resistance to automation present barriers to effective access to FDD. A value of 1.97 pound/household/year has been calculated for cold appliance loads used for frequency response in 2030, using 2013 market rates. The introduction of smart meters in GB by 2020 will allow access to FDD for system balancing. The low commercial value of individual domestic loads increases the attractiveness of non-financial incentives to fully exploit FDD. It was shown that appliance loads have different characteristics which can contribute to an efficient power system in different ways. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The growing share of electricity generation from renewable energy creates difficulties in maintaining the balance of generation and demand. This is mainly due to uncertainties caused by prediction errors in renewable generation. In order to maintain power system security, the participation of demand side response to the balancing services such as operating reserve is critical. In this paper, the capability of smart appliances to act as operating reserves for the system operator is investigated. The smart appliances considered are washing machines, dish washers and tumble dryers equipped with communication modules. A novel framework is introduced which enables system operators to access demand response from smart appliances in a timeframe suitable for operating reserves. A mathematical model is developed to simulate appliances with multiple discrete power phases. The delay and interruption of appliances cycles are considered in the model. A multiple time-step simulation is introduced that assesses the load reduction from a number of households as a response to a reserve instruction which is modelled as a price increase with a short notification period. The results are used to estimate the available demand response from Great Britain (GB) households at any moment of the day. With a 20% penetration of smart appliances, the demand response can provide up to 54% of the operating reserve requirements of the GB power system depending on the time of day. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract: This paper presents for the first time the results of a life cycle assessment study for an intelligent energy management system. We considered material acquisition, manufacturing, transportation, assembly, operation and maintenance stages. The results show that the assembly phase had an environmental impact of 897 Eco-indicator 99 points that was mainly due to the monitoring subsystem (87.80%). When the analysis was extended to cover the use phase, the environmental impact ranged from 1963 (useful life of 5 years) to 3029 Eco-indicator 99 points (useful life of 10 years). The environmental impact of the use stage was found to represent 54-70% of the total, whereas the assembly stage represented 46-30%. The maintenance phase contributed to a very small extent to the total environmental impact (less than 0.5%). In any case, the impact on resources was the largest (about 51%), whereas the human health damage category amounted to approximately 35% and the ecosystem quality damage category represented about 14% of the total impact.

Abstract: Plugin and hybrid vehicles have been shown to offer possible reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, depending on grid-carbon-intensity, range and thus life-cycle battery emissions and vehicle weight, and on trip patterns. We present a framework that enables GHG comparisons (well-to-wheel plus storage manufacturing) for three drivetrains (pure-electric, gasoline-hybrid, and plugin-hybrid), both for individual vehicles and for fleets. The framework captures effects of grid- versus vehicle-based electricity generation, grid transmission and charging losses, and manufacturing and carrying batteries. In contrast to previous work, GHG comparisons can be obtained for heterogeneous fleets of varying vehicle sizes (cars, vans, buses, trucks) and performances, without requiring forecasting of such vehicle specs and their respective market penetrations. Further, we show how a novel adaptation of the Utility Factor concept from plug-in-hybrids to mixed fleets of battery-only and gasoline-hybrids is crucial to quantifying battery-only-vehicles' impact on fleet-wide GHG. To account for regional variations and possible future technology improvements, we show scenarios over a wide spectrum of grid-carbon-intensities (50-1200 g CO(2)e/kW h at wall), vehicle range (similar to 5-500 km), battery energy densities, and battery life-cycle GHG. Model uncertainties are quantified via sensitivity tests. Applying the framework to trip patterns of US passenger transportation, we find that owing to the interplay of GHG/km, battery size, all-electric range, and trip patterns, GHG reductions achievable from electrified transportation are smaller than previously considered (e.g., 55% reduction instead of 80%; scenario-dependent), even when assuming largely decarbonized grid-electricity. Optimal battery range that achieves lowest GHG for partially electrified fleets is different for plug-in hybrids versus pure electrics and furthermore varies strongly (similar to 35 to similar to 200 km) with the predominant carbon-intensity of the grid.

Abstract: A novel Cr-methanol fuel cell was designed to remove Cr(VI) with simultaneous electricity production. In this design, methanol was oxidized on anode, while Cr(VI) was reduced on cathode. With 2 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide as anolyte and 0.1 mol L-1 sodium sulfate as catholyte, the power density output of as high as 903 W m(-2) with external resistance of 15 Omega at 45 degrees C could be obtained. More than 91% Cr(VI) could be reduced in one single cycle of around 400 min. What is more, the presented electrochemical cell can steadily run in wide temperature ranges from -14 degrees C to 45 degrees C. Our results also demonstrated that the proposed Cr-methanol fuel cell had potential application for Cr(VI) removal with simultaneous electricity production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The influence of radiation heat transfer during the phase change process of a storage material has been numerically analyzed in this study. Emphasis has been placed on the thermal characterization of a single constituent storage module rather than an entire storage system, in order to precisely capture the energy exchange contributions of all the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms during the melting of a phase change material (PCM) with tailored optical properties. The equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum and energy have been solved by using the control volume discretization approach, while the radiative transfer equation (RTE) was solved by the discrete ordinate method (DOM). The enthalpy-porosity method was used to track the PCM liquid/solid interface during the process. A parametric analysis has been performed in order to ascertain the effects of the optical thickness and the Planck, Grashof and Stefan numbers on the melting rate, as well as the total and radiative heat transfer rates at the inner surface of the shell. The results show that the presence of thermal radiation enhances the melting process. Correlations for the melt fraction and modified Nusselt number are developed for application in the design process of packed bed heat exchangers for latent heat thermal energy storage.

Abstract: This paper studied the thermal and power performances of a ventilated photovoltaic facade under different ventilation modes, and appropriate operation strategies for different weather conditions were proposed accordingly to maximize its energy conversion efficiency. This ventilated PV double-skin facade (PV-DSF) consists of an outside layer of semi-transparent amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV laminate, an inward-openable window and a 400 mm airflow cavity. Before installation, the electrical characteristics under standard testing conditions (STC) and the temperature coefficients of the semi-transparent PV module were tested and determined in the laboratory. Field measurements were carried out to investigate the impact of different ventilation modes, namely, ventilated, buoyancy-driven ventilated and non-ventilated, on the thermal and power performances of this PV-DSF. The results show that the ventilated PV-DSF provides the lowest average solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and the non-ventilated PV-DSF provides the best thermal insulation performance. In terms of power performance, the energy output of the ventilated PV-DSF is greater than those of the buoyancy-driven ventilated and non-ventilated PV-DSFs by 1.9% and 3%, respectively, due to its much lower operating temperature. Based on the experimental results, a conclusion was drawn that the ventilation design can not only reduce the heat gain of PV-DSF but also improve the energy conversion efficiency of PV modules by bringing down their operating temperature. In addition, an optimum operation strategy is recommended for this kind of PV-DSF to maximize its overall energy efficiency under different weather conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: To solve the overheating problem caused by the solar radiation and to keep the indoor temperature and humidity at a proper level for plants or crops, cooling technologies play vital role in greenhouse industry, and among which evaporative cooling is one of the most commonly-used methods. However, the main challenge of the evaporative cooling is its suitability to local climatic and agronomic condition. In this study, the performance of evaporative cooling pads was investigated experimentally in a 2304-m(2) glass multi-span greenhouse in Shanghai in the southeast of China. Temperature and humidity distributions were measured and reported for different working modes, including the use of evaporative cooling alone and the use of evaporative cooling with shading or ventilation. These experiments were conducted in humid subtropical climates where were considered unfavourable for evaporative cooling pad systems. Quantified analyses from the energy perspective are also made based on the experimental results and the evaporative cooling fan-pad system is demonstrated to be an effective option for greenhouse cooling even in the humid climate. Suggestions and possible solutions for further improving the performance of the system are proposed. The results of this work will be useful for the optimisation of the energy management of greenhouses in humid climates and for the validation of the mathematical model in future work.

Abstract: The miniaturisation of gas turbine engines poses significant challenges to the performance in heat management due to the close proximity of the hot and cold components. This paper examines the scale and significance of heat transfer within micro gas turbines and aims to quantify the corresponding impacts on performance and efficiency. To study these effects, a reduced order lumped capacitance heat transfer network is developed. Two different micro turbine configurations are investigated and the effect of micro turbine size and material selection is explored. The investigation shows that the choice of configuration and materials influences the impact of heat transfer on the micro turbine performance and heat management is therefore key to achieving the full potential of micro turbines.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to review the application of complexity science methods in understanding energy systems and system change. The challenge of moving to sustainable energy systems which provide secure, affordable and low-carbon energy services requires the application of methods which recognise the complexity of energy systems in relation to social, technological, economic and environmental aspects. Energy systems consist of many actors, interacting through networks, leading to emergent properties and adaptive and learning processes. Insights on these type of phenomena have been investigated in other contexts by complex systems theory. However, these insights are only recently beginning to be applied to understanding energy systems and systems transitions.
The paper discusses the aspects of energy systems (in terms of technologies, ecosystems, users, institutions, business models) that lend themselves to the application of complexity science and its characteristics of emergence and coevolution. Complex-systems modelling differs from standard (e.g. economic) modelling and offers capabilities beyond those of conventional models, yet these methods are only beginning to realize anything like their full potential to address the most critical energy challenges. In particular there is significant potential for progress in understanding those challenges that reside at the interface of technology and behaviour. Some of the computational methods that are currently available are reviewed: agent-based and network modelling. The advantages and limitations of these modelling techniques are discussed.
Finally, the paper considers the emerging themes of transport, energy behaviour and physical infrastructure systems in recent research from complex-systems energy modelling. Although complexity science is not well understood by practitioners in the energy domain (and is often difficult to communicate), models can be used to aid decision-making at multiple levels e.g. national and local, and to aid understanding and allow decision making. The techniques and tools of complexity science, therefore, offer a powerful means of understanding the complex decision-making processes that are needed to realise a low-carbon energy system. We conclude with recommendations for future areas of research and application. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Non-isothermal crystallization of aqueous nanofluids in the presence of two types of high aspect-ratio carbon nano-additives, i.e., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), was characterized by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A parametric investigation was performed on various concentrations of the nanofluids as well as various cooling rates during the DSC tests. In addition to the supercooling degree and latent heat of crystallization, the crystallization kinetics was also analyzed by both the Ozawa method and a modified Ozawa-based method. It was shown that dilute loading of CNTs or GNPs leads to reduction of the supercooling degree up to 5 degrees C due to the nucleating effect. The planarly-shaped GNPs featuring large contact area perform better than CNTs in facilitating heterogeneous nucleation, which greatly suppress crystal growth during the late phase of non-isothermal crystallization. In contrast to the case of GNPs, CNTs may be able to accelerate crystallization up to nearly 37% at relatively dilute loadings, especially when the cooling rate is low. The CNT-based aqueous nanofluids exhibit more balanced performance in supercooling degree, latent heat of crystallization, and crystallization kinetics, which may be utilized as an emerging candidate of phase change materials for cold thermal energy storage.

Abstract: With the recent development of the IT technology, the demand for data centers has significantly increased, and modular data centers have attracted considerable attention because of their excellent stability, scalability, and economic feasibility. This research quantitatively analyzed the applicability of various air-side economizers and their energy-saving potential in modular data centers. A detailed cooling load estimation process was established for modular data centers, and annual cooling energy simulations were carried out using various air-side economizers. The various air-side economizers yielded cooling coil load savings of 76-99% in comparison to conventional cooling systems in data centers, and the total cooling energy savings of the economizers ranged from 47.5% to 67.2%. Indirect air-side economizers with high-effectiveness heat exchangers were found to yield significant energy saving (63.6%) and have simple system configurations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper elaborates a direct maximum power point (MPP) finding method for solar photovoltaics (PV) based on quadratic regression analysis of the geometry of the power-voltage (P-V) curve of a typical PV cell or module. This method works in two stages for determination of the MPP parameters such as voltage (V-mp), power (P-mp) and fill factor with high level of accuracy. At first, it determines the approximate MPP parameters using a few data collected from the open-circuit and short-circuit regions of a current-voltage (I-V) characteristic, and further it refines the obtained parameters using quadratic regression analysis. This method is non-iterative and requires no prior knowledge of the physical and electrical parameters of the cell. Besides high accuracy, the method is also very precise in handling the noise level (up to 20%) in the data. The method was tested on a wide range of PV cells reported in the literature including silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), copper zinc tin sulphide selenide (CZTSSe) and organic cells. The estimated MPP parameters are in excellent agreement with those of reported for the cells. The method is also employed for an experimental PV characteristic of a 10 W-p silicon module and a synthesized PV characteristic of a 120 Wp silicon module. The estimated fill factor for silicon modules exactly matches with those available in the datasheet specifications. Experimental evaluation of the method as compared to perturb-and-observe (P&O) in the passive mode exhibits quick response. Thus, the method is applicable for a wide category of PV cells to PV modules. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: When the surface temperature of the outdoor coil in an air source heat pump (ASHP) unit is lower than both freezing point of water and the air dew point, frost can be formed and accumulated over outdoor coil surface. Frosting affects the energy efficiency, and periodic defrosting therefore is necessary. Reverse cycle defrosting is currently the most widely used defrosting method. A previous related study has indicated that during reverse cycle defrosting, downwards flow of the melted frost over a multi-circuit outdoor coil could affect the defrosting performance, without however giving detailed quantitative analysis of the effects. Therefore an experimental study on the effects has been carried out and a quantitative analysis conducted using the experimental data. In this paper, the detailed description of an experimental ASHP unit which was specifically built up is firstly reported. This is followed by presenting experimental results. Result analysis and conclusions are finally given. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There is a widespread assumption in energy statistics and econometrics that energy intensity and energy efficiency are equivalent measures of energy performance of economies. The paper points to the discrepancy between the engineering concept of energy efficiency and the energy intensity as it is understood in macroeconomic statistics. This double discrepancy concerns definitions (while engineering concept of energy efficiency is based on the thermodynamic definition, energy intensity includes economic measures) and use. With regard to the latter, the authors conclude that energy intensity can only provide indirect and delayed evidence of technological and engineering energy efficiency of energy conversion processes, which entails shortcomings for management and policymaking. Therefore, we suggest to stop considering subsectoral, sectoral and other levels of energy intensities as aggregates of lower-level energy efficiency. It is suggested that the insufficiency of energy intensity indicators can be compensated with the introduction of thermodynamic indicators describing energy efficiency at the physical, technological, enterprise, sub-sector, sectoral and national levels without references to any economic or financial parameters. Structured statistical data on thermodynamic efficiency is offered as a better option for identifying break-through technologies and technological bottle-necks that constrain efficiency advancements. It is also suggested that macro-level thermodynamic indicators should be based on the thermodynamic first law efficiency and the energy quality problem may be left to enterprise-level thermoeconomic optimization.

Abstract: Forest residues can be left at the harvest site to gradually decompose, or can be collected for energy purposes. This study analyzes the primary energy and climate impacts of bioenergy systems where forest residues are collected and used for electricity, heat and transportation, compared to fossil-based energy systems where fossil fuels provide the same services while forest residues are left on site to decompose. Time profiles are elaborated of primary energy use and carbon dioxide emissions from various energy applications fulfilled by bioenergy or fossil energy systems. Different biological decay functions are considered based on process-based modeling and inventory data across various climate zones. For all scenarios, the changes in cumulative radiative forcing (CRF) are calculated over a 300-year period, to evaluate the short- and long-term contributions of forest residue to climate change mitigation. A life cycle perspective along the full energy chains is used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of each system. The results show largest primary energy and climate benefits when forest residues are collected and used efficiently for energy services. Using biomass to substitute fossil coal provides greater climate change mitigation benefits than substituting oil or fossil gas. Some bioenergy substitutions result in positive CRF, i.e. increased global warming, during an initial period. This occurs for relatively inefficient bioenergy conversion pathways to substitute less carbon intensive fossil fuels, e.g. biomotor fuel used to replace diesel. More beneficial bioenergy substitutions, such as efficiently replacing coal, result immediately in reduced CRF. Biomass decay rates and transportation distance have less influence on climate benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, a zero-dimensional model for the design of radial turbo-expanders for ORC applications is discussed, with special reference to the estimation of losses and efficiency; a comparison between different fluids (R134a, R1234yf, R236fa, R245fa, Cyclohexane, N-Pentane) is presented and discussed, referring to a typical small-size application (50 kW). In the model, different methods for the design of radial turbines are screened, with special attention to the estimation of losses, for which correlations from literature are used. Real Equations Of State (EOS) are applied to the expansion process in place of the traditionally adopted Mach relationships for ideal gas, which is a significant advancement for modeling organic fluids in ORC, often operating near to critical conditions. The results show that the total to total efficiency of the designed machines range between 0.72 and 0.80, depending on the considered fluid. Generally, higher efficiency (1.5-2.5% points) can be achieved adopting backswept-bladed rotors. The most significant losses come from the rotor secondary flows, due to the high curvature of blade profiles combined to the large pressure gradient. The best performing fluids are R236fa and R245fa, followed by R134a and R1234yf.
Finally, starting from the developed design tool, an off-design analysis of turbo-expanders is presented. Once the design data are available, the characteristic curves of the expander at variable temperature, pressure and fluid mass flowrate at the expander inlet for different values of the specific speed are built. It is thus possible to evaluate the performance of the radial expanders when working far from design point. This analysis, demonstrated for R134a, shows that the total to static efficiency has a relatively modest sensitivity to the off design of the expansion ratio, especially at corrected speed below the design value.

Abstract: The abatement of nitrogen oxides produced in combustion processes and in the chemical industry requires efficient and reliable technologies capable of fulfilling strict environmental regulations. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia in fixed-bed (monolithic) reactors has stood out among other techniques in the last decades. In this work, the use of reverse-flow reactors, operated under the forced un-steady state generated by the periodic reversal of the flow direction, is studied for improving the SCR performance. This reactor can take advantage of ammonia adsorption in the catalyst to enhance concentration profiles in the reactor, increasing reaction rate, efficiency and reducing the emission of un-reacted ammonia. The process has been studied experimentally in a bench-scale device using a commercial monolithic catalyst. The optimum operating conditions, best ammonia feed configuration (side or central) and capacity of the reactor to deal with feed concentration disturbances is analysed. The experiments have also been used for validating a mathematical model of the reactor based on mass conservation equations, and the model has been used to design a full-size reverse-flow reactor able of operating at industrial conditions.

Abstract: The transient response of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is an important issue for transportation applications. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of operating and controlling parameters on the transient response of a PEMFC for achieving more stable cell performance under load change conditions. The transient response of a PEMFC was measured and analyzed by varying air stoichiometry, air humidity, and air excess ratio (AER). The optimal air stoichiometry and AER were determined to minimize the voltage drop, undershoot, and voltage fluctuation under the load change, while maintaining high cell performance. Based on the present data, the optimal air stoichiometry was determined to be between 2.0 and 2.5, and the optimal AER was suggested to be between 1.65 and 2.0. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The low cost and wide availability of natural limestone (CaCO3) is at the basis of the industrial competitiveness of the Ca-looping (CaL) technology for postcombustion CO2 capture as already demonstrated by similar to 1 Mw(t) scale pilot projects. A major focus of studies oriented towards further improving the efficiency of the CaL technology is how to prevent the gradual loss of capture capacity of limestone derived CaO as the number of carbonation/calcination cycles is increased. Natural dolomite (MgCa(CO3)(2)) has been proposed as an alternative sorbent precursor to limestone. Yet, carbonation of MgO is not thermodynamically favorable at CaL conditions, which may hinder the capture performance of dolomite. In the work described in this paper we carried out a thermogravimetric analysis on the multicyclic capture performance of natural dolomite under realistic regeneration conditions necessarily implying high calcination temperature, high CO2 concentration and fast transitions between the carbonation and calcination stages. Our study demonstrates that the sorbent derived from dolomite has a greater capture capacity as compared to limestone. SEM analysis shows that MgO grains in the decomposed dolomite are resistant to sintering under severe calcination conditions and segregate from CaO acting as a thermally stable support which mitigates the multicyclic loss of CaO conversion. Moreover, full decomposition of dolomite is achieved at significantly lower calcination temperatures as compared to limestone, which would help improving further the industrial competitiveness of the technology.

Abstract: Thermoelectric generator (TEG) is a promising energy conversion device for vehicle exhaust waste heat recovery. Although TEG is desired to work under composite modes and operating conditions, the influence of start-up mode on the performance of TEG was rarely paid attention to. In this study, the transient behavior of TEG under different start-up modes is investigated, including constant current, constant voltage, maximum power and constant power modes, and the differences among these modes are analyzed. The heat flow during a start-up process caused by thermoelectric effects including Peltier effect, Joule heat and Thomson heat is investigated in details, as well as the time to achieve the rated power and the influence of vehicle speed and ambient temperature. It is found that for the different start-up modes, the current is the key factor determining the heat flow and generation, With the increment of current, the temperature difference across the hot and cold junctions reduces due to the enhanced Peltier effect, the joule and Thomson heat production is higher, and the time to reach the rated power becomes longer. With different start-up currents, the durations to reach the steady-state power are similar (the difference is less than 5.2%). However, the durations to reach 40% and 80% of steady-state power are significantly affected by the start-up current, and the differences in start-up durations are up to 70% to reach 40% of steady-state power, and 32% to reach 80% of steady-state power. A higher vehicle speed improves the TEG performance, and accelerates the transient response. Although the effect of decreasing the ambient temperature is similar to increasing the vehicle speed, the ambient temperature effect is less significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Free cooling is an effective way to make good use of night cold energy and helps to reduce air-conditioning energy consumption in the daytime. This research proposed integrating a new-type of shell-and-tube based phase change material (PCM) thermal storage system with conventional air-conditioner to increase cooling coefficient of performance (COP). The proposed PCM thermal storage unit uses two different kinds of media (water and air) for the heat transfer fluids (HTF). Water is used for charging loop while air is used for discharging loop. The two HTFs better fit the heat transfer needs of nighttime's free cooling harvest and daytime's condensing water use by the air-conditioning system. A numerical model for the PCM thermal storage unit has been developed, particularly with consideration of staged natural convection effects in PCM melting process. The numerical model equipped with a new PCM staged effective thermal conductivity has been validated by experimental data. Numerical study has evaluated the effects of HTF inlet temperature, mass flow rate and conductive fin height on the PCM thermal storage system's performance. Modeling results show that HTF mass flow rate and fin height need to be designed through an optimization process according to the cooling load profile and achieve best performance of the PCM thermal storage system. Effectiveness of this proposed PCM thermal storage system is generally higher than 0.5. Case study of replacing conventional cooling tower by the proposed PCM thermal storage system for a water-cooled air-conditioner shows a COP value increase of about 25.6%. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Torrefaction is a thermal pre-treatment process for upgrading raw biomass into a more energy dense fuel. Torrefied biomass is combined with a densification process to increase its bulk density similar to conventional wood-pelleting production. This paper identifies the significant environmental impacts associated with production and delivery of these two fuels, using cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment. A feedstock of Scots Pine is modelled for a localised torrefaction/wood pellet plant located in Norway, with the products from each facility delivered to a power station in the UK.
Results show that the relative benefits of torrefaction over wood-pellets are higher on per MJ delivered basis due to the higher calorific value of the fuel. The climate change and fossil depletion impacts for torrefied pellets modelled were lower than wood pellets, using an assumption that the drying requirement of the reactor was 3.0 MJ/kg water removed for both cases. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that the relative impact improvement of the torrefied pellet case compared to wood pellets is strongly dependent on the biomass drying requirement and the proportion of total process heat supplied by the re-circulated torrefaction gas. Land requirements for torrefied pellets are higher due to the mass losses in production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy consumption has always been a central issue for sustainable urban assessment and planning. Different forms of energy analysis can provide various insights for energy policy making. This paper brought together three approaches for energy consumption accounting, i.e., energy flow analysis (EFA), input-output analysis (IOA) and ecological network analysis (ENA), and compared their different perspectives and the policy implications for urban energy use. Beijing was used to exemplify the different energy analysis processes, and the 42 economic sectors of the city were aggregated into seven components. It was determined that EFA quantifies both the primary and final energy consumption of the urban components by tracking the different types of fuel used by the urban economy. IOA accounts for the embodied energy consumption (direct and indirect) used to produce goods and services in the city, whereas the control analysis of ENA quantifies the specific embodied energy that is regulated by the activities within the city's boundary. The network control analysis can also be applied to determining which economic sectors drive the energy consumption and to what extent these sectors are dependent on each other for energy. So-called "controlled energy" is a new concept that adds to the analysis of urban energy consumption, indicating the adjustable energy consumed by sectors. The integration of insights from all three accounting perspectives further our understanding of sustainable energy use in cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Large data centers today already account for nearly 1.31% of total electricity consumption with, cooling responsible for roughly 33% of that energy consumption. This energy intensive cooling problem is exacerbated by the presence of hotspots in multicore microprocessors due to excess coolant flow requirement for thermal management. Here we present a novel liquid-cooling concept, for targeted, energy efficient cooling of hotspots through passively optimized microchannel structures etched into the backside of a chip (embedded liquid cooling or ELC architecture). We adopt an experimentally validated and computationally efficient modeling approach to predict the performance of our hotspot-targeted ELC design. The design is optimized for exemplar non-uniform chip power maps using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). For industrially acceptable limits of approximately 0.4 bar (40 kPa) on pressure drop and one percent of total chip power on pumping power, the optimized designs are computationally evaluated against a base, standard ELC design with uniform channel widths and uniform flow distribution. For an average steady-state heat flux of 150 W/cm(2) in core areas (hotspots) and 20 W/cm(2) over remaining chip area (background), the optimized design reduce's the maximum chip temperature non-uniformity by 61% to 3.7 degrees C. For a higher average, steady-state hotspot heat flux of 300 W/cm(2), the maximum temperature non-uniformity is reduced by 54% to 8.7 degrees C. It is shown that the base design requires a prohibitively high level of pumping power (about 2000 fold for 150 W/cm(2) case and 600 fold for 300 W/cm(2) case) to match the thermal performance of the optimized, hotspot-targeting designs. The pumping power requirement for optimized designs is only 0.23% and 0.17% of the total chip power for 150 W/cm(2) and 300 W/cm(2) hotspot heat flux respectively. Moreover, the optimized designs distribute the coolant flow without any external flow control devices and the performance is only marginally affected by the manifold geometry used to supply the coolant to the microchannel heat transfer structure. This also attests to the robustness of the optimized embedded microchannel structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A prototype energy signal tool is demonstrated for operational whole-building and system-level energy use evaluation. The purpose of the tool is to give a summary of building energy use which allows a building operator to quickly distinguish normal and abnormal energy use. Toward that end, energy use status is displayed as a traffic light, which is a visual metaphor for energy use which is substantially different from expected (red and yellow lights) or more or less the same as expected (green light). Which light to display for a given energy end-use is determined by comparing expected energy use to actual energy use. As expected energy use is necessarily uncertain, we cannot choose the appropriate light with certainty. Instead the energy signal tool chooses the light by minimizing the expected cost of displaying the wrong light. The expected energy use is represented by a probability distribution. Energy use is modeled by a low-order lumped parameter model. Uncertainty in energy use is quantified by a Monte Carlo exploration of the influence of model parameters on energy use. Distributions over model parameters are updated over time via Bayes' theorem. The simulation study is devised to assess whole building energy signal accuracy in the presence of uncertainty and faults at the submetered level, which may lead to tradeoffs at the whole building level not detectable without submetering.

Abstract: A new inverse method is proposed for estimation of thermal inertia and heat gain in air conditioning and refrigeration systems using on-site temperature measurements. The method is applied on a walk-in freezer room of a restaurant in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada during one week of its regular operation. The thermal inertia and instantaneous heat gain are calculated and the results are validated using actual information of the materials inside the freezer room. The proposed method can be implemented in intelligent control systems designed for new and existing HVAC-R systems to improve their overall energy efficiency and reduce their environmental impacts.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using a solar regenerated liquid desiccant membrane system to remove humidity from an office space. While conventional vapor compression cycles dehumidify the air before supplying it to the indoor space, through using sub cool-reheat process, the proposed cycle absorbs the humidity directly from indoor space through the dehumidifier. The dehumidifier consists of a set of permeable vertical tubes placed in the indoor space with liquid desiccant flowing through them. Solar energy is used as the source of thermal energy required for the regeneration of the desiccant and sea water is used as heat sink to provide the cooling needs of the liquid desiccant.
A mathematical model of the membrane desiccant system was integrated with the internal space model and solar system model to predict the humidity removal capacity from the space at given dehumidification and heat sink temperatures and outdoor environmental conditions. Experiments were performed to validate the model results be comparing exit humidity and temperature of the exit air from the space.
The validated model was applied to a case study consisting of an internal office during the month of August in Beirut hot humid climate. A decrease of 10% in indoor relative humidity is observed when the system was used. The cost of the proposed system was compared to the cost of a conventional vapor compression cycle that provides the same indoor conditions. A payback period of 7 years and 8 month was estimated compared to the investment in the vapor compression cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: International agreements will restrict in the near future the use of high-GWP refrigerants in Europe. These restrictions will favour the implantation of refrigeration systems with low-GWP fluids, especially in applications with high leakage rate. To clarify possible solutions that accomplish the forthcoming F-Gas Regulation, we present simplified models of five two-stage vapour compression refrigeration systems and evaluate them with low-GWP refrigerants (HFC, HFO and naturals). We analyse the energy performance over a wide range of evaporating and environment temperatures and present the TEWI analysis under a same scenario, typical of a centralized commercial refrigeration application. We conclude that, for high-GWP refrigerants, direct emissions have greater weight in TEWI than the indirect ones, so future solutions might be based on low-GWP fluids, in some cases with risk of toxicity or flammability. We observe the indirect two-stage systems (cascades) with CO2 as low temperature fluid are promising solutions, especially for warm regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, a new Pseudo-optimal Inexact Stochastic Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Linear Programming (PIS-IT2FSLP) energy model is developed to support energy system planning and environment requirements under uncertainties for Xiamen City. The PIS-IT2FSLP model is based on an integration of interval Type 2 (T2) Fuzzy Sets (FS) boundary programming and stochastic linear programming techniques, enables it to have robust abilities to the tackle uncertainties expressed as T2 FS intervals and probabilistic distributions within a general optimization framework. This new model can sophisticatedly facilitate system analysis of energy supply and energy conversion processes, and environmental requirements as well as provide capacity expansion options with multiple periods. The PIS-IT2FSLP model was applied to a real case study of Xiamen energy systems. Based on a robust two-step solution algorithm, reasonable solutions have been obtained, which reflect tradeoffs between economic and environmental requirements, and among seasonal volatility energy demands of the right hand side constraints of Xiamen energy system. Thus, the lower and upper solutions of PIS-IT2FSLP would then help local energy authorities adjust current energy pattems, and discover an optimal energy strategy for the development of Xiamen City.

Abstract: A small-scale pilot project was built for the pavement-solar energy utilization in this paper. An automatic data acquisition system was designed to measure the effectiveness of the pavement solar energy system based on the operation data of 24 h a day in both summer and winter. Through 69 days (1656 h) of operation in summer, 2821 kW h of heat energy were stored in soil underground. In the transitional season, 4598 kW h of heat energy were taken out from soil during 104 days (2496 h) of operation in winter. The analysis showed that in summer, solar heat collection of asphalt pavement could effectively reduce 7 degrees C of its temperature. Under conditions of natural radiation, the average heat absorptivity of pavement was 37% and the average thermal storage effectiveness of the system was 17%. The electrical energy consumed by the system is only 11% of stored heat During the winter, the asphalt pavement absorbs heat from underground soil which effectively increases its temperature, cutting 32% days of surface temperature below the freezing point. This not only save the energy for ice/snow removal but also mitigate associated safety risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Performance calculations are presented for a small-scale combined solar heat and power (CSHP) system based on an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), in order to investigate the potential of this technology for the combined provision of heating and power for domestic use in the UK. The system consists of a solar collector array of total area equivalent to that available on the roof of a typical UK home, an ORC engine featuring a generalised positive-displacement expander and a water-cooled condenser, and a hot water storage cylinder. Preheated water from the condenser is sent to the domestic hot water cylinder, which can also receive an indirect heating contribution from the solar collector. Annual simulations of the system are performed. The electrical power output from concentrating parabolic-trough (PTC) and non-concentrating evacuated-tube (ETC) collectors of the same total array area are compared. A parametric analysis and a life-cycle cost analysis are also performed, and the annual performance of the system is evaluated according to the total electrical power output and cost per unit generating capacity. A best-case average electrical power output of 89 W (total of 776 kW h/year) plus a hot water provision capacity equivalent to similar to 80% of the total demand are demonstrated, for a whole system capital cost of 2700- pound 3900 pound. Tracking PTCs are found to be very similar in performance to non-tracking ETCs with an average power output of 89 W (776 kW h/year) vs. 80 W (701 kW h/year). (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract: Butanol and ethanol are promising conventional fuel alternatives particularly when utilized in advanced combustion mode like homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). This study investigates the performance and emission characteristics of HCCI engines fueled with oxygenated fuels (i.e. butanol and ethanol). The investigation is done through a combination of experimental data analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) modeling.
This study uses HCCI experimental data to characterize variations in seven engine performance metrics including indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), thermal efficiency, in-cylinder pressure, net total heat released, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and total hydrocarbon (THC) concentrations. Two types of ANNs including radial basis function (RBF) and feedforward (FF) are developed to predict the seven engine performance metrics. The experimental data at 123 HCCI operating points from two different engines are collected to validate the ANN models. The validation results indicate both RBF and FF models can predict HCCI engine performance metrics with less than 4% error for butanol and ethanol fueled engines. The results show that the FF neural network models are advantageous in terms of network simplicity with fewer required neurons but need twice as much training time compared to the RBF models.

Abstract: Externally fired heat engines were used widely since helium the industrial revolution using dirty solid fuels for example coal, due to the lack of refined fuels. However, with the availability of clean fuels, external firing mode was abandoned, except for steam power plants. Lately, with the global trend moving towards green power production, the idea of the external fired system has captured the attention again especially externally fired gas turbine (EFGT) due to its wider range of power generation and the potential of using environment friendly renewable energy sources like biomass. In this paper, a wide range of thermal power sources utilizing EFGT such as concentrated solar power (CSP), fossil, nuclear and biomass fuels are reviewed. Gas turbine as the main component of EFGT is investigated from micro scale below 1 MWe to the large scale central power generation. Moreover, the different high temperature heat exchanger (HTHE) materials and designs are reviewed. Finally, the methods of improving cycle efficiency such as the externally fired combined cycle (EFCC), humidified air turbine (HAT), EFGT with fuel cells and other cycles are reviewed thoroughly.

Abstract: This paper reports the experimental results of a single cylinder diesel engine regarding performance, combustion and emission characteristics using Mahua (Madhuca indica) biodiesel and its blends in different volumetric proportions with petro-diesel. The thermo-physical properties of various blends selected for investigation have been experimentally measured for better evaluation of the performance characteristics. Tests have been carried out on a four stroke tangentially vertical (TV) single cylinder diesel engine at 1500 rpm using an eddy current dynamometer. The static injection timing employed is 20 degrees bTDC with constant nozzle opening pressure of 250 bar. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) as well as Cold and Hot Exhaust Gas Recirculation (CEGR and HEGR) techniques are employed to study the reduction of NO,. Results are compared at full load under steady state condition with conventional engine where no reduction techniques are applied. The comparison indicates that the SCR gives substantial reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) as compared to other technique in a conventional diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel, B100. For B100 with SCR technique, the percentage reduction in NOx is around 20% as compared to conventional engine. This research has been carried out keeping in mind the energy consumption by pumps coupled to diesel engines for irrigation purpose and locomotive tractors used in developing countries. The research findings show that Mahua biodiesel gives equally good performance and lower emissions which make it a good alternative fuel to operate diesel locomotives as well as irrigation pumps without any engine modification.

Abstract: Fuel cells offer many benefits for residential micro-cogeneration because of their high electrical efficiency, low emissions, and low heat-to-power ratio. However, the current design of fuel cell micro combined heat and power (CHP) systems for dwellings can be improved by better matching of the heat generated by the plant with the dwelling's load profile and heat emitters.
This paper explores the design options in building services using fuel cell micro-CHP and aims to bring the two research fields together in order to design superior integrated systems. Therefore a review of current literature on the field is performed and current available options for heat recovery from fuel cells, including the grades of heat available from different fuel cell process units are discussed. This is discussed in relation to the heat demand in a dwelling and the required temperature of the most suitable heat emitters for building services design. The paper motivates a methodology that considers all possible interconnections of plant in the design of fuel cell micro-CHP in dwellings and provides an example of how multi-objective optimisation can be used to identify promising system designs.

Abstract: Impacts of K promoter on microstructures of a precipitated Cu-Fe based catalyst were studied by N-2-physisorption (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption/reduction (H-2-TPD/TPR). Mixed alcohols synthesis (MAS) was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. The results indicated that incorporation of K in the Cu-Fe based catalyst decreased the surface area of the particles, whereas promoted the immigration of bulky iron species to surface layers and strengthened the interaction of surface Fe-Cu. The increase of K concentration weakened the H-2 chemisorption and restrained the reduction of both the Cu and Fe species. The catalytic activity and mixed alcohols selectivity increased accompanied with a gradually increasing K concentration, and reached the highest values as the amount of K increased to 0.5 wt.%. Subsequently, the MAS activity and selectivity C2+OH presented a decreasing trend. In addition, the increase of K concentration facilitated the formation of heavy hydrocarbons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This study presents the conceptual process design for the production of branched paraffins with high carbon number, based on the upgrading of alcohols synthesized from biomass-derived syngas and the economic evaluation and comparison with the Fischer-Tropsh (FT) process and biochemical pathways. Two routes, one based on n-butanol and another on isobutanol upgrading, are described and modeled in ASPENPlus (TM). The flow sheeting results reveal high performance for both process configurations, resulting in an aviation fuel yield 0.172 kg/kg(feedstock) and a thermal efficiency of 40.5% in the case of employing a modified Methanol catalyst for the mixed alcohols synthesis (MAS). Such alternative pathways offer higher efficiencies compared to FT synthesis because specific products such as C12+ branched paraffins for jet fuel applications are achieved with higher selectivity in the conversion processes. The water balance at the whole process reveals that the annual demands for fresh water from a 190 MWth biorefinery plant are 641,000 m(3), emerging the water management as an important issue with considerable environmental impacts. Simulations of the overall process show a rather high biomass carbon to product utilization ratio (up to 30%) leading to relative low CO2 emissions. The economic evaluation reveals that the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Price in a FT plant (1.24 (sic)/l jet fuel) is lower than the corresponding price in a MAS plant (1.49 (sic)/l and 1.28 (sic)/l for cases with different catalysts). The biochemical route based on Acetone Butanol Ethanol fermentation is considered as the most economically desirable option (0.82 (sic)/l). Moreover, the option of selling organic compounds, which are produced intermediately (i.e. light and heavy olefins, C4 alcohol isomers) via the alcohols' upgrading processes was proved promising enough for the feasibility of such biorefineries plants.

Abstract: In this paper, a method for determining the optimum use of a superheater and/or recuperator in a binary geothermal power plant is developed. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is developed to intelligently explore the trade-off between specific work output and specific heat exchanger area and allow visualization of the entire Pareto-optimal set of designs for a wide range of geothermal brine temperatures and dry-bulb temperatures. Selected data is tabulated to show representative optimal designs for each combination of dry-bulb temperature and brine temperature. This work illustrates the development and use of a sophisticated analysis tool utilizing multi-objective particle swarm optimization to allow calculation of the Pareto-optimal set of designs under any combination of dry-bulb temperature and brine temperature while accounting for necessary real-world constraints.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to assess the economic advantages of an innovative solvent for CO2 capture on state-of-the-art solvents. The CESAR-1 solvent, which is an aqueous solution of 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (AMP) and piperazine (PZ), is applied both to advanced supercritical pulverised (ASC) coal and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants with post-combustion CO2 capture units. The methodology includes process model developments using commercial simulation programs, which determine the thermodynamic properties of the selected power plants and the performance of the CO2 capture units. The results show that the techno-economic benefit of CESAR-1 versus MEA is more significant for ASC than that for NGCC due to a higher concentration of CO2 in the flue gas. This follows from the fact that the switch from MEA to CESAR-1 solvents reduces the electricity cost by 4.16 (sic)/MW h in the case of the ASC plant compared to 0.67 (sic)/MW h in connection with the proposed NGCC plant. Based on the above figures, we can conclude that CESAR-1 reduces the cost of CO2 avoided compared to MEA by 6 (sic)/t CO2 and 2 (sic)/t CO2 for the selected ASC and NGCC plants respectively. In view of that, the techno-economics can be improved if the CO2 capture plant is designed to operate using the CESAR-1 absorption technology due to a reduction in the regeneration energy and the solvent recirculation rate (considering its higher CO2 net capacity). However, the variable costs of running the capture plant are higher for the CESAR-1 solvent due to the higher cost of the amines. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A sort of novel bifunctional microencapsulated phase change material (PCM) was designed by encapsulating n-eicosane into a crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) shell and, then, was successfully synthesized through in-situ polycondensation in the sol-gel process using tetrabutyl titanate as a titania precursor. The resultant microcapsule samples were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine their chemical compositions and structures. Furthermore, the crystallinity of the TiO2 shell was verified by powder X-ray diffraction patterns. It was confirmed that the fluorinions could induce the phase transition from the amorphous TiO2 to the brookite-form crystals during the sol-gel process, thus resulting in a crystalline TiO2 shell for the microencapsulated n-eicosane. The scanning and transmission electron microscopy investigations indicated that all of the resultant microcapsules presented a perfect spherical shape with a uniform particle size of 1.5-2 mu m, and they also exhibited a well-defined core-shell structure as well as a smooth and compact shell. The crystalline TiO2 shell made the resultant microcapsules a photocatalytic activity, and therefore, these microcapsules demonstrated a good photocatalytic effect for the chemical degradation and an antimicrobial function for some of the Gram-negative bacteria. Most of all, all of the microencapsulated n-eicosane samples indicated good phase-change performance and high thermal reliability for latent-heat storage and release, and moreover, they achieved a high encapsulation efficiency and a high thermal-storage capability. The bifunctional microencapsulated n-eicosane synthesized in this study will be a potential candidate for the applications of waste heat recovery and treatment, intelligent textiles or fabrics for the warmth underwear and medical protective clothing, preservation and sterilization of foods, and solar energy storage and recovery, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, simulation and optimisation of a small trigeneration plant supplied by geothermal and solar energies. Different technologies are implemented in a dynamic simulation model purposely developed for research scope: a 6 kW(e) micro Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC); a 30 kW(f) single stage H2O/LiBr absorption chiller; a geothermal well; a solar field obtained by new prototypal flat-plate evacuated solar collectors. The ORC is supplied by heat obtained by a geothermal well in which geothermal brine is about at 95 degrees C. In order to improve system performance, additional heat is provided by solar energy obtained through a 25 m(2) solar field. Diathermic oil (up to 130 degrees C) is adopted as working fluid in order to supply heat to the ORC evaporator. A suitable oil storage tank is modelled in order to mitigate the temperature fluctuations due to the variability of solar energy availability. The output power of the ORC depends on the availability of solar energy. The absorption chiller is switched-on in summer time and it is fed by geothermal energy only. This simulation model is implemented in TRNSYS environment The ORC is modelled by zero-dimensional energy and mass balances implemented in Engineering Equation Solver (EES).
A case study is developed in order to test the energy and economic performance of this innovative micro-trigeneration plant. In particular, the above mentioned model is applied to the Regina Isabella hotel in Ischia (Naples, South Italy), famous for its geothermal sources. Currently, such hotel is already equipped by a geothermal system (by several hot water wells) for thermal cares, domestic hot water production and space heating. By TRNSYS the optimisation of the system design parameters and the calculation of the thermo-economic conditions were performed. The system showed excellent energy performance indexes. In fact, the average yearly efficiency of the solar thermal collectors is close to 60%, whereas the average yearly ORC electric efficiency is about 6%, which is a good achievement considering the system driving temperature. Results also show that the system performance is more dependent on the availability of the geothermal energy than the solar one. From the economic point of view, good results are also obtained. In fact, in the worst operating conditions the Simple Pay Back Period is 7.6 years, decreasing to 2.5 years in the most convenient considered scenario (public funding and full utilisation of the produced thermal energy).

Abstract: The world energy demand is continuously increasing and natural gas is one of the strongest candidates to cover the growth. However, natural gas is unavailable in many energy intensive areas and the best way to introduce natural gas to new, scattered, areas is by transporting it as liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG can be shipped from a large LNG import terminal to consumers through a network of smaller satellite terminals with a combination of sea- and land-based transports. Building up a small-scale supply chain network is expensive and capital intensive. This paper presents a mathematical model to aid in the supply chain design decisions by minimizing the total costs associated with fuel, procurement. The use of the model is illustrated by a case study, where the optimal supply chain of LNG for covering certain parts of the energy requirements of a country is designed under different cost structures for LNG and for its land-based transportation.

Abstract: Desiccant-based air handling units (AHU) can allow significant energy saving and emissions reductions with respect to conventional air-conditioning systems. In this work, experimental tests are used to investigate a hybrid desiccant cooling system (DCS) with desiccant wheel (DW), interacting with a small scale cogenerator.
Several new contributions are introduced by this study, such as the high number of operating conditions analyzed and of performance parameters used, the definition of a new COP and a comparison of the DCS with other air-conditioning options.
The performance were analyzed varying five operating conditions: regeneration temperature, rotational speed, volume air flow rates, outdoor air temperature and humidity ratio. Several performance parameters, based on electric, thermal and primary energy, are investigated.
Thermal performance of both the overall hybrid DCS and the DW reduce when regeneration temperature or flow rate increase, while electric and primary energy based parameters rise. Optimal operation is instead found for a narrow range of rotational speed.
The hybrid DCS with microcogenerator is compared with other thermal or electrical air-conditioning technologies. The investigated DCS performs better or at least equal than the other thermally-activated systems, while the result of the comparison with the conventional electric unit depends on the outdoor air conditions.

Abstract: From aspect of energy consuming to pump heat transfer fluid, there is no sound basis on which to create an optimum design of a thermal energy storage unit. Thus, it is necessary to develop a parameter to indicate the energy efficiency of such unit. This paper firstly defines a parameter that indicates the ratio of heat storage of phase change thermal energy storage unit to energy consumed in pumping heat transfer fluid, which is called the energy efficiency ratio, then numerically investigates the characteristics of this parameter. The results show that the energy efficiency ratio can clearly indicate the energy efficiency of a phase change thermal energy storage unit. When the fluid flow of a heat transfer fluid is in a laminar state, the energy efficiency ratio is larger than in a turbulent state. The energy efficiency ratio of a shell-and-tube phase change thermal energy storage unit is more sensitive to the outer tube diameter. Under the same working conditions, within the heat transfer fluids studied, the heat storage property of the phase change thermal energy storage unit is best for water as heat transfer fluid. A combined parameter is found to indicate the effects of both the physical properties of phase change material and heat transfer fluid on the energy efficiency ratio. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Experiments were carried out to investigate the performance of a low-temperature radiant floor heating system with different heat storage materials (sand and phase change material) and heating pipes (polyethylene coils and capillary mat) in the floor structure of a test room. Detailed temperatures in both floor structural layers and the air of the room were measured for four different combinations of these thermal mass and heating pipes during charge and discharge operations. The results showed that the floor structure with capillary mat provides more uniform temperature profile in vertical direction of the test room and needs much shorter time (nearly half) to attain the same room temperature than the cases with polyethylene (PE) coils during the charging process. Also, after the heat source was closed, the floor structures using phase change material (PCM) as thermal mass release heat about 2 times longer than the cases using sand. A CFD simulation is also performed which confirms the measured data during the charging and discharging processes. The results indicate the advantages of using PCM - capillary mat combination for low - temperature floor panel typical of solar - hot - water heating system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Several 'Advanced Rechargeable Battery Technologies' (ARBT) have been evaluated in terms of various energy, environmental, economic, and technical criteria. Their suitability for different applications, such as electric vehicles (EV), consumer electronics, load levelling, and stationary power storage, have also been examined. In order to gain a sense of perspective regarding the performance of the ARBT [including Lithium-Ion batteries (LIB), Li-Ion Polymer (LIP) and Sodium Nickel Chloride (NaNiCl) {or 'ZEBRA'} batteries] they are compared to more mature Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries. LIBs currently dominate the rechargeable battery market, and are likely to continue to do so in the short term in view of their excellent all-round performance and firm grip on the consumer electronics market. However, in view of the competition from Li-Ion Polymer their long-term future is uncertain. The high charge/discharge cycle life of Li-lon batteries means that their use may grow in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, and to a lesser extent in load levelling, if safety concerns are overcome and costs fall significantly. LIP batteries exhibited attractive values of gravimetric energy density, volumetric energy density, and power density. Consequently, they are likely to dominate the consumer electronics market in the long-term, once mass production has become established, but may struggle to break into other sectors unless their charge/discharge cycle life and cost are improved significantly. ZEBRA batteries are presently one of the technologies of choice for EV development work. Nevertheless, compared to other ARBT, such batteries only represent an incremental step forward in terms of energy and environmental performance. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Pollutant exhaust emissions, particularly NOx, produced by diesel engines must be reduced to limit values defined by the environmental regulations as the emissions have many harmful influences on the environment. Recently, the application of the Miller cycle into the internal combustion engines has been proposed to abate NOx emissions. In the present study, the Miller cycle with late intake valve closing (LIVC) version is applied into a single cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection, naturally aspirated diesel engine. Three different cam shafts have been manufactured to provide 5, 10 and 15 crank angle (CA) retarding compared to original camshaft. The optimum retarding angle has been determined as 5 CA in terms of NOx reduction. The attained results have been compared with conventional diesel engine which has standard CA (0 crank angle retarding) in point of the performance and NO, HC, CO emissions. In order to provide a model validation for engine torque, brake power, brake efficiency, specific fuel consumption (SFC) and NO, the Miller cycle diesel engine is modeled by using two-zone combustion model for 5 CA retarding at full load conditions. The simulation results have been verified with experimental data with non-considerable errors. In the experimental results, NO emissions decreased by 30% with 2.5% power loss and a remarkable change is not seen in the HC, CO emissions. The results show that the method could be easily applied into the diesel engine in order to minimize NO emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The cooling systems of rapidly growing Data Centers (DCs) consume a considerable amount of energy, which is one of the main concems in designing and operating DCs. The main source of thermal inefficiency in a typical air-cooled DC is hot air recirculation from outlets of servers into their inlets, causing hot spots and leading to performance reduction of the cooling system. In this study, a thermally aware workload spreading method is proposed for reducing the hot spots while the total allocated server workload is increased. The core of this methodology lies in developing an appropriate thermal DC model for the optimization process. Given the fact that utilizing a high-fidelity thermal model of a DC is highly time consuming in the optimization process, a three dimensional reduced order model of a real DC is developed in this study. This model, whose boundary conditions are determined based on measurement data of an operational DC, is developed based on the potential flow theory updated with the Rankine vortex to account for buoyancy and air recirculation effects inside the DC. Before evaluating the proposed method, this model is verified with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model simulated with the same boundary conditions. The efficient load spreading method is achieved by applying a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm whose objectives are to minimize the hot spot occurrences and to maximize the total workload allocated to servers. In this case study, by applying the proposed method, the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the cooling system is increased by 17%, and the total allocated workload is increased by 10%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for energy efficiency enhancement of DCs. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In Serbia, radiant heating is increasingly used. Also, in Serbia, the largest portion of produced electricity is from the fossil fuels which results in a high value of primary energy consumption coefficient (R). This situation raises the question of the justification of the use of ground sources heat pump (GHSP) over natural gas boiler and GSHP with PV array. Also, the impact of the embodied energy and embodied carbon was included in this paper. The operation of this house is simulated by software EnergyPlus. The results indicated that the newly-developed floor-ceiling radiant heating system has the best performances and classical ceiling heating has the worst performances. However in future with decrease of R, it is shown that the panel heating powered by GSHP may have lower total energy consumption than that of such a system powered by natural gas. For the wall panel heating, this would happen for the highest value of R, while in the case of the ceiling heating, it would appear for the lowest value of R. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Torrefaction is an emerging technology which enables greater co-firing rates of biomass with coal. To date however there has been a lack of real production data from pilot-scale torrefaction plants. Without such data any environmental benefits of torrefied pellet production are difficult to quantify.
In this study data on consumable inputs from a semi-industrial torrefaction plant and the physical properties of produced pellets are used to analyse energy input and air emissions of torrefied pellet production and product transport. EU sustainability criteria are used to compare CO2-equivalent emissions from torrefied and conventional pellet production starting from harvesting of logging residues to end use of co-firing the pellets with coal. A production scenario is examined in which raw material supply and production takes place in Finland with co-firing in Spain. The influence of transport distance (by lorry, rail and ship) on environmental impact is analysed for European and representative North American production sites.
Results indicate about 4.5 GJ of energy is consumed for each tonne of torrefied pellets compared to 3.3 GJ for conventional pellets; representing 23% and 21% of the energy content of the pellets respectively. If electricity from renewable sources can be used, the fossil fuel fraction of input energy can be reduced to 37% and 41% respectively. Production and use of both pellet types in co-firing have similar environmental impact generating CO2-equivalent emissions from electricity in the range 43-45 g MJ(-1). An emission savings of 77% can be realised by co-firing torrefied pellets with fossil coal. Pellet production amounts correspond to 4.3 and 4.2 MJ generated electricity for each kilogram of feedstock (dry mass) and co-firing ratios (energy basis) in the range of 1.4-1.8%.
If only one mode of product transport is used torrefied pellet production and co-firing is found to generate fewer emissions than its conventional counterpart when transport distance is niore than 400 km (lorry), 1850 km (rail) and 25,500 km (ship). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper takes an integrated analysis approach to explore the options available for a UK homeowner to reduce their domestic emissions to the level advised by the UK governments Committee on Climate Change of 20% of those associated with a typical house in 1990. It uses proven thermal models of a typical house and low carbon heating systems to estimate the emissions associated with domestic heating and electricity consumption from a number,of combinations of low carbon micro generation technologies. The amount of additional low carbon electricity needed to offset these emissions to the desired level was then calculated. The capacity of photo voltaic panels needed to generate it was then estimated. This has been done over a range of different grid carbon intensities and the resulting configurations have been subjected to energy analysis and financial appraisal. An environmental life cycle assessment was also undertaken to see if there were any unacceptable environmental consequences of an owner adopting any of the options. The research shows that in all cases operational GHG target can be met, but that emissions associated with the production of the systems is variable, meaning that with current technology a 25% house is more likely. It has also been shown that given current subsidies the installation of some of the proposed systems should be financially attractive to the home owner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A partial oxidation methanol micro reformer (POM-mu Reformer) with finger-shaped channels for low operating temperature and high conversing efficiency is proposed in this study. The micro reformer employs POM reaction for low temperature operation (less than 200 degrees C), exothermic reaction, and quick start-up, as well as air feeding capability; and the finger type reaction chambers for increasing catalyst loading as well as reaction area for performance enhancement. In this study, centrifugal technique was introduced to assist on the catalyst loading with high amount and uniform distribution. The solid content (S), binder's ratio (B), and channel design (the ratio between channel's length and width, R) were investigated in detail to optimize the design parameters. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gas chromatography (GC), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) were employed to analyze the performance of the POM-mu Reformer. The result depicted that the catalyst content and reactive area could be much improved at the optimized condition, and the conversion rate and hydrogen selectivity approached 97.9% and 97.4%, respectively, at a very low operating temperature of 180 C with scarce or no binder in catalyst The POM-mu Reformer can supply hydrogen to fuel cells by generating 2.23 J/min for 80% H-2 utilization and 60% fuel cell efficiency at 2 ml/min of supplied reactant gas, including methanol, oxygen and argon at a mixing ratio of 12.2%, 6.1% and 81.7%, respectively.

Abstract: Nowadays dynamic building simulation is an essential tool for the design of heating systems for residential buildings. The simulation of buildings heated by biomass systems, first of all needs detailed boiler models, capable of simulating the boiler both as a stand-alone appliance and as a system component. This paper presents the calibration and validation of a boiler model by means of laboratory tests. The chosen model, i.e. TRNSYS "Type 869", has been validated for two commercially available pellet boilers of 6 and 12 kW nominal capacities. Two test methods have been applied: the first is a steady state test at nominal load and the second is a load cycle test including stationary operation at different loads as well as transient operation. The load cycle test is representative of the boiler operation in the field and characterises the boiler's stationary and dynamic behaviour. The model had been calibrated based on laboratory data registered during stationary operation at different loads and afterwards it was validated by simulating both the stationary and the dynamic tests. Selected parameters for the validation were the heat transfer rates to water and the water temperature profiles inside the boiler and at the boiler outlet. Modelling results showed better agreement with experimental data during stationary operation rather than during dynamic operation. Heat transfer rates to water were predicted with a maximum deviation of 10% during the stationary operation, and a maximum deviation of 30% during the dynamic load cycle. However, for both operational regimes the fuel consumption was predicted within a 10% deviation from the experimental values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A two dimensional, across the channel, isothermal, two-phase flow model for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is developed to investigate the interaction of dry Nafion (R) ionomer volume fraction (L-M(dry)) and cathode relative humidity (RHc) in PEMFCs. The agglomerate model is used to describe the catalyst layers properties, in which the agglomerate is covered by ionomer and liquid water films. The optimum ionomer water content is suggested by maximising the oxygen diffusion rate through the ionomer film. The effects of L-M(dry) and RHc on membrane and ionomer swelling and the cell performance are studied. The predicted current densities at fixed cell voltages are analysed by the Kriging surrogate model and used to optimise the L-M(dry) and RHc based on analysing their interaction. The simulation results show that the optimum ionomer water content increases as the ionomer content increases. At higher current densities, e.g. 1.0 A cm(-2), the best cell performance is achieved with L-M(dry) of 10%, corresponding to 0.3 mg cm(-2), with fully humidified inlet gases. The optimum RHc is between 60% and 80% for L-M(dry) of 40%. The modelling results also show that at higher current densities, the optimum RHc initially decreases then increases as L-M(dry) increases. The optimum RHc decreases from 76% to 73% as L-M(dry) increases from 10% to 30% then it increases up to 85% as L-M(dry) increases to 50%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The effects of basic engine operating parameters on particle emissions from a hybrid city bus were examined under urban driving conditions involving both constant speed and frequent acceleration. To perform the examinations, real-time data for the parameters and solid Particle Number (PN) emissions were synchronously collected. The driving conditions were specifically chosen because, depending on the driving conditions, PN emissions from a city bus may change by an order of magnitude. A PN measurement system highly sensitive to engine transients and background emissions was specifically chosen, because the particle emission levels typically found in modern diesel engines are relatively low.
The measurements indicated that while operating over a flat route, the PN emissions of the bus were maximized at full-load accelerations and minimized at a constant speed of 70 km/h, which is the maximum speed. Because the combustion process in a diesel engine is relatively stable under constant speed driving conditions, the particle formation was Minimized. During acceleration, however, the particle formation is accelerated due to well-known turbo-lag phenomena that limit the intake air flow rate. For these reasons, there is no simple linear correlation between the PN concentration and the engine operating parameters for driving conditions that involve both acceleration and constant speed driving. However, it was observed that there is a strong correlation between the cumulative PN emissions and cumulative brake engine energy (BEE). The R-2 values of the linear regression lines were almost 1.0 when the acceleration and constant speed operating conditions of the bus were separately evaluated.
Because a city bus operates under real-world conditions involving both accelerating and constant speed driving conditions, a real world PN emission factor was suggested as a function of the maximum, minimum PN emissions (#/kW h) of the bus and a traffic intensity factor.

Abstract: This study experimentally investigates the effects of the combustion phasing on the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion, and implements a closed-loop control of HCCI combustion to reduce pressure-rise rate (PRR) with combustion-phasing retard. The experiments were conducted using dimethyl ether (DME) in a single-cylinder HCCI research engine equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) loop for external EGR and a two-stage exhaust cam for rebreathed EGR The results show that a maximum PRR (PRRmax) and a maximum in-cylinder charge temperature decreases with combustion-phasing retard. However, excessive combustion-phasing retard leads to unacceptable coefficient of variation (COV) of CA50 and IMEP with partial-bum and/or misfire cycles. To dampen increasing cycle-to-cycle variations around the limit of combustion-phasing retard, the closed-loop control of HCCI combustion was implemented using three feedback variables. Finally, stable stoichiometric HCCI operation could be achieved with extensive combustion-phasing retard while maintaining acceptable PRRmax. with the higher level of IMEP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A tubular cavity-receiver that uses air as the heat transfer fluid is evaluated numerically using a validated heat transfer model. The receiver is designed for use on a large-span (9 m net concentrator aperture width) solar parabolic trough concentrator. Through the combination of a parabolic primary concentrator with a nonimaging secondary concentrator, the collector reaches a solar concentration ratio of 97.5. Four different receiver configurations are considered, with smooth or V-corrugated absorber tube and single- or double-glazed aperture window. The collector's performance is characterized by its optical efficiency and heat loss. The optical efficiency is determined with the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. Radiative heat exchange inside the receiver is calculated with the net radiation method. The 2D steady-state energy equation, which couples conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer, is solved for the solid domains of the receiver cross-section, using finite-volume techniques. Simulations for Sevilla/Spain at the summer solstice at solar noon (direct normal solar irradiance: 847 W m(-2), solar incidence angle: 13.9 degrees) yield collector efficiencies between 60% and 65% at a heat transfer fluid temperature of 125 degrees C and between 37% and 42% at 500 degrees C, depending on the receiver configuration. The optical losses amount to more than 30% of the incident solar radiation and constitute the largest source of energy loss. For a 200 m long collector module operated between 300 and 500 degrees C, the isentropic pumping power required to pump the HTF through the receiver is between 11 and 17 kW. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A critical issue in operating passive direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) with neat methanol is finding a way to passively transport water generated at the cathode to the anode through membranes. This is so that the water required for anodic methanol oxidation can be compensated. The corresponding water flux depends on the capillary pressure created by the cathode micro-porous layer (MPL). Conventional MPLs made of carbon powder suffer from the problem of mud-cracks, significantly reducing the capillary pressure. In this work, we propose a cathode MPL prepared with fluorinated carbon nanotubes. It is demonstrated that the fluorinated nanotube MPL has no mud-cracks and its contact angle is as high as 153 degrees. The application of the crack-free and super-hydrophobic MPL to a passive DMFC operating with neat methanol enables a significant increase in the water recovery flux, improving the anodic methanol oxidation reaction and thereby boosting the cell performance.

Abstract: The high penetration of both Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Demand Response (DR) in modern power systems requires a sequence of advanced strategies and technologies for maintaining system reliability and flexibility. Real-time electricity markets (RTM) are the non-discriminatory transaction platforms for providing necessary balancing services, where the market clearing (nodal or zonal prices depending on markets) is very close to real time operations of power systems. One of the primary functions of RTMs in modem power systems is establishing an efficient and effective mechanism for small DER and DR to participate in balancing market transactions, while handling their meteorological or intermittent characteristics, facilitating asset utilization, and stimulating their active responses. Consequently, RTMs are dedicated to maintaining the flexibility and reliability of power systems. This paper reviews advanced typical RTMs respectively in the North America, Australia and Europe, focusing on their market architectures and incentive policies for integrating DER and DR in electricity markets. In this paper, RTMs are classified into three groups: Group I applies nodal prices implemented by optimal power flow, which clears energy prices every 5 min. Group II applies zonal prices, with the time resolution of 5-min. Group III is a general balancing market, which clears zonal prices intro-hourly. The various successful advanced RTM experiences have been summarized and discussed, which provides a technical overview of the present RTMs integrating DER and DR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: A small-scale combined cooling and power (CCP) system usually serves district air conditioning apart from power generation purposes. The typical system consists of a gas turbine and an exhaust gas-fired absorption refrigerator. The surplus heat of the gas turbine is recovered to generate cooling energy. In this way, the CCP system has a high overall efficiency at the design point. However, the CCP system usually runs under off-design conditions because the users' demand varies frequently. The operating strategy of the gas turbine will affect the thermodynamic performance of itself and the entire CCP system. The operating strategies for gas turbines include the reducing turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and the compressor inlet air throttling (IAT). A CCP system, consisting of an OPRA gas turbine and a double effects absorption refrigerator, is investigated to identify the effects of different operating strategies. The CCP system is simulated based on the partial-load model of gas turbine and absorption refrigerator. The off-design performance of the CCP system is compared under different operating strategies. The results show that the IAT strategy is the better one. At 50% rated power output of the gas turbine, the IAT operating strategy can increase overall system efficiency by 10% compared with the TIT strategy. In general, the IAT operating strategy is suited for other gas turbines. However, the benefits of IAT should be investigated in the future, when different gas turbine is adopted. This study may provide a new operating strategy of small scale gas turbine to improve the off-design performance of CCP system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Oil-related events have increased the uncertainty and complexity of the worldwide oil market. This paper investigates the effects of four types of oil-related events on world oil prices, using an event study methodology and an AR-GARCH model. The Internet information concerning these events, which is derived from search query volumes in Google, is introduced in an analytical framework to identify the magnitude and significance of the market response to oil-related events. The results indicate that world oil prices responding to different oil-related events display obvious differentiation. The cumulative abnormal returns, which reflect the influence of the global financial crisis, tend to drop first and then reverse and rise, while the cumulative abnormal returns induced by other oil-related events present a stronger persistent effect. The impact of the global financial crisis on oil price returns is significantly negative, while the impact of the Libyan war and hurricanes is significantly positive. However, the reactions of oil price returns to different OPEC production announcements are inconsistent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The article assesses the electricity consumption in use of telecommunication equipment to achieve one remote multi-user work meeting, an existing service proposed by Orange group. It also examines the electric gains of substitution for a meeting requiring physical transport. Equipment comprises participant computers PC and phones, access to core networks and servers to permit audio link and the share of documents on PC display between users. Each device requires power to perform hours of activity or transfer nominal bit's of throughput.
A generic and modular method is suggested to determine from this information, which is not directly related to services processed by the devices, the consumption of the service under study. The method thus provides a quantitative relation of service consumption to its characteristics - duration, number of users and access throughput - but also to device consumption efficiency and utilization rate. The relation of dependance permits to assess potential energy saving by substituting devices for more efficiency ones and/or by increasing their utilization rate at same provided service.
With some utilization rates at around 10%, as observed for the servers, a telemeeting between three users and lasting 2.3 h requires 9 MJ of electricity. Using better equipment and higher rates it can be decreased to 1.5 MJ. By comparison transport of two of the users by train over a total distance of 2500 km requires 500 MJ.
The method can be applied to any service provided its characteristics are known. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Exergy analysis, which provides means of calculating efficiency losses in industrial devices, is reviewed, and the area of its validity is carefully discussed. Consequently, a generalization is proposed, which holds also beyond the area of applicability of exergy analysis. The generalization is formulated within the framework of classical irreversible thermodynamics, and interestingly it leads to minimization of a functional different from entropy production. Fuel cells, osmotic power plants and heat engines are analyzed within the theory. In particular, the theory is demonstrated on a toy model of solid oxide fuel cells quantitatively. Eventually, a new general algorithm of thermodynamic optimization is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A new mathematical model is proposed for the estimation of CO2 gasification kinetics of different rank coals and ash contents. There are no previous reports on the determination of the conversion rate or even residence time of CO2 or steam gasification based on coal characterization and for a wide range of ash content. This new approach can be used to infer the residence time and other parameters required for reactor design and operation optimization of newly mined coals or coal mixtures used as feedstock.
The coal micropore surface area and the alkaline content determined by the ash composition were proved to be the most significant variables influencing the gasification rate. These variables were correlated to formulate a semi-empirical expression based on the Arrhenius equation. An equation to infer residence time, independent of the kinetic model, is also presented.
The new equation is important in understanding the catalytic effect of the alkaline content in the temperature range where the chemical reaction is the controlling step. It can also be used as the corresponding term of the chemical reaction in a gas-solid kinetic model when working at higher temperatures. This new approach is valid, if there is not loss of alkali and alkaline earth metals due to sublimation or melting, which results in a glassy slag structure. The proposed model has direct industrial application in simulation of gasifiers' performance with the knowledge of only coal characterization properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) based on phase change material (PCMs) is an interesting solution to be used for mitigating the mismatch between energy demand and supply that affects various kinds energy systems. The advance of LHTES technology requires to overcome the limitations posed by the poor thermal conductivity of most of the PCMs. Thus, a large scale utilization of LHTES system strongly depends on the development of efficient heat transfer enhancement techniques. In this paper the use of tree shaped fins is proposed to enhance the performance of a shell-and-tube LHTES unit. The study is performed through a numerical model that takes into account of the thermal behaviour of the system. The geometry of Y-shaped fins with one and two bifurcations are optimized through the combined use of CFD modelling and response surface method. The results show that an increase of 24% of the system efficiency can be achieved by the optimized unit. Another relevant result arises from the analysis: the optimal fin design depends on the operating time of the LHTES unit. For short operating times Y-shaped fins with wide angles between branches are preferable. On the contrary, smaller angles are necessary for long operating times.
To summarize, this work presents for the first time a shape optimization strategy for the improvement of a system involving transient operating conditions. This is a key feature of the paper and an innovative effort to tackle optimization problems involving energy systems that show unsteady state behaviour. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: With large scale battery systems being more and more used in demanding applications regarding lifetime, performance and safety, it is of great importance to utilize not only cells with a high cyclic and calendric lifetime but also to optimize the whole system architecture. The aim of this work is therefore, to highlight the benefits of a modular system architecture allowing the use of hybrid battery systems combining high power and high energy cells in a multi-technology system. To achieve an optimized performance, efficiency and lifetime for an electric vehicle the complete drive train topology has to be taken into account instead of optimizing one of the components individually. Consequently, the topic will be analyzed from the system's point of view, addressing in particular the modularization of the battery as well as the power electronics needed to do so. It will be shown that a highly flexible battery system can be realized by dc-to-dc converters between a modular, hybrid battery system and the drive inverter. By the dc-to-dc converters the battery output voltages and the inverter input voltages are decoupled. Hence, the battery's topology can be chosen unrestrictedly within a wide range and easily be interconnected to a common dc-link of a different voltage. The benefits of this flexibility will be analyzed in detail showing especially how the lifetime of the battery system can be improved and the impact on system weight. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Rock salt in China is primarily bedded salt, usually composed of many thin salt layers and interlayers (e.g. anhydrite, mudstone, and glauberite). Thus, the feasibility analysis of abandoned salt caverns located in salt beds to be used as Underground Gas Storage (UGS) facilities is full of challenges. In this paper, we introduce the feasibility analysis of China's first salt cavern gas storage facility using an abandoned salt cavern. The cavern is located in Jintan city, Jiangsu province, China. The mechanical properties and permeability of the bedded salts are obtained by experiments. Based on the results of the analyses, it appears to be quite feasible to convert the abandoned salt caverns of Jintan city to UGS facilities. The stability of the cavern is evaluated by the 3D geomechanical numerical simulations, and the operating parameters are proposed accordingly. Results indicate that the maximum volume shrinkage of the cavern is less than 25% and the maximum deformations are less than 2% of the caverns' maximum diameters after operating for 20 years. It is recommended that the weighted average internal gas pressure be maintained as 11 MPa to control the extent of the plastic zones to a safe level. Safety factors decrease with operating time, especially those of the interface between rock salt and mudstone layers decrease significantly. Effective strain is generally greater than 2%, and locally is greater than 3% after operating 20 years. The maximum pressure drop rate should be kept to less than 0.55 MPa/day. Based on above proposed parameters, China's first salt cavern gas storage facilities were completed, and gas was first injected, in 2007. To check the status of the caverns after operating for 6 years, the volumes of the caverns were measured in 2013 by Sonar under working conditions. Measurement results show that the cavern shapes did not change much, and that volume shrinkages were less than 2%. Comprehensive results show that the feasibility analysis method proposed in this paper is reliable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The UK government's CO2 emissions targets will require electrification of much of the country's infrastructure with low carbon technologies such as photovoltaic panels, electric vehicles and heat pumps. The large scale proliferation of these technologies will necessitate major changes to the planning and operation of distribution networks. Distribution network operators are trialling electrical energy storage (EES) across their networks to increase their understanding of the contribution that it can make to enable the expected paradigm shift in generation and consumption of electricity.
In order to evaluate a range of applications for EES, including voltage control and power flow management, installations have taken place at various distribution network locations and voltage levels. This article reports on trial design approaches and their application to a UK trial of an EES system to ensure broad applicability of the results. Results from these trials of an EES system, low carbon technologies and trial distribution networks are used to develop validated power system models. These models are used to evaluate, using a formalised methodology, the impact that EES could have on the design and operation of future distribution networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: For future energy supply systems the effects and benefits of battery storage systems in households with photovoltaic (PV) generators and the effects on distribution and transmission grids need to be identified and analyzed. The development of grid relieving management strategies for the storage system in due consideration of self-consumption is a necessary step forward in order to analyze the potential of private home battery storage systems to reduce stress on the power supply system. A MATLAB-based model of a lithium-ion storage system has been developed. The model is applicable for a wide range of PV generator sizes, different battery storage systems and diverse management strategies. In order to identify the potential of grid relieving forecast strategies, without discharging the storage into the grid, a management strategy based on persistence forecasts of solar radiation and household load demand has been implemented and analyzed. To minimize forecast uncertainties a proportional plus integral controller has been developed. The persistence forecast management strategy is applicable in real-life PV-battery-systems and due to the simple forecast it is easy to equip existing systems with such a management system with only low effort. As a result it will be shown that a storage system management based on forecasts has a significantly higher potential to relieve the grid than a system that only maximizes self-consumption as it is usually used nowadays. Besides, such a management strategy is able to unload the grid more than a static power reduction to 70% of the nominal power rating according to the current German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). At the same time, the self-consumption can be retained at nearly the same level as by using a management strategy to purely maximize the self-consumption. Even less energy is wasted then with the feed-in limitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Although pumped hydro storage is seen as a strategic key asset by grid operators, financing it is complicated in new liberalised markets. It could be argued that the optimum generation portfolio is now determined by the economic viability of generators based on a short to medium term return on investment. This has meant that capital intensive projects such as pumped hydro storage are less attractive for wholesale electricity companies because the payback periods are too long. In tandem a significant amount of wind power has entered the generation mix, which has resulted in operating and planning integration issues due to wind's inherent uncertain, varying spatial and temporal nature. These integration issues can be overcome using fast acting gas peaking plant or energy storage. Most analysis of wind power integration using storage to date has used stochastic optimisation for power system balancing or arbitrage modelling to examine techno-economic viability. In this research a deterministic dynamic programming long term generation expansion model is employed to optimise the generation mix, total system costs and total carbon dioxide emissions, and unlike other studies calculates reserve to firm wind power. The key finding of this study is that the incentive to build capital-intensive pumped hydro storage to firm wind power is limited unless exogenous market costs come very strongly into play. Furthermore it was demonstrated that reserve increases with increasing wind power showing the importance of ancillary services in future power systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Currently, there is an increasing interest in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants as alternative to produce renewable electricity at large scale by using mirrors to concentrate the solar energy and to convert it into high temperature heat. These facilities can be combined with thermal energy storage (TES) systems, which are, nowadays, one of the most feasible solutions in facing the challenge of the intermittent energy supply and demand. However, they are still in research process and, for that, there is a lack of environmental impact studies of these TES systems complementing solar plants. This paper accounts the environmental impact of three TES systems used nowadays in high temperature applications for CSP plants: first, a system which stores sensible heat in high temperature concrete; second, a system storing sensible heat in molten salts; and third, another system with molten salts but storing latent heat. All the systems are normalised in order to be comparable between them due to its initial storage capacity difference. The environmental impact is accounted by calculating the amount of embodied energy in the components of the different TES systems. Notice that embodied energy refers to the total energy inputs required to make a component. Between the three systems, the sensible heat system using concrete as storage material is the one with less environmental impact while the molten salts and PCM have a higher value of embodied energy, mainly due to the nitrate mixture used as storage material. Finally, advantages and disadvantages of the method proposed used are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper gray-box models of the residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system were developed. The HVAC system comprises of several subsystems such as energy recovery ventilator (ERV), air handling unit (AHU), buffer tank (BT), radiant floor heating (RFH) system, zone and ground source heat pump (GSHP) whose models can be identified separately and combined to obtain the model of the full system. The parameters of the subsystem models were identified from the data measured from the instrumented TRCA Archetype Sustainable House (TRCA-ASH) HVAC systems located at Kortright Centre for Conservation in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. Individual subsystem models were combined to obtain the full system model which replicates the performance of the existing HVAC system and provides the cost estimate for running the HVAC system. Existing HVAC system uses ON/OFF controllers for zone temperature and BT temperature control. The ON/OFF controllers were integrated into the full scale system model and energy estimates were calculated for the operation of primary and secondary components (e.g., GSHP, fans and pumps). This model can be used to further investigate the effects of more advanced controllers (e.g., PID, model predictive control-MPC) and energy conservation strategies (e.g., set-point reset, passive/active thermal energy storage) in the simulation before implementing on the existing HVAC system.

Abstract: A novel method has been designed to obtain the optimum community energy storage (CES) systems for end user applications. The method evaluates the optimum performance (including the round trip efficiency and annual discharge), levelised cost (LCOES), the internal rate of return and the levelised value of suitable energy storage technologies. A complimentary methodology was developed including three reference years (2012, 2020 and zero carbon year) to show the evolution of the business case during the low carbon transition. The method follows a community approach and the optimum CES system was calculated as a function of the size of the community. In this work, this method was put in practice with lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technologies when performing PV energy time-shift using real demand data from a single home to a 100-home community. The community approach reduced the LCOES down to 0.30 (sic)/kW h and 0.11 (sic)/kW h in 2020 and the zero carbon year respectively. These values meant a cost reduction by 37% and 66% regarding a single home. Results demonstrated that PbA batteries needs from 1.5 to 2.5 times more capacity than Li-ion chemistry to reduce the LCOES, the worst case scenario being for the smallest communities, because the more spiky demand profile required proportionately larger PbA battery capacities.

Abstract: Air temperature is an effective predictor for electricity demand, especially during hot periods where the need of electric air conditioning can be high. This paper presents for the first time an assessment of the use of seasonal climate forecasts of temperature for medium-term electricity demand prediction. The retrospective seasonal climate forecasts provided by ECWMF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) are used to forecast the June-July Italian electricity demand for the period 1990-2007.
We find a relationship between summer (June-July) average temperature patterns over Europe and Italian electricity demand using both a linear and non-linear regression approach. With the aim to evaluate the potential usefulness of the information contained into the climate ensemble forecast, the analysis is extended considering a probabilistic approach.
Results show that, especially in the Center-South of Italy, seasonal forecasts of temperature issued in May lead to a significant correlation coefficient of electricity demand greater than 0.6 for the summer period. The average correlation obtained from seasonal forecasts is 0.53 for the temperature predicted in May and 0.19 for the predictions issued in April for the linear model, while the non-linear approach leads to the coefficients of 0.62 and 0.36 respectively. For the probabilistic approach, seasonal forecasts exhibit a positive and significant skill-score in predicting the demand above/below the upper/lower tercue in many regions.
This work is a significant progress in understanding the relationship between temperature and electricity demand. It is shown that much of the predictable electricity demand anomaly over Italy is connected with so-called heat-waves (i.e. long lasting positive temperature anomalies) over Europe.

Abstract: Several of the emerging technologies for electricity storage are based on some form of thermal energy storage (TES). Examples include liquid air energy storage, pumped heat energy storage and, at least in part, advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage. Compared to other large-scale storage methods, TES benefits from relatively high energy densities, which should translate into a low cost per MW h of storage capacity and a small installation footprint. TES is also free from the geographic constraints that apply to hydro storage schemes. TES concepts for electricity storage rely on either a heat pump or refrigeration cycle during the charging phase to create a hot or a cold storage space (the thermal stores), or in some cases both. During discharge, the thermal stores are depleted by reversing the cycle such that it acts as a heat engine. The present paper is concerned with a form of TES that has both hot and cold packed-bed thermal stores, and for which the heat pump and heat engine are based on a reciprocating Joule cycle, with argon as the working fluid. A thermodynamic analysis is presented based on traditional cycle calculations coupled with a Schumann-style model of the packed beds. Particular attention is paid to the various loss-generating mechanisms and their effect on roundtrip efficiency and storage density. A parametric study is first presented that examines the sensitivity of results to assumed values of the various loss factors and demonstrates the rather complex influence of the numerous design variables. Results of an optimisation study are then given in the form of trade-off surfaces for roundtrip efficiency, energy density and power density. The optimised designs show a relatively flat efficiency vs. energy density trade-off, so high storage density can be attained with only a modest efficiency penalty. After optimisation, losses due to pressure drop and irreversible heat transfer in the thermal reservoirs are only a few percent, so roundtrip efficiency is governed mainly by the efficiency of the compression and expansion processes: overall roundtrip efficiencies approaching those for pumped hydro schemes might be achievable whilst simultaneously attaining energy storage densities of around 200 MJ m(-3), but this is contingent upon attaining compression and expansion efficiencies for the reciprocating devices that have yet to be proven.

Abstract: A great portion of the primary energy is consumed by space heating and cooling in buildings. The need for utilizing more renewable energy in the building sector remains critical for ensuring the energy and environment sustainability. Geothermal energy is one of the renewable energy sources that we have an easy access to for supplying low-grade thermal energy with a low impact on the environment. The methods of utilizing geothermal energy for buildings include such as ground source heat pumps and earth to air heat exchangers (EAHEs). In this paper we presented the comprehensive performance analysis and deduced an easy-to-apply regression model for predicting the cooling capacity of an EAHE. A one-dimensional steady-state control volume model was developed and applied to simulate the performance of the EAHE. It couples both heat and mass transfer between the air and the tube. The model was calibrated by comparing against the experimental data from an existing renewable energy testing facility. After the calibration, six factors, namely the air temperature, the air relative humidity, the air velocity at the inlet of EAHE, the tube surface temperature, and the tube length and diameter on the performance were analyzed using the calibrated model. The polynomial regression models for predicting the cooling capacities including total, sensible and latent cooling capacity with high accuracy were obtained. The easy-to-apply formulas can be of great use in the design and application of EAHEs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, construction and tests of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator. A two-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine converts thermal energy to acoustic power. Two low-impedance linear alternators (i.e., audio loudspeakers) were installed to extract and convert the engine's acoustic power to electricity. The coupling mechanism between the thermoacoustic engine and alternators has been systematically studied numerically and experimentally, hence the optimal locations for installing the linear alternators were identified to maximize the electric power output and/or the thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency. A ball valve was used in the loop to partly correct the acoustic field that was altered by manufacturing errors. A prototype was built based on this new concept, which used pressurized helium at 1.8 MPa as the working gas and operated at a frequency of about 171 Hz. In the experiment, a maximum electric power of 204W when the hot end temperature of the two regenerators reaches 512 degrees C and 452 degrees C, respectively. A maximum thermal-to-electric efficiency of 3.43% was achieved when the hot end temperature of the two regenerators reaches 597 degrees C and 511 degrees C, respectively. The research results presented in this paper demonstrate that multi-stage traveling-wave thermoacoustic electricity generator has a great potential for developing inexpensive electric generators.

Abstract: This paper aims at exploring the influence that the changes in sectoral composition in most EU economies have had on aggregate energy intensity. We rely on the so-called Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method, implemented within a multiplicative energy intensity approach. Then, based on the Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA), we present, develop and apply a new methodology that enables the exploration of the contribution of each sector to the percent change in the structural factors index. Our findings show: (a) a greater importance of the intensity factor over the structural one, (b) a positive influence of structural change in some ex-communist countries, and (c) a strong, negative contribution of the industrial sector (including construction) to changes in aggregate energy intensity in most European economies, particularly in the Western ones. In short, adaptation to more efficient techniques, innovation, R&D, and substitution for higher quality energies, seem to be the action lines to follow, although in former communist countries these strategies should be accompanied by other policies aiming at accelerating the transition processes.

Abstract: Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is a crucial technology for balancing large steam power plants, and may become increasingly important for storing renewable energies. Hence, capacity ranges of PHS, as well as its dynamic response to renewable power variability, will become progressively relevant. In this paper, we focus on determining capacity ranges and efficiencies of PHS plants using conventional constant speed Francis runners, adopting unconventional runner sets, arranged in innovative fashion. In the pumping mode, it is assumed that the impellers run at a single speed, but that they can have, depending on the plant, either the same or different design capacities. In the turbine mode, it is assumed that the runners can access the well-established range from 60% to 100% of design capacity via Wicket gate adjustment. In order to extend the capacity ranges with constant speed runners, bypass loops to balance the plant are considered. Because bypass operation implies losses, the possible efficiencies are studied. The results show that (a) bypass is an effective means of extending capacity ranges, but high by-pass ratios decrease efficiencies. (b) One of the impeller sets postulated in this work offers the possibility of almost continuous capacity at high efficiencies, with relatively small capacity variation within the set.

Abstract: This paper describes the experimental characterization of a 25 cm(2) laboratory scale vanadium redox flow battery (V-RFB). The unit cell performance with respect to voltage, coulombic and energy efficiencies under different performance parameters (current densities, operating temperatures, flow rates, electrolyte concentrations and material properties of 5 cm x 5 cm electrodes) are presented. The cell exhibits different characteristics under different operating parameters; the highest energy efficiency is recorded at c.a. 82%, operating at 308 K, 60 mA cm(-2) and 3 cm(3) s(-1) volumetric flow rate for 250 cm(3) electrolytes (each reservoir) of 1.6 mol dm(-3) V(III)/V(IV) in 4 mol dm(-3) H2SO4. Formation charge of the mixture of vanadium species into single electro-active species at positive and negative electrodes are presented. Estimated time for the electro-active species to complete the formation charge using electrochemical calculation of Faraday's constant are presented; a discrepancy of 4.5% is found between the theoretical and experimental data using current density of 80 mA cm(-2).

Abstract: Remote communities beyond the reach of conventional electricity grids primarily rely on diesel generators (DG) to supply electricity. The systems in these communities are costly to operate because of the high price of transporting diesel to remote areas, and the low overall efficiencies caused by part-load operation of the DG. There is increasing interest to use wind energy converters (WEC) to supplement DG, thereby lowering the fuel consumption and operating costs. In order to use WEC to reduce the economic and environmental burden that DG have on remote communities, an energy storage system can be incorporated to buffer both generation and demand. This can avoid curtailment of the WEC, operate the DG at optimal efficiency, and reduce the necessary maximum installed generator capacities.
Regenerative air energy storage (RAES) is a form of compressed air storage that is suitable for deployment in remote communities due to its ability to utilize waste heat from DG to boost the roundtrip efficiency of energy storage. This article presents a numerical model for a RAES system operating in a wind-diesel micro-grid. Simulations are run for varying WEC penetration levels and RAES energy capacities.
The results show that in systems with WEC penetration less than 75%, increasing WEC capacity is more economic than adding a RAES system. Above penetration rates of 75%, the use of RAES achieves increased diesel savings with only slightly longer payback than simple wind-diesel systems. In the remote Canadian community case study, the optimal RAES system is 0.5 MW and 1 MW h with a WEC penetration rate of approximately 75%. A larger RAES results in further fuel savings, and thus environmental benefit, with only marginal increase in simple payback period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study we show that a chemical ferricyanide cathode can be replaced by a biological oxygen reducing cathode in a plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) with a new record power output. A biocathode was successfully integrated in a PMFC and operated for 151 days. Plants growth continued and the power density increased reaching a maximum power output of 679 mW/m(2) plant growth area (PGA) in a 10 min polarization. The two week record average power densities was 240 mW/m(2) PGA. The new records were reached due to the high redox potential of oxygen reduction which was effectively catalyzed by microorganisms in the cathode. This resulted in a 127 mV higher cathode potential of the PMFC with a biocathode than a PMFC with a ferricyanide cathode. We also found that substrate availability in the anode likely limits the current generation. This work is crucial for PMFC application as it shows that PMFC can be a completely sustainable biotechnology with an improved power output. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Eutectic molten salt can be used as the latent thermal energy storage (LIES) medium in solar energy applications. In the present study, eutectic salt (50 wt% NaNO3, 50 wt% KNO3) with a melting temperature of about 220 degrees C was employed as the PCM for the middle-temperature solar energy application, which can be powered by the parabolic-trough solar collector using oil as the heat transfer fluid. There are many LIES units in which the molten salt is encapsulated in the thermal energy storage tank, where the heat transfer characteristic of the LTES unit is very important for the overall performance of the entire thermal energy storage tank. We experimentally and numerically investigated the heat transfer characteristics of the molten-salt in a LTES unit with and without heat transfer enhancement. Various heating temperatures of 240 degrees C, 250 degrees C, and 260 degrees C and cooling temperatures of 30 degrees C, 70 degrees C, and 110 degrees C were employed in the study, so as to extensively reveal the heat transfer characteristics during heat storage and retrieval. It was found that natural convection was very dominant during heat storage in the case of pure molten-salt, especially when the heating temperature was higher, and it was weakened in the case of molten-salt with metal foam; while the heat retrieval process was enhanced by the presence of the metal foam. The numerical results were compared with the experimental results, showing reasonable agreement, which indicated that such numerical model could be used for the further study of the performance of the LTES system.

Abstract: The most relevant issue in operation of isolated power systems is frequency stability. Frequency stability is concerned with the ability of generators to supply the loads at an acceptable frequency after a disturbance. Frequency stability is governed by the kinetic energy stored in the generator-prime mover rotating masses and the prime mover frequency primary regulation. If frequency excursions are not within +/-2.5 Hz range, cascade tripping of the remaining generators can occur because of generator over/under frequency protections tripping. Energy storage systems can contribute to frequency stability enhancement if their discharging is governed by a frequency controller.
Endesa is leading a research project on testing the state of the art of energy storage systems for several applications (peak-shaving, voltage control, frequency control) in several isolated power systems of the Canary Islands. Several applications are being investigated. One of them consists on the application of a 4 MW-5 s ultracapacitor (UC) for frequency stability enhancement of the La Palma power system.
This paper reports the dynamic model developed for time domain simulation and controller design of frequency stability, and field tests undertaken to validate models and the controller settings. A simple but still accurate model is presented. The proposed model takes into account the UC's state of charge (SoC) and it represents the dynamics of the power electronics by means of a non-linear first-order model. The frequency control consists of droop control and inertia emulation. Ramp rate limits, power limits and SoC are also taken into account in the frequency control. In comparison with the recorded field tests, the proposed model is able to accurately represent the response of the UC for the purpose of frequency stability analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) is a cost-effective technology that enables the reduction of energy use and CO2 emissions associated with the heating and cooling of buildings by storage and recovery of large quantities of thermal energy in the subsurface. Reducing the distance between wells in large-scale application of ATES increases the total amount of energy that can be provided by ATES in a given area. However, due to thermal interference the performance of individual systems can decrease. In this study a novel method is presented that can be used to (a) determine the impact of thermal interference on the economic and environmental performance of ATES and (b) optimize well distances in large-scale applications. The method is demonstrated using the hydrogeological conditions of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Results for this case study show that it is cost-effective to allow a limited amount of thermal interference, such that 30-40% more energy can be provided in a given area compared to the case in which all negative thermal interference is avoided. Sensitivity analysis indicates that optimal well distance is moderately insensitive to changes in hydrogeological and economic conditions. Maximum economic benefit compared to conventional heating and cooling systems on the other hand is sensitive, especially to changes in the gas price and storage temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Energy storage has the potential to provide multiple services to several sectors in electricity industry and thus support activities related to generation, network and system operation. Hence aggregating the value delivered by storage to these sectors is paramount for promoting its efficient deployment in the near future, which will provide the level of flexibility needed to deal with the envisaged high renewables share and the increase in peak demand driven by transport and heating electrification. In this context, we develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to schedule operation of distributed storage by coordinating provision of a range of system services which are rewarded at different market prices. The model maximises distributed storage's net profit while providing distribution network congestion management, energy price arbitrage and various reserve and frequency regulation services through both active and reactive power control. We demonstrate benefits associated with the coordination of these services and its impacts on commercial strategies to determine optimal multi-service portfolios in the long term. We also demonstrate the value of reactive power control to support not only distribution network congestion management, but also efficient trading of energy and balancing services which are usually treated through active power-only control. In addition, we use the model to price the service of distribution network congestion management and propose an efficient investment policy to upgrade distribution network capacity in the presence of distributed storage. Finally, several case studies under current market conditions in Great Britain (GB) demonstrate that distributed storage revenues associated with frequency control services are significantly more profitable.

Abstract: A finite volume method based computational fluid dynamics model has been developed and applied for a cathode-supported planar solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) operating in cross-flow configuration arrangement. The performance behavior, in terms of current density, temperature distribution and hydrogen production in an SOEC, has been investigated for different operating voltages and compared with a corresponding parallel-flow configuration. The predicted results show that higher current densities are obtained for higher operating voltages. The anodic current density is higher than the cathodic one. Yet, the parallel-flow configuration yields lower current density values although they remain in the same order of magnitude as those from the cross-flow arrangement. The simulation reveals various temperature profiles depending on the operating voltage emphasizing the three thermal operating modes of an SOEC, i.e., endothermic, thermo-neutral and exothermic. Per contra, the parallel-flow arrangement gives a temperature decrease along the flow direction although operating in exothermic mode. Higher hydrogen molar fractions at the outlet of the cathode channel were obtained at higher operating voltages due to the higher current densities generated and the exothermic operating mode. The parallel-flow arrangement yields lower hydrogen production due to the lower current densities revealed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: At this moment, the global energy consumption in buildings is around 40% of the total energy consumption in developed countries. Thermal energy storage (TES) is presented as one way to address this energy-related problem proposing an alternative to reduce the gap between energy supply and energy demand. One way to store energy is using thermochemical materials (TCM). These types of materials allow accumulating energy through a chemical process at low temperature, almost without heat losses. In addition, it is a stable way to perform the heat storage and TCM can be implemented for seasonal storage or/and long term storage. This study compares the cyclability, from the thermophysical point of view, CaCl2 which follows a chemical reaction and zeolite which follows a sorption process to be used as TCM for seasonal/long term storage. The main results show that the chemical reaction TCM is more energy-efficient than the sorption TCM. The CaCl2 calculated energy density is 1.47 GJ/m(3), being the best option to be considered to be used as TCM, even though the dehydration process of the zeolite is simpler and it occurs at higher temperatures its calculated energy density is only 0.2 GJ/m(3).

Abstract: We investigate the wave energy potential in the Caribbean Sea using a 30-year wave hindcast. Wave energy in enclosed sea basins, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, is commonly associated with lower energy production rates. However, an easterly zonal wind reaching 13 m/s, known as the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CCLJ), is shown to control the wave climatology in the Caribbean Sea. The wave hindcast information is validated with altimetry (Globwave) and buoy (DIMAR) data from the Colombian Caribbean Sea. The wave hindcast performance is very satisfactory at two buoy locations (Barranquilla and Providencia) and with respect to altimetry information, but presents an underprediction of extreme events at Puerto Bolivar. Therefore, an assessment of wave energy in the study area, based on wave hindcast information, is conducted to investigate the wave energy potential in such enclosed area. Numerical results suggest that the CLLJ region is suitable for wave energy extraction (8-14 kW/m) and presents important spatial gradients that need to be considered for the installation of wave energy devices. Furthermore, it is found that locally generated (sea) wave energy can be suitable for energy production and hence future technology development should be devoted to its harvesting.

Abstract: Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of barley straw with K2CO3 at different temperatures (280-400 degrees C) was conducted and compared to optimize its process conditions; the aqueous phase as a co-product from this process was recycled to explore the feasibility of implementing wastewater reuse for bio-crude oil production. Results showed that low temperature favored the formation of bio-crude oil, with a maximum yield of 34.9 wt% at 300 degrees C. Contrarily, at high temperature, the bio-crude oil had better qualities in terms of less oxygen content and higher heating values (HHVs). The compounds identified in bio-crude oil were mainly phenolics, carboxylic acids, aldehydes and alcohols, among which the relative contents of phenolics and carboxylic acids decreased with increasing temperature. In the recirculation studies, bio-crude yield was enhanced gradually with aqueous phase addition at 300 degrees C, and reached 38.4 wt% after three cycles. The HHVs of bio-crude oil from HTL with aqueous phase were 28.4-29.4 MJ/kg, slightly higher than those from HTL with fresh water. While no obvious differences in elemental distribution can be found after aqueous phase recirculation. In conclusion, this study gives a detailed insight into the HTL behavior of barley straw, and offers potential opportunities and benefits for bio-crude oil production through the reuse of aqueous phase.

Abstract: In this paper, we use experimental data collected from an Austin, Texas smart grid test bed with a system-level battery energy storage model to assess the lifetime of batteries in a microgrid operating in islanded mode during a distribution-level outage. We consider a hypothetical microgrid consisting of 21 single-family detached homes and three transformer-level community energy storage (CES) battery units ranging in size from 25 kW h to 75 kW h. To describe the performance of CES batteries, we implement a dynamic behavioral circuit model capable of describing voltage transients and rate-capacity effects. We use one-minute electricity production and consumption data collected from the smart grid test bed in 2012 to assess how the timing of an electric outage affects the islanding lifetime of a residential microgrid. We contrast our results with the average outage duration reported by U.S. electric utilities to quantify how often a residential microgrid could withstand a typical outage. Our results show that increasing the amount of rooftop PV in a residential microgrid does not significantly increase how often it can withstand an average-duration outage. However, combining PV with CES extends the median islanding lifetime by up to 11.6 h during morning outages. Based on our results, 50 kW h CES provides the best tradeoff between the cost of a CES system and its reliability benefit, allowing downstream loads to withstand an average-duration outage approximately 93% of the time.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology for the economic optimisation of the sizing of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) whilst enhancing the participation of Wind Power Plants (WPP) in network primary frequency control support. The methodology was designed flexibly, so it can be applied to different energy markets and to include different ESS technologies. The methodology includes the formulation and solving of a Linear Programming (LP) problem.
The methodology was applied to the particular case of a 50 MW WPP, equipped with a Vanadium Redox Flow battery (VRB) in the UK energy market. Analysis is performed considering real data on the UK regular energy market and the UK frequency response market. Data for wind power generation and energy storage costs are estimated from literature.
Results suggest that, under certain assumptions, ESSs can be profitable for the operator of a WPP that is providing frequency response. The ESS provides power reserves such that the WPP can generate close to the maximum energy available. The solution of the optimisation problem establishes that an ESS with a power rating of 5.3 MW and energy capacity of about 3 MW h would be enough to provide such service whilst maximising the incomes for the WPP operator considering the regular and frequency regulation UK markets.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of renewable energies into electrical grids, power imbalance has become one of the most critical issues in grid operations. The end-users at power demand side can actually make use of their demand reduction potentials to contribute to the grid power balance. Conventional demand responses of end-users can provide considerable power demand reductions, but the demand responses are usually subject to significant delay and cannot fulfill the needs of grid real time operation. In this paper, a fast chiller power demand response control strategy for commercial buildings is therefore proposed which facilitates buildings to act as grid "operating reserves" by providing rapid demand responses to grid request within minutes. However, simply shutting down some essential operating chillers would result in disordered chilled water flow distribution and uneven indoor thermal comfort degradation. This strategy has therefore taken essential measures to solve such problems effectively. Simulation case studies are conducted to investigate the operation dynamics and energy performance of HVAC systems in the demand response events controlled by the strategy. Results show that fast and significant power demand reductions can be achieved without sacrificing the thermal comfort too much. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Standalone renewable energy (RE) systems hold the most promising solution to the electrification of remote areas without utility grid access, while a feasible energy storage is a core part for achieving a continuous and reliable power supply since RE is usually intermittent and weather dependent. In the present study, the pumped hydro storage system is proposed, which is considered as a promising technology for solar energy penetration and particularly for small autonomous systems in remote areas. The mathematical models for the major components are developed, and system reliability and economic criteria are discussed as a benchmark for optimization. The genetic algorithm (GA), along with Pareto optimality concept, is used for the system techno-economic optimization: to maximize power supply reliability and minimize system lifecycle cost simultaneously. The proposed methodology is applied on a real remote inhabited island without power supply. System sizing, simulation and optimization are carried out using single-objective and double-objective GA technique. The performance of the optimal case under zero LPSP is examined. This study demonstrates that the proposed models and optimization algorithm is effective and can be used for other similar studies in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The paper presents a model-based approach to supporting battery selection for a fuel cell (FC)-based auxiliary power unit (APU). It is introduced to a case study of electrical power production and consumption management in a truck anti-idling application of a diesel-powered FC-based APU, a system under development in FCGEN, a FCH JU European project of the FP7 program. With fuel cell and related technologies increasingly competing with others in the market, they need to form complete systems with matching and well-balanced components to enable using the technology to its best. Within the whole system, the battery, serving as an energy buffer, represents a medium-cost element, but it affects the operating parameters importantly. Within the scope of this study, a purpose-oriented model of the diesel powered FC-based system is developed together with a realistic load scenario for the comparison of three batteries. The battery size and type are investigated and discussed in the light of the simulation results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The use of forecast information for cascade hydropower stations is one of the effective ways to increase the electricity generation reliability and economic benefit. However, the uncertainty of forecast is high when the forecast horizon is long. It is a common practice for hydropower stations to abandon water during flood seasons due to the limited capacity of the associated reservoirs. If forecast is accurate, the stored water can be discharged early before the flood peak arrives. This would effectively reduce the amount of water being abandoned and increase electricity generation. But there is a risk that the water stored in reservoirs would become less than expected if the forecast fails or in dry periods. In order to reduce the negative impact of forecast uncertainty, hydrogen production and storage as energy harvested by electrolysis of water using the electricity from the cascade hydropower stations is proposed and used in this study. Hun River cascade hydropower stations in China are selected as a case study. By integrating ten-day inflow forecast with hedging rule curves (HRCs-TDIF), the feasibility of optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations using hydrogen as energy storage is analyzed. Hedging rules curves of hydrogen production (HRCs-HP) is established for analyzing the relationship between electricity generation reliability (EGR) of the cascade hydropower stations and equipment utilization (EU) of hydrogen production under different equipment scales (ES). The results show that the proposed methods for the selected cascade hydropower stations may lead to high EGR and less water being abandoned. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In district energy systems powered by Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, thermal storage can significantly increase CHP flexibility to respond to real time market signals and therefore improve the business case of such demand response schemes in a Smart Grid environment. However, main challenges remain as to what is the optimal way to control inter-temporal storage operation in the presence of uncertain market prices, and then how to value the investment into storage as flexibility enabler. In this outlook, the aim of this paper is to propose a model for optimal and dynamic control and long term valuation of CHP-thermal storage in the presence of uncertain market prices. The proposed model is formulated as a stochastic control problem and numerically solved through Least Squares Monte Carlo regression analysis, with integrated investment and operational timescale analysis equivalent to real options valuation models encountered in finance. Outputs are represented by clear and interpretable feedback control strategy maps for each hour of the day, thus suitable for real time demand response under uncertainty. Numerical applications to a realistic UK case study with projected market gas and electricity prices exemplify the proposed approach and quantify the robustness of the selected storage solutions.

Abstract: Batch trials for co-digestion of raw sludge and food waste using eleven different mass-based mixtures were performed ranging from 5% to 30%. In contrast to conducting digestion trials as replicates in parallel as commonly done in previous studies, replications were performed successively in each trial to capture the variability in yield caused by a changing composition of the substrates. Trials were conducted four times with the same mixture ratios, but always using a fresh charge of inoculum, raw sludge and food waste. Data fitting was applied to assess the effect of the different mixtures on both the ultimate methane yield and the hydrolysis rate constant. The results revealed that with increasing contributions of food waste, the methane yield of the mixtures increased just due to its higher methane potential. The hydrolysis rate constant in the mixtures with a low contribution of food waste (up to 12.5% mass-based or 35% based on volatile solids) derived in batch experiments were higher than the one observed during the mono-digestion. Hence, co-digestion of food waste holds promise not only due to a higher methane yield, but in particular due to the accelerated methane production rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The paper presents the operational results of a real life residential microgrid which includes six apartments, a 20 kWp photovoltaic plant, a solar based thermal energy plant, a geothermal heat pump, a thermal energy storage, in the form of a 13001 water tank and two 5.8 kW h batteries supplying, each, a couple of apartments. Thanks to the thermal energy storage, the solar based thermal energy plant is able to satisfy the 100% of the hot water summer demand. Therefore the thermal energy storage represents a fundamental element in the management of the residential demand of thermal energy. It collects renewable thermal energy during day-time to release it during night-time, effectively shaving the peak of the thermal energy demand. The two electric storages, on the other hand, provide the hosted electrical subsystems with the ability to effectively increase the self-consumption of the local energy production, thus lowering the amount of energy surplus to be sold back to the grid, and increasing the self-sufficiency of the microgrid. For instance, the storage has supported self-consumption up to the 58.1% of local energy production with regard to the first battery, and up to the 63.5% with regard to the second one. Also, 3165 and 3365 yearly hours of fully autonomous activity have been recorded thanks to the first, and the second battery respectively. On the other hand, the yearly average efficiency amounts to 63.7%, and 653% respectively, for the first and second battery. In the second part of the paper we propose a computational framework to evaluate the overall performance of the microgrid system, while accounting different operating conditions and energy management policies. From this perspective, the framework acts as a useful modeling and design tool, to assess the opportunity of employing alternative energy management system topologies and strategies. Eight different configurations, with growing complexity, have been derived from the original system on purpose. The simulations, carried out based on real data related to one-year time period, have provided results showing that, the higher the integration level of electrical and thermal storage is, the higher degree of self-sufficiency can be achieved by the microgrid, and, in turn, the more consistent the yearly energy saving become. Nevertheless, despite the energy cost reduction achievable with the availability of storage systems in the Leaf House, their high investment cost made them not really profitable at the current price conditions for devices and energy purchase.

Abstract: On-line analysis of proximates (moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon) and lignocellulose components (cellulose, semi-cellulose, and lignin) of coarse-crushed corn stover was investigated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Compared with traditional technique, on-line measurement is complex and challenging but provides real-time analysis. The spectrometer operated over a conveyor belt that moved at 20 cm/s, and the distance between the spectrometer scanning window and the surface of the sample was 100 mm. Corn stover samples (n = 217) were collected from three provinces in China and used to develop the models. Samples were crushed to <50 mm before analysis. After optimized pretreatment, all the NIRS models were developed using partial least squares (PLS) method. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the models for moisture, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon, cellulose, semi-cellulose, and lignin were 9.04%, 9.99%, 1.31%, 6.00%, 3.87%, 6.80%, and 5.06%, respectively. On-line analysis of proximates and lignocellulose components of corn stover was possible using this NIRS system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study the effect of a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) strategy on the lifetime of two different lithium-ion batteries. The work investigates how the aging effect on the electric vehicles' (EV) battery packs due to the additional V2G use can be reduced: it is assumed that the grid is able to identify the cars within the fleet for which the ulterior aging effects caused by V2G usage are restrained in respect of the others. The chosen EVs have to contain enough energy to satisfy the grid requests in terms of power regulation. In order to analyze the possible effects on the EVs due to the mentioned strategy, a V2G simulation environment has been implemented. The system consists of 100 EVs and a grid management strategy subsystem. Each EV is represented by a battery electrical model based on electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data and an aging prediction model parameterized through accelerated aging tests. In order to reproduce real scenario conditions, both the electrical battery model and the aging prediction model have been parameterized for two different cells, a LiFePO4-cathode based and an NMC-cathode based lithium-ion cell. In particular, the accelerated aging tests have been carried out for more than one year, both for calendar and cycling operation, involving around 45 cells for each of the two technologies. The grid subsystem is represented by an algorithm which is able to consider information in terms of aging and type of battery installed in the EV. This subsystem helps to make decisions related to the optimal additional use of each car for a V2G operation. In order to show the applicability and feasibility in terms of battery pack lifetime of the considered V2G management strategy, different scenarios for a period of one year have been simulated. These scenarios consider two different locations with two significantly distinct ambient temperatures, in which the starting conditions of each car in terms of aging state have been selected randomly. The implemented system can be used as a perfect tool to test different grid strategies, taking the aging of the EVs as well as the request in terms of grid power regulation at the same time into account. Furthermore, the entire strategy has been tested including in the system two assembled battery packs, with two li-ion battery chemistries as mentioned earlier. The individual battery management system (BMS) for each technology has been developed in terms of hardware and software requirements. Moreover, the information exchange in terms of aging data between grid and BMS for the V2G strategy has been implemented and tested on a real-time simulation unit. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In many studies, carbon nanoparticles with high values of thermal conductivity (10-3000 W/m K) have been embedded into phase change thermal energy storage materials (PCMs) in order to enhance their bulk thermal properties. While a great deal of work to date has focused on determining the effect of these nanoparticles on a PCM's solid phase thermal properties, little is known about their effect on its liquid phase thermal properties. Thus, in this study, the effect of implanting randomly oriented herringbone style graphite nanofibers (HGNF, average diameter = 100 nm, average length = 20 mu m) on the bulk thermal properties of an organic paraffin PCM (IGI 1230A, T-melt = 329.15 K) in both the solid and liquid phase is quantified. The bulk thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity and thermal diffusivity of HGNF/PCM nanocomposites are obtained as a function of temperature and HGNF volume loading level. It is found that the property enhancement varies significantly depending on the material phase. In order to explain the difference between solid and liquid phase thermal properties, heat flow at the nanoparticle-PCM and nanoparticle-nanoparticle interfaces is examined as a function of HGNF loading level and temperature. To do this, the solid and liquid phase thermal boundary resistances (TBRs) between the nanoparticles and the surrounding PCM and/or between contacting nanoparticles are found. Results suggest that the TBR at the HGNF-PCM interface is nearly double the TBR across the HGNF-HGNF interface in both solid and liquid phases. However, both the HGNF-PCM and HGNF-HGNF TBRs are at least an order of magnitude lower when the PCM is in its solid phase versus when the PCM is in its liquid phase. Finally, the effect of nanofiber concentration on the PCM's latent heat of fusion and melt temperature is investigated in order to determine the applicability of the HGNF/PCM nanocomposite in a wide variety of energy systems.

Abstract: This study aims to provide information on the changes in electricity consumption and costs on dairy farms, through the simulation of various electricity tariffs that may exist in the future and how these tariffs interact with changes in farm management (i.e. shifting the milking operation to an earlier or later time of the day). A previously developed model capable of simulating electricity consumption and costs on dairy farms (MECD) was used to simulate five different electricity tariffs (Flat, Day&Night, Time of Use Tariff I (TOU1), TOU2 and Real Time Pricing (RTP)) on three representative Irish dairy farms: a small farm (SF), a medium farm (MF) and a large farm (LF). The Flat tariff consisted of one electricity price for all time periods, the Day&Night tariff consisted of two electricity prices, a high rate from 09:00 to 00:00 h and a low rate thereafter. The TOU tariff structure was similar to that of the Day&Night tariff except that a peak price band was introduced between 17:00 and 19:00 h. The RTP tariff varied dynamically according to the electricity demand on the national grid. The model used in these simulations was a mechanistic mathematical representation of the electricity consumption that simulated farm equipment under the following headings; milk cooling system, water heating system, milking machine system, lighting systems, water pump systems and the winter housing facilities. The effect of milking start time was simulated to determine the effect on electricity consumption and costs at farm level. The earliest AM milking start time and the latest PM milking start time resulted in the lowest energy consumption. The difference between the lowest and highest electricity consumption within a farm was 7% for SF, 5% for MF and 5% for LF. This difference was accounted for by the variation in the, milk cooling system coefficient of performance. The greatest scope to reduce total annual electricity costs by adjusting milking start times was on TOU2 (39%, 34% and 33% of total annual electricity costs on the SF, MF and LF) and the least scope for reductions using this method was on the Flat tariff (7%, 5% and 7% of total annual electricity costs). The potential for reduction of annual electricity consumption and related costs per litre of milk produced by adjusting milking times was higher for the LF than the SF or MF across all electricity tariffs. It is anticipated that these results and the use of the MECD will help support the decision-making process at farm level around increasing energy efficiency and electricity cost forecasts in future electricity pricing tariff structures.

Abstract: Due to the suitability to balance the intermittency in decentralized systems with renewable sources, electrochemical energy storage possibilities have been analyzed in several studies, all highlighting the need for improvements in relevant techno-economic parameters. Particularly a reduction in the costs per cycle is much needed, which could either come from innovation in more cost-efficient manufacturing methods, a higher endurance of charge/discharge sequences or higher capacities. Looking at patent applications as a metric allows us to determine whether the necessary technological progress is indeed occurring, as the mandatory publication of the underlying inventions provides access to otherwise hidden R&D activities. Our paper contributes to the literature with a compilation of technological classes related to important battery types in the novel Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC), which can be used to identify relevant patent applications of the competing technologies. Using the worldwide patent statistical database (PAT-STAT), we find that promising technologies have been showing increasing patent counts in recent years. For example, the number of patent applications related to regenerative fuel cells (e.g. redox flow batteries) doubled from 2009 to 2011. Nevertheless, the volume of patent filings in technologies related to lithium remains unchallenged. Patent applications in this area are still growing, which indicates that the introduction of improved modules will continue. Using citation analysis, we have identified important patents and organizations for relevant candidate technologies. Our study underlines that electrochemical storage, and in particular lithium-based technologies, will play an increasingly important role in future energy systems. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract: Energy storage technologies can provide services to the electricity grid that are necessary for its usability, stability, and reliability. The services, such as power factor correction and renewable energy arbitrage, are defined by duration, cycling occurrence, power, and market price. Storage technologies suitable to these applications, such as pumped hydro and batteries, are defined by their usable energy, power, efficiency, operating range, availability, lifetime, and cost.
In this article, grid services and storage technologies are examined using a range of metrics. Through a series of figures and discussions, the reader is provided with a method for comparing universal characteristics with regional/technology specific values. This provides a guiding strategy to help identify overlap between service needs and storage technology capabilities, so as to aid in the specification and selection of systems for present and future grid storage opportunities.

Abstract: Wind tunnel experiments have been conducted with a newly developed two-bladed Savonius-style wind turbine specifically meant for a small-scale energy conversion. This novel shape of the turbine blade is evolved from a series of experiments with different types of blades in the recent past. The developed two-bladed turbine is tested in an open type test section and its performance is assessed in terms of power and torque coefficients. Experiments have also been conducted with other standard blades such as semi-circular, semi-elliptic, Benesh and Bach types in order to have a direct comparison. In this study, all the reported experimental data are inclusive of wind tunnel blockage corrections. Further, the effects of Reynolds number on the dynamic and static characteristics are also discussed. The present investigation demonstrates a gain of 34.8% in maximum power coefficient with the newly developed two-bladed turbine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A previously validated quasi-one-dimensional transient two-phase heat transfer model is used to assess the effect of operational and design parameters on the performance of thermocline thermal energy storage (TES) based on a packed bed of rocks and high-temperature air from process heat as heat transfer fluid. The performance indicators are thermal losses, pumping work, discharge outflow temperature, and overall storage efficiency. A 7.2 GWh(th) TES unit is used as a baseline design. It is found that initial charging of the TES prior to cyclic operation significantly improves its performance at the expense of additional storage material. The temperature drop during the discharge phase is reduced and the efficiency is increased by decreasing the tank diameter-to-height ratio and the rock diameter at the expense of increased pressure drop and pumping work. Increasing the cone angle results in reduced storage size, but increases the temperature drop during discharging. It is shown that thin insulation layers are sufficient to ensure low thermal losses. For all investigated cases, the overall efficiency of the storage stays above 95%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimation and real-time performance are critical evaluation indexes for Li-ion battery management systems (BMS). High accuracy algorithms often take long program execution time (PET) in the resource-constrained embedded application systems, which will undoubtedly lead to the decrease of the time slots of other processes, thereby reduce the overall performance of BMS. Considering the resource optimization and the computational load balance, this paper proposes a multi-model switching SOC estimation method for Li-ion batteries. Four typical battery models are employed to build a close-loop SOC estimation system. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) method is employed to eliminate the effect of the current noise and improve the accuracy of SOC. The experiments under dynamic current conditions are conducted to verify the accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that accurate estimation results and reasonable PET can be obtained by the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the long run dynamics of economic growth and biomass consumption nexus by applying dynamic panel analyses for 51 Sub-Sahara African countries for 1980-2009 period. The results show that economic growth is affected by biomass consumption, openness and population significantly and positively in African countries. GDP elasticity with respect to biomass consumption is close to unity and the elasticities of GDP in terms of openness are found statistically significant (between 0.259 and 0.348). According to homogeneous variance structure, one percent increase in variables of biomass, openness and population will lead GDP to increase by 1.818%, 0.269% and 0.676%, respectively. However, according to estimations from heterogeneous variance structure indicate that one percent increase in biomass, openness and population variables will cause GDP to increase by 0.820%, 0.259% and 0.811%, respectively. In conclusion, this paper finds significant effect of biomass consumption on GDP in 51 Africa countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Micro-algae have been recognized as a promising feedstock for biofuel production. Effective combining microalgae cultivation with wastewater treatment can reduce CO2 emissions and the cost of microalgae biofuel production, making it more feasible. However, the biomass and lipid productivity must be improved prior to large-scale production. The paper is therefore giving a critical review on microalgae productivity towards biofuel production focusing on the influencing factors in terms of strains and cultivation condition. Based on this review, we recommend the mixed native algae species and employment of two-stage cultivation strategy as potential breakthrough toward sustainable and economic microalgae biofuel production using wastewater as a medium for cultivation.

Abstract: Photovoltaic applications are implemented on a large scale in buildings, with a view to reducing global warming sustainably, as well as to meet energy demand. Thousands of electricity generators have been installed in this process around the world. However, very few countries have technical regulations that enable the energy efficiency and yield to be optimised in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). On the other hand, all these normative should be a result of a serious study of the solar resource available in each region.
This paper proposes a methodology to establish technical standards in order to limit the losses due to shading and orientation of the constructed surface areas, where any country could be taken as benchmark. Colombia is also taken as a case study, by performing a comparative analysis for different cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Considerable research has been conducted on heat transfer enhancement of phase change materials (PCMs) in thermal energy storage systems. A new concept of a heat transfer enhancement technique for a tube-in-tank phase change thermal energy storage system, dynamic melting has been investigated through computational fluid dynamics analysis. This process involves forced recirculation of melted PCM during melting generated by heat transfer fluid. Dynamic melting was found to accelerate the melting process compared to natural convection. However, significant increases in heat transfer could only be achieved when the PCM flow rate was equal to or greater than the flow rate of the heat transfer fluid. Both parallel and counter flow for the PCM and the heat transfer fluid were analysed. The method represents a promising approach to heat transfer improvement in tube-in-tank PCM systems.

Abstract: Desalination has become imperative as a drinking water source for many parts of the world. Due to the large quantities of thermal energy and high quality electricity requirements for water purification, the desalination industry depends on waste heat resources and renewable energy sources such as solar collectors, photovoltaic arrays, geothermal and wind and tidal energy sources. Considering the mismatch between the source supply and demand and intermittent nature of these energy resources, energy storage is a must for reliable and continuous operation of desalination facilities. Thermal energy storage (TES) requires a suitable medium for storage and circulation while the photovoltaic/wind generated electricity needs to be stored in batteries for later use. Desalination technologies that utilize thermal energy and thus require storage for uninterrupted process operation are multi-stage flash distillation (MSF), multieffect evaporation (MED), low temperature desalination (LTD) and humidification-dehumidification (HD) and membrane distillation (MD). Energy accumulation, storage and supply are the key components of energy storage concept which improve process performance along with better resource economics, and minimum environmental impact. Similarly, the battery energy storage (BES) is essential to store electrical energy for electrodialysis (ED), reverse osmosis (RO) and mechanical vapor compression (MVC) technologies.
This research-review paper provides a critical review on current energy storage options for different desalination processes powered by various renewable energy and waste heat sources with focus on thermal energy storage and battery energy storage systems. Principles of energy storage (thermal and electrical energy) are discussed with details on the design, sizing, and economics for desalination process applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Hydrogenation technology is an important chemical upgrading process for low quality oil such as coal tar. Kinetic modeling for hydrogenation process remains a challenging task because of the large amount of compounds and complex reactions involved. Therefore, a new systematic methodology is proposed in this study to characterize mixture streams for the kinetic modeling of coal tar hydrogenation. The methodology incorporates both lumped method based on boiling point to represent feedstock and a carbon number-based component approach in the form of a structural matrix to characterize products at a molecular level. A mathematical transformation model is built for interrelating the bulk properties and molecular composition of products. A detailed kinetic model for coal tar hydrogenation is constructed based on the reaction pathway networks between lumped feedstock and carbon number-based molecular product. Detailed molecular compositions of the products are obtained from experiments to provide a basis for estimating the parameters of the kinetic model. The proposed method is verified by experiment results, which are consistent with predicted values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents the modeling and control for a novel Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system for wind turbines. The system captures excess power prior to electricity generation so that electrical components can be downsized for demand instead of supply. Energy is stored in a high pressure dual chamber liquid-compressed air storage vessel. It takes advantage of the power density of hydraulics and the energy density of pneumatics in the "open accumulator" architecture. A liquid piston air compressor/expander is utilized to achieve near-isothermal compression/expansion for efficient operation. A cycle-average approach is used to model the dynamics of each component in the combined wind turbine and storage system. Standard torque control is used to capture the maximum power from wind through a hydraulic pump attached to the turbine rotor in the nacelle. To achieve both accumulator pressure regulation and generator power tracking, a nonlinear controller is designed based on an energy based Lyapunov function. The nonlinear controller is then modified to distribute the control effort between the hydraulic and pneumatic elements based on their bandwidth capabilities. As a result, liquid piston air compressor/expander will loosely maintain the accumulator pressure ratio, while the down-tower hydraulic pump/motor precisely tracks the desired generator power. This control scheme also allows the accumulator to function as a damper for the storage system by absorbing power disturbances from the hydraulic path generated by the wind gusts. A set of simulation case studies demonstrate the operation of the combined system when the nonlinear controller is utilized and illustrates how this system can be used for load leveling, downsizing electrical system and maximizing revenues.

Abstract: Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Given the significant water-energy problems associated with many remote and arid areas of the planet, most studies, projects and developments of installations for the production of fresh water using desalination technologies powered by renewable energy sources have focussed on small-scale stand-alone systems. The most commonly used energy sources have been solar photovoltaic and wind and the most widely applied desalination technology that of reverse osmosis (RO). Most of the systems use batteries as a means of mass energy storage and the RO plants normally operate at constant pressure and flow rate. This paper presents a small-scale prototype SWRO (seawater reverse osmosis) desalination plant designed to continuously adapt its energy consumption to the variable power supplied by a wind turbine (WT), dispensing with mass energy storage in batteries and proposing the use of a supercapacitor bank as a dynamic regulation system. A description is given of the tests performed to date with the SWRO desalination plant connected to the conventional grid while controlling the number of pressure vessels that are connected/disconnected to/from the system and regulating their operating pressures and flow rates (within predetermined admissible limits) to maintain a constant permeate recovery rate and adapt the energy consumption of the plant to a widely varying simulated wind energy supply.
One of the most important conclusions that can be drawn from the studies undertaken is the feasibility of adapting the consumption of the prototype of the SWRO desalination plant to widely varying WT-generated power. Despite using various time interval lengths in which it was assumed that the WT output power remained constant, a perfect fit was not obtained between the theoretical WT-generated power and the power consumed by the SWRO desalination plant, nor was it possible to maintain a constant permeate recovery rate at each instant.

Abstract: The EBBSG (External Boiling Bayonet Steam Generator) system, proposed in previous publications, offers an alternative to the classical once-through high pressure steam generators. This system exploits the combination between the Loeffler external boiling scheme and the bayonet-tube steam generator and is expected to provide advantages in terms of safety while keeping good values of cycle performance and vessel size. The main disadvantages result in the increased size of the heat exchangers with respect to once-through steam boilers and in the need of steam blowers, as envisaged under the Loeffler scheme.
In the present paper, a new and more efficient system is proposed, in which the steam circulation is assured by steam-jet ejectors instead of blowers. The innovative solution, named SJ-EBBSG (Steam-Jet External Boiling Bayonet Steam Generator), is expected to provide several advantages with respect to the original scheme. In particular, the advantages envisage an increased global efficiency (+0.49% with respect to EBBSG) due to the lower power consumption of the auxiliaries and smaller size of the bayonet heat exchangers (-6.1% diameter, -7.3% length), other than increased safety and plant availability.
Throughout the article, the two steam generation solutions are compared and the advantages demonstrated by calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the coming years, Ireland will continue to face an increasing demand for wood biomass as a renewable source of energy. This will result in strained supply/demand scenarios, which will call for new planning and logistics systems capable of optimizing the efficient use of the biomass resources. In this study, a linear programming tool was developed which includes moisture content (MC) as a driving factor for the cost optimisation of two supply chains that use short wood and whole trees from thinnings as material feedstock. The tool was designed and implemented to analyse the impact of moisture content and truck configurations (5-axle and 6-axle trucks) on supply chain costs and spatial distribution of the supply materials. The results indicate that the inclusion of wood chips from whole trees reduces the costs of wood energy supply in comparison with only producing wood chips from short wood to satisfy the demand, with 9.8% and 10.2% cost rethiction when transported with 5-axle and 6-axle trucks respectively. Constraining the MC of the wood chips delivered to the power plant increases both transport and overall supply chain costs, due, firstly to an increase in the haulage distance and secondly, to the number of counties providing the biomass material. In terms of truck configuration, the use of 6-axle trucks resulted in a 14.8% reduction in the number of truckloads and a 12.3% reduction in haulage costs in comparison to the use of 5-axle trucks across the MC scenarios analysed.

Abstract: Energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in the performance and economy of electrified vehicles. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) combining both lithium-ion cells and supercapacitors is one of the most promising solutions. This paper discusses the optimal HESS dimensioning and energy management of a fuel cell hybrid electric bus. Three novel contributions are added to the relevant literature. First, efficient convex programming is used to simultaneously optimize the HESS dimension (including sizes of both the lithium-ion battery pack and the supercapacitor stack) and the power allocation between the HESS and the fuel cell system (FCS) of the hybrid bus. In the combined plant/ controller optimization problem, a dynamic battery State-of-Health (SOH) model is integrated to quantitatively examine the impact of the battery replacement strategy on both the HESS size and the bus economy. Second, the HESS and the battery-only ESS options are systematically compared in the proposed optimization framework. Finally, the battery-health-perceptive HESS optimization outcome is contrasted to the ideal one neglecting the battery degradation (assuming that the battery is durable over the bus service period without deliberate power regulation).

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wind energy development and increasing wind power penetration level, it will be a big challenge to operate the power system with high wind power penetration securely and reliably due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of wind power. With the flexible charging-discharging characteristics, Energy Storage System (ESS) is considered as an effective tool to enhance the flexibility and controllability not only of a specific wind farm, but also of the entire grid. This paper reviews the state of the art of the ESS technologies for wind power integration support from different aspects. Firstly, the modern ESS technologies and their potential applications for wind power integration support are introduced. Secondly, the planning problem in relation to the ESS application for wind power integration is reviewed, including the selection of the ESS type, and the optimal sizing and siting of the ESS. Finally, the proposed operation and control strategies of the ESS for different application purposes in relation to the wind power integration support are summarized. The conclusion is drawn in the end. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Since high temperature superconducting magnetic energy storage system (HT SMES) has attracted,significant attention for their fast response in milliseconds, high efficiency (cyclic efficiency over 95%) and unlimited times of charging and discharging cycles, it can be used for system stabilizing - damping out low frequency power oscillations. A voltage source converter (VSC) based HTS SMES has been optimal designed for achieving a high efficiency and has been constructed by China Electric Power Research Institute (CEPRI). This SMES can store the maximum energy, while for the first time used two states of art high temperature superconductors, YBCO and BSCCO tapes. It has been tested in a 110 kV transmission power system by a dynamic power fluctuation compensation experiment using three different controlling strategies in CEPRI. The experimental output powers with these three strategies are compared and the results show that the SMES can trace the power variation and provide the required power to restrain the power fluctuation in milliseconds successfully. Finally, the application planning of SMES with the equivalent capacity in a practical renewable power system at Zhangbei wind power test base is evaluated by a case study based on the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation. An optimal switch time of the SMES in wind power system is presented using the real transmission parameters of Zhangbei power grid. This study can provide a reference for the demonstration of large-scale SMES systems in renewable power system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: There is growing interest in using direct contact heat transfer in thermal storage with phase change materials (PCM). Previous research has predominantly focused on the heat transfer improvement mostly using liquid as the heat transfer fluid, with limited consideration for volume change and pumping losses both of which reduce the useful energy storage density of the system. An experimental investigation was undertaken using air as the heat transfer fluid and water as the PCM subject to freezing only. Unity heat exchange effectiveness was identified over the entire phase change process demonstrating the excellent heat transfer characteristics of this concept. A volume increase of 30% was measured with potential for significant reduction. Pumping losses were found to be significantly higher than expected, and should represent the primary focus of future research. If pumping losses can be reduced, gas based direct contact PCM storage can potentially achieve a higher useful storage density than conventional PCM systems which rely on a large heat exchange area.

Abstract: An investigation was conducted to examine the effects of key parameters such as intake temperature, equivalence ratio, engine load, intake pressure, spark timing and spring stiffness on the transition from SI combustion to HCCI combustion in a two-stroke free piston linear engine. Operation of the free piston engine was simulated based on the combination of three mathematical models including a dynamic model, a linear alternator model and a thermodynamic model. These mathematical models were combined and solved by a program written in Fortran. To validate the mathematical models, the simulation results were compared with experimental data in the SI mode. For the transition from SI combustion to HCCI combustion, the simulation results show that if the equivalence ratio is decreased, the intake temperature and engine load should be increased to get a successful SI-HCCI transition. However, the simulation results also show that the in-cylinder pressure is decreased, while the peak in-cylinder temperature in HCCI mode is increased significantly if the intake temperature is increased so much. Beside the successful SI-HCCI transition, the increase of intake pressure from P-in = 1.1 bar to P-in = 1.6 bar is one of solutions to reduce peak in-cylinder temperature in HCCI mode. However, the simulation results also indicate that if the intake pressure is increased so much (P-in = 1.6 bar), the engine knocking problem is occurred. Adjusting spring stiffness from k = 2.9 N/mm to k = 14.7 N/mm is also considered one of useful solutions for reducing the peak in-cylinder temperature in HCCI mode as well as avoiding engine knock. Besides, the change of spark timing is suggested as a benefic method to help the control of the SI-HCCI transition to be more convenient. To get a successful SI-HCCI transition with reducing of peak temperature in HCCI mode as well as avoiding engine knock, the simulation results show that the engine should be operated with following conditions: equivalence ratio phi = 0.7, engine load R-L = 180 Omega, intake temperature T-in = 400 K, intake pressure P-in = 1.2 bar, spark timing in SI mode x(ig) = 3 mm and spring stiffness k = 14.7 N/mm. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The thermal performance of building walls integrated with phase change materials (PCM) was evaluated in terms of heat flux reduction and heat transfer time delay. To fully melt and solidify over daily cycles, PCMs must be incorporated as thin layers placed longitudinally within the walls. The thin PCM layer was integrated into the wall via a thermal shield, whereby the PCM was contained in thin sealed polymer pouches, arranged in sheets laminated with aluminum foil on both sides. This system is herein referred to as "PCM thermal shield (PCMTS)". The optimal location of the PCMTS within the wall cavities is critical for heat transfer reduction and management. The thermal performance of south and west facing walls with and without PCMTS was evaluated experimentally using two identical test houses. The PCMTS was installed at various depths, one at a time, within the wall cavities. Each location depth was numbered from 1 to 5 starting at next to the wallboard surface facing the wall cavity (location 1) and proceeding to the exterior side of cavity at intervals of 1.27 cm. The results showed that the optimal location for a PCMTS in the south wall was location 3 (2.54 cm from the wallboard), while the optimal location for a PCMTS in the west wall was location 2 (1.27 cm from the wallboard). At these locations, the peak heat flux reductions were 51.3% and 29.7% for the south wall and the west wall, respectively. The maximum peak heat flux time delays were 6.3 h for location 1 in the south wall and 2.3 h for location 2 in the west wall. The maximum daily heat transfer reductions were 27.1% for location 3 in the south wall and 3.6% for location 5 in the west wall. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper proposes methodologies to estimate day-ahead quantity and quality of solar irradiance using the National Weather Service (NWS) sky cover forecast. The proposed methods use two parameters, the daily sky clearness index (K-D) for quantity and the daily probability of persistence (POP-K-D) for quality. FOP-K-D efficiently represents quality of daily solar irradiance. In addition, POP-K-D can be applicable to indicate that solar irradiance variability is within ramp rates of common generators in power systems at a certain photovoltaic (PV) penetration level. For model development, this paper splits up a direct estimation process from cloud forecast to solar irradiance into two stages: forecast verification and cloud-to-irradiance conversion. Verification of the sky cover forecast shows an overestimation bias of approximately 20% on days with a high irradiance level. Thus, the NWS sky cover forecast needs to be adjusted based on the type of day. This paper also proposes new equations that provide accurate conversion from cloud observation to surface solar irradiance. Finally, this paper proposes a method for estimating day-ahead POP-K-D and three methods for estimating day-ahead K-D based on the NWS sky cover forecast. The proposed methods incorporate different schemes for dealing with the bias discovered in the cloud forecast. Estimation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods at different irradiance levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work, the effect of the number of stages on the productivity of a multi-effect active solar still was experimentally investigated for the first time. Moreover, system performances in continuous and non-continuous modes were compared. For this purpose, indoor experiments were conducted on 4 similar solar still devices with different stages (1-4 stages) in order to accurately control the environmental conditions. In addition, water production was hourly measured during the whole 24-h experiment. The results show that with increased number of stages, distillate production can be predicted with a quadratic function. Moreover, adding a maximum of 6 and 10 additional stages can significantly increase production in continuous and non-continuous modes, respectively. It was also concluded that with more stages, the production enhancement is more in the continuous mode compared to the non-continuous mode, in a way that there is no significant difference between the performance of the single-stage device in continuous and non-continuous modes.

Abstract: Wind has been recognized as one of major realistic clean energy sources for power generation to meet the continuously increased energy demand and to achieve the carbon emission reduction targets. However, the utilisation of wind energy encounters an inevitable challenge resulting from the nature of wind intermittency. To address this, the paper presents the recent research work at Warwick on the feasibility study of a new hybrid system by integrating a wind turbine with compressed air energy storage. A mechanical transmission mechanism is designed and implemented for power integration within the hybrid system. A scroll expander is adopted to serve as an "air-machinery energy converter", which can transmit additional driving power generalized from the stored compressed air to the turbine shaft for smoothing the wind power fluctuation. A mathematical model for the complete hybrid process is developed and the control strategy is investigated for corresponding cooperative operations. A prototype test rig for implementing the proposed mechanism is built for proof of the concept. From the simulated and experimental studies, the energy conversion efficiency analysis is conducted while the system experiences different operation conditions and modes. It is proved that the proposed hybrid wind turbine system is feasible technically. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper the environmental performance of an advanced hybrid energy storage system, comprising high power and high energy lithium iron phosphate cells, is compared with a stand alone battery concept composed of lithium manganese oxide cells. The methodology used to analyse the environmental impacts is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The manufacturing, use phase and end-of-life of the battery packs are assessed for twelve impact categories. The functional unit is 1 km driven under European average conditions. The present study assesses the environmental performance of the two battery packs for two scenarios: scenario 1 with a vehicle total drive range of 150,000 km and scenario 2 with total driving range of the car of 300,000 km. The results of scenario 1 show that the increased efficiency of the hybrid system reduces, in general, the environmental impact during the use stage, although the manufacturing stage has higher impact than the benchmark. Scenario 2 shows how the extended lifetime of the hybrid system benefits the emissions per km driven. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In the present study, PVdF-co-HFP copolymer and its sulfonated derivatives have been analyzed as polymer electrolyte membrane in single chamber MFCs. The sulfonation of PVdF-co-HFP copolymer was performed by treating with chlorosulfonic acid for 5, 7 and 9 h, resulting in 23%, 30%, and 18% of degree of sulfonation (DS) in the respective SP-5, SP-7, and SP-9 membranes. On observing the membranes under field emission scanning electron microscope fitted with EDAX, porosity was found to be increasing with increase in the duration of sulfonation except for 9 h duration. The elemental analysis of the membranes indicated the presence of higher sulfur and oxygen content with the increasing sulfonation duration except for 9 h duration, for which crosslinks were formed via sulfone linkages. The membranes were characterized for their ion exchange capacity (IEC) and proton conductivity; IEC value of 0.21 meq g(-1) 0.42 meq g(-1), and 0.12 meq g(-1) and proton conductivity of 0.0012 S cm(-1), 0.00363 S cm(-1), and 0.0006 S cm(-1) were observed for SP-5, SP-7, and SP-9 membranes. Open air cathode MFCs with membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) containing sulfonated and non-sulfonated PVdF-co-HFP membranes have been analyzed for their overall MFC performance. It was observed that amongst these membranes, MFC with SP-7 membrane showed the maximum power and current density of 290.176 +/- 15 mW m(-2) and 1390.866 +/- 70 mA m(-2) with an overall similar to 89% COD removal in 28 days operation, using electrogenic mixed firmicute consortium. In overall, the study illustrates the impression of sulfonated PVdF-co-HFP membranes as PEM and its application in MFC for harvesting bio-energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Energy storage is an important technology for balancing a low carbon power network. Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES) is a class of thermo-electric energy storage that utilises a tank of liquid air as the energy storage media. The device is charged using an air liquefier and energy is recovered through a Rankine cycle using the stored liquid air as the working fluid. The cycle efficiency is greatly improved through the storage and recycling of thermal energy released during discharge and used to reduce the work required to liquefy air during charging. Analysis and results from the design and testing of novel LAES concept at pilot scale are presented. Fundamental analysis of the LAES cycle is first described to determine the theoretical cycle performance and in particular the value of cold recycle. The pilot plant is then described together with the results of a series of comprehensive technical and commercial trials. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future potential of LAES in particular the fit with the requirements for bulk energy storage and the transition of the LASS technology from pilot to commercial scale.

Abstract: Increasing interest in low carbon electro-thermal heating technologies, such as electric heat pumps and combined heat and power units, may in the near future significantly change the character of domestic electricity and gas demand profiles. To understand the impact of adoption of such technologies it is necessary to appreciate fully the multi-energy aspects of such technologies, and indeed of any other domestic energy service demands. Such holistic treatment is necessary to fully capture the effects of coincidence in various energy service demands within and across dwellings. To that end this paper introduces and details a high resolution domestic multi-energy model comprised of physically based space heating, domestic hot water (DHW), cooking and electrical appliance models. Given the potential for thermal storage in the heating system and building elements particular attention is given to the space heating model, which includes building, heat emitter, buffer tank and heating unit models, capturing the relevant inter-temporal dependencies, heat transfer rates and system inertia. The power and interest of the presented model is demonstrated through exploration of a selection of various possible applications, including amongst others: effect of input energy/heating technology substitution on consumption profiles of different energy vectors, effect of thermal inertia, and investigation of dwelling diversity. Additionally the importance of high granularity modelling is demonstrated. The presented model can be utilised by many actors involved in energy systems for various purposes. For example electricity distribution network operators for modelling of network peak demand, demand aggregators for estimation of potential demand side flexibility, government agencies for assessing incentive scheme costs, electricity retailers for understanding the impact of electro-thermal technology adoption upon their demand portfolio or potential heat network operators for understanding the demand for heat in an area.

Abstract: Heat demand in a district heating system can have a significant variation within 1 day, which produces problematic conditions for efficient heat generation. Short-term thermal energy storage can decrease this daily variation and make the conditions for generating heat more favorable. By periodically overheating and underheating buildings, causing small variations in indoor temperature, building thermal inertia can be utilized for thermal energy storage. This study presents the results from a pilot test where the potential to function as thermal energy storage was tested for five multifamily residential buildings in Gothenburg, Sweden. The signals from the outdoor temperature sensors were adjusted in different cycles during a total of 52 weeks. The delivered heat and indoor temperature were measured during the test. The results indicate that heavy buildings, with a structural core of concrete, can tolerate relatively large variations in heat deliveries while still maintaining a good indoor climate. The study also demonstrated that a fixed time constant is not accurate enough to describe the variations in indoor temperature caused by the utilization of the buildings as short-term thermal energy storage. Degree hours is instead proposed as a simple yet adequate measurement for the thermal energy storage capacity in buildings. Storing 0.1 kW h/m(floor)(2) area of heat will very rarely cause variations in indoor temperature larger than +/- 0.5 degrees C in a heavy building. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents the use of a Support Vector Machine load predictive energy management system to control the energy flow between a solar energy source, a supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage combination and the load. The supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage system is deployed in a solar energy system to improve the reliability of delivered power. The combination of batteries and supercapacitors makes use of complementary characteristic that allow the overlapping of a battery's high energy density with a supercapacitors' high power density. This hybrid system produces a straightforward benefit over either individual system, by taking advantage of each characteristic. When the supercapacitor caters for the instantaneous peak power which prolongs the battery lifespan, it also minimizes the system cost and ensures a greener system by reducing the number of batteries. The resulting performance is highly dependent on the energy controls implemented in the system to exploit the strengths of the energy storage devices and minimize its weaknesses. It is crucial to use energy from the supercapacitor and therefore minimize jeopardizing the power system reliability especially when there is a sudden peak power demand. This study has been divided into two stages. The first stage is to obtain the optimum SVM load prediction model, and the second stage carries out the performance comparison of the proposed SVM-load predictive energy management system with conventional sequential programming control (if-else condition). An optimized load prediction classification model is investigated and implemented. This C-Support Vector Classification yields classification accuracy of 100% using 17 support vectors in 0.004866 s of training time. The Polynomial kernel is the optimum kernel in our experiments where the C and g values are 2 and 0.25 respectively. However, for the load profile regression model which was implemented in the K-step ahead of load prediction, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel was chosen due to the highest squared correlation coefficient and the lowest mean squared error. Results obtained shows that the proposed SVM load predictive energy management system accurately identifies and predicts the load demand. This has been justified by the supercapacitor charging and leading the peak current demand by 200 ms for different load profiles with different optimized regression models. This methodology optimizes the cost of the system by reducing the amount of power electronics within the hybrid energy storage system, and also prolongs the batteries' lifespan as previously mentioned.

Abstract: The supply security of fossil fuels is one of the most important policy issues in South Korea. This is because of South Korea's economic condition, geopolitical status, and lack of energy resources. This study investigates the Korean public's perceptions of the supply security of fossil fuels using the contingent valuation method. It derives the Korean public's willingness to pay (WTP) for policy measures that enhance the supply security of fossil fuels, such as overseas energy development and strategic reserves. It also compares the WTP in terms of an increase in taxes on gasoline or diesel with the WTP in terms of an increase in the tax on electricity. The results demonstrate that the WTP will increase if the Korean public's understanding of the importance of policy measures that boost the supply security of fossil fuels as well as the role of government in implementing these measures are enhanced. The comparison of the WTP shows that the Korean public will be less against an increase in the tax on electricity than an increase in the tax on gasoline or diesel. This is so even though the WTP amount for a tax increase on electricity is smaller than that for a tax increase on gasoline or diesel. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A biofuel micro trigeneration prototype has been developed to utilise local energy crop oils as fuel in rural areas and developing countries. Straight plant oils (SPOs) only leave behind very little carbon footprint during its simply production process compared to commercial biodiesels in refineries, but the high viscosity of SPOs causes difficulties at engine cold starts, which further results in poor fuel atomisation, compromised engine performance and fast engine deterioration. In this study, a phase change material (PCM) thermal storage is designed to recover and store engine exhaust heat to preheat SPOs at cold starts. High temperature commercial paraffin is selected as the PCM to meet the optimal preheating temperature range of 70-90 degrees C, in terms of the SPO property study. A numerical model of the PCM thermal storage is developed and validated by references. The PCM melting and solidification processes with the consideration of natural convection in liquid zone are simulated in ANSYS-FLUENT to verify the feasibility of the PCM thermal storage as a part of the self-contained biofuel micro trigeneration prototype.

Abstract: The development of distributed generation (DG) has brought new challenges to power networks. One of them that catches extensive attention is the voltage regulation problem of distribution networks caused by DG. Optimal allocation of DG in distribution networks is another well-known problem being widely investigated. This paper proposes a new method for the optimal allocation of photovoltaic distributed generation (PV-DG) considering the non-dispatchable characteristics of PV units. An adaptive reactive power control model is introduced in PV-DG allocation as to balance the trade-off between the improvement of voltage quality and the minimization of power loss in a distribution network integrated with PV-DG units. The optimal allocation problem is formulated as a chance-constrained stochastic programming (CCSP) model for dealing with the randomness of solar power energy. A novel algorithm combining the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) with support vector machines (SVM) is proposed to find the Pareto front consisting of a set of possible solutions. The Pareto solutions are further evaluated using the weighted rank sum ratio (WRSR) method to help the decision-maker obtain the desired solution. Simulation results on a 33-bus radial distribution system show that the optimal allocation method can fully take into account the time-variant characteristics and probability distribution of PV-DG, and obtain the best allocation scheme.

Abstract: A sort of new microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCM) based on paraffin wax core and poly (methyl methacrylate-co-methyl acrylate) shell with nano alumina (nano-Al2O3) inlay was synthesized through emulsion polymerization. Various techniques were used to characterize the as-prepared products so as to investigate the effect of nano-Al2O3 on morphology and thermal performance, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermal conductivity measurement. The results showed that the products achieved the best performance with 16% (monomer mass) nano-Al2O3 added under the optimal preparation conditions. The DSC results indicated that the phase change temperature of the composite exhibited appropriate phase change temperature and achieved high encapsulation efficiency. The thermal conductivity of the paraffin microcapsules is also significantly improved owing to the presence of high thermal conductive nano-Al2O3. This synthetic technique can be a perspective way to prepare the MEPCM with enhanced thermal transfer and phase change properties for potential applications to energy-saving building materials.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) and distributed generation technologies, such as combined heat and power (CHP) or photovoltaics (PV), can be used to reduce energy costs and decrease CO2 emissions from buildings by shifting energy consumption to times with less emissions and/or lower energy prices. To determine the feasibility of investing in TES in combination with other distributed energy resources (DER), mixed integer linear programming (MILP) can be used. Such a MILP model is the well-established Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM); however, it currently uses only a simplified TES model to guarantee linearity and short run-times. Loss calculations are based only on the energy contained in the storage. This paper presents a new DER-CAM TES model that allows improved tracking of losses based on ambient and storage temperatures, and compares results with the previous version. A multi-layer TES model is introduced that retains linearity and avoids creating an endogenous optimization problem. The improved model increases the accuracy of the estimated storage losses and enables use of heat pumps for low temperature storage charging. Results indicate that the previous model overestimates the attractiveness of TES investments for cases without possibility to invest in heat pumps and underestimates it for some locations when heat pumps are allowed. Despite a variation in optimal technology selection between the two models, the objective function value stays quite stable, illustrating the complexity of optimal DER sizing problems in buildings and microgrids.

Abstract: In this paper we study the spatial and temporal distribution of the wind and hydro resources, together with electricity demand and prices, with the objective to gain insights on the trade-offs of developing wind power in different parts of the country. It is particularly important to understand the impacts of a high penetration level of wind power on an electricity market that is already highly influenced by seasonal hydro power availability. The correlation between the seasonal patterns of wind, hydro, demand and prices has received little attention in the literature. In our approach, we separate daily deviations from the expected seasonal value, and show that for some locations it is the anomalies that have a more significant correlation with electricity prices than the seasonal patterns themselves. This indicates that the correlation results for anomalies from different wind sites can give valuable information on wind resource availability in critical periods of the year, such as dry seasons, and thereby enables identifying sites that can most optimally balance price volatility during these periods while potentially also maximising profits to investors. Even though the numerical results pertain to New Zealand, our methodology is applicable to any electricity system that utilises wind and hydro resources such as Chile, Colombia and several North American and Northern European jurisdictions.

Abstract: Demand for electricity in China kept accelerating in recent years; moreover, there exist serious mismatches among the distribution of power demand, energy resources, and power generation infrastructure across different regions in China, both of which indicate a necessity of a holistic and integrated approach to the strategic planning and development of its power industry. Material benefits could be realized by ensuring that the long term development of the power system is optimized by taking into consideration the different regional dynamics and characteristics. This paper proposes a multi-region optimization model that can deliver insights into how planning of the long term development of China's power sector could minimize the total cost of China's power sector by considering regional variations in availabilities of resources and inter-region power transmission line capacity. A case study considered how investment decisions to expand and alter the existing generation mix could be optimized across a timeframe from 2011 to 2050. By comparing results between single and multi-region optimizations, it was possible to show the likely impact on how investment decisions would differ when regional differences were taken into account. The multi-region optimization arguably better reflects and considers conditions and challenges in the real world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study applies an efficient optimization technique based on a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) technique to determine the optimal design and engineering of a potential geothermal production operation at a prospect near Superstition Mountain in Southern California, USA. The faster MARS-based statistical model is used as a surrogate for higher-fidelity physical models within the intensive optimization process. Its use allows for the exploration of the impacts of specific engineering design parameters in the context of geologic uncertainty as a means to both understand and maximize profitability of the production operation. The MARS model is initially developed from a training dataset generated by a finite set of computationally complex hydrothermal models applied to the prospect. Its application reveals that the optimal engineering design variables can differ considerably assuming different choices of hydrothermal flow properties, which, in turn, indicates the importance of reducing the uncertainty of key geologic properties. The major uncertainty sources in the natural-system are identified and ranked first by an efficient MARS-enabled total order sensitivity quantification, which is then used to assist evaluating the effect of geological uncertainties on optimized results. At the Southern California prospect, this parameter sensitivity analysis suggests that groundwater circulation through high permeable structures, rather than heat conduction through impermeable granite, is the primary heat transfer method during geothermal extraction. Reservoir histories simulated using optimal parameters with different constraints are analyzed and compared to investigate the longevity and maximum profit of the geothermal resources. The comparison shows that the longevity and profit are very likely to be overestimated by optimizations without appropriate constraints on natural conditions. In addition to geothermal energy production, this optimization approach can also be used to manage other geologic resource operations, such as hydrocarbon production or CO2 sequestration, under uncertain reservoir conditions.

For target grid planning, it is essential to identify and quantify this impact in terms of local infrastructure overloads. We study the impact of EV charging loads on Swiss distribution substations under different penetration levels and pricing regimes. Unlike mainly conceptual studies focusing on generic distribution grids, we use real data driving profiles matched to regional circumstances, Swiss substation capacity and load data in the high-voltage grid together with electricity prices as the main data inputs. To reflect current regulation and contracting schemes, we apply decentral decision-making instead of central control. The results indicate that under a flat electricity tariff and EV penetration levels around 16% the current substation capacity will be sufficient to cover additional EV charging load. However, beyond penetration levels of 50% an increasing number of substations will be overloaded. More significantly, the introduction of dynamic electricity prices can further increase the risk of substation overloads. These results show that EV charging loads can also cause bottlenecks on substations in the high-voltage grid. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In a modern greenhouse there are a number of alternative systems that can be deployed to control the climate, and the choice what to use and when is not easy for the grower. A novel management system is proposed, consisting of an energy input minimizing module, and a module to realise the determined input with the available equipment. The current paper describes the energy minimization part.
A dynamic optimization tool based on optimal control theory was used to obtain time trajectories of the energy flux that minimizes total external energy input over the year, while maintaining greenhouse air temperature and humidity between grower defined bounds. By giving the grower the lead in defining the bounds, the method stays as closely as possible to the grower's daily practice and experience, and no crop production models and market prices are needed. The underlying dynamic model of temperature and humidity, based on known physical principles and parameters, compared very well with unique, year round high frequent data from a commercial rose greenhouse. A relatively simple crop transpiration model was validated separately, with very good results.
It was shown that over twelve selected days, distributed over the entire year, the energy saving potential as compared to the actual grower's practice is substantial. This potential was related to the definition of lower and upper bounds, less natural ventilation at colder days, and more natural ventilation and less heating at warmer days. The prominent role of the bounds was clearly demonstrated. Relaxing the temperature and humidity bounds decreases the energy input to the greenhouse. While this is obvious, the quantification of the effect as demonstrated here is of great interest to growers, and is essential for the development of the second part of the system.

Abstract: Wood ash, which is recognized as an environmental pollutant, is tried as a new material for CO2 capture in this work. Five wood ash samples obtained from different raw materials were chosen, and an experimental demonstration of the CO2 capture performances of these wood ash samples was present in detail in a modified fixed bed reactor system. The CO2 capture and the sorbent regeneration performances of wood ash were investigated under different conditions by changing the temperature, H2O concentration, gas flow rate and the heating rate. The CO2 capture capacities are in the range of 0.35-0.54 mmol CO2/g for different wood ash samples under the condition of 60 degrees C, 10% CO2 + 12% H2O. The CO2 capture processes contain two parts for these samples. One is the physical adsorption process, and another is the chemical reaction of K2CO3 with CO2 and H2O to form KHCO3, K2CO3.1.5H(2)O and K4H2(CO3)(3).1.5H(2)O The desired wood ash is proved to be regenerable and stable during 10-cycle CO2 sorption-desorption tests. The deactivation model and the Avrami-Erofeyev model are adopted to evaluate the CO2 sorption and desorption kinetics of this sample respectively. Considering the low cost, and the recycling of environmental pollutants, wood ash is a nice choice for CO2 capture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
