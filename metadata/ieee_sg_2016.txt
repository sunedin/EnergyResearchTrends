Abstract: In this paper, proper scheduling of the operation of multiple storage devices is sought so as to minimize the expected total cost (of conventional generation) in a power network with intermittent renewable generation. Since the power network constraints make it intractable to compute optimal storage operation policies through dynamic programming-based approaches, a Lyapunov optimization-based online algorithm (LOPN) is proposed, which makes decisions based only on the current state of the system (i.e., the current demand and renewable generation). The proposed algorithm is computationally simple and achieves asymptotic optimality (as the capacity of energy storage grows large). To improve the performance of the LOPN algorithm for the case with limited storage capacity, a threshold-based energy storage management (TESM) algorithm is proposed that utilizes the forecast information (on demand and renewable generation) over the next few time slots to make storage operation decisions. Numerical experiments are conducted on IEEE 6- and 9-bus test systems to validate the asymptotic optimality of LOPN, and compare the performance of LOPN and TESM. Numerical results show that TESM significantly outperforms LOPN when the storage capacity is relatively small.

Abstract: A major challenge to implementing residential demand response is that of aligning the objectives of many households, each of which aims to minimize its payments and maximize its comfort level, while balancing this with the objectives of an aggregator that aims to minimize the cost of electricity purchased in a pooled wholesale market. This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of households with a mixture of discrete and continuous energy levels. A distinctive feature of the method in this paper is that the non-convex demand response (DR) problem is decomposed in terms of households as opposed to devices, which allows incorporating more intricate couplings between energy storage devices, appliances, and distributed energy resources. The proposed method is a fast distributed algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The method is tested on systems with up to 2560 households, each with 10 devices on average. The proposed algorithm is designed to terminate in 60 iterations irrespective of system size, which can be ideal for an on-line version of this problem. Moreover, numerical results show that with minimal parameter tuning, the algorithm exhibits a very similar convergence behavior throughout the studied systems and converges to near-optimal solutions, which corroborates its scalability.

Abstract: This paper gives a comprehensive discussion on applying the cloud computing technology as the new information infrastructure for the next-generation power system. First, this paper analyzes the main requirements of the future power grid on the information infrastructure and the limitations of the current information infrastructure. Based on this, a layered cloud-based information infrastructure model for next-generation power grid is proposed. Thus, this paper discussed how different categories of the power applications can benefit from the cloud-based information infrastructure. For the demonstration purpose, this paper develops three specific cloud-enabled power applications. The first two applications demonstrate how to develop practical compute-intensive and data-intensive power applications by utilizing different layered services provided by the state-of-the-art public cloud computing platforms. In the third application, we propose a cloud-based collaborative direct load control framework in a smart grid and show the merits of the cloud-based information infrastructure on it. Some cybersecurity considerations and the challenges and limitations of the cloud-based information infrastructure are also discussed.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for contingency management using smart loads, which are realized through the emerging paradigm of the Internet of things. The framework involves the system operator, the load serving entities (LSEs), and the end-users with smart home management systems that automatically control adjustable loads. The system operator uses an efficient linear equation solver to quickly calculate the load curtailment needed at each bus to relieve congested lines after a contingency. Given this curtailment request, an LSE calculates a power allowance for each of its end-use customers to maximize the aggregate user utility. This large-scale NP-hard problem is approximated to a convex optimization for efficient computation. A smart home management system determines the appliances allowed to be used in order to maximize the user's utility within the power allowance given by the LSE. Since the user's utility depends on the near-future usage of the appliances, the framework provides the Welch-based reactive appliance prediction (WRAP) algorithm to predict the user behavior and maximize utility. The proposed framework is validated using the New England 39-bus test system. The results show that power system components at risk can be quickly alleviated by adjusting a large number of small smart loads. Additionally, WRAP accurately predicts the users' future behavior, minimizing the impact on the aggregate users' utility.

Abstract: Many critical infrastructures are interdependent networks in which the behavior of one network impacts those of the others. Despite the fact that interdependencies are essential for the operation of critical infrastructures, such interdependencies can negatively affect the reliability and fuel the cascade of failures within and across the networks. In this paper, a novel interdependent Markov-chain framework is proposed that enables capturing interdependencies between two critical infrastructures with the ultimate goal of predicting their resilience to cascading failures and characterizing the effects of interdependencies on system reliability. The framework is sufficiently general to model cascading failures in any interdependent networks; however, this paper focuses on the electric-cyber infrastructure as an example. Using this framework it is shown that interdependencies among reliable systems, i.e., systems with exponentially distributed failure sizes, can make the individually reliable systems behave unreliably as a whole with power-law failure-size distributions.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) can be considered as flexible mobile battery storages in microgrids. For multiple microgrids in an area, coordinated scheduling on charging and discharging are required to avoid power exchange spikes between the multi-microgrid system and the main grid. In this paper, a two-stage integrated energy exchange scheduling strategy for multimicrogrid system is presented, which considers EVs as storage devices. Then, several dual variables, which are representative of the marginal cost of proper constraints, are utilized to form an updated price, thereby being a modification on the original electricity price. With this updated price signal, a price-based decentralized scheduling strategy is presented for the microgrid central controller. Simulation results show that the two-stage scheduling strategy reduces the electricity cost and avoids frequent transitions between battery charging/discharging states. With the proposed decentralized scheduling strategy, each microgrid only needs to solve its local problem and limits the total power exchange within the safe range.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transport and heating will introduce uncertain smart appliance growth in the power system, which fundamentally challenges traditional network pricing. In this paper, a new long-term distribution network charging is proposed to accommodate uncertain load growth. Instead of using fixed a load growth rate (LGR), it adopts a fuzzy model, developed based on a set of projected deterministic LGRs and confidence levels. This fuzzy model is incorporated into the pricing model through a-cut intervals. In order to improve computational efficiency, an analytical pricing approach is introduced. The vertex extension approach is used to build charge membership functions. Thereafter, a common defuzzification approach, center of gravity, is employed to defuzzify membership functions in order to generate deterministic charges. The new approach is benchmarked with two existing standard charging methods on a practical U.K. high-voltage distribution system. Results show that it is effective in capturing the uncertainty in load growth.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problems of load scheduling and power trading in systems with high penetration of renewable energy resources (RERs). We adopt approximate dynamic programming to schedule the operation of different types of appliances including must-run and controllable appliances. We assume that users can sell their excess power generation to other users or to the utility company. Since it is more profitable for users to trade energy with other users locally, users with excess generation compete with each other to sell their respective extra power to their neighbors. A game theoretic approach is adopted to model the interaction between users with excess generation. In our system model, each user aims to obtain a larger share of the market and to maximize its revenue by appropriately selecting its offered price and generation. In addition to yielding a higher revenue, consuming the excess generation locally reduces the reverse power flow, which impacts the stability of the system. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the energy expenses of the users. The proposed algorithm also facilitates the utilization of RERs by encouraging users to consume excess generation locally rather than injecting it back into the power grid.

Abstract: A parametric controller is proposed for transient stability of synchronous generators after the occurrence of a disturbance in the power grid. The proposed controller based on feedback linearization control theory relies on receiving timely phasor measurement unit (PMU) information from selected parts of the power grid to employ fast acting flywheels that are situated near synchronous generators. The local storage devices aim to balance a swing equation model of the synchronous generator to drive the associated rotor speed to stability. The advantages of the proposed controller include that it is tunable and integrates well with existing governor controls in contrast to other forms of PMU-based control. Further, a comparison is drawn between the proposed controller and recently proposed nonlinear controllers for transient stabilization. Numerical results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller when applied to the 39-bus 10-generator New England power system.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the impact of cyber attacks on voltage regulation in distribution systems when a number of photovoltaic (PV) systems are connected. We employ a centralized control scheme that utilizes voltage measurements from sectionizing switches equipped with sensors. It is demonstrated that if measurements are falsified by an attacker, voltage violation can occur in the system. However, by equipping the control with a detection algorithm, we verify that the damage can be limited especially when the number of attacked sensors is small through theoretical analysis and simulation case studies. In addition, studies are made on attacks which attempt to reduce the output power at PV systems equipped with overvoltage protection functions. Further discussion is provided on how to enhance the security level of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Monitoring critical infrastructures is highly dependent on the accuracy of the installed sensors and the robustness of estimation algorithms. Data-injection attacks can degrade the operational reliability and security of any cyber-physical infrastructures. An attacker can compromise the integrity of the monitoring algorithms by hijacking a subset of sensor measurements and sending manipulated readings. Such approach can result in wide-area blackouts in power grids. This paper considers several cases of severe data-injections with high probabilities of information loss. To achieve an accurate supervision, a Bayesian-based approximated filter (BAF) has been proposed at each monitoring node using a distributed architecture. To maintain a reduced communication overhead and time complexity, upper and lower bound methods have been developed. The performance of the proposed technique has been demonstrated in a mature synchrophasor application known as the oscillation detection. Two test cases have been generated to examine the immunity of the proposed estimation scheme in New Zealand and Oman power grids. The tests were conducted in the presence of harsh data-injection attacks and multiple system disturbances. Results show the proposed BAF method can accurately extract the oscillatory parameters from the contaminated measurements.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a suite of asynchronous distributed optimization algorithms for wide-area oscillation estimation in power systems using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). We first pose the estimation problem as a real-time, iterative, and distributed consensus problem. Thereafter, we consider a probabilistic traffic model for modeling delays in any typical wide-area communication network, and study how the delays enter the process of information exchange between distributed phasor data concentrators that are employed to execute this consensus algorithm in a coordinated fashion. Finally, we propose four different strategies by which the convergence rate and accuracy of this consensus algorithm can be made immune to the asynchrony resulting from the network traffic. We carry out extensive simulations to show possible numerical instabilities and sensitivities of the ADMM convergence on our proposed strategies. Our results exhibit a broad view of how the convergence of any distributed estimation algorithm in a generic cyber-physical system depends strongly on the uncertainties of the underlying communication models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of algorithms to determine the active- and reactive-power setpoints for photovoltaic (PV) inverters in distribution networks. The objective is to optimize the operation of the distribution feeder according to a variety of performance objectives and ensure voltage regulation. In general, these algorithms take a form of the widely studied ac optimal power flow (OPF) problem. For the envisioned application domain, nonlinear power-flow constraints render pertinent OPF problems nonconvex and computationally intensive for large systems. To address these concerns, we formulate a quadratic constrained quadratic program (QCQP) by leveraging a linear approximation of the algebraic power-flow equations. Furthermore, simplification from QCQP to a linearly constrained quadratic program is provided under certain conditions. The merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated with simulation results that utilize realistic PV-generation and load-profile data for illustrative distribution-system test feeders.

Abstract: This paper focuses on developing an interdisciplinary mechanism that combines machine learning, optimization, and data structure design to build a demand response and home energy management system that can meet the needs of real-life conditions. The loads of major home appliances are divided into three categories: 1) containing fixed loads; 2) regulate-able loads; and 3) deferrable loads, based on which a decoupled demand response mechanism is proposed for optimal energy management of the three categories of loads. A learning-based demand response strategy is developed for regulateable loads with a special focus on home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVACs). This paper presents how a learning system should be designed to learn the energy consumption model of HVACs, how to integrate the learning mechanism with optimization techniques to generate optimal demand response policies, and how a data structure should be designed to store and capture current home appliance behaviors properly. This paper investigates how the integrative and learning-based home energy management system behaves in a demand response framework. Case studies are conducted through an integrative simulation approach that combines a home energy simulator and MATLAB together for demand response evaluation.

Abstract: This paper studies frequency regulation of power systems by using both automatic generation control (AGC) and load-side control. A switched distributed controller is designed for each load bus in a transmission network. The targets of the designed controller are twofold. First, it makes controllable loads work together with generators to restore the system frequency quickly after a real power mismatch occurs in the grid. Second, it restores controllable loads to their nominal working conditions. To achieve the first target, a consensus-based distributed load-side controller is designed. Peer-to-peer communication between loads is used to achieve an average consensus according to which controllable load reacts to the frequency deviation. To achieve the second target, the load-side controller shifts its duties to AGC slowly after the frequency goes back into an ideal region, and hence, controllable loads will restore to their nominal conditions gradually. A switching signal is designed to detect time instants when the load-side controller should work in the mode of frequency restoration or in the mode of load restoration.

Abstract: Domestic energy usage patterns can be reduced to a series of classifications for power system analysis or operational purposes, generalizing household behavior into particular load profiles without noise induced variability. However, with AMI data transmissions over wireless networks becoming more commonplace data losses can inhibit classification negating the benefits to the operation of the power system as a whole. Here, an approach allowing incomplete load profiles to be classified while maintaining less than a 10% classification error with up to 20% of the data missing is presented.

Abstract: Distributed generation is increasingly being integrated into distribution networks worldwide, presenting new challenges for network operators and planners. In particular, the introduction of photovoltaic (PV) generation at the low voltage (LV) level has highlighted the ongoing need for more extensive and detailed modeling to quantify the full extent and nature of potential impacts. While a number of approaches have been developed to address the size of this problem, the most accurate and comprehensive approach is to carry out simulations for the entire network across multiple scenarios. However, this task is computationally complex and requires significant amounts of data. To address this challenge, this paper presents a simplified and computationally efficient methodology based around a two-bus equivalent model, which may be used to estimate the maximum voltage in an LV area due to PV generation over time. The developed model is validated against a full three-phase power flow approach for a real-world distribution network comprising 10 213 LV network areas. Furthermore, to highlight its utility, the model is used in a case study examining the effectiveness of reactive power injection for mitigating overvoltage due to PV generation.

Abstract: This paper studies the physical consequences of a class of unobservable state-and-topology cyber-physical attacks in which both state and topology data for a sub-network of the network are changed by an attacker to mask a physical attack. The problem is formulated as a two-stage optimization problem, which aims to cause overload in a line of the network with limited attack resources. It is shown that unobservable state-and-topology cyber-physical attacks as studied in this paper can make the system operation more vulnerable to line outages and failures.

Abstract: Based on the current practice of charging peak demand, an expectation-oriented stochastic model is established for the demand contracting decision of electricity users. The resultant optimization problem is proved to be nonlinear but convex. Thus, the first-order optimality condition of the proposed model, which leads to an integral equation founded on the probability density function of the peak load, is used to derive the optimal contracting strategy for consumers. Simulation results support the convexity of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the proposed solution method under different demand charging rules and different consumption patterns of customers.

Abstract: Severe peak rebounds are likely in absence of a system-wide coordination among customers participating in demand response programs. This paper aims to establish a decentralized system-wide framework to coordinate demand response of residential customers in a smart grid. The objective of the framework is to modify system load profile provided that customers' payments are minimized, and their comfort and privacy are preserved. Home load management (HLM) modules, embedded in customers' smart meters are autonomous agents of the framework. The energy service provider iteratively exchanges load information with HLM modules in the hope of achieving his desired load profile. In each iteration, the service provider announces system load profile to HLM modules. The modules, keeping in mind their own financial and comfort constraints, nonsequentially send back load reschedule proposals to modify system load profile. The received proposals are judged whether they improve system load profile or not. HLM modules with accepted proposals apply their proposed schedules. The modified system load profile is then released, and HLM modules' new proposals are gathered and judged. This procedure is repeated to the point at which no further improvement in the system load profile can be experienced. Performance of the framework is shown by applying it to a system with 50 customers.

Abstract: The assessment of voltage stability margins is a promising direction for wide-area monitoring systems. Accurate monitoring architectures for long-term voltage instability are typically centralized and lack scalability, while completely decentralized approaches relying on local measurements tend toward inaccuracy. Here we present distributed linear algorithms for the online computation of voltage collapse sensitivity indices. The computations are collectively performed by processors embedded at each bus in the smart grid, using synchronized phasor measurements and communication of voltage phasors between neighboring buses. Our algorithms provably converge to the proper index values as would be calculated using centralized information, but do not require any central decision maker for coordination. Modifications of the algorithms to account for generator reactive power limits are discussed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our designs with a case study of the New England 39 bus system.

Abstract: Transient stability controller design based on an optimality principle is an emerging approach for resolving high order contingencies that can otherwise lead to rotor angle instability. It is difficult to design for high order contingencies due to their complexity. A challenging issue is the nonlinearity of the system, which limits the selection approaches available and results in a potentially large search space to find a suitable control action. Because rotor angle instability evolves rapidly, a fast control response is required. This paper develops a cost-based controller under the constraint of bounded computation. A method to downsize the admissible control search space is developed in a manner that retains controls most likely to provide the best cost. Subsequently, a further reduction in computation is designed through model elimination. A set of common cost metrics is applied for all controllers. Tradeoffs between the model-based and model-free approaches are demonstrated. The effect of computational constraints on the competing goals of control cost and control timeliness for complex contingencies is tested with the New England 39-bus system.

Abstract: Restorative self-healing is one of the most important features of smart grids. The major purpose of a restorative self-healing control strategy is to steer a power system to secure operating states. In this paper, a self-healing transmission network reconfiguration algorithm based on the complex network theory is proposed. The capacities of generators and the amounts of important loads (i.e., the high priority loads), as well as the distribution and importance of each transmission line in the outage area are considered in the proposed method using the presented electrical "betweenness." Next, the optimal restoration paths and the optimal restorative self-healing strategy can be attained automatically. Finally, the New England 10-unit 39-bus system and a part of the actual Guangdong power system in China are employed to illustrate the features of the proposed method.

Abstract: In order to support various innovative demand response programs, smart grid needs a wireless communication network with quality-of-service (QoS) support. This paper studies the issue of providing QoS in terms of packet delay, packet error probability, and outage probability to a large number of sensors and smart meters in a neighborhood area network of a densely populated urban area. We assume the network is based on the IEEE 802.15.4g Standard. Given that bandwidth is limited, we propose to divide smart meters into groups and each group will take a turn to access a shared wireless channel in a time-division-multiplexing manner. Within each allocated time duration, a group of smart meters will compete for channel access using a simple slotted Aloha protocol. We have developed an analytical model to quantify the QoS metrics. Through the analytical model, we can determine the minimum concentrator density that is required to support a given smart meter density. We have verified the analytical model through simulations. The results show that we need less than ten concentrators per km(2) to support a node density of 500 units per km(2), while making sure that packet delay does not exceed 1.0 s, packet error probability is below 0.005 and outage probability is lower than 0.01.

Abstract: Power system topology control through transmission line switching for economic gains and reliability benefits has been recently considered in day to day operations. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation for a more efficient application of topology control strategies in real world scenarios with anticipated increase in the presence of highly variable renewable generation and uncertain loads. Such uncertainties are modeled via the point estimation method embedded into the dc optimal power flow-based formulations for optimal switching solutions. Hourly and daily advantages of the proposed probabilistic framework, compared with the conventional operations and deterministic formulations, are discussed. As the anticipated economic gains would increase through sequential implementation of several switching actions, a new probabilistic decision making approach to identify the optimal number of switching actions at each hour is also proposed. This decision support tool uses the probabilistic reliability cost/value analytics in which not only the financial benefits, but also the costs of reliability risks, are taken into account. The approach is tested through various scenarios on the modified IEEE 118-bus test system, with and without renewables integration, and the results revealed its applicability and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper develops a droop-based distributed cooperative control scheme for microgrids under a switching communication network with non-uniform time-varying delays. We first design a pinning-based frequency/voltage controller containing a distributed voltage observer and then design a consensus-based active/reactive power controller, which are employed into the secondary control stage to generate the nominal set points used in the primary control stage for different distributed generators (DGs). By this approach, the frequencies and the weighted average value of all DGs' voltages can be pinned to the desired values while maintaining the precise active and reactive power sharing. With the proposed scheme, each DG only needs to communicate with its neighbors intermittently, even if their communication networks are local and time-varying, and their variant delays may be non-uniform. Sufficient conditions on the requirements for the network connectivity and the delay upper bound that guarantee the stability and reliability of the microgrid are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by the simulation of a microgrid test system.

Abstract: In the past two decades the frequent occurrences of large scale blackouts and catastrophic events has reduced the reliability of power grid to a great extent. A thorough analysis of the propagation of failures, in terms of line outages, combined with the topological characteristics of the grid aids, has been done to take corrective actions to save the system from complete collapse. It also helps to investigate the progress and understand the nature and intensity of blackouts. This motivates to establish the relationship between the network topological characteristics and cascading failure in the power grid. In this paper, the basic topological characteristics of the power network are studied in detail and the average propagation of failure under varying topological conditions is calculated as a branching process parameter. The variation in the mean propagation is studied in detail using a number of test bed networks with the alternate realistic networks derived from the standard IEEE networks imitating the real network conditions. The results confirm a qualitative agreement between the variations in topological parameter and the failure propagation rate in the cascading regime. Based on the analysis mentioned above, data clearly shows that the average failure propagation factor varies linearly with the variations in the statistical metrics.

Abstract: Data injection attacks have emerged as a significant threat on the smart power grid. By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can manipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic benefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such works assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or defense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with multiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study the interactions between the defender and the attackers, two game models are considered. In the first, a Stackelberg game is proposed in which the defender acts as a leader that can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers, before deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties of the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the equilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited system information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In the second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot anticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, a hybrid satisfaction equilibrium-Nash equilibrium game is proposed. To find the equilibrium of this hybrid game, a search-based algorithm is introduced. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to illustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and defender. The results show that by defending a very small set of measurements, the grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks have no effect on the system. Moreover, the results also show how, at equilibrium, multiple attackers can play a destructive role toward each other by choosing to carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected. In addition, the obtained equilibrium strategies under the Stackelberg and the hybrid models are compared while characterizing the amount of loss that the defender endures due to its inability to anticipate the attackers' actions.

Abstract: Multiple attacker data-injection attack construction in electricity grids with minimum-mean-square-error state estimation is studied for centralized and decentralized scenarios. A performance analysis of the trade-off between the maximum distortion that an attack can introduce and the probability of the attack being detected by the network operator is considered. In this setting, optimal centralized attack construction strategies are studied. The decentralized case is examined in a game-theoretic setting. A novel utility function is proposed to model this trade-off and it is shown that the resulting game is a potential game. The existence and cardinality of the corresponding set of Nash equilibria of the game is analyzed. Interestingly, the attackers can exploit the correlation among the state variables to facilitate the attack construction. It is shown that attackers can agree on a data-injection vector construction that achieves the best trade-off between distortion and detection probability by sharing only a limited number of bits offline. For the particular case of two attackers, numerical results based on IEEE test systems are presented.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the question of efficient allocation of energy, while buying the same from generation companies, to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) by aggregator (electricity utility or load serving entities) through auction mechanisms. Recognizing the practical limitations of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, which would be natural to apply in this context, we investigate two practical mechanisms that can be viewed as extensions of second price auction mechanisms and have limited message (bid) complexity. In the first mechanism, the elastic-supply multi-level second price, each PEV agent submits a number of price bids, one for each of a given set of energy levels (energy quantities). In the second mechanism, the elastic-supply progressive second price, the PEV agents submit a 2-D bid indicating the price as well as the desired energy quantity. Taking into account differences across PEV-owners in terms of their willingness-to-pay values and charging time constraints, we analyze the social optimality and incentive compatibility properties of the two auction mechanisms. We also complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations.

Abstract: The stalling of highly concentrated constant torque induction motor loads due to system faults may result in fault induced delayed voltage recovery. This state can cause significantly depressed local voltage for several seconds after the fault is cleared and can also lead to widely cascaded system failure. Though there is extensive study conducted within the modeling of motor loads, the dynamic connection between the aggregated induction motor loads and the grid still needs further investigation. In this paper, a dynamic performance model is developed for motor stalling and over heat thermal tripping. Specifically, this dynamic model can be constructed with an energy-like Lyapunov function, and can be incorporated as part of power system dynamic cascading model. The simulation examples are carried out in an enhanced version of the IEEE 57 bus test system, as demonstration for feasibility. This model may be beneficial for smart grid monitoring and planning, as well as energy analysis for power system cascading failure.

Abstract: This research directly couples investment decisions on distributed energy resources (DERs) with demand side management (DSM) strategies that can be adopted over time by residential communities. The formulation also takes into account factors that usually contribute to long-term market variations and short-term operational volatilities. This paper uses a high resolution adaptive model (Hi-RAM) for short-term load calculations on a premise that expected dynamical effects due to DSM strategies and their interactions cannot effectively be captured by traditional forecast models. The integration of Hi-RAM into investment formulation allows for certain What-If investment scenario analysis on the use of advanced technologies, new plug-ins, and consumer response to power price fluctuations, and more. To demonstrate the significance of coupling of DER investment decisions and DSM strategies, three scenarios are presented. The base scenario (Mode I) results can be reproduced using traditional forecast models and is included for baseline analysis and benchmarking. In Mode II, new load patterns for plug-in electric vehicles are introduced. Mode III is an extended version of Mode II, where smart devices are used within households. The comparison of investment decisions from the three modes clearly demonstrate that interaction effects of DSM strategies matter.

Abstract: This paper proposed a hierarchical structure for the electricity market to facilitate the coordination of energy markets in distribution and transmission networks. The proposed market structure enables the integration of microgrids, which provide energy and ancillary services in distribution networks. In the proposed hierarchical structure, microgrids participate in the energy market at the distribution networks settled by the distribution network operator (DNO), and load aggregators (LAs) interact with microgrids and generation companies (GENCOs) to import/export energy to/from the distribution network electricity markets from/to the wholesale electricity market. The proposed approach addressed the synergy of energy markets by introducing dynamic game with complete information for GENCOs, microgrids, and LAs. The proposed hierarchical competition is composed of bi-level optimization problems in which the respective upper-level problems maximize the individual market participants' payoff, and the lower-level problems represent the market settlement accomplished by the DNO or the independent system operator. The bi-level problems are solved by developing sensitivity functions for market participants' payoff with respect to their bidding strategies. A case study is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We propose a framework for the analysis of cyber switching attacks and control-based mitigation in cyber-enabled power systems. Our model of the switching attack is simple, only requiring knowledge of the sign of the local relative rotor speed, which may be estimated. The controller is modeled to be resource constrained, choosing to act only during select intervals of time. We make use of an iterated game-theoretic formulation to describe the interactions of the parties and its effect on system stability. Analytic results indicate the potential of the constrained controller to achieve transient stabilization over time using zero-determinant strategies. Numerical results of the New England 39-bus power system demonstrate the potential for such a controller to increase system resilience during cyber-attacks.

Abstract: The electric power grid is owned and operated by many competing providers who do not want to reveal their sensitive information to other providers. This competitive environment motivates the use of a third-party (cloud-computing) platform that combines information from each provider and jointly optimizes resources in the entire grid. Since the power system structure and component values are confidential, the third-party computing platform must be either absolutely secure or information needs to be masked before sharing with the third party. In this paper, we propose an approach to obfuscate the sensitive information and solve the multi-party AC optimal power flow problem in a shared computing platform. The initial obfuscation is separately performed by each party so that sensitive information is masked from the third party and all other participants.

Abstract: Major power grid blackouts in various parts of the world are characterized by voltage collapse. This paper studies the blackout case in the Indian power grid due to voltage collapse in the inter-regional corridor. First, the computer simulation models are tuned to match responses from the phasor measurement units at various locations in the grid. The inter-area mode with the frequency of 0.3 and 0.5 Hz with reduced damping were observed and resulted due to switching actions that occurred during the disturbance. This paper simulates the complex power grid network for various loading conditions of Northern region using power system simulator for engineering. Further, the system variables are analyzed using Prony method to estimate the inter-area mode for different NR loading conditions. The eigen values associated with the 0.3 Hz mode depict the movement from open left half plane into open right half plane with a slight increase in the parameter indicating "hopf bifurcation." This paper also discusses the maximum loading capacity for the inter-regional lines in-order avoid loss of small signal stability, and highlights the use of real time phasor measurement unit measurements in-order to estimate and track the oscillatory modes.

Abstract: Electric system operators rely on regulation services to match the total system supply to the total system load in quasi real-time. The regulation contractual framework requires that a regulation unit declares its regulation parameters at the beginning of the contract, the operator guarantees that the regulation signals will be within the range of these parameters, and the regulation unit is rewarded proportionally to what it declares and what it supplies. We study how this service can be provided by a unit with a non-ideal storage. We consider two broad classes of storage technologies characterized by different state of charge evolution equations, namely batteries and flywheels. We first focus on a single contract, and obtain formulas for the upward and downward regulation parameters that a unit with either a battery or a flywheel should declare to the operator to maximize its reward. We then focus on a multiple contract setting and show how to analytically quantify the reward that such a unit could obtain in successive contracts. We quantify this reward using bounds and expectation, and compare our analytical results with those obtained from a dataset of real-world regulation signals. Finally, we provide engineering insights by comparing different storage technologies in terms of potential rewards for different contract durations and parameters.

Abstract: Isolated regions and islands are facing imported fossil-fuel dependency, higher electricity prices, and vulnerability to climate change. At the same time, they are increasing their renewable penetration and, therefore, risk for electric utilities. Integrating stochastic energy resources in noninterconnected systems may take advantage of an intelligent and optimized risk-averse unit commitment (UC) model. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic UC model with high renewable penetration including reserve requirements for the efficient management of uncertainty. In order to account for the uncertainty around the true outcomes of load, wind, and photovoltaic (PV) generation, a minimum conditional value at risk term has been included in the model formulation. A stochastic measure of the value of the stochastic solution is used to evaluate the benefits of using stochastic programming. The model considers the need for reserves dependent on the forecasting horizon and the amount of renewable generation. Active power demand, and wind and PV generations are considered as probability distribution functions. The model is applied to the Lanzarote-Fuerteventura system in the Canary Islands, Spain, and Crete, Greece.

Abstract: Introduction of distributed generation (DG) to the power system may lead to nonselective protection actions. For every future DG installation, the relay settings need to be modified to guarantee protection coordination that can lead to numerous changes in relay settings. This paper presents a novel approach to plan relay protection coordination considering future DG installations. Thus, this paper aims at proposing a method capable of optimally identifying one set of relay settings valid for all possible future DG planning scenarios. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a linear programming problem and the simplex algorithm is utilized to solve it. The proposed approach is tested on the distribution part of the modified meshed IEEE 14-bus system and the IEEE 13-bus radial test system. Comparative studies have been conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach under various planning scenarios considering application of fault current limiters.

Abstract: In this paper, a new method is presented to simultaneously identify parameters of synchronous generator and its excitation system (EXS) using measurement data. These measurements could be provided by metering devices such as data acquisition system or fault recorders of the power plant. Since a smart grid is capable of providing synchronized measurements using phasor measurement units, the desired data could also be provided by these devices. In the proposed method, the reference voltage of the EXS is considered as the input signal, while the terminal voltage and output active power of the machine are considered as output signals. The desired parameters are classified into three categories using a sensitivity analysis: 1) the parameters that affect the terminal voltage; 2) the parameters that affect the active power; and 3) the parameters that do not considerably affect either. A multistage genetic algorithm optimization is used to iteratively identify the parameters. To show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, it is applied to a single machine with a dc-type EXS connected to an infinite bus. Using the proposed method, 19 parameters of synchronous generator and its EXS are identified within four stages.

Abstract: Large-scale lithium-ion battery packs are widely adopted in systems such as electric vehicles and energy backup in power grids. Due to factors such as manufacturing difference and heterogeneous discharging conditions, cells in the battery pack may have different statuses, such as diverse voltage levels. This cell diversity is commonly known as the cell imbalance issue. For the charging of battery packs, the cell imbalance not only early on terminates the charging process before all cells are fully charged, but also leads to different desired charging currents among cells. In this paper, based on the advancement in reconfigurable battery systems, we demonstrate how to utilize system reconfigurability to mitigate the impact of cell imbalance on an efficient charging process. With the proposed reconfiguration-assisted charging (RAC), cells in the system are categorized according to their real-time voltages, and the charging process is performed in a category-by-category manner. To charge cells in a given category, a graph-based algorithm is presented to charge cells with their desired charging currents, respectively. We evaluate RAC through both experiments and simulations. The results demonstrate that the RAC increases the capacity charged into cells by about 25% and yields a dramatically reduced variance.

However, it introduces new privacy threats to customers. Prior works have proposed privacy-preserving methods in the AMI, such as temporal or spatial aggregation. A main assumption in these works is that fine-grained data do not need to be attributable to individuals. However, this assumption does not hold in incentive-based demand response (IDR) programs where fine-grained metering data are required to analyze individual demand curtailments, and hence, need to be attributable. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for IDR programs in the smart grid, which enables the DR provider to compute individual demand curtailments and DR rewards while preserving customer privacy. Moreover, a customer can reveal his/her identity and prove ownership of his/her power usage profile in certain situations, such as legal disputes. We achieve both privacy and efficiency in our scheme through a combination of several cryptographic primitives, such as identity-committable signatures and partially blind signatures. As far as we know, we are the first to identify and address privacy issues for IDR programs in the smart grid.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar have received much attention in recent years, and large amounts of renewable generation are being integrated into electricity networks. A fundamental challenge in power system operation is to handle the intermittent nature of renewable generation. In this paper, we present a stochastic programming approach to solve a multiperiod optimal power flow problem under renewable generation uncertainty. The proposed approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, operating points of the conventional power plants are determined. The second stage realizes generation from the renewable resources and optimally accommodates it by relying on the demand-side flexibilities. The proposed model is illustrated on a 4-bus and a 39-bus system. Numerical results show that substantial benefits in terms of redispatch costs can be achieved with the help of demand side flexibilities. The proposed approach is tested on the standard IEEE test networks of up to 300 buses and for a wide variety of scenarios for renewable generation.

Abstract: Utilizing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is growing fast and booming nowadays. These vehicles, as portable loads and energy sources, may be connected to standard sockets at home. As a result, those extra electrical loads, grid to vehicle, generations, and vehicle to grid, have several impacts on distribution networks, e.g., network energy loss. This paper presents a two-stage optimization method to minimize the energy loss of microgrid with different penetration levels of PHEVs. In the first stage, a novel convex quadratic objective function for active power management of PHEVs is proposed, and daily required energy of PHEVs is calculated based on stochastic model of PHEV owners' behavior. It is supposed that PHEVs can be employed as distributed capacitors. Therefore, reactive power of PHEVs is specified in the second stage. Afterward, the proposed methodology is applied to a realistic distribution network. It will be illustrated that network energy loss is likely to rise considerably in the case of increasing penetration level of PHEVs without smart charging strategy; in order to minimize network energy loss, a smart management scheme will have to be considered. Also, the significant impact of PHEVs' active and reactive power management on energy loss reduction will be demonstrated.

Abstract: The potential economic impact of transmission line rating (TLR) attacks in two-settlement electricity markets is studied in this paper. We show that nodal prices in real-time markets can be manipulated via a TLR attack, which can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. Several acceleration techniques are developed to reduce the computational burden of solving the bi-level problem. A heuristic strategy is proposed to deal with the issue of multiplicity in pricing. The uncertainties in load are also considered in the proposed TLR model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that well-designed TLR attacks can manipulate the profits of market participants in the two-settlement markets. Benchmark testing shows that the proposed acceleration techniques can reduce computation time tremendously, and the proposed heuristic strategy can mitigate the issue of multiplicity in pricing.

Abstract: The envisaged de-carbonization of power systems poses unprecedented challenges enhancing the potential of flexible demand. However, the incorporation of the latter in system planning has yet to be comprehensively investigated. This paper proposes a novel planning model that allows co-optimizing the investment and operating costs of conventional generation assets and demand flexibility, in the form of smart-charging/discharging electric vehicles (EV). The model includes a detailed representation of EV operational constraints along with the generation technical characteristics, and accounts for the costs required to enable demand flexibility. Computational tractability is achieved through clustering generation units and EV, which allows massively reducing the number of decision variables and constraints, and avoiding non-linearities. Case studies in the context of the U.K. demonstrate the economic value of EV flexibility in reducing peak demand levels and absorbing wind generation variability, and the dependence of this value on the required enabling cost and users' traveling patterns.

Abstract: Information and communication infrastructure will be extensively deployed to monitor and control electric power delivery components of today's power grid. While these cyber elements enhance a utility's ability to maintain physical stability, if a subset are compromised by adversaries, disruption may occur. In this paper, a novel framework based on the principles of differential games is proposed that demonstrates stealthy worst-case strategies for attackers to disrupt transient stability by leveraging control over distributed energy resources. We demonstrate that if the electric power utility is able to identify uncompromised components, countermeasures can exist that effectively reduce the impact of attack for a fixed time interval. Based on our results, we develop insights to construct safety margin recommendations for cyber-physical smart grid actuation elements that promote system resilience during a cyber attack.

Abstract: Microgrids have emerged as an alternative to alleviate increasing energy demands. However, because microgrids are primarily based on nonconventional energy sources (NCES), there is high uncertainty involved in their operation. The aim of this paper is to formulate a robust energy management system (EMS) for a microgrid that uses model predictive control theory as the mathematical framework. The robust EMS (REMS) is formulated using a fuzzy prediction interval model as the prediction model. This model allows us to represent both nonlinear dynamic behavior and uncertainty in the available energy from NCES. In particular, the uncertainty in wind-based energy sources can be represented. In this way, upper and lower boundaries for the trajectories of the available energy are obtained. These boundaries are used to derive a robust formulation of the EMS. The microgrid installed in Huatacondo was used as a test bench. The results indicated that, in comparison with a nonrobust approach, the proposed formulation adequately integrated the uncertainty into the EMS, increasing the robustness of the microgrid by using the diesel generator as spinning reserve. However, the operating costs were also slightly increased due to the additional reserves. This achievement indicates that the proposed REMS is an appropriate alternative for improving the robustness, against the wind power variations, in the operation of microgrids.

Abstract: This paper proposes three-phase steady-state models for a distributed generator (DG) interfaced to a main system via a three-wire current-controlled voltage-source converter. In order to represent the DG in a realistic manner, the three major factors that determine the steady-state phase outputs under unbalanced operating conditions are considered: 1) the power control strategy; 2) output filter; and 3) voltage and current sensor positions. Based on these factors, the DGs are classified into various types. According to the position of the voltage sensor, two equivalent circuit models including an equivalent three-phase current source (ETCS) are proposed. For each type of DG, the output current of the ETCS is formulated as a function of the voltage of the ETCS-connected node, the filter impedances, and the active and reactive power references. To verify the accuracy of the proposed models, the results of the power flow incorporating them are compared with those obtained from the PSCAD simulation using detailed dynamic models of the DG.

Abstract: This paper proposes a transform-based compression algorithm for waveforms associated with power quality and transient phenomena in power systems. This method uses the wavelet transform, a dynamic bit allocation in the transform domain through estimation of the spectral shape, as well as entropy coding in order to minimize residual redundancy. Five distinct approaches for estimating the spectral shape are proposed. Four of them are based on analytical models that seek to describe the decreasing behavior of the transformed coefficients: 1) decreasing linear bit allocation shape; 2) decreasing quadratic bit allocation shape; 3) decreasing exponential bit allocation shape; 4) rotated sigmoid bit allocation shape; and 5) the fifth approach-the neural shape estimator (NSE)-is an adaptive model that uses an artificial neural network to map the changes in the spectrum shape. Results with databases of real signals and a performance evaluation using objective measures are reported. The results indicate that the NSE approach outperforms the other proposed solutions that use spectral shape estimation for coding, as well as other compression contributions reported in the literature.

Abstract: Regulation service (RS) reserves, a critical type of bi-directional capacity reserves, are provided today by expensive and environmentally unfriendly centralized fossil fuel generators. This paper investigates provision of RS reserves by the demand side. We consider a smart building operator that is capable of modulating the aggregate consumption of the building loads via price signals in response to an unanticipated RS signal that an independent system operator broadcasts. We first model the RS signal and load behavior, and formulate the related stochastic dynamic programming (DP) problem. Then, in order to deal with the complexity of the DP problem resulting from the uncountably infinite allowable price set, we characterize certain key properties of the DP dynamics, solve the DP problem for a discretized price policy to observe the structure of the optimal policy and re-capture the continuous price policy in an analytic approximate policy iteration (API) algorithm using the above properties and structure. We finally provide numerical evidence that the novel API algorithm converges to a continuous dynamic price policy that outperforms optimal discretized price policies in both computational effort and average cost.

Abstract: This paper discusses the influence of unintended reactive power flow caused by photovoltaic (PV) inverter systems with a power factor specification of one on the grid voltage and grid loss. In theory, the apparent power feed-in of these PV systems should be equal to the active power feed-in. Observations in distribution grids have shown a reactive power flow caused by these systems. The main purpose is, if this influence has to be considered in grid planning and power system management in smart grids. Therefore, measurement data of several low voltage grids is used. Three different scenarios for the unintended reactive power are simulated. Under normal operating conditions, the unintended reactive power is not relevant. Nevertheless, if voltage or overload problems are not explainable, they can be a result of the unintended reactive power flow. This approach is very helpful for network operators to locate and understand the reasons for grid problems.

Abstract: Inspired by induction machines working principles, this paper presents the idea of phase-locked-loop-less (PLL-less) operation of grid-connected voltage source converters (VSCs) under new concept of inducverter. The proposed controller eliminates the need for a dedicated synchronization process and the related PLL, and therefore it offers a simpler and more reliable control strategy compared to the conventional methods. In addition, it represents an improved performance, as it provides real and true auto-start and auto-synchronization with a grid without the need for grid voltage information. A current damping/synchronization unit enables grid auto-synchronization by using local current information and can track grid voltage frequency, angle, and amplitude variations while feeding constant amount of power, which is of high-interest in frequency varying grids and also in the case of grid voltage angle jump. Another advantage of the inducverter is that it introduces virtual inertia to the grid to regulate frequency, which enhances frequency dynamics of smart grids. Beside the current synchronization unit, the proposed strategy has a single-loop controller core with control over both power and current, which is implemented in a hybrid dq and abc frame using a virtual adaptive lead or lag impedance. The controller also offers stable and high-performance synchronization and operation under unbalanced and/or distorted grid conditions. The work beside synchronous current converters gives a bird's eye view to research in the new area of PLL-less and virtual inertia-based operation of VSCs and fulfill a unified set of controllers for the smart grid integration. Simulation, hardware-in-loop, and experimental results are presented to validate effectiveness of the controller.

Abstract: Due to the high-measuring cost, the monitoring of power quality (PQ) is nontrivial. This paper is aimed at reducing the cost of PQ monitoring in power network. Using a real-world PQ dataset, this paper adopts a learn-from-data approach to obtain a device latent feature model, which captures the device behavior as a PQ transition function. With the latent feature model, the power network could be modeled, in analogy, as a data-driven network, which presents the opportunity to use the well-investigated network monitoring and data estimation algorithms to solve the network quality monitoring problem in power grid. Based on this network model, algorithms are proposed to intelligently place measurement devices on suitable power links to reduce the uncertainty of PQ estimation on unmonitored power links. The meter placement algorithms use entropy-based measurements and Bayesian network models to identify the most suitable power links for PQ meter placement. Evaluation results on various simulated networks including IEEE distribution test feeder system show that the meter placement solution is efficient, and has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty of PQ values on unmonitored power links.

Abstract: Demand-side participation is now widely recognized as being extremely critical for satisfying the growing electricity demand in the U.S. The primary mechanism for demand management in the U.S. is demand response (DR) programs that attempt to reduce or shift demand by giving incentives to participating customers via price discounts or rebate payments. Utilities that offer DR programs rely on automated DR devices (ADRs) to automate the response to DR signals. The ADRs are faulty, but the working state of the ADR is not directly observable; one can, however, attempt to infer it from the power consumption during DR events. The utility loses revenue when a malfunctioning ADR does not respond to a DR signal; however, sending a maintenance crew to check and reset the ADR also incurs costs. In this paper, we show that the problem of maintaining a pool of ADRs using a limited number of maintenance crews can be formulated as a restless bandit problem, and that one can compute a near-optimal policy for this problem using Whittle indices. We show that the Whittle indices can be efficiently computed using a variational Bayes procedure even when the load-shed magnitude is noisy, and when there is a random mismatch between the clocks at the utility and at the meter. The results of our numerical experiments suggest that the Whittle-index-based approximate policy is within 4% of the optimal solution for all reasonably low values of the signal-to-noise ratio in the meter readings.

Abstract: A faithful distributed mechanism is proposed in this paper for sharing the cost of electricity among a large number of strategic and distributed household agents that have private information, and discrete and continuous energy levels. In contrast to mechanisms in prior works, which charge the agents based on their day-ahead allocation, the proposed mechanism charges the agents based on their day-ahead allocation and their actual consumption. The mechanism is proven to be asymptotically dominant strategy incentive compatible, weakly budget balanced, and fair in charging the agents. However, the proposed mechanism's payment function, which requires computing a marginal allocation problem for each agent, renders the mechanism intractable for a large number of household agents if it is computed centrally. Thus, a distributed implementation of the mechanism is proposed, in which the agents share the computational burden with the aggregator. The distributed implementation is based on a penalty/reward scheme inspired by the prisoner's dilemma that brings faithful computation to a dominant strategy equilibrium.

Abstract: The use of distributed generators (DGs) has increased in the past decade and projections indicate that penetration will further increase. In this scenario, with the improvements in power-electronics-based converters, the DG units have the potential to effectively resolve voltage/current control issues in low-voltage distribution systems. In this paper, a new probabilistic index is defined to measure the controllability of voltages and currents in the buses and lines of distribution systems. Using this index greatly facilitates the analysis and measurement of voltage/current controllability levels of distribution systems. Different types of DGs are allocated in the system to optimize the voltage/current controllability by using the defined index. The results are compared with those obtained through the conventional approach of DG allocation, which is based on the minimization of energy losses. A new combined index is defined to include both V-I controllability and energy losses. Several sensitivity studies are then performed to show the effect of the penetration level of different types of DGs on the proposed indices.

Abstract: Distributed control methods based on consensus algorithms have become popular in recent years for microgrid (MG) systems. These kind of algorithms can be applied to share information in order to coordinate multiple distributed generators within a MG. However, stability analysis becomes a challenging issue when these kinds of algorithms are used, since the dynamics of the electrical and the communication systems interact with each other. Moreover, the transmission rate and topology of the communication network also affect the system dynamics. Due to discrete nature of the information exchange in the communication network, continuous-time methods can be inaccurate for this kind of dynamic study. Therefore, this paper aims at modeling a complete dc MG using a discrete-time approach in order to perform a sensitivity analysis taking into account the effects of the consensus algorithm. To this end, a generalized modeling method is proposed and the influence of key control parameters, the communication topology, and the communication speed are studied in detail. The theoretical results obtained with the proposed model are verified by comparing them with the results obtained with a detailed switching simulator developed in Simulink/Plecs.

Abstract: Utilizing battery storage devices in plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) for grid support using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept is gaining popularity. With appropriate control strategies, the PEV batteries and associated power electronics can be exploited for solar photovoltaic (PV) impact mitigation and grid support. However, as the PEV batteries have limited capacity and the capacity usage is also constrained by transportation requirements, an intelligent strategy is necessary for an effective utilization of the available capacity for V2G applications. In this paper, a strategy for an effective utilization of PEV battery capacity for solar PV impact mitigation and grid support is proposed. A controllable charging/discharging pattern is developed to optimize the use of the limited PEV battery capacity to mitigate PV impacts, such as voltage rise during midday or to support the evening load peak. To ensure an effective utilization of the available PEV battery capacity when used for travel (which is the main usage of the PEVs) or when interventions in the charging operation is caused by passing clouds, a strategy for dynamic adjustments in PEV charging/discharging rates is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is tested using a real distribution system in Australia based on practical PV and PEV data.

Abstract: In this paper, an energy consumption management is considered for households (users) in a residential smart grid network. In each house, there are two types of demands, essential and flexible demands, where the flexible demands are further categorized into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant demands. The delay-sensitive demands have higher priority to be served than the delay-tolerant demands. Meanwhile, in order to decrease the delay of delay-tolerant demands, such demands are allowed to be upgraded to the high-priority queue (i.e., the same queue that serves the delay-sensitive demands) with a given probability. An optimization problem is then formulated to minimize the total electricity cost and the operation delay of flexible demands by obtaining the optimal energy management decisions. Based on adaptive dynamic programming, a centralized algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In addition, a distributed algorithm is designed for practical implementation and the neural network is employed to estimate the pricing or demands when such system information is not known. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can provide effective management for household electricity usage and reduce the operation delay for the flexible demands.

Abstract: Distributed optimization techniques in electric power systems have drawn increased attention as they provide a scalable way to handle the increasingly complex and large-scale optimization problems associated with the optimal operation of the system. However, little effort has been reported on how to optimally partition the overall optimization problem into subproblems, which significantly affects the efficiency and convergence speed of distributed methods. To address this issue, this paper focuses on how to determine the optimal partition for a given system and optimization problem, and quantify the improvement obtained with the optimal partition in terms of number of iterations and convergence time for solving the ac optimal power flow problem. The proposed approach is based on spectral clustering using a combination of the Hessian matrix of the optimization problem and the admittance matrix as the affinity matrix. Simulation results for the IEEE test systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning method, and the robustness of the performance of a certain partition with respect to the operating point of the system.

Abstract: As microgrids evolve, it is reasonable to expect that a variety of energy storage systems (ESSs) with different operational characteristics will be used simultaneously. Because each storage system has different capabilities and capacities, they will complement each other, and be able to achieve more efficient and reliable results than if only a single type of system were used. However, integrating multiple types of storage comes with several implementation challenges. Existing control techniques used to charge and discharge different technologies are not sufficient to accommodate the electrochemical (or mechanical) differences. In this paper, we propose an interconnection topology and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize the coordination of different ESSs in a microgrid.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a profit-maximizationbased pricing optimization model for the demand response (DR) management with customer behavior learning in the context of smart grids. By recognizing the different consumption patterns between shiftable and curtailable appliances, two different and distinguished behavior models are proposed. For shiftable appliances whose energy consumption can be shifted from high price periods to low price periods but total energy consumption is fixed, a probabilistic behavior model and its learning algorithm are proposed to model an individual customer's shifting probabilities dependent on different hourly prices. For curtailable appliances whose energy consumption cannot be shifted but total energy consumption can be adjusted, a regression model is proposed to model an individual customer's usage patterns dependent on prices and temperatures. After proposing the learning algorithms to identify these proposed behavior models, this paper further develops a genetic algorithm-based distributed pricing optimization algorithm for DR management with the aim to maximize the retailer's profit. Numerical results indicate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed models and their benefits to the retailer by improving its profit.

Abstract: In this paper, a real-time smart metering approach is proposed that reduces the reporting frequency for a given maximum error constraint. The proposed scheme employs an adaptive change detection filter that tracks the mean trend of the local power consumption, and load estimates are reported only when the estimation error exceeds a prescribed magnitude bound. The run-length of the proposed scheme is analyzed and expressions for the average time to a report are derived. Simulation results with both simulated and real-measurement data are provided to illustrate the tracking performance, and the reductions in the reporting rate. The results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the reporting rate in exchange for a small bounded tracking error.

Abstract: Energy storage systems (ESSs) are essential in future power systems because they can improve power usage efficiency. In this paper, a novel coordinated control algorithm is proposed for distributed battery ESSs (BESSs). The neighboring BESSs of a simulation system are grouped and controlled by a main control center. The main control center sends charging or discharging operation signals to each BESS. The primary objective of the proposed coordinated control scheme is to mitigate voltage and frequency deviations. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, the BESSs are connected to a distribution system of the Korea Electric Power Corporation. The results are compared with those obtained using uncoordinated control scheme with on-load tap changer considering aspects of power quality (voltage and frequency variation). The simulation results show that the voltage and frequency deviations are reduced with the proposed coordinated control algorithm.

Abstract: This paper develops a novel energy trading system with a community energy storage (CES) device for demand-side load management within a neighborhood area network. The energy users in the proposed system that have their own photovoltaic power generation are allowed to trade energy from their personal surplus with the grid and the CES device. We adopt a dynamic noncooperative repeated game with Pareto-efficient pure strategies as the decentralized approach for the users to determine optimal energy trading amounts for the next day. This decentralized model needs minimal information exchange or communication between users. Simulation results show that our system is able to provide peak load leveling for the grid, while providing financial benefits to users. Moreover, the performance benefits of our system are robust to both inaccuracy in day-ahead power forecasts and CES battery inefficiencies.

Abstract: This paper addresses a two-stage framework for the economic operation of a microgrid-like electric vehicle (EV) parking deck with on-site renewable energy generation (roof-top photovoltaic panel). This microgrid-like EV parking deck is a localized grouping of distributed generation (solar), energy storage (EV batteries), and load (EV charging load). Although EV parking decks can enable greater adoption of renewable energy sources by scheduling charging loads to coincide with periods of strong sun, the inherent intermittency of renewable energy resources and variable EV parking behaviors complicates the economic operation. In this paper, the proposed first stage of this framework provides the parking deck operators with a stochastic approach for dealing with the uncertainty of solar energy so as to make an optimal price decision (marginal electricity sale price and parking fee rebate) at the day-ahead time scale. The second stage introduces a model predictive control-based operation strategy of EV charging dealing with the uncertainty of parking behaviors within the real-time operation. Case studies demonstrate the better performance of the proposed framework, offering an effective day-ahead marginal electricity price for tomorrow's operation and increasing the microgrid-like EV parking deck's revenue during the real-time operation.

Abstract: In smart grid, customers have access to the electricity consumption and the price data via smart meters; thus, they are able to participate in the demand response (DR) programs. In this paper, we address the interaction among multiple utility companies and multiple customers in smart grid by modeling the DR problem as two noncooperative games: the supplier and customer side games. In the first game, supply function bidding mechanism is employed to model the utility companies' profit maximization problem. In the proposed mechanism, the utility companies submit their bids to the data center, where the electricity price is computed and is sent to the customers. In the second game, the price anticipating customers determine optimal shiftable load profile to maximize their daily payoff. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the mentioned games are studied and a computationally tractable distributed algorithm is designed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DR method in increasing the utility companies' profit and customers' payoff, as well as in reducing the peak-to-average ratio in the aggregate load demand. Finally, the algorithm performance is compared with a DR method in the literature to demonstrate the similarities and differences.

Abstract: Smart grids have attracted increasing interest in the field of industrial research. These systems allow electricity consumers to communicate with electrical systems using bidirectional communications. However, these bidirectional channels may introduce privacy threats to consumers. Considerable research has been conducted with the aim of resolving these threats. Unfortunately, a practical smart grid design with adequate efficiency and security functionalities has not yet been produced. In this paper, we propose lightweight privacy preserving metering protocols by designing a distributed authentication method to further increase the speed of the message authentication process. We confirmed the efficiency and security of our method by performing a detailed analysis.

Abstract: This paper documents the effort to perform dynamic model validation for the U.S. Eastern Interconnection (EI) by modeling the governor deadband. The Western Electricity Coordinating Council-modified 1981 IEEE type 1 turbine governor model (WSIEG1) was added to the EI model. A frequency response sensitivity study is conducted to look at the impacts of a few major factors. The significance of modeling governor dead band is evident. Simulated frequency responses are adjusted and validated against the measurements collected by the frequency monitoring network. Two actual events are replicated in a 16 000-bus EI dynamic model. This paper demonstrates the need for a comprehensive effort on governor dead band modeling by the industry.

Abstract: In order to reduce the energy cost of data centers, recent studies suggest distributing computation workload among multiple geographically dispersed data centers by exploiting the electricity price difference. However, the impact of data center load redistribution on the power grid is not well understood yet. This paper takes the first step toward tackling this important issue by studying how the power grid can take advantage of the data centers' load distribution proactively for the purpose of power load balancing. We model the interactions between power grid and data centers as a two-stage problem where the utility company chooses proper pricing mechanisms to balance the electric power load in the first stage and the data centers seek to minimize their total energy cost by responding to the prices in the second stage. We show that the two-stage problem is a bilevel quadratic program, which is NP-hard and cannot be solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We introduce benchmark problems to derive upper and lower bounds for the solution of the two-stage problem. We further propose a branch and bound algorithm to attain the globally optimal solution, and propose a heuristic algorithm with low computational complexity to obtain an alternative close-to-optimal solution. We also study the impact of background load prediction error using the theoretical framework of robust optimization. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can not only improve the power grid reliability, but also reduce the energy cost of data centers.

Abstract: Microgrids are emerging as an important constituent of large-scale smart grids. They are equipped with the controls necessary for managing the operation in islanded or grid connected mode and serve the loads with clean, reliable, and uninterruptible power. Microgrid must be equipped with a robust grid synchronization (GS) algorithm so as to allow a smooth transfer from islanded mode to grid tied mode. This gets even more critical when the availability of the power grid is irregular or the power grid is weak. This paper proposes a simple yet highly reliable GS technique based on controller area network (CAN) communication. The grid synchronizer block senses the three phase grid voltages, derives the phase angle (theta) using synchronously rotating reference frame-based phase lock loop, and transmits this information on the CAN network to all microsources (MS). The local controller associated with each MS receives the data with small but known and definite time latencies. This allows each MS to energize simultaneously in synchronization with the grid, facilitating easy GS of all the MS, minimizing the time required for GS of the complete microgrid. All the analytical, simulation, and hardware results related to this paper are presented.

Abstract: While enabling prominent growth of renewable-based distributed generation (DG) and matching energy harvesting, nonfirm connection policy requires accompanying active and reactive power dispatch control. Centralized control often implies comprehensive communication infrastructure and notable capital investment. Hence, DG planning models tailored for decentralized management of thermal and voltage constraints are found wanting. This paper presents a DG planning methodology, which successfully incorporates a new decentralized active power curtailment control and also includes decentralized voltage control. It optimizes autonomous control settings for each generator individually, such that the net energy export from the distribution to transmission level, per unit of installed capacity, is maximized. Comparative time series analysis validates the methodology.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider modeling and prediction of power loads due to fast charging stations for plug-in electric vehicles (EV). The first part of this paper is to simulate work of a fast charger activity by exploiting empirical data that characterize EV user behavior. The second part describes the time series obtained by this simulator and its properties. We show that the power load aggregated over a number of fast chargers (after deseasonalizing and elimination of the linear trend) is a self-similar process with the Hurst parameter 0.57 < H < 0.67, where H varies depending on the multiplexing level. The main contribution of this paper is empirical evidence that a fitted fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (fARIMA) model taking into account self-similarity of the load time series can yield high-quality short-term forecasts when H is large enough. Namely, the fitted fARIMA model uniformly outperforms regular ARIMA algorithms in terms of root-mean-square error for predictions with time horizon up to 120 min for H >= 0.639. Moreover, we show that the fARIMA advantage on average grows as a function of the Hurst exponent H. Computational experiments demonstrate that this edge is stably greater than 1.1% and can be as high as 5-7% for some scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates electric vehicle (EV) participation in the flexible ramp market. We take into account EV stochastic mobility, and evaluate impact on power system reliability and flexibility. Based on dynamic programming, the model deals with uncertainties and variations of net load, as well as EV charging requirements. Markov process is utilized in estimating the aggregated power capacity of EVs. Two participation modes are analyzed: 1) EV direct provision of the ramp product; and 2) EV cooperation with the conventional generator. Moreover, we propose new indices to evaluate power system flexibility. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach and illustrate how EV involvement into the ramp market can improve power system reliability and flexibility.

Abstract: Increased non-linear residential loads in today's distribution system is a concern due to the harmonics related power quality issues. The situation gets worsened by the harmonic resonance introduced by the installation of power factor correction (PFC) capacitor banks in the distribution network. At the same time, more and more renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG) units are being installed in the residential area. These DG systems can be used as an effective way to mitigate the harmonic related power quality problems introduced by the nonlinear residential loads. In literature, very limited work has been done to identify harmonic compensation priorities that should be assigned to different DGs operating at different locations of the distribution system for improved compensation performance. This issue is addressed in this paper. A selective harmonic compensation scheme based on modal analysis is developed to assign compensation priorities on DGs operating at different distribution system nodes for improved compensation performance. A modeled residential distribution system containing distribution components such as distribution line, PFC capacitors, transformers, and household appliances along with DG units is used to verify the improvement of compensation performance. Experimental verification of the proposed method is also provided.

Abstract: To realize the synergy between plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and wind power, this paper presents a hierarchical stochastic control scheme for the coordination of PEV charging and wind power in a microgrid. This scheme consists of two layers. Based on the non-Gaussian wind power predictive distributions, an upper layer stochastic predictive controller coordinates the operation of PEV aggregator and wind turbine. The computed power references are sent to the lower layer PEV and wind controllers for execution. The PEV controller optimally allots the aggregated charging power to individual PEVs. The wind controller regulates the power output of wind turbine. In this way, a power balance between supply and demand in a microgrid is achieved. The main feature of this scheme is that it incorporates the non-Gaussian uncertainty and partially dispatchability of wind power, as well as the PEV uncertainty. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage charging scheme for the electric vehicle aggregator to minimize the charging cost of each individual participator, while taking uncertain renewable generation and aggregator's capacity into account. The charging problem is formulated as a generalized Nash game with shared global constraints, where the congestion constraint and renewable energy utility constraint that couple all participators' strategies serve as the global constraints and should be satisfied for all possible outcomes of uncertainty. The normalized Nash equilibrium (NNE) is used to characterize a fair charging decision among the participants. It is shown that when the commission fee charged by the aggregator is a convex function and proportionally shared by the consumers, the NNE can be efficiently computed from a particular convex optimization problem, and is noninferior if the commission fee function is separable in players. An adaptive scenario generation algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model in a tractable manner. A dynamic real-time bidding scheme is suggested for practical implementations in a receding horizon fashion, accounting for tackling various kinds of uncertainties. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the proposed technique.

Abstract: Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) deployment has been widely promoted in recent years to improve the accuracy of billing information as well as to facilitate implementation of demand response. Information integrity and availability of the devices is crucial to the billing information that should reflect accurately on how much the household energy is consumed. The IP-based smart metering devices may exist with unknown vulnerabilities that can introduce back-doors to enable worm propagation across AMI network. The infected devices can be attack agents that would largely disable the metering functionalities or manipulate control variables of each meter. This paper proposes an optimal frequency of on-site investigation and the number of monitoring verification to investigate potential anomalies of malware footprinting by applying the decision process framework of Markovian. The proposed method determines the best inspection strategies based on the observation from the existing anomaly detectors deployed in the network. The considerations include malware propagation characteristics, accuracy of anomaly detectors, and investigation and diagnosis costs. Four scenarios are simulated using the proposed method, demonstrating the effectiveness of investigation on potentially infected electronic meters within an AMI network.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal reconfiguration-based dynamic tariff (DT) method for congestion management and line loss reduction in distribution networks with high penetration of electric vehicles. In the proposed DT concept, feeder reconfiguration (FR) is employed through mixed integer programming when calculating the DT, leading to minimized energy cost and reduced DT as compared with the DT concept without FR. This paper further demonstrates that the line losses can be taken into account during the calculation of DT. As a result, the line loss reduction can be realized in a decentralized manner through the DT framework. Three case studies were conducted to validate the optimal reconfiguration-based DT method for congestion management and line loss reduction in distribution networks.

Abstract: One of the well-known methods to share active and reactive power in microgrids (MGs) is droop control. A disadvantage of this method is that in steady state the frequency of the MG deviates from the nominal value and has to be restored using a secondary control system (SCS). The signal obtained at the output of the SCS is transmitted using a communication channel to the generation sources in the MG, correcting the frequency. However, communication channels are prone to time delays, which should be considered in the design of the SCS; otherwise, the operation of the MG could be compromised. In this paper, two new SCSs control schemes are discussed to deal with this issue: 1) a model predictive controller (MPC); and 2) a Smith predictor-based controller. The performance of both control methodologies are compared with that obtained using a conventional proportional integral-based SCS using simulation work. Stability analysis based on small signal models and participation factors is also realized. It is concluded that in terms of robustness, the MPC has better performance.

Abstract: With ever increasing deployment of automation and communication systems in smart grids, distribution network reconfiguration is becoming a viable solution for improving the operation of power grids. A novel hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper that determines Pareto frontiers, as the candidate solutions, for multiobjective distribution network reconfiguration problem. The proposed hybrid optimization algorithm combines the concept of fuzzy Pareto dominance with shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) to recognize optimal nondominated solutions identified by SFLA. The local search step of SFLA is also customized for power systems application so that it automatically creates and analyzes only the feasible and radial configurations in its optimization procedure, which significantly increases the convergence speed of the algorithm. Moreover, an adaptive reliability-based frog encoding is introduced that supervises the algorithm to concentrate on more reliable network topologies. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on a 136-bus electricity distribution network.

Abstract: This paper is concerned about real-time modeling and identification of dynamically changing loads in power systems. An exponential dynamic load model was proposed earlier and was well accepted by several investigators who worked on this paper. This paper considers this model and identifies its parameters in real-time based on synchronously sampled measurements. An unscented Kalman filter is used to track the unknown parameters of the exponential dynamic load model. This paper first implements and tests the proposed method using simulated measurements. The method is then applied to actual recorded utility measurements to identify and track the bus load of the utility. The results are found to be promising, suggesting viability of tracking dynamic load models for online applications.

Abstract: Grid security and open markets are two major smart grid goals. Transparency of market data facilitates a competitive and efficient energy environment. But it may also reveal critical physical system information. Recovering the grid topology based solely on publicly available market data is explored here. Real-time energy prices are typically calculated as the Lagrange multipliers of network-constrained economic dispatch; that is, via a linear program (LP) typically solved every 5 min. Since the grid Laplacian matrix is a parameter of this LP, someone apart from the system operator could try inferring this topology-related matrix upon observing successive LP dual outcomes. It is first shown that the matrix of spatio-temporal prices can be factored as the product of the inverse Laplacian times a sparse matrix. Leveraging results from sparse matrix decompositions, topology recovery schemes with complementary strengths are subsequently formulated. Solvers scalable to high-dimensional and streaming market data are devised. Numerical validation using synthetic and real-load data on the IEEE 30-bus grid provide useful input for current and future market designs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a distributed economic dispatch (ED) strategy based on projected gradient and finite-time average consensus algorithms for smart grid systems. Both conventional thermal generators and wind turbines are taken into account in the ED model. By decomposing the centralized optimization into optimizations at local agents, a scheme is proposed for each agent to iteratively estimate a solution of the optimization problem in a distributed manner with limited communication among neighbors. It is theoretically shown that the estimated solutions of all the agents reach consensus of the optimal solution asymptomatically. This scheme also brings some advantages, such as plug-and-play property. Different from most existing distributed methods, the private confidential information, such as gradient or incremental cost of each generator, is not required for the information exchange, which makes more sense in real applications. Besides, the proposed method not only handles quadratic, but also nonquadratic convex cost functions with arbitrary initial values. Several case studies implemented on six-bus power system, as well as the IEEE 30-bus power system, are discussed and tested to validate the proposed method.

Abstract: In a residential area where many households have installed rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units, there is a reverse power flow from the households to the substation when the power generation from PV units is larger than the aggregate load of the households. This reverse power flow causes the voltage rise problem. In this paper, we study the use of demand side management to mitigate the voltage rise problem. We propose an autonomous energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which schedules the operation of deferrable loads to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse power flow. The proposed algorithm shifts the operation of deferrable loads from peak consumption hours to hours with high-power generation from the PV units. We use stochastic programming to formulate an energy consumption scheduling problem, which takes into account the uncertainty related to the amount of power generation from PV units. The formulated cost function comprises a monetary cost for energy consumption, the revenue from energy export, and an external cost for the voltage rise. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can mitigate the voltage rise problem in areas with high penetration of PV units and reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load.

Abstract: This paper studies the solution of joint energy storage (ES) ownership sharing between multiple shared facility controllers (SFCs) and those dwelling in a residential community. The main objective is to enable the residential units (RUs) to decide on the fraction of their ES capacity that they want to share with the SFCs of the community in order to assist them in storing electricity, e.g., for fulfilling the demand of various shared facilities. To this end, a modified auction-based mechanism is designed that captures the interaction between the SFCs and the RUs so as to determine the auction price and the allocation of ES shared by the RUs that governs the proposed joint ES ownership. The fraction of the capacity of the storage that each RU decides to put into the market to share with the SFCs and the auction price are determined by a noncooperative Stackelberg game formulated between the RUs and the auctioneer. It is shown that the proposed auction possesses the incentive compatibility and the individual rationality properties, which are leveraged via the unique Stackelberg equilibrium solution of the game. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: The emergence of smart grid technology is offering a unique opportunity to improve power management in intelligent buildings through the integration and optimization of distributed energy resources and loads. In this paper, the interactions of multiple intelligent buildings in the context of energy market, as well as distributed energy generation and storage facilities, is considered. Within a time horizon divided into multiple periods in which generations and loads are forecasted, each building in a certain period may experience power surplus or deficit. While any deficit can be obtained from the market, buildings may consider selling their unused power back to the market. A dynamic pricing model based on differential game theory is set up in order to study the interactions of these players and how they maximize their profit. We also propose algorithms to implement and operate the system over the time horizon considered. Furthermore, numerical studies are performed to validate the model and algorithms.

Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for coordination of flywheel energy storage matrix system (FESMS) cooperated with wind farm. A simple and distributed ratio consensus algorithm is proposed to solve FESMS dispatch problem. The algorithm is based on average consensus for both undirected and unbalanced directed graphs. Average consensus is guaranteed in unbalanced digraphs by updating the weight matrix with both its row sums and column sums being 1. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Abstract: Accelerated development of eco-friendly technologies such as renewable energy, smart grids, and electric transportation will shape the future of electric power generation and supply. Accordingly, the power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible, which impact the system sizing. However, integrating these considerations into the design stage can be complex. Under these terms, this paper presents a novel model based on mixed integer linear programming for the optimization of a hybrid renewable energy system with a battery energy storage system in residential microgrids in which the demand response of available controllable appliances is coherently considered in the proposed optimization problem with reduced calculation burdens. The model takes into account the intrinsic stochastic behavior of renewable energy and the uncertainty involving electric load prediction, and thus proper stochastic models are considered. This paper investigates the effect of load flexibility on the component sizing of the system for a residential microgrid in Okinawa. Also under consideration are different operation scenarios emulating technical limitations and several uncertainty levels.

Abstract: Integration of a large number of flexible consumers in a smart grid requires a scalable power balancing strategy. We formulate the control problem as an optimization problem to be solved repeatedly by the aggregator in a model predictive control framework. To solve the large-scale control problem in real-time requires decomposition methods. We propose a decomposition method based on Douglas-Rachford splitting to solve this large-scale control problem. The method decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, e.g., locally by each unit connected to an aggregator. The total power consumption is controlled through a negotiation procedure between all cooperating units and an aggregator that coordinates the overall objective. For large-scale systems, this method is faster than solving the original problem and can be distributed to include an arbitrary number of units. We show how different aggregator objectives are implemented and provide simulations of the controller including the computational performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized energy management system for the coordinated operation of networked microgirds (MGs) in a distribution system. In the grid-connected mode, the distribution network operator and each MG are considered as distinct entities with individual objectives to minimize their own operation costs. It is assumed that both dispatchable and renewable energy source-based distributed generators (DGs) exist in the distribution network and the networked MGs. In order to coordinate the operation of all entities, we apply a decentralized bi-level algorithm to solve the problem with the first level to conduct negotiations among all entities and the second level to update the non-converging penalties. In the islanded mode, the objective of each MG is to maintain a reliable power supply to its customers. In order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumption, we formulate the problems as two-stage stochastic programs. The first stage is to determine base generation setpoints based on the forecasts and the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based on the realized scenarios. Case studies of a distribution system with networked MGs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in both grid-connected and islanded modes.

Abstract: Hybridization of energy storages (ESs) with different ramp rates helps minimization of system bus voltage variation and extension of ESs lifetime in dc microgrids. Hybrid ES system (HESS) control is normally realized with centralized coordination. In this paper, HESS distributed control, which is independent of the communication link, is proposed to enhance system reliability. All ESs are configured as slack terminals to regulate system bus voltage with droop control. System net power decomposition and ESs power sharing are realized with localized low-pass filter (LPF) applied to ESs with low-ramp rates. The relationship between LPF cut-off frequency and ES ramp rate is elaborated in detail. However, bus voltage deviation and power tracking errors are the main drawbacks of HESS distributed control. Multilevel energy management system (EMS) is thus proposed to enhance system control accuracy. HESS distributed control is scheduled as the primary control. Bus voltage restoration and power sharing compensation are applied in secondary control to eliminate the voltage deviation and power tracking errors, respectively. In tertiary control, autonomous state of charge (SoC) recovery is implemented to limit SoC variation of ES with high-ramp rate. A lab-scale dc microgrid is developed to verify the proposed multilevel EMS for HESS control.

Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal bidding strategy problem of a commercial virtual power plant (CVPP), which comprises of distributed energy resources (DERs), battery storage systems (BSS), and electricity consumers, and participates in the day-ahead (DA) electricity market. The ultimate goal of the CVPP is the maximization of the DA profit in conjunction with the minimization of the anticipated real-time production and the consumption of imbalance charges. A three-stage stochastic bilevel optimization model is formulated, where the uncertainty lies in the DA CVPP DER production and load consumption, as well as in the rivals' offer curves and real-time balancing prices. Demand response schemes are also incorporated into the virtual power plant (VPP) portfolio. The proposed bi-level model consists of an upper level that represents the VPP profit maximization problem and a lower level that represents the independent system operator (ISO) DA market-clearing problem. This bi-level optimization problem is converted into a mixed-integer linear programing model using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and the strong duality theory. Finally, the risk associated with the VPP profit variability is explicitly taken into account through the incorporation of the conditional value-atrisk metric. Simulations on the Greek power system demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: This paper presents an energy scheduling algorithm for a small-scale microgrid serving small to medium size commercial buildings (the building microgrid) that includes conventional and renewable distributed generation resources, energy storage, and both linear and nonlinear loads. An essential study objective is to mitigate power quality issues through coordinating the operating schedules of sensitive devices in the building microgrid. The proposed energy scheduling algorithm is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem where power quality requirements are modeled in the constraints. The algorithm also involves validation with the harmonics and dynamic event simulations. Case studies have been performed with realistic model parameters to verify the performance of the algorithm. This paper results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in managing voltage and frequency deviations, as well as harmonic distortions. In the transaction-based control framework, the proposed algorithm can be used to aggregate device transaction bids and facilitate the buildings-to-grid integration.

Abstract: Time-of-use electricity pricing is touted as one of the solutions toward optimal load distribution in the future of smart grid. However, the benefits of such an approach are limited as human electricity usage can often be described as inelastic in nature, or not sensitive to pricing in economic theory. Water heating constitutes one of the largest components of such usage. This paper proposes technology to enable residential water heating to be converted from an inelastic to an elastic demand, which would respond to pricing incentives. This is accomplished by utilizing consumer hot water use patterns combined with thermal storage to calculate a user-specific temperature profile. Results demonstrated that such an approach could not only reduce electrical water heating costs significantly and allow for realization of large-scale grid benefits, but also improve customer experience as thermal storage capability would enable more hot water to be delivered at times of peak consumption.

Abstract: An energy management system for stand-alone microgrid consisting of a wind turbine (WT) generator, a diesel generator, an energy storage system (ESS), and a sea water desalination system is proposed in this paper. The coordinated control of the distributed generations and ESS is researched with two operation modes. Then, a real-time rolling horizon energy management method is presented based on hour-ahead wind speed forecast. The operation mode of the microgrid system and the reference output power of WT generator are determined according to the forecasted wind speed and state of charge of the ESS, which can achieve the goal of maximizing utilization of wind energy and minimizing utilization of diesel generator on the basis of system stable operation. The proposed energy management method has been tested on the real-time digital simulator system. The results clearly verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate how network tariffs, such as the traditional energy-based network tariff (EBT) and power-based network tariffs (PBT), would affect the distribution system and the customers' incentives to schedule their demand under an hourly electricity pricing scheme. For this purpose, a mixed integer linear programming model has been developed and used in a case study to schedule the load demand for 100 residential customers with the objective being minimization of their electricity cost. The results have shown that by scheduling the flexible loads, customers could save up to (sic)119/year under EBT and (sic)127/year under PBT. If more than 25% of the customers were price-responsive under the EBT, the peak demand could be increased, while it could be reduced by 4% if all customers were responsive under the PBT. With plug-in electric vehicles, the possible benefits were found to be higher for both customers and the distribution system operator for the case with PBT compared with EBT.

Abstract: A spatio-temporal method for producing very-shortterm parametric probabilistic wind power forecasts at a large number of locations is presented. Smart grids containing tens, or hundreds, of wind generators require skilled very-short-term forecasts to operate effectively and spatial information is highly desirable. In addition, probabilistic forecasts are widely regarded as necessary for optimal power system management as they quantify the uncertainty associated with point forecasts. Here, we work within a parametric framework based on the logit-normal distribution and forecast its parameters. The location parameter for multiple wind farms is modeled as a vector-valued spatio-temporal process and the scale parameter is tracked by modified exponential smoothing. A state-of-the-art technique for fitting sparse vector autoregressive models is employed to model the location parameter and demonstrates numerical advantages over conventional vector autoregressive models. The proposed method is tested on a dataset of 5 min mean wind power generation at 22 wind farms in Australia. Five-min ahead forecasts are produced and evaluated in terms of point, and probabilistic forecast skill scores and calibration. Conventional autoregressive and vector autoregressive models serve as benchmarks.

Abstract: Microgrids can provide the most promising means of integrating large amounts of distributed sources into the power grid and can supply reliable power to critical loads. A generalized control framework is required to regulate microgrid voltage and frequency, maintain system stability, maintain power quality, and manage distributed generations. A microgrid control framework for power management and voltage and frequency regulation is proposed in this paper. The proposed method, virtual droop control, is described and formulated and compared with the existing natural droop control technique. Unit commitment algorithm has also been implemented to manage nonrenewable sources to improve the system efficiency. The proposed technique operates the microgrid at a constant voltage and frequency, and uses communication for power sharing. It also provides the means to operate the microgrid in case of lost communication and sabotage on communication network. The proposed method has been applied to Fort Sill microgrid and the modeling results have been compared with natural droop control technique. A laboratory setup, which consists of a 100 kW natural gas generator, 56 kWh Li-ion based battery with 250 kW inverter, and 100 kW load bank, has been built and tested. The results of the setup have been provided, which confirms the viability of the proposed technique.

Abstract: This paper proposes multiagent supervisory control for precise power management in isolated dc microgrids. Two power management aspects are considered: 1) equal power sharing, which is realized via a proposed distributed equal power sharing algorithm; and 2) optimal power dispatch, which is achieved through a proposed distributed equal incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional advantage of the ability to restore the average system voltage to its nominal value. The proposed algorithms are based on the application of the average consensus theory along with voltage sensitivity analysis. Each distributed generation (DG) unit exchanges information with its neighbors, thus locally updating its no-load voltage setting to achieve the supervisory control objectives. The incorporation of DG droop-based control renders the proposed algorithms fully distributed with a reduced number of agents. The stability of the proposed algorithms is addressed, as well as the convergence of the proposed DEIC algorithm. Real-time OPAL-RT simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in a hardware-in-the-loop application.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an advanced battery management system (BMS). The basic concept is to divide each series battery array into sub-arrays where each battery is individually monitored and managed. The proposed BMS continuously monitors the voltage, current, and energy of each battery. Based on these measurements, the BMS can calculate individual state of charge (SoC) levels and C-rates. Furthermore, the system has the capability to isolate each individual battery to apply different charging profiles and advanced diagnostics to detect the correct problems. Pulsed charging is deployed using different duty cycles for SoC balancing. The isolated battery is bypassed to maintain uninterrupted supply to the load despite reduced series array voltage. An unidirectional dc-dc boost converter maintains a constant output voltage level to the load, regardless of the number of batteries connected, until the problem is corrected. A hardware implementation of the proposed BMS is explained in detail. The performance of the system is tested experimentally under different loading conditions, including heavy pulsed loads.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel measurement procedure for load flow analysis in medium voltage (MV) smart grids. The new approach is based on power measurements at low voltage (LV) side of MV/LV distribution substations. Such measurements are carried out by means of power quality analyzers. If compared with the load flow methods based on measurements at the MV side, the proposed approach has a lower cost and it offers an equally reliable measurement system. The proposed algorithm takes the basic concept of the current summation backward/forward method; some modifications are introduced to use LV load powers measurements. To this aim, the MV/LV power transformer is properly modeled and taken into account in the algorithm. The proposed approach is validated by means of both simulations and experimental measurements; the test system is the MV distribution grid of Ustica Island, Italy. First, the proposed algorithm is compared with the MATLAB/Simulink load flow tool, which is based on the traditional Newton-Raphson method. Second, a comparison is carried out between the proposed method and the measurement data collected in the actual MV network of Ustica. Such comparison takes into account the uncertainties of both proposed method, and experimental active and reactive MV power measurements.

Abstract: The proliferation of technologies such as combine heat and power systems has accelerated the integration of energy resources in energy hubs. Besides, the advances in smart grid technologies motivate the electricity utility companies toward developing demand response (DR) programs to influence the electricity usage behavior of the customers. In this paper, we modify the conventional DR programs in smart grid to develop an integrated DR (IDR) program for multiple energy carriers fed into an energy hub in smart grid, namely a smart energy (S. E.) hub. In our model, the IDR program is formulated for the electricity and natural gas networks. The interaction among the S. E. hubs is modeled as an ordinal potential game with unique Nash equilibrium. Besides, a distributed algorithm is developed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results show that in addition to load shifting, the customers in the S. E. hubs can participate in the IDR program by switching the energy resources (e.g., from the electricity to the natural gas) during the peak hours. Moreover, the IDR program can increase the S. E. hubs' daily payoff and the utility companies' daily profit.

Abstract: To fully support information management among various stakeholders in smart grid domains, how to establish secure communication sessions has become an important issue for smart grid environments. In order to support secure communications between smart meters and service providers, key management for authentication becomes a crucial security topic. Recently, several key distribution schemes have been proposed to provide secure communications for smart grid. However, these schemes do not support smart meter anonymity and possess security weaknesses. This paper utilizes an identity-based signature scheme and an identity-based encryption scheme to propose a new anonymous key distribution scheme for smart grid environments. In the proposed scheme, a smart meter can anonymously access services provided by service providers using one private key without the help of the trusted anchor during authentication. In addition, the proposed scheme requires only a few of computation operations at the smart meter side. Security analysis is conducted to prove the proposed scheme is secure under random oracle model.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully distributed control strategy for the management of micro-storage devices that perform energy arbitrage. For large storage populations, the problem can be approximated as a differential game with infinite players (mean field game). Through the resolution of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs), it is possible to determine, as a fixed point, the optimal feedback strategy for each player and the resulting price of energy if that strategy is applied. Once this price is calculated, it can be communicated to the devices, which are able to independently determine their optimal charge profile. Simulation results are provided, calculating the fixed point through numerical integration of the PDEs. The original model is then extended in order to consider additional elements, such as multiple population of devices and demand uncertainty.

Abstract: This paper aims to set up a probabilistic framework to assess the value of a portfolio of demand response (DR) customers under both operational (short-term) and planning (long-term) uncertainties through real options (ROs) modeling borrowed from financial theory. In an operational setting, DR is considered as an RO contract allowing an aggregator seeking to maximize its revenue to sell flexible demand in the day-ahead market and balance its energy portfolio in the balancing markets. Sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS) are used to value DR activation decisions based on market price evolutions. These decisions combine DR physical characteristics and portfolio scheduling optimization, whereby the aggregator chooses to exercise only the contracts probabilistically leading to a profit, also considering the physical payback effects of load recovery. Sensitivity of profits to changing market conditions and payback characteristics is also assessed. In an investment setting, subject to long-term uncertainties, the value of an investment in DR-enabling technology is quantified through the Datar-Mathews RO approach that applies hybrid SMCS and scenario analysis. The results show how the flexibility value of DR can be highlighted by modeling it as RO, particularly in high volatile markets, and how realistic inclusion of payback characteristics significantly decrease the benefits estimated for DR. In addition, the proposed RO framework generally allows hedging of the risks incurred under long-term and short-term uncertainties.

Abstract: We present goal-seeking obstacle and collision evasion, an approach to resilient multicast routing for smart grid applications based on principles from robust flocking theory. We assert that analogies exist between the flocking principles of goal seeking, obstacle evasion, collision avoidance and behavioral transitions, and the routing goals of low latency, buffer overflow management, and adaptability in the presence of changing network conditions. Our multicast routing framework employs an underlying dynamical systems model convenient for integration with representations of power system dynamics to produce an overall cyber-physical smart grid description. Through simulations and comparisons with prior art we demonstrate how our approach provides insight on effective multicast routing principles to promote resilience in faulted power systems in the presence of congestion and denial-of-service attacks on communications infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper aims at minimizing economical cost of a microgrid by jointly scheduling various devices, e.g., appliances, batteries, thermal generators, and wind turbines. To properly model the system, the characteristics of all devices is fully investigated; in particular, the chance constraint is introduced to capture the randomness of power generation of wind turbines. Then, this problem is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer program with coupling constraints. In order to solve this problem efficiently, it is decoupled via dual decomposition into a set of sub-problems to be solved distributedly on each appliance, battery, and generator. While the scheduling of generator is well studied in literature, this paper specially proposes an efficient method for appliance scheduling, and then employs Benders' decomposition for battery scheduling. The performance of the proposed approach is verified by numerical simulations.

Abstract: Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is a precious operation strategy that can improve the system from different aspects including total cost, reliability, and power quality. Nevertheless, the high complexity of the new smart grids has resulted in much uncertainty in the DFR problem that necessities the use of a sufficient stochastic framework to deal with them. In this way, this paper proposes a new stochastic framework based on cloud theory to account the uncertainties associated with multiobjective DFR problem from the reliability point of view. Cloud theory is constructed based on fuzzy theory and probability idea. In comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation method, cloud models can give more information on the uncertainties associated with the problem. This special aspect of cloud models makes it possible to integrate the fuzziness and randomness of qualitative concepts through the cloud drops and then transforms them to the quantitative model. In order to solve the proposed problem, a fast and powerful optimization technique is required. To deal with this issue, a new optimization algorithm designated as theta-bat algorithm is proposed in this paper. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method are examined on the 32-bus and 69-bus IEEE distribution test system.

Abstract: A framework for real-time (RT) charging management of an electric vehicle aggregator (EVA) participating in electric energy and regulation markets is proposed. The developed models, which assign charging set points to the electric vehicles (EVs) based on evolving EV charging priorities, are formulated as linear programs that can be solved very fast. A model of the most common (constant current-constant voltage) battery charging method is also presented. A case study is examined, where an EVA representing 1000 EVs participates in the day-ahead and RT energy and regulation markets, and manages the RT charging of the EVs in his fleet based on the developed framework. Through this approach, conclusions on the impact of the charging priority parameterization for the RT EV charging management, the value of the dynamic regulation signal on the reliable EV participation in the regulation market, and the impact of the detailed battery modelling are derived.

Abstract: In this paper, stochastic optimization of economic dispatch (ED) and interruptible load management is investigated using short-term distributional forecast of wind farm generation. Specifically, using the statistical information of wind farm generation extracted from historical data, a Markov chainbased distributional forecast model for wind farm generation is developed in a rigorous optimization framework, in which the diurnal nonstationarity and the seasonality of wind generation are accounted for by constructing multiple finite-state Markov chains for each epoch of 3 h and for each individual month. Based on this distributional forecast model, the joint optimization of ED and interruptible load management is cast as a stochastic optimization problem. Additionally, a robust ED is formulated using an uncertainty set constructed based on the proposed distributional forecast, aiming to minimize the system cost for worst cases. The proposed stochastic ED is compared with four other ED schemes: 1) the robust ED; 2) deterministic ED using the persistence wind generation forecast model; 3) scenario-based stochastic ED; and 4) deterministic ED, in which perfect wind generation forecasts are used. Numerical studies, using the IEEE Reliability Test System-1996 and realistic wind measurement data from an actual wind farm, demonstrate the significant benefits obtained by leveraging the Markov chain-based distributional forecast and the interruptible load management.

Abstract: We study the demand response (DR) of geo-distributed data centers (DCs) using smart grid's pricing signals set by local electric utilities. The geo-distributed DCs are suitable candidates for the DR programs due to their huge energy consumption and flexibility to distribute their energy demand across time and location, whereas the price signal is well-known for DR programs to reduce the peak-to-average load ratio. There are two dependencies that make the pricing design difficult: 1) dependency among utilities; and 2) dependency between DCs and their local utilities. Our proposed pricing scheme is constructed based on a two-stage Stackelberg game in which each utility sets a real-time price to maximize its own profit in Stage I and based on these prices, the DCs' service provider minimizes its cost via workload shifting and dynamic server allocation in Stage II. For the first dependency, we show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium. For the second dependency, we propose an iterative and distributed algorithm that can converge to this equilibrium, where the "right prices" are set for the "right demands." We also verify our proposal by trace-based simulations, and results show that our pricing scheme significantly outperforms other baseline schemes in terms of flattening the power demand over time and space.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fault location method for single-phase microgrids. In order to locate a fault, a feature specific to the fault location is found, namely the maximum oscillation magnitude of the transient voltage signal induced by the fault. Our theoretical study and extensive simulations demonstrate that there is an approximated linear relationship between the maximum magnitude of the transient signal observed by a sensor, and the distance between the sensor and the fault location. Based on the discovered relationship, microgrid topology and sensor location information, we have designed an algorithm capable of locating the fault in the single-phase microgrids. The proposed fault location method has been implemented and validated through simulations in Electro-Magnetic Transients Program and MATLAB. The average localization error is less than 10% in the evaluation results, which manifests the significance of the novel method, as there is little research done for fault location in single-phase microgrids.

Abstract: A time-delay switch (TDS) attack on a control system is caused by adversaries that strategically imbed time delays into such systems. TDS attacks can make a control system, or more specifically a distributed power control system, unstable. Time delays can be introduced in the sensing loop (SL) or control lines. This paper describes a novel, simple, and effective method to thwart TDS attacks on SL. The proposed method works by augmenting the controller with a time-delay estimator to estimate any time delays. The modified controller controls the system under TDS attack. Also, the time-delay estimator will track time delays introduced by an adversary using a modified model reference control with an indirect supervisor and a modified least mean square minimization technique.

Abstract: In this paper, the design of an event-driven middleware for general purpose services in smart grid (SG) is presented. The main purpose is to provide a peer-to-peer distributed software infrastructure to allow the access of new multiple and authorized actors to SGs information in order to provide new services. To achieve this, the proposed middleware has been designed to be: 1) event-based; 2) reliable; 3) secure from malicious information and communication technology attacks; and 4) to enable hardware independent interoperability between heterogeneous technologies. To demonstrate practical deployment, a numerical case study applied to the whole U.K. distribution network is presented, and the capabilities of the proposed infrastructure are discussed.

Abstract: A salient feature of a renewable energy power supply system (REPSS) on islands is the high level of uncertainties caused by high penetration of volatile power sources, such as wind and solar photovoltaic farms. This creates large forecast errors under some conditions and makes the fixed time-scale dispatch impotent in maintaining system reliability. To tackle this challenge, a time-scale adaptive dispatch method is developed in this paper. The time-scale for dispatch REPSS on islands is adjusted online according to the confidence interval of forecast error predicted by neural network. Extensive tests have validated the effectiveness of the presented method in offsetting the uncertainties in the system and improving the system reliability.

Abstract: The problem of dynamic pricing of electricity in a retail market is considered. A Stackelberg game is used to model interactions between a retailer and its customers; the retailer sets the day-ahead hourly price of electricity and consumers adjust real-time consumptions to maximize individual consumer surplus. For thermostatic demands, the optimal aggregated demand is shown to be an affine function of the day-ahead hourly price. A complete characterization of the tradeoffs between consumer surplus and retail profit is obtained. The Pareto front of achievable tradeoffs is shown to be concave, and each point on the Pareto front is achieved by an optimal day-ahead hourly price. Effects of integrating renewables and local storage are analyzed. It is shown that benefits of renewable integration all go to the retailer when the capacity of renewable is relatively small. As the capacity increases beyond a certain threshold, the benefit from renewable that goes to consumers increases.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time price (RTP)-based demand-response (DR) algorithm for achieving optimal load control of devices in a facility by forming a virtual electricity-trading process, where the energy management center of the facility is the virtual retailer (leader) offering virtual retail prices, from which devices (followers) are supposed to purchase energy. A one-leader, N-follower Stackelberg game is formulated to capture the interactions between them, and optimization problems are formed for each player to help in selecting the optimal strategy. The existence of a unique Stackelberg equilibrium that provides optimal energy demands for each device was demonstrated. The simulation analysis showed that the Stackelberg game-based DR algorithm is effective for achieving the optimal load control of devices in response to RTP changes with a trivial computation burden.

Abstract: The smart grid is driving the deployment of networked components within the traditional power grid to achieve greater reliability and control. However, those cyber components are creating new security vulnerabilities that could lead to significant disruptions if exploited maliciously. We propose a comprehensive cost model designed to assist in the selection of responses to malicious attacks on an advanced metering infrastructure. The cost model reflects the costs of response actions due to outages in the distribution grid, disruptions of the electricity market, and violations of contractual agreements among stakeholders. We also present a realistic implementation of the cost model using ArcGIS for topology generation and GridLAB-D for grid simulation. The cost model is a step forward toward achievement of automated resilience in the smart grid. It also provides comprehensive modeling for system dynamics and operation costs, while relieving utilities from the burden of manually assigning costs for response actions and modeling attacker steps.

Abstract: The integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources requires increased flexibility in the operation of the electric grid. Storage, broadly speaking, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over time; network, on the other hand, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over geographical locations. The optimal control of storage networks in stochastic environments is an important open problem. The key challenge is that, even in small networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control problems on continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality and are intractable in general settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is known to give optimal or provably near-optimal performance for this problem. This paper provides an efficient algorithm to solve this problem with performance guarantees. We study the operation of storage networks, i.e., a storage system interconnected via a power network. An online algorithm, termed online modified greedy algorithm, is developed for the corresponding constrained stochastic control problem. A sub-optimality bound for the algorithm is derived and a semidefinite program is constructed to minimize the bound. In many cases, the bound approaches zero so that the algorithm is near-optimal. A task-based distributed implementation of the online algorithm relying only on local information and neighborhood communication is then developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical examples verify the established theoretical performance bounds and demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm.

Abstract: Wide-area monitoring and control (WAMC) systems based on synchrophasor data streams are becoming more and more significant to the operation of the smart power grid. Reliable and secure communication, and higher quality of service (very low latency, high availability, etc.) of data are crucial to the success of WAMC systems. However, the IEEE standard for synchrophasor data communication (IEEE Standard C37.118.2-2011) does not place any restrictions on the choice of transport layer protocols. In light of this, we examine the communication between synchrophasors [phasor measurement units (PMUs)] and phasor data concentrators to analyze potential security vulnerabilities present at the transport layer, and investigate the advantages and disadvantages of both the TCP and UDP protocols, respectively, with an emphasis on security issues. Demonstrations of attacks related to these security vulnerabilities are shown in lab environment and underlying mechanisms are

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for a dc distribution system for power system integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The dc distribution system is intended to integrate electric vehicles in a parking lot with an ac grid through bidirectional dc-dc converters (battery chargers) and a central voltage-sourced converter. Using an online constrained optimization algorithm, the proposed EMS manages the power flow within the dc system. Thus, the PEV owners can charge or discharge their batteries based on the state-of-charge of the batteries and their upcoming trip plans. The EMS offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: 1) the fast energy exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange time; and 2) the optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues through selling their stored energy. The proposed EMS seamlessly handles all charging/discharging requests from the PEV owners with different options and, at the same time, it takes into account the power demand and power generation limits of the ac grid to preclude under-voltage, over-voltage, and reverse power flow issues. Various energy exchange scenarios are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS.

Abstract: In the restructured power industry, demand responsiveness is a key factor whose importance will be boosted due to the impetus provided by the development of smart grids. Within the context of pool-based electricity markets, this paper addresses the incorporation of price-responsive demand in multiperiod energy scheduling driven by consumer payment minimization. Although consumer payment minimization has drawn considerable attention mainly in an operational setting and also recently under a planning framework, available models and solution approaches typically neglect demand-side participation. The proposed scheduling model considers a marginal pricing scheme as well as the effects of both network constraints and intertemporal constraints associated with generation operation. Modeling demand-side participation leads to bilinear payment terms that significantly increase the mathematical complexity of the optimization process. The resulting problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel program for which no exact solution technique is currently available. This paper presents a novel methodology by which the original bilevel and bilinear problem is converted into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear program suitable for efficient off-the-shelf software. This transformation is based on the application of duality theory of linear programming, integer algebra, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions. The proposed approach has been successfully applied to the IEEE 118-bus system.

Abstract: Price-based management of distributed energy resources within microgrids is continuously gaining ground due to scalability and privacy limitations of centralized architectures. However, the concentration of flexible loads' response to the lowest-priced periods yields inefficient solutions. A previously proposed measure imposing a flexibility restriction on flexible loads might raise acceptability and feasibility concerns by the users. This paper develops a novel fully price-based approach where this hard restriction is replaced by a soft nonlinear price signal. This signal is customized to the operating properties of the different flexible load types by penalizing the square of the demand and the duration of cycle delay of loads with continuously adjustable power levels and deferrable cycles, respectively. This approach is shown to produce more efficient solutions than the flexibility restriction measure for both types of loads. For the latter type, randomization of the nonlinear prices brings additional benefits, especially in low operating diversity cases. These contributions are supported by case studies on a microgrid test system with electric vehicles and wet appliances used as representative examples of the above flexible load types.

Abstract: Droop control strategy enables the microgrid switch between grid-connected and islanded mode flexibly, and easily realizes the "plug and play" function of distributed generation and loads, which has recently aroused great concerns. However, small disturbances may occur during the changing process and eventually yield transient oscillation, thus the focus of microgrid control is how to switch smoothly within different operation modes. In order to improve the dynamic characteristics of an inverter-based microgrid, this paper derived a precise small-signal state-space model of the whole microgrid including droop controller, network, and loads. The key control parameters of the inverter and their optimum ranges, which greatly influence the damping frequency of oscillatory components in the transient response, can be obtained through eigenvalue analysis. In addition, genetic algorithm is introduced to search for optimal settings of the key parameters during time-domain simulation in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed small-signal dynamic model and optimization algorithm, and enhanced the dynamic performance of the microgrid, which can be the reference for parameter design of droop control in low voltage microgrids.

Abstract: This paper proposes an interactive control framework for microgrid interconnections to achieve effective load sharing and guaranteed system-wide small signal stability. In the proposed framework, hierarchical control is performed at three levels operating in different time frames. A model reference control-based scheme is implemented for primary level power sharing, through which the interface inverter of each microgrid is controlled to track a designed reference model. At the secondary level, an interactive droop management scheme is proposed to manage the reference model droop gains based on a distributed stability criterion. At the tertiary level, an ac power flow-based supervisory control strategy is utilized to dispatch the nominal setting to each microgrid central controller (MGCC) for the primary level reference tracking, and broadcast an interaction coefficient to each MGCC so that the droop gains can be managed to guarantee system-wide stability. Numerical analysis of a study system designed based on the IEEE 123-node test feeder demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed interactive control framework.

Abstract: In this paper, the overvoltage problems that might arise from the integration of photovoltaic (PV) panels into low-voltage (LV) distribution networks is addressed. A distributed scheme is proposed that adjusts the reactive and active power output of inverters to prevent or alleviate such problems. The proposed scheme is model-free and makes use of limited communication between the controllers in the form of a distress signal only during emergency conditions. It prioritizes the use of reactive power, while active power curtailment is performed only as a last resort. The behavior of the scheme is studied using dynamic simulations on a single LV feeder and on a larger network composed of 14 LV feeders. Its performance is compared with a centralized scheme based on the solution of an optimal power flow (OPF) problem, whose objective function is to minimize the active power curtailment. The proposed scheme successfully mitigates overvoltage situations due to high PV penetration and performs almost as well as the OPF-based solution with significantly less information and communication requirements.

Abstract: In electric power systems, multiple entities are responsible for ensuring an economic and reliable way of delivering power from producers to consumers. With the increase of variable renewable generation it is becoming increasingly important to take advantage of the individual entities' (and their areas') capabilities for balancing variability. Hence, in this paper, we employ and extend the approximate Newton directions method to optimally coordinate control areas leveraging storage available in one area to balance variable resources in another area with only minimal information exchange among the areas. The problem to be decomposed is a model predictive control problem including generation constraints, energy storage constraints, and AC power flow constraints. Singularity issues encountered when formulating the respective Newton-Raphson steps due to intertemporal constraints are addressed and extensions to the original decomposition method are proposed to improve the convergence rate and required communication of the method.

Abstract: Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are being increasingly deployed to improve monitoring and control of the power grid due to their improved data synchronization and reporting rates in comparison with legacy metering devices. However, one drawback of their higher data rates is the associated increase in bandwidth (for transmission) and storage requirements (for data archives). Fortunately, typical grid behavior can lead to significant compression opportunities for phasor angle measurements. For example, operation of the grid at nearnominal frequency results in small changes in phase angles between frames, and the similarity in frequencies throughout the system results in a high level of correlation between phasor angles of different PMUs. This paper presents several methods for preprocessing of phasor angles that take advantage of these system characteristics, including a new method-frequency compensated difference encoding-that is able to significantly reduce angle data entropy. After the preprocessor stage, the signal is input to an entropy encoder, based on Golomb-Rice codes, that is ideal for high-throughput signal compression. The ability of the proposed methods to compress phase angles is demonstrated using a large corpus of data-over 1 billion phasor angles from 25 data sets-captured during typical and atypical grid conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, an agent-based decentralized control model for islanded microgrids (MGs) is proposed, which consists of a two-layer control structure. The bottom layer is the electrical distribution MG, while the top layer is the communication network composed of agents. An agent is regarded as a local control processor together with communication devices, so agents can collect present states of distributed generators (DGs) and loads when communication lines are added between two layers. Moreover, each agent can also exchange information with its neighboring agents of the network. After information is processed according to control laws, agents adjust the production of DGs to which they connect. Further, a systematic method is presented, which can be used to derive a set of control laws for agents from any given communication network, after the rules to establish the communication network are given. Furthermore, it has been seen that the output power supplied by DGs satisfies the load demand in the MG when agents use the proposed control laws. Finally, the simulation results show that frequency and voltage fluctuations are small and meet the requirements.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time distributed voltage security monitoring framework for large power systems using synchrophasor measurements. The method distributes its major computations among substations and collects results from each substation at the control center to provide a comprehensive voltage security index. At the substation level, two Q-V sensitivity-based voltage security indices, namely, a positive index and a negative index, are calculated from ambient synchrophasor measurements. The indices are estimated using two new algorithms, namely, fast bidirectional sensitivities calculation and bidirectional linearization approximation, using local measurements. These local sensitivities from different substations are collected at the control center level, where wide-area voltage security assessment is carried out to estimate the system proximity to voltage collapse, as well as to identify voltage insecure subareas if any exist. Simulations and numerical studies of the IEEE 118-bus test power system and validated large-scale model of the July 2, 1996 Western American blackout are used to illustrate that the proposed algorithm can detect voltage insecurity effectively in large power systems.

Abstract: In smart grid, residential consumers adopt different load scheduling methods to manage their power consumptions with specific objectives. The conventional load scheduling methods aim to maximize the consumption payoff or minimize the consumption cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of cost efficiency-based residential load scheduling framework to improve the economical efficiency of the residential electricity consumption. The cost efficiency is defined as the ratio of consumer's total consumption benefit to its total electricity payment during a certain period. We develop a cost-efficient load scheduling algorithm for the demand-side's day-ahead bidding process and real-time pricing mechanism by using a fractional programing approach. Results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can effectively reflect and affect user's consumption behavior and achieve the optimal cost-efficient energy consumption profile. For practical consideration, we also take into account the service fee and distributed energy resources (DERs) in our framework, and analyze their impacts on the cost efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly improves consumer's cost efficiency. It is shown that a higher service fee will decrease the cost efficiency, while the integration of DERs can effectively improve the cost efficiency.

Abstract: As the power demand becomes higher all over the world, transmission lines are often carrying electric power near their limits, which can cause power systems to be operated under serious stress. Voltage collapse is one of the more critical problems that impacts power system operational security and many of the recent major blackouts were caused, at least partially, by voltage collapse. Therefore, a fast and accurate voltage stability monitor is necessary for the modern system, together with a fast calculation of possible remedial actions. The development and application of wide-area measurement systems established the foundation of online assessment of voltage stability in large-scale power systems. In this paper, a voltage stability (QV) index based on phasor measurements is used to identify the weak buses and a new parallel optimization method that increases this voltage stability margin is introduced. Results on the IEEE standard systems show the accuracy and efficiency of the methods.

Abstract: The use of distributed generation (DG) resources is seen as a key important factor in improving technical and economic aspects of distribution systems. However, little research exists concerning the optimal location and operation of DGs. This paper proposes a novel method to find simultaneously the optimal location and operation of DGs. The method is developed in two phases, namely Phase 1 and 2. Phase 1 deals with the optimal location of DGs using a multiobjective optimization problem in which active power loss reduction, voltage profile improvement, and voltage regulation are the objectives. A Pareto frontier differential evolution (PDE) algorithm is developed to solve the multiobjective problem. Phase 2 copes with the optimal income of the DGs' owners along with the optimal total payment of the distribution company by adopting a bi-level optimization method with two agents. Game theory is employed to assist in finding optimal contract prices. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using two IEEE, 33-bus, and 69-bus, standard distribution networks. This paper concludes that the proposed method can serve as an accurate tool for practitioners in finding the optimal location and operation strategy of DGs.

Abstract: With sustained growth of intermittent power supplies connected to grid, the randomness and volatility of intermittent power supplies will bring new challenges to power system optimization dispatch. For dealing with the uncertainty of large-scale intermittent power supply, this paper introduces robust optimization theory into optimization dispatch for hybrid wind/photovoltaic/hydro/thermal power systems. Meanwhile in order to make an ideal compromise between reliability and economy of system dispatch, this paper also introduces concept of uncertainty to cover shortcoming of conventional robust optimization which is conservative. A flexible robust optimization with adjustable uncertainty budget dispatch model is built for hybrid power system to achieve coordination between reliability and economy, and then the uncertainty budget decision methods are studied to reduce blindness of uncertainty budget decisions. Moreover, a new compound differential evolution (CDE) algorithm is designed in this paper. The diversity of individuals and convergence speed are taken into account in process of differential evolution (DE) calculation by introducing a series of operations into DE algorithm, such as individual ranking, population dividing, CDE, and population restructuring. Finally, a sample application is carried out to verify the validity and practicability of the model and the method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for enabling the reliability-differentiated services in a residential distribution network with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). A reliability-differentiated pricing mechanism is developed to satisfy the different reliability requirements of the customers while encouraging the customers to consume electricity in such a way that the reliability of the overall distribution system can be enhanced. A dynamic spinning reserve pricing scheme is developed to stimulate PHEVs to participate in spinning reserve by providing economic benefits when the state of the distribution system becomes risky. Based on the formulated reliability-differentiated system, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to coordinate the charging process of PHEVs in a decentralized fashion. At the upper level of the hierarchical game, an evolutionary game is formulated to optimize the management of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity of each PHEV. Under the V2G strategies obtained from the evolutionary game, a noncooperative game is formulated at the lower level to coordinate the charging sequences of PHEVs. Various simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical game approach. The simulation results show that the hierarchical game approach is effective in enhancing both reliability of the distribution system and economic profits of the PHEVs.

Abstract: By intruding on the substations and control center of the supervisory control and data acquisition system, trip commands can be sent to intelligent electronic devices that control the power system breakers. Reliability of the power system can be impacted through the cyberattacks. In this paper, a modified semi-Markov process (SMP) model is used to describe the procedures of normal and penetration attacks against the intrusion tolerant system. By modeling the transition probabilities between the SMP states and sojourn time of each SMP state, the mean times to compromise the normal and penetration attacks are calculated. With increased probabilities of breaker trips resulted from the cyberattacks, the loss of load probabilities are evaluated based on IEEE reliability test system 79. When the level of attack increases or the level of defense in the system decreases, the simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable.

Abstract: Cooperation between the controllable load, such as electrical vehicles (EVs) and the generation, provides the power system new operating strategies. A novel hierarchical charge control framework is proposed based on the Benders decomposition for large populations of EVs. The grid, unit, and accurate EV constraints can be considered. On the upper level, the cooperative dispatch scheme between the generation and the EV aggregators is obtained. On the lower level, the feasibility of the scheme is checked with EV constraints considered. The levels are coordinated by the Benders cuts. In addition, the distributed approximate Benders cuts is also proposed, which helps to protect user privacy and a three-level framework is developed based on the decentralized control. The case studies on IEEE Reliability Test System have verified the proposed framework and method is valid and feasible. The charge control based on it can minimize the grid operation cost and improve the unit operating efficiency.

Abstract: Smart impedance is a new way to look at hybrid active power filters. As originally proposed in the literature, hybrid active filters were presented to improve the physical limitation of tuned passive filters. A new conditioner named smart impedance is proposed to eliminate the need of passive filter tuning procedure, the whole tuning process is performed electronically. The proposed topology is able to manipulate the displacement power factor and perform multiple frequency harmonic current mitigation at the same time. In weak systems, where the source impedance is not negligible, like in smart grids, smart impedance guaranties the voltage regulation and stability. The smart impedance control strategy uses proportional resonant controller, which allows phase-locked loop-less power system synchronization. Smart impedance system is composed of an active converter, a coupling transformer, and a capacitive unit, arranged as three phase or single phase equipment.

Abstract: The modern railway system is a massive grid connected complex system with distributed active loads (trains), sources (particularly distributed renewable sources), and storage (wayside or on-board storage systems). Its energy management therefore requires the concepts and techniques used for managing energy in the smart grid (SG). Accordingly, the new railway energy management system (REM-S) is developed to integrate on-board, wayside, and coordination services. REM-S is driven by the idea that regeneration, loads, storage, and volatile distributed energy resources should be coordinated dynamically to achieve optimal energy usage. This paper presents the proposed REM-S architecture, which is based on a hybrid centralized-decentralized concept and developed according to SG architecture model framework.

Abstract: This paper describes the application of advanced metering infrastructure data for developing energy forecasting and operational planning services in distribution networks with significant distributed energy resources. This paper describes development of three services designed for use in distribution network energy management systems. These are comprised of a demand forecasting service, an approach for constraint management in distribution networks, and a service for forecasting voltage profiles in the low voltage network. These services could be applied as part of an advanced distribution network management system in order to improve situational awareness and provide early warning of potential network issues. The methodology and its applicability is demonstrated using recorded supervisory control and data acquisition and smart meter data from an existing medium voltage distribution network.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully distributed reactive power optimization algorithm that can obtain the global optimum solution of nonconvex problems for distribution networks (DNs) without requiring a central coordinator. Second-order conic relaxation is used to achieve exact convexification. A fully distributed second-order cone programming solver (D-SOCP) is formulated corresponding to the given division of areas based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which is greatly simplified by exploiting the structure of active DNs. The problem is solved for each area with very little interchange of boundary information between neighboring areas. D-SOCP is extended by using a varying penalty parameter to improve convergence. A proof of its convergence is also given. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated via numerical simulations using the IEEE 69-bus, 123-bus DNs, and a real 1066-bus distribution system.

Abstract: This paper addresses robust frequency control in an islanded ac microgrid (MG). In an islanded MG with renewable sources, load change, wind power fluctuation, and sun irradiation power disturbance as well as dynamical perturbation, such as damping coefficient and inertia constants, can significantly influence the system frequency, and hence the MG frequency control problem faces some new challenges. In response to these challenges, in this paper, H-infinity and mu-synthesis robust control techniques are used to develop the secondary frequency control loop. In the proposed control scheme, some microsources (diesel engine generator, micro turbine, and fuel cell) are assumed to be responsible for balancing the load and power in the MG system. The synthesized H-infinity and mu-controllers are examined on an MG test platform, and the controllers' robustness and performance are evaluated in the presence of various disturbances and parametric uncertainties. The results are compared with an optimal control design. It is shown that the mu-synthesis approach due to considering structured/parametric uncertainties provides better performance than the H-infinity control method.

Abstract: The responses of multiple distributed generation (DG) units and voltage regulating devices, such as tap changers and capacitor banks, for correcting the voltage may lead to operational conflicts and oscillatory transients, where distribution systems are subjected to network reconfiguration and availability of the DG units. Therefore, coordinated voltage control is required to minimize control interactions, while accounting for the impact of structural changes associated with the network. This paper proposes a strategy for coordinating the operation of multiple voltage regulating devices and DG units in medium voltage (MV) distribution systems, under structural changes and DG availability, for effective voltage control. The proposed strategy aids to minimize the operational conflicts by allowing voltage regulating devices to operate in accordance with the priority scheme designed based on the electrical-distance between voltage regulating devices and DG units, while maximizing the voltage support by the DG units. The proposed coordination scheme is designed to enact with an aid of a substation centered distribution management system for online voltage control. The control actions of proposed coordination strategy are tested on a MV distribution system, derived from the state of New South Wales, Australia, through simulations, and results are reported.

Abstract: Internode line impedance values are essential information for achieving coordinated voltage regulation with distributed energy devices. However, in a low-voltage distribution system, these values are difficult to acquire, especially when the devices are installed in an ad hoc manner by individual users. This paper proposes a novel method for automated impedance estimation based on practically available parameters at the terminal nodes. The distributed energy devices measure and transmit the terminal parameters to a host device. Then, the host device estimates the line impedances based on its impedance model and the collected parameters. For practical implementation, the proposed method is built under several assumptions. For example, it is assumed that the phases of terminal voltages are not synchronized owing to communication latency. Instead, only the magnitude value is incorporated during the impedance estimation. The proposed method is verified via a simulation that assumes a realistic environment.

Abstract: The increasing impact of electric vehicles on distribution networks can be alleviated by smart charging-the shifting of electric vehicle load to times when there is available capacity in the network. This work presents a market mechanism for smart charging that optimally allocates available charging capacity in a way that ensures network stability, while at the same time allowing vehicles to express individual preferences regarding their charging rates. Those who want higher rates can receive these, but must pay a higher price. The mechanism takes into account network-specific constraints such as total network load, voltage drop, and phase unbalance. However, since vehicles have differing impacts on these constraints, this leads to unequal access to the available resources (i.e., charging capacity), resulting in an unfair market. An additional constraint can be introduced to level the playing field for all users, but it leads to a reduction in aggregate performance. The mechanism is shown to be efficient and strategy-proof, so users cannot gain an unfair advantage by misrepresenting their preferences. A series of simulations demonstrate the mechanism's behavior and properties. The results open the door to multi-tiered user plans by demand response aggregators.

Abstract: A scenario-based robust energy management method accounting for the worst-case amount of renewable generation (RG) and load is developed in this paper. The economic and robust model is formulated to maximize the total exchange cost while getting the minimum social benefits cost at the same time. Uncertainty of RG and load is described as an uncertain set produced by interval prediction. Then, the Taguchi's orthogonal array (OA) testing method is used to provide possible testing scenarios. A simple, but practical, search strategy based on OA is designed for solving the optimization problem. By optimizing the worst-case scenario, the energy management solution of the proposed model is robust against most of the possible realizations of the modeled uncertain set by Monte Carlo verification. Numerical cases on the typical microgrid system show the effectiveness of the model and solution strategy. In addition, the influence of exchange electricity price and other parameters are also discussed in the cases.

Abstract: Microgrids with distributed generation (DG) provide a resilient solution in the case of major faults in a distribution system due to natural disasters. This paper proposes a novel distribution system operational approach by forming multiple microgrids energized by DG from the radial distribution system in real-time operations to restore critical loads from the power outage. Specifically, a mixed-integer linear program is formulated to maximize the critical loads to be picked up while satisfying the self-adequacy and operation constraints for the microgrids formation problem by controlling the ON/OFF status of the remotely controlled switch devices and DG. A distributed multiagent coordination scheme is designed via local communications for the global information discovery as inputs of the optimization, which is suitable for autonomous communication requirements after the disastrous event. The formed microgrids can be further utilized for power quality control and can be connected to a larger microgrid before the restoration of the main grids is complete. Numerical results based on modified IEEE distribution test systems validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

Abstract: State estimation (SE) for bulk power systems is traditionally formulated and executed as one integrated problem in a control center energy management system. This simultaneous approach may present challenges when the concerned network consists of different types of systems operated by different entities (independent system operator, transmission system operator, or utility). A leading example is provided by hybrid ac/high voltage dc (HVDC) grids. We propose a distributed solution method where the system network is decomposed into several subsystems on which SE problems are executed separately and are iteratively coordinated through updated boundary information. Hybrid ac/HVDC grids naturally decompose into ac and HVDC subsystems. The proposed method uses a Lagrangian relaxation-based approach and block-wise Gauss-Seidel solution technique to arrive at a solution. The paper describes the method in the context of HVDC grids based on voltage source converter (VSC) technology. It presents a unified modeling framework for monopole/bipole converter configurations, parallel converters, converter-less dc buses, and wind farm connections. Illustrations and test cases are drawn using hybrid ac/HVDC grids formed by IEEE 39 and 300 bus ac grid networks along with monopole and bipole VSC HVDC grids.

Abstract: High penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) as moving loads in power system have drawn increasing concerns about their negative impacts. Due to the spatial-temporal random dynamics of EVs, it is a challenge for identification and positioning of the space and time varying impacts. Most previous studies investigated system-wide EV charging demand based on data analysis with deterministic charging location and time. In this circumstance, this paper proposes a probabilistic model for nodal charging demand based on the spatial-temporal dynamics of moving EVs. Following the introduction to the integrated system with graph theory, a spatial-temporal model of moving EV loads is established based on random trip chain and Markov decision process (MDP). The nodal EV charging demands are derived from the charging probabilities of single and multiple EVs. The system studies show that this model is capable to assess the nodal charging demand due to the spatial-temporal distribution of moving EVs.

Abstract: Microgrid control practice has been dominated by droop control for over a decade. The main reason is that droop control can ensure voltage and frequency stability, and proper sharing of the load among distributed generation units without communication links. However, droop control causes undesirable voltage and frequency deviations. Using a dynamic feedback incorporating washout filters, this letter proposes a novel approach to perform power sharing without any communication links, and without compromising voltage and frequency regulation. Simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC environment validate the performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: In this paper, a new and completely distributed algorithm for integrated volt/var control is presented. The algorithm is based on a multiagent system, which provides distributed intelligence to smart grid. The voltage regulator and shunt capacitor controlled by intelligent agents collaborate to determine the optimal setting for the entire system. The optimization objectives include maintaining the system voltage profile within a specified range, minimizing system loss, and reducing the switching of shunt capacitors. To achieve these objectives, an updated agent-based distributed power flow solver is used. The proposed algorithm is validated through the modified IEEE 34 node test feeder.

Abstract: During the holidays, the power load of the East China Grid dropped significantly, resulting in excess capacitive reactive power, which makes the grid voltage increase significantly. For ultra-high voltage alternating current/direct current (UHVAC/DC) hybrid system, restricted by the minimum input number of the alternating current filter (ACF) in the dc converter stations, multiple dc stations that operate at a low-power transmission mode will inject a large capacitive reactive power to 500 kV ac grid, leading to a dramatic voltage rise. In addition, the 1000 kV UHVAC system may also transport a large capacitive reactive power to 500 kV ac grid during the holidays. In this paper, an optimal reactive power control strategy based on multi-dc power modulation has been proposed. It includes two steps. First, the minimized reactive power interchange control strategy which minimizes the reactive power interchange (RPI) between the UHVAC grid and the 500 kV ac grid has been executed. After that, if the grid voltage still exceeds the upper limit, the multi-dc power modulation is used to minimize the RPI between the dc converter stations and the 500 kV ac grid. The example analysis shows that the proposed optimal reactive power control strategy can effectively optimize the reactive power distribution in the UHVAC/DC hybrid system, thus reasonably controling the grid voltage.

Abstract: Characterization of electric loads provides opportunities to incorporate detailed energy usage information into applications such as protection, efficiency certification, demand response, and energy management. This paper proposes a low computational cost, but yet accurate method, to extract signatures for load classification and characterization. Instead of utilizing digital signal processing and frequency-domain analysis, this paper abstracts the similarity of voltage-current (V-I) trajectories between loads and proposes to map V-I trajectories to a grid of cells with binary values. Graphical signatures can then be extracted for many applications. The proposed method significantly reduces the computational cost compared with existing frequency-domain signature extraction methods. Test results show that an average of over 99% of success rate can be achieved using the proposed signatures.

Abstract: This paper investigates the coordinated voltage control problem for smart distribution grid with the integration of distributed generation (DG). By actively participating in voltage control together with under-load tap changer and shunt capacitors, DG can operate more effectively in the distribution network. The objective of the proposed control method is to minimize the active power loss in the distribution system and to decrease the number of switching device operations while maintaining the grid voltage within the allowable range. Nondispatchable and dispatchable DG are both considered in the control method. To solve the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, the trust region sequential quadratic programming method is integrated with the branch and bound approach to iteratively approximate the optimization with trust region guidance. Numerical tests on a standard 10-kV distribution system, a real 10-kV distribution system in the Sichuan province of China, and the IEEE 13-bus demonstrate the applicability of the proposed coordinated voltage control method.

Abstract: Bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) is normally configured as the slack terminal to regulate system bus voltage for dc microgrid operation in grid-tied state. In case of utility grid fault, BIC is disabled and the system changes to operate in islanded state. Localized battery energy storage (BES) voltage regulation mode (VRM) operation is activated to maintain system power balance. Operating mode changes of BES and BIC during islanding and reconnection might result in system voltage fluctuations and undesirable inrush current. Detailed transition procedure, which is crucial, has seldom been discussed in literature. In this paper, multiple-slack-terminal dc microgrid, in which both BIC and BES operate in VRM with droop control, is implemented to ensure smooth transitions between grid-tied and islanded states. BES operating mode change is eliminated, and thus, system bus voltage is actively regulated throughout the transitions. Contactor is installed at BIC dc side to decouple BIC operating mode change and grid connection. A counter is used to ensure bus voltages at both sides of contactor have been matched stably to minimize inrush current. To enhance system control accuracy, multilevel energy management system is carried out. A lab-scale dc microgrid has been developed for experimental verifications.

Abstract: This paper examines operation models of multiple virtual power plants (multiVPPs), aiming at unified management of the multiVPP through VPP central controller, which reveals the controllability of the VPP as source and load in general. Two operation models will be introduced in this paper: 1) VPP dispatch model; and 2) the game theoretic model for multiVPP dispatch. In the VPP dispatch model, considering interactive coordination between VPP and energy consumers, a demand response model based on time-of-use pricing mechanism and interruptible loads is employed. And then the optimal results of VPP dispatch model are applied in the game theoretic model for multiVPP dispatch. During the process of market competition, the bidding strategy of each VPP is determined by its affordable power output and fuel cost. To solve the inherent variability and unpredictability of the renewable generation sources, the multi-time scale rolling scheduling strategy is adopted. Finally, taking the multiVPP, which consists of various distributed generations and battery storage devices, as an example, variables including transferred load, compensation capacity, optimal bidding strategy, and profits for each VPP are obtained. From the analysis of the results, the method serves as a foundation for dispatch of multiVPP.

Abstract: In this paper, a two-stage procedure is proposed in order to solve the centralized self-healing scheme for electrical distribution systems. The considered self-healing actions are the reconfiguration of the distribution grid and, if needed, node and zone load-shedding. Thus, the proposed procedure determines the status of the switching devices in order to effectively isolate a faulty zone and minimize the number of de-energized nodes and zones, while ensuring that the operative and electrical constraints of the system are not violated. The proposed method is comprised of two stages. The first stage solves a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem in order to obtain the binary decision variables for the self-healing scheme (i.e., the switching device status and energized zones). In the second stage, a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem is solved in order to adjust the steady-state operating point of the topology found in the first stage (i.e., correction of the continuous electrical variables and load-shedding optimization). Commercial optimization solvers are used in the first stage to solve the MILP problem and in the second stage to solve the NLP problem. A 44-node test system and a real Brazilian distribution system with 964-nodes were used to test and verify the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Based on fuzzy mathematics theory, this paper proposes a fuzzy multi-objective optimization model with related constraints to minimize the total economic cost and network loss of microgrid. Uncontrollable microsources are considered as negative load, and stochastic net load scenarios are generated for taking the uncertainty of their output power and load into account. Cooperating with storage devices of the optimal capacity controllable microsources are treated as variables in the optimization process with the consideration of their start and stop strategy. Chaos optimization algorithm is introduced into binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to propose chaotic BPSO (CBPSO). Search capability of BPSO is improved via the chaotic search approach of chaos optimization algorithm. Tests of four benchmark functions show that the proposed CBPSO has better convergence performance than BPSO. Simulation results validate the correctness of the proposed model and the effectiveness of CBPSO.

Abstract: Deployment of data generation devices such as sensors and smart meters have been accelerating toward the vision of smart grid. The volume of data to be collected increases tremendously. Secure, efficient, and scalable data collection becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we present a secure and scalable data communications protocol for smart grid data collection. Under a hierarchical architecture, relay nodes [also known as data collectors (DCs)] collect and convey the data securely from measurement devices to the power operator. While the DCs can verify the integrity, they are not given access to the content, which may pave the way for third party providers to deliver value-added services or even the data collection itself. We further present optimization solutions for minimizing the total data collection time.

Abstract: In recent years, power utilities have been designing and implementing wide area measurement system (WAMS) to provide more intelligent monitoring, control, and protection for the power grid. In this paper, a new method is presented for the optimization of the cost of different parts of the WAMS. In this method, the cost of optimal placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and a phasor data concentrator (PDC), as well as their associated communication infrastructure (CI) are simultaneously considered and minimized. For this purpose, the binary imperialistic competition algorithm is used for the optimal placement of PMUs. Dijkstra's single-source shortest-path algorithm is used to obtain the minimum CI cost. It is also used for optimal placement of PDC. Because of the good adaptability of the proposed methodology to understudy problem, the proposed method is implemented in different conditions of the power network such as N - 1 contingency condition (e.g., a single-line outage or a single-PMU outage), and some important and practical considerations are provided. Practical considerations are the availability of preinstalled PMUs in some buses and the availability of the communication links in some parts of the power network. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on different IEEE standard test systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical system model that captures the decision making processes involved in a network of multiple providers and a large number of consumers in the smart grid, incorporating multiple processes from power generation to market activities and to power consumption. We establish a Stackelberg game between providers and end users, where the providers behave as leaders maximizing their profit and end users act as the followers maximizing their individual welfare. We obtain closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game and prove that a unique equilibrium solution exists. In the large population regime, we show that a higher number of providers help to improve profits for the providers. This is inline with the goal of facilitating multiple distributed power generation units, one of the main design considerations in the smart grid. We further prove that there exist a unique number of providers that maximize their profits, and develop an iterative and distributed algorithm to obtain it. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the solutions and to corroborate the results.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel direct load control model for scheduling the air conditioner loads (ACLs) in the Southern China region. The model has two objectives: 1) to minimize the total deviations between the total scheduled and instructed shed ACLs over the entire dispatch horizon; and 2) to minimize the disturbance of the residents' thermal comfort. The primary contribution of this paper is to employ an International Organization of Standard thermal comfort model to precisely estimate the residents' thermal comfort degree. The secondary contribution of this paper is to propose a new optimization algorithm called fuzzy adaptive imperialist competitive algorithm to effectively solve the model. A case study including three major cities in Southern China is conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: The charging load of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is usually modeled with statistic methods such that the internal physical relationship among the charging factors is ignored. In this paper, a diffusion model for charging power of PEVs is proposed. The proposed model considers the interactions among the charging factors in a mathematical way using the physically-based modeling method. The area control error (ACE) correction problem is studied by applying charging power control of PEVs with the proposed model. By considering the practical conditions, a controller is designed to make efficient use of the distributed charging power of PEVs to meet the requirement of ACE correction. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion model and ACE correction method.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal bidding strategy in the day-ahead market of a microgrid consisting of intermittent distributed generation (DG), storage, dispatchable DG, and price responsive loads. The microgrid coordinates the energy consumption or production of its components, and trades electricity in both day-ahead and real-time markets to minimize its operating cost as a single entity. The bidding problem is challenging due to a variety of uncertainties, including power output of intermittent DG, load variation, and day-ahead and real-time market prices. A hybrid stochastic/robust optimization model is proposed to minimize the expected net cost, i.e., expected total cost of operation minus total benefit of demand. This formulation can be solved by mixed-integer linear programming. The uncertain output of intermittent DG and day-ahead market price are modeled via scenarios based on forecast results, while a robust optimization is proposed to limit the unbalanced power in real-time market taking account of the uncertainty of real-time market price. Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a photovoltaic panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator, a battery, and a responsive load show the advantage of stochastic optimization, as well as robust optimization.

Abstract: A key feature of smart grids is the use of demand side resources to provide flexibility to the energy system and thus increase its efficiency. Multienergy systems where different energy vectors such as gas, electricity, and heat are optimized simultaneously prove to be a valuable source of demand side flexibility. However, planning of such systems may be extremely challenging, particularly in the presence of long-term price uncertainty in the underlying energy vectors. In this light, this paper proposes a unified operation and planning optimization methodology for distributed multienergy generation (DMG) systems with the aim of assessing flexibility embedded in both operation and investment stages subject to long-term uncertainties. The proposed approach reflects real options thinking borrowed from finance, and is cast as a stochastic mixed integer linear program. The methodology is illustrated through a realistic U.K.-based DMG case study for district energy systems, with combined heat and power plant, electric heat pumps, and thermal energy storage. The results show that the proposed approach allows reduction in both expected cost and risk relative to other less flexible planning methods, thus potentially enhancing the business case of flexible DMG systems.

Abstract: Conventional overcurrent protection schemes for radial distribution systems usually attempt to coordinate a recloser at the beginning of the feeder with the fuses on the laterals. The integration of distributed generation in distribution systems leads to problems related to protection coordination that are difficult to be solved by applying conventional protection techniques. This paper proposes an efficient communication-based protection scheme that implements common directional overcurrent relays instead of reclosers at the line, assisted by intertripping and blocking transfer functions. The proposed protection strategy guarantees selectivity regardless of whether the generating units are connected to the network or not, and can be designed retaining either the fuse-blowing or fuse-saving philosophy. Meaningful conclusions are derived from the application of the scheme on a test distribution system.

Abstract: Self-healing is a key characteristic and goal of smart grid, which is based on the classification of the operating states of the power system. With views to the differences between the distribution and transmission system in terms of the operation model and structural features, an essential difference can appear in the classification of operating states between these two systems. According to the characteristics of distribution system with distributed generations (DGs), a new method based on hierarchical classification is proposed to classify the operating states of distribution system with DGs. In this method, several important performances reflecting the operating conditions of distribution system are regarded as critical attributes, including external stability, reliability, integrity, and economy. Moreover, different transition paths and control targets in different states are proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the classification method, which aim at the safety and reliability of the distribution system operation. Finally, a control strategy based on state classification is presented to support the decision-making for the self-healing distribution system. A case study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the classification method for the operating states of distribution system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a transformative architecture for the normal operation and self-healing of networked microgrids (MGs). MGs can support and interchange electricity with each other in the proposed infrastructure. The networked MGs are connected by a physical common bus and a designed two-layer cyber communication network. The lower layer is within each MG where the energy management system (EMS) schedules the MG operation; the upper layer links a number of EMSs for global optimization and communication. In the normal operation mode, the objective is to schedule dispatchable distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems (ESs), and controllable loads to minimize the operation costs and maximize the supply adequacy of each MG. When a generation deficiency or fault happens in an MG, the model switches to the self-healing mode and the local generation capacities of other MGs can be used to support the on-emergency portion of the system. A consensus algorithm is used to distribute portions of the desired power support to each individual MG in a decentralized way. The allocated portion corresponds to each MG's local power exchange target, which is used by its EMS to perform the optimal schedule. The resultant aggregated power output of networked MGs will be used to provide the requested power support. Test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper describes a fully distributed power dispatch method that can achieve fast frequency recovery and minimal generation cost for autonomous microgrids. The method is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, a subgradient-based consensus algorithm is used to recover frequency. The equal increment rate criteria is incorporated into this algorithm to achieve a minimal regulating cost, obtained by economically distributing power among distributed energy resources. Control signals updated with latest local measurements are executed in each iteration step to speed up the frequency recovery procedure. In the second stage, an average consensus algorithm is applied to resolve frequency oscillations caused by measurement errors. Numerical tests are described to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method and its applicability in the presence of communication time delay is discussed.

Abstract: Microgrid is a new concept for future energy distribution system that enables renewable energy integration. It generally consists of multiple distributed generators that are usually interfaced to the grid through power inverters. For the islanding operation of ac microgrids, two important tasks are to share the load demand among multiple parallel connected inverters proportionately, and maintain the voltage and frequency stabilities. This paper reviews and categorizes various approaches of power sharing control principles. Simultaneously, the control schemes are graphically illustrated. Moreover, various control approaches are compared in terms of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, this paper presents the future trends.

Abstract: This paper presents a new concept based on wavelet design and machine learning applied to nonintrusive load monitoring. The wavelet coefficients of length-6 filter are determined using procrustes analysis and are used to construct new wavelets to match the load signals to be detected, unlike previous work which used previously designed wavelet functions that are special cases of Daubechies filters to suit other nonpower system applications such as communications and image processing. The results of applying the new concept to a test system consisting of four loads have shown that the newly designed wavelet can improve the prediction accuracy compared with that obtained using Daubechies filter of order three while keeping the prominent features of the pattern in the detail levels.

Abstract: Due to various green initiatives, renewable energy will be massively incorporated into the future smart grid. However, the intermittency of the renewables may result in power imbalance, thus adversely affecting the stability of a power system. Frequency regulation may be used to maintain the power balance at all times. As electric vehicles (EVs) become popular, they may be connected to the grid to form a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. An aggregation of EVs can be coordinated to provide frequency regulation services. However, V2G is a dynamic system where the participating EVs come and go independently. Thus, it is not easy to estimate the regulation capacities for V2G. In a preliminary study, we modeled an aggregation of EVs with a queueing network, whose structure allows us to estimate the capacities for regulation-up and regulation-down separately. The estimated capacities from the V2G system can be used for establishing a regulation contract between an aggregator and the grid operator, and facilitating a new business model for V2G. In this paper, we extend our previous development by designing a smart charging mechanism that can adapt to given characteristics of the EVs and make the performance of the actual system follow the analytical model.

Abstract: Integration of centralized wind farms may induce cascading tripping incidents, which brings about critical challenges to secure operation of power grid. One of the major risks is the lack of coordinated voltage/reactive power control for multiple wind farms. Therefore, a robust master-slave two-level coordinated static voltage security region (VSR) is proposed in this paper, along with detailed modeling of the network topology and wind farms to achieve coordination among wind farms. The slave VSR on the wind-farm-side is designed to guarantee the operation of each wind unit within a secure range in order to protect wind units from serious over-voltage and low-voltage problems, whereas the master system-wide VSR aims to coordinate centralized wind farms to ensure security both under normal operating conditions and N - 1 contingency conditions. Furthermore, a hierarchically iterative coordination method is introduced to compute the voltage security range of each wind farm through the iteration process. A modified six-bus system with two wind farms, a real system from Northern China, and a large system with 972 wind units are studied, and results verify the effectiveness of the proposed two-level VSR and the hierarchically iterative coordination method.

Abstract: Clustering methods are increasingly being applied to residential smart meter data, which provides a number of important opportunities for distribution network operators (DNOs) to manage and plan low-voltage networks. Clustering has a number of potential advantages for DNOs, including the identification of suitable candidates for demand response and the improvement of energy profile modeling. However, due to the high stochasticity and irregularity of household-level demand, detailed analytics are required to define appropriate attributes to cluster. In this paper, we present in-depth analysis of customer smart meter data to better understand the peak demand and major sources of variability in their behavior. We find four key time periods, in which the data should be analyzed, and use this to form relevant attributes for our clustering. We present a finite mixture model-based clustering, where we discover ten distinct behavior groups describing customers based on their demand and their variability. Finally, using an existing bootstrap technique, we show that the clustering is reliable. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time in the power systems literature that the sample robustness of the clustering has been tested.

Abstract: Nonlinear preprocessors, including conventional clipping, blanking, joint blanking/clipping, and deep clipping, have been employed to mitigate the impulsive noise in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based power-line communications. Those nonlinear preprocessors are characterized by one or two thresholds, which are optimized to achieve an optimum output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we aim to further improve the output SNR by linearly combining two nonlinear preprocessors. Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed method yields better output SNR and symbol/bit error rate performance than the individual ones.

Abstract: A novel technique for loss of mains (LOM) detection using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data is described in this paper. The technique, known as the peak ratio analysis method (PRAM), improves both sensitivity and stability of LOM protection when compared with prevailing techniques. The technique is based on a rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) measurement from M-class PMUs, but the key novelty of the method lies in the fact that it employs a new "peak-ratio" analysis of the measured ROCOF waveform during any frequency disturbance to determine whether the potentially-islanded element of the network is grid connected or not. The proposed technique is described and several examples of its operation are compared with three competing LOM protection methods that have all been widely used by industry and/or reported in the literature: standard ROCOF phase offset relay and phase angle difference methods. It is shown that the PRAM technique exhibits comparable performance to the others, and in many cases improves upon their abilities, in particular for systems where the inertia of the main power system is reduced, which may arise in future systems with increased penetrations of renewable generation and high voltage dc (HVDC) infeeds.

Abstract: A decentralized and self-optimizing control strategy is proposed for the frequency-power droop type distributed generators (DGs). The main characteristics of the proposed control strategy are the following: 1) it is hierarchical and fully decentralized, i.e., the functions of primary, secondary and tertiary frequency control can be realized locally, with the microgrid centralized controller making communication networks unnecessary and 2) it can make DGs share loads according to the equal incremental principle. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

Abstract: The integration of distributed generation (DG) sources can cause significant impacts on distribution networks, particularly the changes in magnitudes and directions of short circuit currents that may lead to false tripping or fail to trip over-current protection relays in the system. It is expensive and technically challenging to redesign/reconfigure and/or to replace the original protection system for a distribution network. If not appropriately handled, this issue can be a big hurdle before the wide use of DG. Based on the impact analysis of the number of DGs, their locations and capacities upon short circuit currents, this paper presents an optimal DG placement method to maximize the penetration level of DG in distribution networks without changing the original relay protection schemes. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal locations and sizes of DG in distribution networks. Simulation studies have been carried out on a three-feeder test distribution network and a widely used 33-node test system to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Stochastic time delay is a new challenge for communication networks in wide-area damping control (WADC) systems. Uncertainties introduced by stochastic time delays increase the difficulty of modeling, analyzing the stability, and designing the controller. In this paper, a new approach for stability analysis and controller design through expectation modeling is proposed to solve for the uncertainty in wide-area controlled power systems introduced by the effect of a stochastic time delay. In the proposed method, the expectation model that considers the detailed stochastic time delay distribution is derived to accurately model the effect of a communication network on the wide-area control performance. Through a matrix transformation of the expectation model, the eigenvalue of the WADC system that considers time delay can then be calculated; this eigenvalue can be used for analyzing the system stability. A novel expectation model-based controller design procedure is established, through which traditional methods can be applied in the controller design of a power system with a stochastic time delay. Finally, the effectiveness of the stability analysis and controller design methods are validated through simulations in a power system of four generators and two areas with an HVDC link, and a power system with eight generators and 36 buses.

Abstract: Accurate real-time states provided by the state estimator are critical for power system reliable operation and control. This paper proposes a novel phasor measurement unit (PMU)-based robust state estimation method (PRSEM) to real-time monitor a power system under different operation conditions. To be specific, an adaptive weight assignment function to dynamically adjust the measurement weight based on the distance of big unwanted disturbances from the PMU measurements is proposed to increase algorithm robustness. Furthermore, a statistical test-based interpolation matrix H updating judgment strategy is proposed. The processed and resynced PMU information are used as priori information and incorporated to the modified weighted least square estimation to address the measurements imperfect synchronization between supervisory control and data acquisition and PMU measurements. Finally, the innovation analysis-based bad data (BD) detection method, which can handle the smearing effect and critical measurement errors, is presented. We evaluate PRSEM by using IEEE benchmark test systems and a realistic utility system. The numerical results indicate that, in short computation time, PRSEM can effectively track the system real-time states with good robustness and can address several kinds of BD.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) technology has drawn increasing amounts of attention in the last decade. As the world's largest automotive market, China has recently made the electrification of transportation central to its national strategic plan. Because of the unique nature of the vertically regulated power industry, China's massive deployment of PEVs has to face unique challenges that may not be encountered by any other country/region. Therefore, a comprehensive coordinated PEV charging scheme is urgently needed to facilitate the smooth grid integration of PEVs at all levels (e.g., transmission systems, distribution systems, and charging stations). This paper presents detailed mathematical modeling of a novel hierarchical framework for coordinated PEV charging at multiple timescales (i.e., day-ahead and real-time). The proposed three-level (e.g., provincial level, municipal level, and charging station level) PEV charging strategy jointly optimizes system load profile and charging costs while satisfying customer charging requirements. The interrelationships between various levels in terms of energy transaction and information exchange are clearly identified. Case studies on Guangdong Province, China, are carried out and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed hierarchical control framework in reducing system peak demand and charging costs.

Abstract: Current regulation is crucial for operating single-phase grid-connected inverters. The challenge of the current controller is how to fast and precisely track the current with zero steady-state error. This paper proposes a novel feedback mechanism for the conventional proportional integral controller. It allows the steady-state error suppression with no need of additional complex control algorithms such as the synchronous reference frame transformation. Five alternative implementation methods are comparatively evaluated from the viewpoint of the steady-state and dynamic responses. Further, the theoretical analysis done indicates that the widely used P+Resonant control is just a special case of the proposed control solution. The time-domain simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results from a TMS320F2812 DSP-based laboratory prototypes are in good agreement, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed generalized method.

Abstract: A microgrid (MG) can operate in both grid-tied and autonomous mode. Without the support from the public utility, the control of an autonomous MG is more complex due to its poor system inertia. Though energy storage system (ESS) can act as a main power source to maintain system frequency and voltage stability, traditional droop control is usually invalid in practice due to the resistive line of low/medium voltage MG. Virtual impedance control can be a solution to decouple the active and reactive power allocations among ESSs. However, the control bandwidth is reduced since it requires low-pass filters with reduced bandwidth to calculate the average active and reactive power. In this paper, a novel ESSs control method is proposed with V/f droop control (VFDC) and P/Q droop control (PQDC) combined. It can distribute the active and reactive power precisely since the interference of line parameters uncertainty is prevented and system stability is enhanced. The comparison between traditional droop and the hybrid VFDC/PQDC is analyzed based on equivalent circuits. A hybrid VFDC/PQDC-based MG control scheme is proposed and its small-signal stability is analyzed. The proposed method is verified through experimental test on a MG platform with two 100 kVA ESS prototypes.

Abstract: An ultra high voltage (UHV) ac and dc interconnection will become the foundation of China's future smart grid. Due to the wide spread of interconnected regions, the distance between control stations will increase dramatically. Therefore, the communication system's reliability and real-time performance will become increasingly crucial. However, failures of the communication system, such as interruptions, latency, and bit error, are inevitable. This paper uses the UHV grid security and stability defense system (SSDS) as an example to analyze its requirements for communication and the impact of communication failure on the system's performance. The effect of communication latency on the power system's stability is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Based on this analysis, a framework of an UHV grid SSDS considering the risk of the communication system is proposed. A preliminary power system and communication system co-simulation tool is developed to perform a case study. The case study demonstrates that communication latency in the UHV grid changes the control strategy's effectiveness due to a delay in executing the control strategy. Furthermore, communication latency will negatively affect the power grid's stability.

Abstract: This paper presents a load frequency control scheme using electric vehicles (EVs) to help thermal turbine units to provide the stability fluctuated by load demands. First, a general framework for deriving a state-space model for general power system topologies is given. Then, a detailed model of a four-area power system incorporating a smart and renewable discharged EVs system is presented. The areas within the system are interconnected via a combination of alternating current/high voltage direct current links and thyristor controlled phase shifters. Based on some recent development on functional observers, novel distributed functional observers are designed, one at each local area, to implement any given global state feedback controller. The designed observers are of reduced order and dynamically decoupled from others in contrast to conventional centralized observer (CO)-based controllers. The proposed scheme can cope better against accidental failures than those CO-based controllers. Extensive simulations and comparisons are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: New generation of loads and the power factor correction devices of these loads provides an opportunity for distribution system operators to use them as reactive power support. In this paper, the integration of these end-user reactive-power-capable devices is investigated to provide voltage support to the grid. Due to the limitation on the number of smart homes, at first, the effective locations for injecting the reactive power into the distribution system is determined (i.e., Q-C buses) and showed how reactive power resources connected at those buses can be controlled. For control purposes, centralized support distributed voltage control (CSDVC) algorithm is proposed and the distribution system is decomposed into different areas by using e-decomposition. Then Q-C buses, as the candidate buses, for providing reactive power are obtained. Optimum reactive power injection in every candidate bus in each area and tap position of the regulator, if necessary, is calculated by using genetic algorithm. The CSDVC is proposed to cover the inaccuracy of the loads forecasting and the control area centers faults, and also to provide secure reactive power control. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 33 and 69 buses distribution test systems.

Abstract: Development of distributed energy resources introduces high level of interdependency and the need for integrated models in a multienergy system (MES). Moreover, highlighting environmental aspects facilitates electrification in the transportation sector and integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). In this paper, aggregation of PEVs' batteries in parking lots (PL) is considered as a bulk electric storage in MES. The energy hub approach is employed for modeling MES considering PL. Due to the profitable behavior of PL in the reserve market, the energy hub model is modified to consider the reserve sources as ancillary services in the output energy vector. Moreover, the uncertain traffic pattern of PEVs' owners in PL is modeled by a stochastic approach. The numerical results demonstrate the proficiency of the proposed model, determining the changes in the behavior of other MESs elements in the presence of PL.

Abstract: The distribution network operator is usually responsible for increasing the efficiency and reliability of network operation. The target of active loss minimization is in line with efficiency improvement. However, this approach may not be the best way to decrease the losses payments in an unbundled market environment. This paper investigates the differences between loss minimization and loss payment minimization strategies. It proposes an effective approach for decreasing the losses payment considering the uncertainties of electricity prices in a day ahead energy market using energy storage systems and demand response. In order to quantify the benefits of the proposed method, the evaluation of the proposed technique is carried out by applying it on a 33-bus distribution network.

Abstract: As one of the key components of the smart grid, advanced metering infrastructure brings many potential advantages such as load management and demand response. However, computerizing the metering system also introduces numerous new vectors for energy theft. In this paper, we present a novel consumption pattern-based energy theft detector, which leverages the predictability property of customers' normal and malicious consumption patterns. Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate. Therefore, the proposed method does not invade customers' privacy. Extensive experiments on a real dataset of 5000 customers show a high performance for the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an electricity load scheduling problem in a residence. Compared with previous works in which only limited sets of appliances are considered, we classify various appliances into five sets considering their different energy consumption and operation characteristics, and provide mathematical models for them. With these appliance models, we propose an electricity load scheduling algorithm that controls the operation time and energy consumption level of each appliance adapting to time-of-use pricing in order to maximize the overall net utility of the residence while satisfying its budget limit. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is in general, difficult to solve. In order to solve the problem, we use the generalized Benders decomposition approach with which we can solve the MINLP problem easily with low computational complexity. By solving the problem, we provide an algorithm to obtain the optimal electricity load scheduling of various appliances with different energy consumption and operation characteristics in a unified way.

Abstract: The implementation of smart grid permits different system participants (e.g., distributed generations and loads) to interact in a rational and independent behavior to improve the distribution system (DS) performance. Each participant is recognized as a selfish decision maker that selects actions that improve its own payoff leading to conflicts with others. Therefore, further investigations are required to improve the decision making process outcomes. In this paper, a decentralized cooperative algorithm is developed to manage the multiparticipants DS operation. The proposed algorithm has been developed based on a correlated equilibrium game-theoretic approach. The outcomes of the proposed algorithm were compared with the traditional existing "best response" (BR) game-theoretic approach, which was utilized in similar multiparticipants DSs that converge to Nash equilibrium. The proposed algorithm is tested with two different case studies that were selected by the DS operator. The proposed algorithm was verified using a modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder. The test results showed a superior system performance compared with traditional BR techniques.

Abstract: A new multiagent system (MAS) design for fault location, isolation, and restoration in power distribution systems (PDSs) is presented. When there is a fault in the PDS, MAS quickly isolates the fault and restores the service to the fault-free zones. Hierarchical coordination strategy is introduced to manage the agents, which integrate the advantages of both centralized and decentralized coordination strategies. Proposed MAS is composed of zone agents (ZAs), feeder agents (FAs), and substation agents. In this framework, ZA locate and isolate the fault based on the locally available information, and assist the FA for reconfiguration and restoration. FA can solve the restoration problem using the existing algorithms for the 0-1 knapsack problem. A novel Q-learning mechanism is also introduced to support the FA in decision making for restoration. The design is illustrated by the use of case studies of fault location, isolation, and restoration on West Virginia super circuit. The results from the case studies indicate the performance of proposed MAS design.

Abstract: With the development of smart grid, demand-side resources (DSR) will play an increasingly important role in the power balance of supply and demand. In addition, the requirement of a low-carbon smart grid means some policy backgrounds, such as carbon emissions trading (CET), should not be ignored. Under these circumstances, it is a good idea to construct a novel unit commitment (UC) model. This paper proposes a model that not only takes advantage of various resources on the demand side, such as electric vehicles, demand response, and distributed generation, but also reflects the effects of CET on generation schedule. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is applied to solve the problem. In numerical studies, we analyze the impacts of DSR and CET on the results of UC, respectively. In addition, two meaningful experiments are conducted to study the approaches to allocate emission quotas and the effects of price transmission mechanism.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of multitype renewable energy (RE) sources (intermittent energy sources) has become an important feature in smart grid development all over the world. It is internationally recognized that the island (or weak-tie connected) power grids are the best platforms for intermittent energy integration test and demonstration because of their abundant RE resources, scarcity of conventional energy, and technical difficulty with accommodation of intermittent energy. The ongoing research on Hainan (the second biggest island in China) power grid will achieve a comprehensive breakthrough in power grid planning, analysis, scheduling, operation, relay protection, security control, disaster prevention, and other key areas in multitype RE source integration. To be specific, this paper focuses on the key part of the research project-optimal scheduling and complementary operation and a new framework of multitime-frame robust scheduling/dispatch system is first proposed, which is different from most other robust approaches and lays special emphasis on the engineering characteristics of power system operation. Simulation results based on the real data of Hainan power grid show that the approach presented is effective and will be put into online operation in the near future.

Abstract: Since the origin of energy management systems, state estimation applications have aided in automatic power system operations, mainly for transmission systems. Currently, however, smart grid concepts are modifying the behavior of distribution systems through a rapid increase of controllable distributed generators, demand response, and electric vehicles. Consequently, the advanced metering infrastructure is providing a large amount of synchronized metering data with high accuracy and resolution, which favors the development of state estimation procedures to sustain distribution management systems. Therefore, this paper presents the formulation of a novel algorithm for state estimation solution in distribution networks using the Hamiltonian cycle theory, where the network states are quickly obtained through a calculation scheme under the normal operating conditions.

Abstract: With the increased environmental concern, the photovoltaic (PV) generation capacity is growing in today's power systems. As the PV penetration rate increases, the intermittency and uncertainty of PV systems will cause frequency regulation issues. When rapid fluctuations take place, the system requires fast responding regulation to recover the frequency within a short period of time. Traditional power plants with slow dynamics are less capable of tracking the fast-changing regulation signal. In this context, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered as an effective regulation source to respond immediately to frequency deviations. This paper addresses the sizing issue of an aggregated BESS by a series of system level performance tests with different BESS penetration rates. The evaluation criteria are the control performance standards 1 and 2. Response effectiveness of the BESS with different levels of disturbances is also analyzed, with comparison to that of the traditional power plants. The proposed BESS aggregation controller is also validated using software simulations and a hardware testbed.

Abstract: In this paper, an improved control method for multiple bidirectional power converters is proposed to reduce the circulating current and power-sharing deviation among converters when the hybrid ac/dc microgrid operated in island mode, which can enhance the security of parallel converters. First, a unified detection method for circulating current and power-sharing deviation is described. Then, the improved control method for bidirectional converters in hybrid microgrid operated in island mode is presented to reduce circulating current and power-sharing deviation, which includes the droop controller used to achieve automatic power sharing and the improved virtual impedance controller used to further reduce circulating current and power-sharing deviation. At last, simulation and experiment results verified that the proposed control method can simultaneously achieve circulating current reduction and automatic power sharing, and does not decrease the output power capability of converter. The proposed control method is suitable for the configuration that has a specific bus between bidirectional power converters, and the ac bus connected to ac loads and the host grid.

Abstract: Intensive research is being directed at microgrids because of their numerous benefits, such as their ability to enhance the reliability of a power system and reduce its environmental impact. Past research has focused on microgrids that have predefined boundaries. However, a recently suggested methodology enables the determination of fictitious boundaries that divide existing bulky grids into smaller microgrids, thereby facilitating the use of a smart grid paradigm in large-scale systems. These boundaries are fixed and do not change with the power system operating conditions. In this paper, we propose a new microgrid concept that incorporates flexible fictitious boundaries: "dynamic microgrids." The proposed method is based on the allocation and coordination of agents in order to achieve boundary mobility. The stochastic behavior of loads and renewable-based generators are considered, and a novel model that represents wind, solar, and load power based on historical data has been developed. The PG&E 69-bus system has been used for testing and validating the proposed concept. Compared with the fixed boundary microgrids, our results show the superior effectiveness of the dynamic microgrid concept for addressing the self-adequacy of microgrids in the presence of stochastically varying loads and generation.

Abstract: Direct or centralized loading shaping in smart grid has been heavily investigated. However, it is usually not clear how the users are compensated by providing load shaping services. In this paper, we will discuss indirect load shaping in a distributed manner. On one hand, we aim to reduce the users' energy cost by investigating how to fully utilize the battery pack and the water tank for the combined heat and power (CHP) systems. We first formulate the queueing models for the CHP systems and then propose an algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization technique, which does not need any statistical information about the system dynamics. The optimal control actions can be obtained by solving a nonconvex optimization problem. We then discuss when it can be converted into a convex optimization problem. Since the CHP battery pack queue and water tank queue are correlated, the capacity relationship between them is further explored considering different queue weights. On the other hand, based on the users' reaction model, we propose an algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n) to determine the real-time price for the power company to effectively coordinate all the CHP systems and provide distributed load shaping services.

Abstract: This paper aims to model interdependencies between power systems and dispatching data networks, and to analyze the intricate impacts on cascading failures. The functions of communication networks are embedded into dispatching data networks in China, thus we use dispatching data networks in the paper. The structures of dispatching data networks are generally categorized into two types: 1) double-star; and 2) mesh. The correlation of nodes in double-star networks and power systems is "degree to degree,"whereas "degree to betweenness" is the correlation for mesh networks. Furthermore, the interactive model between power grids and dispatching data networks is presented by a dynamic power flow model. Taking the IEEE 39-bus system and China's Guangdong 500-kV system as examples, in the case of random attacks on the interdependent system, simulation results show that the power grid coupled with double-star dispatching data networks has lower probability of catastrophic failures than with the mesh structure, because the double-star dispatching data network has outstanding capability of delivering information even though some communication nodes are out of order. In contrast, under intentional attacks, the decrement of the transmission performance of the double-star network is more serious than that in the mesh network. Therefore, the power system exhibits much higher vulnerability when coupled with the double-star network.

Abstract: When conducting the wind power (WP) planning, it is very important for electric power companies to evaluate the penetration limit of the grid-accommodable WP. This paper proposes a probabilistic method for determining grid-accommodable WP capacity based on the multiscenario analysis. Typical power system operation scenarios are generated from the combination of different WP scenarios and demand scenarios. A power system operation simulation model is proposed and implemented to the generated scenarios. The operation results are further used as the basis of the proposed probabilistic method. The validity and effectiveness of the new method are demonstrated in two cases, i.e., the IEEE 39-bus test system and a real large power system in China, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents an extended state estimation method which allows the identification of unexpected power injections at multiple points of common coupling (PCCs) of power distribution grids. The developed state estimator makes use of a three-phase network modeling where active and reactive power injection levels at PCCs are estimated and checked in real time with the values expected by the system operator. The estimation algorithm applies a sparse tableau formulation in which equality constraints are employed to model power injection assumptions at PCCs. The identification of unexpected power injections is then performed using a methodology based on normalized Lagrange multipliers and geometric tests. Simulations conducted on a modified version of the IEEE 34-node test feeder illustrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach, fostering discussions regarding the future of real-time monitoring on power distribution systems.

The upper bound of the relaxing error within the method is presented through theoretical analysis. Simulation experiments on the IEEE 30-bus system show that the proposed method works well both to the nonlinear model and to the dc model. In this letter, both single and multiple state variables attacks are considered.
