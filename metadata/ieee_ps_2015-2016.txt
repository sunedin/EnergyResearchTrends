Abstract: This paper presents the evolution and design of the Swiss reserve market and describes its two-stage stochastic market-clearing model. In Switzerland, the reserve market comprises weekly and daily auctions. The decision-making problem is to determine the amount of reserves that should be procured in each market stage. The stochasticity stems from daily offers which are not available at the beginning of the week, when the first-stage decisions are made. The new market-clearing model minimizes expected procurement costs of reserves, while taking reserve dimensioning criteria and market properties into consideration. Since the last week of January 2014, this model has been clearing the reserve market in Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world implementation of a stochastic market-clearing model in electricity markets.

Abstract: This letter investigates the impacts of distributed generation (DG) units' reactive power limits on the power flow solution of droop-controlled islanded microgrids (DCIMGs). It is demonstrated that the simplifications adopted in existing literature for modeling such limits are not accurate and can lead to crucial deviations in the answer, especially for heavily loaded islands. A detailed model is presented for the incorporation of the DG units' reactive power limits in the power flow formulation of DCIMGs and the impacts of such limits on the steady-state solution are demonstrated and analyzed.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new formulation for the optimum reconfiguration of islanded microgrid (IMG) systems. The reconfiguration problem is casted as a multi-objective optimization problem, in order to: 1) minimize the IMG fuel consumption in the operational planning horizon for which islanded operation is planned; 2) ensure the IMG capability to feed the maximum possible demand by enhancing its voltage instability proximity index taken over all the states at which the islanded system may reside; and 3) minimize the relevant switching operation costs. The proposed problem formulation takes into consideration the system's operational constraints in all operating conditions based on the consideration of the uncertainty associated with renewable resources output power and load variability. Moreover, the proposed formulation accounts for droop controlled IMG special operational characteristics as well as the availability/unavailability of a supervisory microgrid central controller (MGCC). The formulated problem is solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). MATLAB environment has been used to test and validate the proposed problem formulation. The results show that the implementation of appropriate IMG reconfiguration problem formulations will enhance the performance of IMG systems and facilitate a successful integration of the microgrid concept in distribution networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for online determination of the Thevenin equivalent parameters of a power system at a given node using the local PMU measurements at that node. The method takes into account the measurement errors and the changes in the system side. An analysis of the effects of changes in system side is carried out on a simple two-bus system to gain an insight of the effect of system side changes on the estimated Thevenin equivalent parameters. The proposed method uses voltage and current magnitudes as well as active and reactive powers; thus avoiding the effect of phase angle drift of the PMU and the need to synchronize measurements at different instances to the same reference. Applying the method to the IEEE 30-bus test system has shown its ability to correctly determine the Thevenin equivalent even in the presence of measurement errors and/or system side changes.

Abstract: Converting existing ac transmission lines to an extended multiterminal three-wire bipolar HVDC system can be considered a cost-effective way to interconnect dispersed offshore wind farms to onshore ac grids instead of building new bipolar HVDC systems. To automatically coordinate between different converters in a multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) system, droop control techniques have been adopted as an effective means without the need for fast communications between units. The droop control design is mainly dependent on the line resistances. This paper shows that the equivalent resistance of a three-wire bipolar system changes based on the operational mode. The modification to droop control design of an MTDC equipped with a three-wire bipolar system is then presented to tackle this resistance variation with the operating condition. Two types of MTDC systems are considered in this work, namely, radial parallel and meshed parallel systems. Different simulation studies have been conducted to validate the results of the presented analysis.

Abstract: There are few systematic methodologies capable of predicting and leveraging the reserve capacity potential of large populations of thermostatically-controlled loads (TCLs). For such reserves to have economic and technical value, it is essential that demand-side flexibility aggregators and system operators be able to do so quickly and robustly. In addition, aggregators need to ensure TCL users' comfort and end use satisfaction. Part I of this two-part paper introduces an analytical approach to characterize and control the statistical bounds on the potential aggregated response of a population of TCLs, while ensuring users' comfort satisfaction. First, the uncertainty associated with the instantaneous power consumption of a typical TCL is described by a set of random variables and their statistics. TCL statistics are then employed to characterize the exploitable flexibility from a large population of similar devices. From this, a control strategy and parameters are introduced for sporadic (i.e., contingency-type) reserve provision by the population. In Part II, the proposed analytical approach and control strategy are validated for the special case of electric water heaters (EWHs). Further, the trade-off between demand response capacity and EWH users' comfort satisfaction is investigated through several case studies.

Abstract: An analytical approach and a control strategy are proposed in Part I of this two-part paper for leveraging the aggregate demand of a population of thermostatically-controlled loads (TCLs) to deliver contingency-type reserve capacity. Further, a metric is introduced to quantify the TCL users' comfort satisfaction in response to a control signal. In Part II, we address the validation of the concepts put forth in the first part of the paper. To do so, we develop an extensive set of case studies based upon a population of 10 000 electric water heaters (EWH). Here, a physically-based model is first derived for the calculation of EWHs on-time statistics. The model is then extended to calculate the probability of EWH users' comfort satisfaction. The analytical approach and control strategy presented in Part I are validated using the EWH model against Monte Carlo simulations. Further, the trade-off between demand response capacity and EWH users' comfort satisfaction is investigated.

Abstract: The paper proposes a framework for the selection of optimal configuration of line compensation devices, thyristor controlled series capacitors (TCSC) and conventional fixed series capacitors, for reducing the risk of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) in the network while maintaining required power transfer. The methodology developed in the paper is based on the robust risk evaluation of SSR that takes into consideration the severity of subsynchronous resonance and probability of its occurrence. The subsynchronous resonance risk index developed previously is used to assess the severity of subsynchronous resonance. The line outage model is employed to determine the probability of contingencies potentially leading to subsynchronous resonance. It is demonstrated that with relatively small participation of TCSC, even with the most basic control, in series compensation of lines, the risk of SSR can be successfully managed.

Abstract: The deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in distribution systems provides an excellent opportunity for load monitoring applications. Load decomposition can be done at the smart meters level, providing a better understanding of the load behavior at near-real-time. In this paper, loads' current and voltage waveforms are processed offline to form a comprehensive library. This library consists of a set of measurements projected onto the eigenloads space. Eigenloads are basically the eigenvectors describing the load signatures space. Similar to human faces, every load has a distinct signature. Each load measurement is transformed into a photo and an efficient face recognition algorithm is applied to the set of photos. A list of all the online devices is always stored and can be accessed at any time. The proposed method can be implemented at the smart meters level. The distributed computation that can be achieved by performing simple calculations at each smart meter, without the need for sending intensive data to a central processor, is beneficial. From a system operator perspective, load composition in near-real-time provides the loads' voltage dependence that are needed, for example, in volt-VAR optimization (VVO) in distribution systems. Further applications of load composition data are also discussed.

Abstract: Conventionally, power flow equations are used for distribution systems (DS) analysis to find the nodal voltages. For the particular form of the DS reconfiguration problem, however, a direct formulation in terms of branch flows allows a substantial increase in solution efficiency from an optimization point of view. In this paper, a set of linear current flow (LCF) equations are derived for DS. This formulation is then used within the network reconfiguration problem for loss minimization. A mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) formulation, together with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, are proposed in this paper and assessed through simulations. In these comparisons, the MILP formulation shows computational advantages over the MIQCP version and the preceding literature. The proposed methods are evaluated on several test systems.

Abstract: In order to ensure a reliable and continuous supply of electric energy, operators must manage hundreds to thousands of generators with complex operating requirements, maintain synchronism, and manage thousands of transmission assets. Further complications arise due to stringent reliability standards, resource uncertainty, and limited economical energy storage. With advances in algorithmic performance and hardware, such optimization problems still require an engineered and simplified market structure. Market operators must therefore adjust the proposed market solution in order to obtain a valid solution. An overview of existing industry practices related to such market adjustments, referred to as out-of-market corrections, is presented. This paper also analyzes the market implications and required out-of-market corrections for the day-ahead scheduling process. Multiple out-of-market correction algorithms are created and used to analyze the potential impacts on market solutions and settlements. Finally, such solutions are compared against an extensive form stochastic unit commitment solution.

Abstract: Reliable and economic deployment of a generation fleet to satisfy demand is a complex problem. Independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission operators (RTOs) solve complex unit commitment and economic dispatch models to determine appropriate resources to deploy at various time stages. Due to the complexity of power systems, several approximations are made within optimization models, including approximations of the transmission network with a linearized formulation known as the direct current optimal power flow (DCOPF) instead of the more realistic formulation known as the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF). Furthermore, approximations occur in these models by relaxing specific constraints in the model, i.e., the constraint is allowed to be violated based on a predetermined penalty price. By doing so, the ISO/RTO receives several benefits, including the ability to manage prices, clear the market, as well as the potential to obtain gains in social welfare (market surplus). This paper describes the constraint relaxation practices of ISOs in their unit commitment models and analyzes the corresponding market implications based on these practices.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-purpose VAr control strategy for solar PV inverters for voltage support in distribution networks. The proposed strategy can be applied under various PV power generation conditions. The inverters will normally operate in a dynamic VAr compensation mode for voltage support (including low PV and no PV periods). During mid-day when PV has surplus power, the proposed strategy will control the PV inverters to absorb VAr for voltage rise mitigation using a droop characteristic approach. During passing clouds, the strategy will mitigate voltage fluctuations by ramp-rate control of inverter VAr output. A dynamic model of the proposed PV inverter control has been developed to analyze its performance in terms of fast VAr control and voltage support under various PV generation conditions. The results of the analysis performed on an Australian distribution system show that the proposed VAr control strategy can mitigate voltage rise, and improve the voltage profile despite potential vast changes in the sun irradiation during passing cloud and also in the absence of PV output during the evening.

Abstract: Modeling and analysis of the output impedance of a grid-connected voltage-sourced converter (VSC)-based system under the recently-developed power synchronization control topology is presented in this paper. The impact of impedance passivity on subsynchronous damping profile of an electrically-nearby synchronous generator is then characterized. The impacts of key factors such as control modes and control parameter are addressed. A comparison with the standard vector control strategy is also presented. The results reveal that under this type of control, a VSC does not have negative impact on sub-synchronous dynamics; on the contrary, it has a positive impact, compared with commonly used vector current control where the latter has a potential to degrade the system damping. Time-domain simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: This work describes a methodology for informing targeted demand-response (DR) and marketing programs that focus on the temperature-sensitive part of residential electricity demand. Our methodology uses data that is becoming readily available at utility companies-hourly energy consumption readings collected from "smart" electricity meters, as well as hourly temperature readings. To decompose individual consumption into a thermal-sensitive part and a base load (non-thermally-sensitive), we propose a model of temperature response that is based on thermal regimes, i.e., unobserved decisions of consumers to use their heating or cooling appliances. We use this model to extract useful benchmarks that compose thermal profiles of individual users, i.e., terse characterizations of the statistics of these users' temperature-sensitive consumption. We present example profiles generated using our model on real consumers, and show its performance on a large sample of residential users. This knowledge may, in turn, inform the DR program by allowing scarce operational and marketing budgets to be spent on the right users-those whose influencing will yield highest energy reductions-at the right time. We show that such segmentation and targeting of users may offer savings exceeding 100% of a random strategy.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) will play an essential role in smart grids by contributing to the operational flexibility requirement arising from the increased penetration of intermittent renewable generation. However, DR activation could be hampered in the absence of intelligent network management. Real-time thermal rating (RTTR) functions as a smart network management tool for unlocking the network capacities by allowing the network to safely operate during overload states. This paper offers an optimal residential DR approach integrated with RTTR to balance the hourly wind power production. The proposed framework is modeled from the perspective of an electrical aggregator that manages the population of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads for wind power balancing considering the RTTR of a distribution network. The model schedules the HVAC loads without deterioration of the customers' temperature preferences. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, simulations are performed on a typical Finnish distribution network plan. The results demonstrate the considerable benefits that can be realized by coordinating the DR and RTTR in a distribution network for wind generation balancing.

Abstract: Hierarchically structured automatic voltage control (AVC) architecture has attracted increased interest as networks operate closer to their capacity limits. Hierarchical AVC enables wide-area coordinated voltage regulation (CVR). Due to the inherent complexity of the task, it is based on reduced control models, i.e., simplified models of the system suitable for voltage control. It is a fact however that a single reduced control model (static RCM) cannot be optimal for all network configurations and operating conditions. In pursuit of an improved CVR, this paper investigates the applicability of zoning methodologies in adaptively determined RCM. It further argues that the selection of a zoning methodology affects not only the CVR operation, but also its robustness to erroneous data and proposes a comprehensive generic framework for evaluating its performance. Lastly, it extends and evaluates several zoning-based control model reduction methodologies: namely, hierarchical clustering employing two different proximity metrics, spectral k-way and fuzzy C-means, on both static and adaptive schemes.

Abstract: To respond to volatility and congestion in the power grid, demand response (DR) mechanisms allow for shaping the load compared to a base load profile. When tapping on a large population of heterogeneous appliances as a DR resource, the challenge is in modeling the dimensions available for control. Such models need to strike the right balance between accuracy of the model and tractability. The goal of this paper is to provide a medium-grained stochastic hybrid model to represent a population of appliances that belong to two classes: deferrable or thermostatically controlled loads. We preserve quantized information regarding individual load constraints, while discarding information about the identity of appliance owners. The advantages of our proposed population model are 1) it allows us to model and control load in a scalable fashion, useful for ex-ante planning by an aggregator or for real-time load control; 2) it allows for the preservation of the privacy of end-use customers that own submetered or directly controlled appliances.

Abstract: The novel cascade-mitigation scheme developed in Part I of this paper is implemented within a receding-horizon model predictive control (MPC) scheme with a linear controller model. This present paper illustrates the MPC strategy with a case-study that is based on the IEEE RTS-96 network, though with energy storage and renewable generation added. It is shown that the MPC strategy alleviates temperature overloads on transmission lines by rescheduling generation, energy storage, and other network elements, while taking into account ramp-rate limits and network limitations. Resilient performance is achieved despite the use of a simplified linear controller model. The MPC scheme is compared against a base-case that seeks to emulate human operator behavior.

Abstract: A novel model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed for mitigating the effects of severe line-overload disturbances in electrical power systems. A piece-wise linear convex approximation of line losses is employed to model the effect of transmission line power flow on conductor temperatures. Control is achieved through a receding-horizon model predictive control (MPC) strategy which alleviates line temperature overloads and thereby prevents the propagation of outages. The MPC strategy adjusts line flows by rescheduling generation, energy storage and controllable load, while taking into account ramp-rate limits and network limitations. In Part II of this paper, the MPC strategy is illustrated through simulation of the IEEE RTS-96 network, augmented to incorporate energy storage and renewable generation.

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-based advanced distribution network management system (NMS) aimed at maximizing wind energy harvesting while simultaneously managing congestion and voltages. The NMS allows the adoption of multi-minute control cycles so the volume of actions from on-load tap changers (OLTCs) and distributed generation (DG) plants can be reduced while effectively catering for the effects of wind power uncertainties. This work presents the quantification of benefits and impacts from adopting different control cycles as well a comparison with a deterministic approach. The risk-based approach is implemented by adapting and expanding an AC optimal power flow. A risk level is used to determine the extent to which congestion and voltage rise could exist during a control cycle. The proposed NMS is applied to a real-life U.K. MV network from the North West of England to assess its effectiveness in managing high penetration of wind power considering minute-by-minute simulations for one week. The results show that the risk-based approach can effectively manage network constraints better than the deterministic approach, particularly for multi-minute control cycles, reducing also the number of control actions but at the expense of higher levels of curtailment.

Abstract: This paper presents a planning framework to find the minimum storage sizes (power and energy) at multiple locations in distribution networks to reduce curtailment from renewable distributed generation (DG), specifically wind farms, while managing congestion and voltages. A two-stage iterative process is adopted in this framework. The first stage uses a multi-period AC optimal power flow (OPF) across the studied horizon to obtain initial storage sizes considering hourly wind and load profiles. The second stage adopts a high granularity minute-by-minute control driven by a mono-period bi-level AC OPF to tune the first-stage storage sizes according to the actual curtailment. Congestion and voltages are managed through the optimal control of storage (active and reactive power), on-load tap changers (OLTCs), DG power factor, and DG curtailment as last resort. The proposed storage planning framework is applied to a real 33-kV network from the North West of England over one week. The results highlight that by embedding high granularity control aspects into planning, it is possible to more accurately size storage facilities. Moreover, intelligent management of further flexibility (i.e., OLTCs, storage, and DG power factor control) can lead to much smaller storage capacities. This, however, depends on the required level of curtailment.

Abstract: In order to optimize their assets, electrical power distribution companies seek out various techniques to improve system operation and its different variables, like voltage levels, active power losses and so on. A few of the tools applied to meet these objectives include reactive power compensation, use of voltage regulators, and network reconfiguration. One target most companies aim at is power loss minimization; one available tool to do this is distribution system reconfiguration. To reconfigure a network in radial power distribution systems means to alter the topology changing the state of a set of switches normally closed (NC) and normally opened (NO). In restructured electrical power business, a company must also consider obtaining a topology as reliable as possible. In most cases, reducing the power losses is no guarantee of improved reliability. This paper presents a multiobjective algorithm to reduce power losses while improving the reliability index using the artificial immune systems technique applying graph theory considerations to improve computational performance and Pareto dominance rules. The proposed algorithm is tested on a sample system, 14-bus test system, and on Administracion Nacional de Electricidad (ANDE) real feeder (CBO-01 23-kV feeder).

Abstract: Many countries are planning for a large-scale expansion of wind power. This development will have a significant impact on power system operation and economics. One of the challenges is that the difficulty to forecast wind power generation will increase the need for real-time balancing. This paper presents a study of how the impact of wind power forecast errors can be reduced by changes in the market design. The study is based on the conditions in the Nordic electricity market. A characteristic of this market is that there is a large share of flexible hydro generation; hence, ramp and unit commitment constraints rarely constrain dispatch. The need for regulation during real-time is provided in a voluntary real-time balancing market, where players can be compensated for their redispatch costs. Case studies are presented which show that a shift from day-ahead to intraday trading and increased demand response can improve the performance when the share of wind power is increasing.

Abstract: It is generally believed that following a fault, the system remains stable as long as the fault is cleared within a "critical clearing time" or CCT. This letter shows that when there is a high impedance resistive fault, there are later intervals such that if the fault is cleared within these intervals of time, the system is still stable notwithstanding that the clearing time is now larger than the conventionally calculated CCT. The results are obtained precisely using digital simulation and explained qualitatively using the equal area criterion.

Abstract: To handle significant variability in loads, renewable energy generation, as well as various contingencies, (two-stage) robust optimization method has been adopted to construct unit commitment models and to ensure reliable solutions. In this paper, we further explore and extend the modeling capacity of two-stage robust optimization and present two new robust unit commitment variants: the expanded robust unit commitment and the risk constrained robust unit commitment model. We derive structural properties, demonstrate the connection to the popular scenario based stochastic unit commitment models, and present a customized column-and-constraint generation method. Numerical experiments on those models are performed using practical data sets, which illustrate their modeling strength, economic outcomes, and the algorithm performance in solving those models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the overexcitation limiters (OELs) on the stability margin of a power system which is operating under stressed conditions. Several OEL modeling approaches are presented and the effect of their action has been examined in model power systems. It is realized that, more often than not, OEL operating status goes undetected by existing dynamic security assessment tools commonly used in the industry. It is found that the identification and accurate representation of OELs lead to significantly different transient stability margins. Unscented Kalman filtering is used to detect the OEL activation events. In the context of stressed system operation, such quantitative assessment is very useful for system control. This understanding is further reinforced through detailed studies in two model power systems.

Abstract: Reduced external networks supplied with real-time data are employed in this paper to solve the state estimation problem in interconnected systems. We propose a method to obtain a composed single system state of different monitored areas with local estimations and external equivalent models, which neither require the use of a coordination agent nor requires extensive data interchange. Phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements taken from system boundaries are used to provide updated equivalent networks as well as an inter-area synchronism. The approach allows testing erroneous external models directly in the state estimation framework. The detectability of bad data in interconnection measurements are also preserved. Tests with the IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems show robustness and accuracy of the model under different area decomposition schemes with low computational requirements compared to similar conventional approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative method to determine delay requirements of the information and communication technology (ICT) system supporting wide-area power oscillation damping (WAPOD) controllers. An allowable time delay for the ICT infrastructure named "equivalent time delay (ETD)" is defined. The ETD is calculated by numerically comparing the damping behavior of the system when local input signals (LI) and remote input signals (RI) are used in the damping controller. The use of a WAPOD is only justified when its response outperforms that of a controller using local inputs. Therefore, the total time delay in the control loop must be below the calculated ETD. As such, the ETD serves as a design criteria to determine ICT latency requirements. The selection of an effective RI signal can be carried out by considering the maximum delays (ETDs) of different wide-area measurements. A damping improvement has been proposed using the same methodology indicating a minimum outperformance of the remote signals. The proposed method is demonstrated using the well-known Klein-Rogers-Kundur multi-machine power system and the Vietnamese power system model.

Abstract: This paper introduces a screening method to determine the potential risk of interactions between a dynamic device and a generator with torsional oscillations. The proposed method introduces a factor called the radiality factor (RF) which is an indicator of the radialness of the network between the device and the generator. The RF is calculated in the sub-synchronous frequency range and plotted against the frequency (RF curves). The RF curves can then be used for screening of torsional interactions between the generator and other dynamic devices. The critical value for the RF is determined through a large number of sensitivity studies on a test system. This method surpasses the available screening method: unit interaction factor (UIF) calculations which is only applicable for inductive networks without series compensated lines.

Abstract: This paper presents a new control strategy for high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission based on the synchronverter concept: the sending-end rectifier controls emulate a synchronous motor (SM), and the receiving end inverter emulates a synchronous generator (SG). The two converters connected with a DC line provide what is called a synchronverter HVDC (SHVDC). The structure of the SHVDC is firstly analyzed. It is shown that the droop and voltage regulations included in the SHVDC structure are necessary and sufficient to well define the behavior of SHVDC. The standard parameters of the SG cannot be directly used for this structure. A specific tuning method of these parameters is proposed in order to satisfy the usual HVDC control requirements. The new tuning method is compared with the standard vector control in terms of local performances and fault critical clearing time (CCT) in the neighboring zone of the link. The test network is a 4-machine power system with parallel HVDC/AC transmission. The results indicate the contribution of the proposed controller to enhance the stability margin of the neighbor AC zone of the link.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework to quantify the impact of uncertainty that arises from load variations, renewable-based generation, and noise in communication channels on the automatic generation control (AGC) system. To this end, we rely on a model of the power system that includes the synchronous generator dynamics, the network, and the AGC system dynamics, as well as the effect of various sources of uncertainty. Then, we develop a method to analytically propagate the uncertainty from the aforementioned sources to the system frequency and area control error (ACE), and obtain expressions that approximate their probability distribution functions. We make use of this framework to obtain probabilistic expressions for the frequency performance criteria developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC); such expressions may be used to determine the limiting values of uncertainty that the system may withstand. The proposed ideas are illustrated through the Western Electricity Coordination Council (WECC) 9-bus 3-machine system and a 140-bus 48-machine system.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a reduced-order model for synchronous generator dynamics via selective modal analysis. Then, we use this reduced-order model to formulate a balancing authority (BA) area dynamic model. Next, we use the BA area model to design an adaptive automatic generation control (AGC) scheme, with self-tuning gain, that decreases the amount of regulation needed and potentially reduces the associated costs. In particular, we use the BA area model to derive a relationship between the actual frequency response characteristic (AFRC) of the BA area, the area control error, the system frequency, and the total generation. We make use of this relationship to estimate the AFRC online, and set the frequency bias factor equal to the online estimation. As a result, the AGC system is driven by the exact number of MW needed to restore the system frequency and the real power interchange to the desired values. We demonstrate the proposed ideas with a single machine infinite bus, the 9-bus 3-machine Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), and a 140-bus 48-machine systems.

Abstract: Wind energy is going to be a significant part of electric energy generation in the very near future. However, in addition to its intermittent nature that could lead to major difficulties for power system reliability and stability, the conventional control applied to wind turbines and their generators, usually doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs), does not allow them to participate in frequency regulation, whether short or long term. Moreover, the use of wind generators for autonomous frequency regulation is becoming an essential objective in power grids with reduced inertia and isolatedmicrogrid operation. While droop-control is suggested by many researchers to solve these problems, detailed analysis of droop-controlled DFIG units in microgrids has not been reported. To fill-out this gap, this paper presents torque-and power-droop implementations in DFIG-based units by some simple modifications in the conventional control and then, bymeans of small-signal modeling and eigen-value studies, shows how both techniques influence frequency stability. Sensitivity studies, with respect to the presence of turbine-and inverter-based generators in microgrids; and impacts of pitch-angle controller, wind speed variation and isolated mode operation with only wind-generators, are conducted. Time-domain simulation is utilized to verify the analytical results.

Abstract: In this paper, a new procedure based on a backward/forward sweep (BFS) algorithm for solving power flows in weakly meshed dc traction networks is presented. The proposed technique is able to consider the trains as nonlinear and non-smooth (nondifferentiable) voltage-dependent loads or generators. This feature permits the inclusion of the trains' overcurrent protection and the squeeze control. With the use of the mentioned controls, the conventional power flow problem becomes a voltage constrained power flow problem, and the interaction between the trains and the network can be accurately modeled. However, the train control induces a highly non-smooth voltage-dependent load characteristic, causing convergence problems in most of the derivative-based algorithms. The proposed algorithm is faster, more robust, and more stable than the derivative-based ones. In addition, the authors present all of the formulation in a compact matrix-based form by means of the graph theory application and the node incidence matrix.

Abstract: Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) and security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problems are necessary tools to system operators for operational planning and near-to-real-time operation. The solution times of these problems are challenging mainly due to their inherent large size. Previous studies have shown that relatively few of those problems' constraints serve to enclose their feasible set of solutions. Therefore, the constraints that do not contribute to the feasible set of solutions could be discarded to decrease the size of these problems and their associated solution times. Umbrella constraint discovery (UCD) has been proposed to identify and rule out redundant constraints in dc-SCOPF problems. In this paper, we propose an improvement over the original UCD formulation that exploits the structure of its parent SCOPF problem. This new partial UCD approach can lead to significant speed-ups in terms of UCD solution time and size. Based on the encouraging results for partial UCD on SCOPF, we apply the technique on SCUC. Alike in SCOPF, partial UCD can efficiently strip out redundant (i. e., non-umbrella) constraints off SCUC. We find, however, that because of its structure, SCUC has a much lower proportion of non-umbrella constraints in comparison to SCOPF.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach in estimating important parameters of power system transient stability model such as inertia constant and direct axis transient reactance in real time. It uses a variation of unscented Kalman filter (UKF) on the phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. The accurate estimation of these parameters is very important for assessing the stability and tuning the adaptive protection system on power swing relays. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in a simulated data from 16-machine 68-bus system model. The paper also presents the performance comparison between the UKF and EKF method in estimating the parameters. The robustness of method is further validated in the presence of noise that is likely to be in the PMU data in reality.

Abstract: As the need for faster power system dynamic simulations increases, it is essential to develop new algorithms that exploit parallel computing to accelerate those simulations. This paper proposes a parallel algorithm based on a two-level, Schur-complement-based, domain decomposition method. The two-level partitioning provides high parallelization potential (coarse- and fine-grained). In addition, due to the Schur-complement approach used to update the sub-domain interface variables, the algorithm exhibits high global convergence rate. Finally, it provides significant numerical and computational acceleration. The algorithm is implemented using the shared-memory parallel programming model, targeting inexpensive multi-core machines. Its performance is reported on a real system as well as on a large test system combining transmission and distribution networks.

Abstract: Distributed power electronic reactive power sources-such as smart PV inverters-may play an important role in regulating customer voltages and reducing system losses in future distribution systems. Though it is natural to consider model-based optimal control algorithms to coordinate these resources, those strategies typically require relatively large communications capabilities and accurate models. In this paper we present an alternative way to implement the optimization problem that circumvents these communications and modeling challenges. We present an Extremum Seeking (ES) control algorithm to modulate the reactive power output of VAR resources to minimize total real power delivery at the feeder substation subject to voltage magnitude constraints, without an explicit feeder model. We present results that guarantee a variety of distribution feeder objective functions are convex over a broad range of power flows and perform an analysis showing the convergence of the ES approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the method is equivalent to recently developed convex relaxations used to solve distribution optimal power flow problems.

Abstract: A novel procedure for estimating the total inertia of the Great Britain (GB) power system is presented. Following an instantaneous in-feed loss, regional variations in the estimate of inertia are obtained from measured frequency transients using installed synchronised phasor measurement units (PMUs). A method is proposed to first detect a suitable event for analysis, and then filter the measured transients in order to obtain a reliable estimate of inertia for a given region of the GB network. The total inertia for the whole system is then calculated as a summation, with an estimate also provided as to the contribution to inertia from residual sources, namely synchronously connected demand and embedded generation. The approach is first demonstrated on the full dynamic model of the GB transmission system, before results are presented from analyzing the impact of a number of instantaneous transmission in-feed loss events using phase-angle data provided by PMUs from the GB transmission network and also devices installed at the domestic supply at 4 GB universities.

Abstract: This paper presents a bilevel model for describing the interdependence of decisions between a retailer/aggregator and the distributed resources owners that the former serves and represents. Decision making is performed in a hierarchical fashion. The retailer performs the energy management of various resources indirectly; price signals are used as incentives for inducing the entities owning the distributed resources in a behavior that optimizes the operation and economic profit of the microgrid that they compose. The two-level interaction is formulated mathematically as a mathematical programming problem with complementarity constraints, while nonlinearities are replaced by equivalent linear expressions. The results of a characteristic case study indicate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed model.

Abstract: The recent deployment of distributed generation has led to a revolution in the use of distribution systems and the emergence of "smart grid" concepts. Smart grids are intended primarily as a means of facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources and of achieving greater system reliability and efficiency. Energy storage systems (ESSs) offer a number of benefits that can help utilities move toward those goals. One of those benefits is the capacity to improve the utilization of network infrastructure by means of proper load management. This paper proposes a methodology for allocating ESSs in distribution systems in order to defer system upgrades, minimize system losses, and take advantage of the arbitrage benefit. The cost and arbitrage benefit of energy storage installation are optimized with respect to system upgrade and energy losses costs. The primary goal of this research is to determine the optimal size and location of storage units to be installed, in addition to their optimal operation, so that total system costs are minimized, while system benefits are maximized. In this paper, a probabilistic load model is adopted instead of utilizing time-series based models, which provide an optimal solution that is valid only for the time-series pattern that is applied.

Abstract: The paper investigates the effect of age related failure of power transformers on the identification of most critical transformer sites for system reliability. The end-of-life failure model of power transformers is modified first to integrate loading conditions effect. The adopted Arrhenius-Weibull probability distribution, which represents the effect of thermal stress on the transformer's end-of-life failure, was compared with the commonly used Gaussian probability distribution model. The sensitivity of results to the uncertainty in model parameters is thoroughly assessed, and acceptable level of uncertainty is determined. The results demonstrated the importance of integration of loading conditions into the failure model. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the identification of critical transformer sites is not significantly affected by the uncertainty in the failure model parameters and that approximate ranges of parameters can be used instead of accurate values without significant, if any, loss in accuracy. The case studies were performed on a realistic transmission test system with 154 power transformers.

Abstract: Power system components have a relatively long life span and hence there is not enough data to derive an accurate end-of-life failure model. This contributes to the uncertainty in system reliability assessment. This paper discusses the quantification of the effect of uncertainty in end-of-life failure models on system reliability indices. This paper characterizes the uncertainty by a mixed aleatory-epistemic uncertainty model, where the aleatory uncertainty originated from the variability of failure events and the epistemic uncertainty originated from a lack of data. The mixed aleatory-epistemic uncertainty was propagated using two methods: Second Order Probability and Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DSET). Power transformers were chosen as the case study equipment and the methods were applied on a realistic transmission network.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized wide-area coordinated supplementary control of multiple line-commutated converter (LCC)-HVDC links to 1) prevent interactions among the HVDC links and 2) enhance the damping of the inter-area oscillatory modes. The proposed approach is based on the sparsity-promoting optimal control. The main features of the proposed approach are 1) it requires minimal communication infrastructure to achieve the control objectives and thus reduces the impacts of communication delays and noise, 2) it entails in an optimal gain which preserves the closed-loop stability and 3) it does not require the estimates of the system states. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated based on eigen analysis and time-domain simulation of an interconnected AC system that includes five LCC-HVDC links. Performance of the proposed controller is also compared with those of fully centralized and conventional local supplementary controllers and its merits are highlighted. The studies indicate the proposed controller, based on 13 remotely communicated signals, provides similar performance as that of a fully centralized optimal controller using 2050 communicated signals and is far superior to the conventional local supplementary controllers.

Abstract: This paper proposes a vehicle-to-grid reactive power support (V2GQ) strategy for optimal coordinated voltage regulation in distribution networks with high distributed generation (DG) penetration. The proposed algorithm employs plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), DG, and on-load tap changer (OLTC) to satisfy PEV charging demand and grid voltage requirements with relaxed tap operation, and minimum DG active power curtailment. The voltage regulation problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming and consists of three consecutive stages, in which successive stages apply the outputs of their preceding stages as constraints. The first stage aims to maximize the energy delivered to PEVs to assure PEV owner satisfactions. The second stage maximizes the DG extracted active power. Third stage minimizes the voltage deviation from its nominal value utilizing the available PEV and DG reactive powers. The main implicit objective of the third stage problem is relaxing the OLTC tap operation. In addition, the conventional OLTC control is replaced by a proposed centralized controller that utilizes the output of the third stage to set its tap position. Real-time simulations are developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal coordinated algorithm on a typical distribution network using OPAL-RT real-time simulator (RTS) in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application.

Abstract: Increasing wind capacity integration results in displacement of active power from conventional generators and a reduction in reactive power sources available. As such, voltage stability may become a concern in certain periods for power system operation particularly in weaker areas of the network. Thus, it is of importance to consider the AC constraints for optimal wind generation planning (long term) in order to decrease the possibility of a wind capacity allocation that requires costly remedies from the power system operation perspective (short term). In this work, a procedure is proposed for wind capacity allocation with the aim of benefiting from the potential of an optimal wind capacity allocation for enhancing the voltage stability margin. The procedure is based on a multi operating conditions voltage stability constrained optimal power flow. The wind capacity target is set and the loadability margin is tracked. The results will show the applicability of the proposed procedure and will emphasize the effects of the pattern of wind capacity allocation on the loadability margin. This will result in a wind capacity allocation that enhances the minimum loadability margin among the possible future operating conditions considered for planning. The procedure uses the Maximin concept for this purpose.

Abstract: In part II of this two-part paper, the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm for solving the microgrid (MG) day-ahead cooling and electricity coordinated scheduling is proposed. Significant improvements are made in comparison with the conventional PSO algorithm from two aspects. First, the mandatory correction is implemented to ensure the complex coupled constraints among the components of a particle are met after the particle's position is updated, which could enhance the algorithm performance when solving the problem including complex constraints. Second, it is assumed that a solution denoted by a particle occupies a neighboring area, the size of which decreases from a certain value to nearly zero as the iteration step increases to its limitation, which helps to avoid the pre-maturity of algorithm. For an MG composed of the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) units, PV panels, wind turbines, and storage batteries, a range of case studies under different MG operating modes are carried out through simulations. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed multi time-scale, multi energy-type coordinated MG scheduling solution can achieve the co-optimization of multi energy-type supply to meet customer's cooling and electricity demands, and make the MG be controllable as seen from the connected main grid.

Abstract: For optimal microgrid (MG) operation, one challenge is the supply of cooling and electricity energy is a coupled co-optimization issue when considering the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) units and ice-storage air-conditioners. Another challenge is the inherent randomness of renewable energy within the MG should be accommodated by MG itself. In Part I of this two-part paper, the partial load performance of CCHPs and the performance of ice-storage air-conditioners are modeled, and the cooling and electricity coordinated MG day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatching models are established. In day-ahead scheduling model, the uncertainty of wind and solar power is represented by multi-scenarios and the objective is to achieve the minimal expected MG operation cost. In real-time dispatching model, the different time-scale dispatch schemes are respectively applied for cooling and electricity to smooth out the fluctuations of renewable energy supply and to follow the variations of cooling and electricity demands by the fine dispatching of the components within MG such that the impact of MG to the connected main grid is minimal. The proposed MG multi time-scale cooling and electricity coordinated schedule achieves an integrated optimization for multi energy-type supply, and makes the MG be controllable as seen from the main grid.

Abstract: This letter presents a second-order cone formulation for AC power flow problem. The power flow equations are first derived as functions of more practical variables of power systems and then placed in a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. The proposed conic power flow (CPF) model can be solved efficiently through IPMs, and at the same time, it has a very good accuracy as compared to the full AC power flow model. Also, the proposed CPF can efficiently handle the ill-conditioned networks. The numerical efficiency and good accuracy of the model are shown by simulating various case studies.

Abstract: In this paper, a multi-period integrated framework is developed for generation expansion planning (GEP), transmission expansion planning (TEP), and natural gas grid expansion planning (NGGEP) problems for large-scale systems. New nodal generation requirements, new transmission lines, and natural gas (NG) pipelines are simultaneously obtained in a multi-period planning horizon. In addition, a new approach is proposed to compute NG load flow by considering grid compressors. In order to solve the large-scale mixed integer nonlinear problem, a framework is developed based on genetic algorithms. The proposed framework performance is investigated by applying it to a typical electric-NG combined grid. Moreover, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for real-world systems, it has been applied to the Iranian power and NG system, including 98 power plants, 521 buses, 1060 transmission lines, and 92 NG pipelines. The results indicate that the proposed framework is applicable for large-scale and real-world systems.

Abstract: With the increasingly high demand for well-trained power systems engineers, the University of Pittsburgh has partnered with Eaton in the creation of the new Electric Power Systems Laboratory at the Swanson School of Engineering. This laboratory demands the capability to perform a wide variety of experimental procedures while providing students and researchers with a seamless working environment. To accomplish that goal, a novel lab workbench was developed. This lab workbench integrates the load banks necessary for laboratory procedures with advanced metering, controls and safety features, and contains them within a work station ideally suited for the laboratory space. This paper details the development of those lab workbenches, from concept, to design, to prototype construction, to testing. Additionally, this work describes planned classroom experiments utilizing the developed bench. Ultimately the realized workbench demonstrates its capability to be reconfigured to suit the demands of both education as well as new research projects for undergraduate and graduate studies.

Abstract: Given the significant amount of installed generation-capacity based on wind power, and also due to current economic downturn, the subsidies and incentives that have been widely used by wind-power producers to recover their investment costs have decreased and are even expected to disappear in the near future. In these conditions, wind-power producers need to develop offering strategies to make their investments profitable counting solely on the market. This paper proposes a multi-stage risk-constrained stochastic complementarity model to derive the optimal offering strategy of a wind-power producer that participates in both the day-ahead and the balancing markets. Uncertainties concerning wind-power productions, market prices, demands' bids, and rivals' offers are efficiently modeled using a set of scenarios. The conditional-value-at-risk metric is used to model the profit risk associated with the offering decisions. The proposed model is recast as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming program solvable using available branch-and-cut algorithms. Results of a case study are reported and discussed to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: A global multiscale method based on a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm to characterize the global behavior of transient processes recorded using wide-area sensors is proposed. The method interprets global dynamic behavior in terms of both, spatial patterns or shapes and temporal patterns associated with dynamic modes containing essentially single-frequency components, from which the mode shapes, frequencies and growth and decay rates of the modes can be extracted simultaneously. These modes are then used to detect the coherent and dominant structures within the data. The technique is well suited for fast wide-area monitoring and assessment of global instability in the context of modern data fusion-based estimation techniques. Results of the application of the proposed method to large, high-dimensional data sets are encouraging.

Abstract: Generating units, participating in the secondary frequency control of a control area, are usually spinning units already connected to the network and operating outside their range of optimal performance. This paper deals with an alternative method of providing secondary frequency control called Rapid-Start (RS). It consists in assigning a regulation band to several off-line units (RS units) which are capable of being started and connected rapidly, therefore allowing the online units to operate closer to their nominal power. As RS operation may have economic benefits, an appropriate algorithm to start up an RS unit needs to be developed. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate, compare, and choose the most appropriate RS algorithm among the ones developed for a certain AGC control area. An optimization model provides a reference by determining the hypothetically ideal start-ups and shut-downs of RS units. In addition, the definition of performance indexes to evaluate, compare, and choose the different RS algorithms is proposed. The proposed methodology is illustrated for a secondary frequency control zone within the Spanish power system by using real data signals.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand response (DR) for voltage and frequency support of islanded microgrids. The proposed method basically relies on extracting information from real and reactive power sensitivities at different buses for minimizing the voltage and frequency deviations of the islanded microgrid. To this aim, a new power flow procedure is adopted in which the frequency deviation appears as an additional state variable. This helps to calculate the required setpoints for the DERs as well as the amount of the demanded power curtailed through the controllable loads to meet the overall goal. The loads are classified based on their a-priori known controllability degree. To minimize the manipulated load, the most effective buses are selected based on their associated sensitivity values. In the grid-connected mode, the total operation cost is minimized, while the microgrid bus voltages are maintained within the pre-specified acceptable range. In both modes, the whole process is formulated as a multiobjective problem solved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO). The control procedure involves a series of commands for which the incident command system (ICS) is used as a secure communication structure. The performance of the proposed control framework is evaluated for the case of a typical MV microgrid in both grid-connected and islanded modes.

Abstract: The paper presents a unified control framework which allows the responsive end-user devices (REDs) such as inverter-based photovoltaic systems (PVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and domestic controllable loads at residential level to effectively participate in the voltage and frequency control of the smart grid. The presented control framework basically relies on extracting information from active and reactive power sensitivities at different buses. In this framework, for voltage control, two support groups namely the active support group and the reactive support group are dedicated to each transmission bus. However, for frequency control, only one active support group is defined for the entire system. The REDs used for voltage and frequency control are classified based on their controllability degree. The idea of selecting the most effective buses is also presented to minimize the burden of communication commands. Following the detection of voltage or frequency violation in the system, the targeted buses are identified and receive corrective control signals to accordingly change their active and/or reactive powers. To minimize the manipulated active and reactive powers, the whole process is formulated as a multiobjective problem solved by the particle swarm optimization. The control procedure involves a series of commands for which the incident command system is used as a secure communication structure.

Abstract: Converter control is an important aspect of voltage-source-converter high-voltage dc (VSC-HVDC) based multi-terminal dc grids. Variants of power drooped against dc voltage control have previously been proposed for this purpose. However, there is at this time no clear methodology available on how to select the size of the droop constants for distributing a power mismatch, following, e.g., a converter trip, on several converters. This paper proposes a methodology for establishing droop constants for a variant of power drooped against dc voltage called pilot voltage droop control. The methodology is derived from the basic control laws in a straight forward fashion and the accuracy is exemplified by time domain simulations in Digsilent's Powerfactory platform.

Abstract: We present a combined look-ahead dispatch and reserve optimization formulation, which extends our recent work on time-coupled reserve policies and employs the recent notion of generalized decision rules from the robust optimization literature. This aims to improve the performance of traditional linear decision rules when applied to short-term electrical reserve operation. We derive a primal problem whose solution is a time-coupled rule for up-and down-regulating the power injections of each controllable device, such as a generator or energy storage unit, in response to discovered values of prediction errors. This rule depends on the "bin" into which measured prediction errors fall, so that, for example, up-regulation follows a different rule to down-regulation. We also derive an associated dual problem, whose solution provides a lower-bound on the best possible primal cost. This allows the suboptimality of a candidate solution based on a particular decision rule parameterization to be bounded. The primal and dual solutions are also compared to the so-called prescient case, in which the values of the uncertainty are known in advance. We demonstrate the method using numerical case studies, including the standard IEEE-118 bus network, in which a minimum possible reserve cost is identified using the dual lower-bounding approach.

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of an adaptive power oscillation damping (POD) controller for a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) equipped with energy storage. This is achieved using a signal estimation technique based on a modified recursive least square (RLS) algorithm, which allows a fast, selective, and adaptive estimation of the low-frequency electromechanical oscillations from locally measured signals during power system disturbances. The proposed method is effective in increasing the damping of the system at the frequencies of interest, also in the case of system parameter uncertainties and at various connection points of the compensator. First, the analysis of the impact of active and reactive power injection into the power system will be carried out using a simple two-machine system model. A control strategy that optimizes active and reactive power injection at various connection points of the STATCOM will be derived using the simplified model. Small-signal analysis of the dynamic performance of the proposed control strategy will be carried out. The effectiveness of the proposed control method to provide power oscillation damping irrespective of the connection point of the device and in the presence of system parameter uncertainties will be verified through simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: A number of methods have been proposed and implemented to improve system damping against low-frequency electromechanical oscillations in the power system. Among these, flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) can be used to provide power oscillation damping (POD) function to the power system. The design of the POD algorithms in these devices requires estimation of the power oscillation frequency components and this is mostly achieved through the use of various filter combinations. However, these filter-based solutions are characterized by low bandwidth to extract the required signal components accurately, and this limits the dynamic performance of the FACTS controllers. Moreover, the filters are designed for specific frequencies, and a change in the system would reduce the performance of the methods. Thus, there is a need for a better estimation algorithm with fast and selective estimation of the required signal that is robust against system parameter uncertainties. In this paper, this is achieved by the use of a recursive least square algorithm that uses variable forgetting factor and a frequency adaptation mechanism. The investigated method has fast estimation in transient conditions without compromising its selectivity in steady state. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proven through simulation as well as experimental verification.

Abstract: The use of interruptible load (IL) resources to improve the primary frequency response (PFR) of an interconnected power system has been proposed and, for speed, it is likely that such resources would operate autonomously on local frequency measurements. The commitment of the resources, however, could be coordinated globally and frequently in accordance with the state of the system. This paper investigates the minimum cost commitment of IL resources to ensure the PFR of a system remains within specified limits. The binary integer programming problem considers the commitment cost of each IL resource and includes nonlinear frequency constraints specified by the transient stability simulation of the system. A method to estimate the contribution of an IL resource towards meeting a frequency constraint is proposed and incorporated into a solution approach that involves the iterative solving of a linear commitment problem. The sensitivity-based estimation method reduces the amount of computationally burdensome transient stability simulation required by the algorithm with little increase in the final solution cost. An IEEE 118-bus test case study with 1000 IL resources demonstrates the benefit of the estimation method.

Abstract: Identification of post-fault topology is critical to not only cascaded outage prevention but also prediction of post-fault dynamic behavior. Existing methods for identifying the tripped lines rely on steady state SCADA/PMU measurements, and therefore fail to accomplish their task within fractions of a second. This limits their application to online transient stability assessment. This paper presents a method for online identification of post-fault topology on the basis of information of the pre-fault operating conditions and synchronized measurements at all generator buses. The proposed technique identifies the tripped line with negligible delay, before the system reaches steady state. An innovative index, which represents the normalized kinetic energy gained by generators immediately after the fault, is used to minimize the search set of possible tripped lines. For every candidate line, the generator output powers are calculated considering the line as tripped, and the minimum error between the measured and the calculated generator powers is used to finally identify the tripped line. The IEEE 39-bus system and a 246-bus North Indian Grid representation are used to show the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a non-linear data analysis technique that can quantify the number and duration of a dynamical system of being in nearly the same area in phase space trajectory. This paper proposes three applications of RQA to analyse power system dynamics. These are denoising of PMU data, localization of power system events, and transient stability contingency ranking of power system. All three applications have been demonstrated using a multimachine test system.

Abstract: A modified fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA) combined with a probabilistic approach are proposed in this paper to coordinate and optimize the parameters of power system stabilizers (PSSs) and static VAR compensator (SVC) damping controller for improving the probabilistic small-signal stability of power systems with large-scale wind generation, taking into consideration the stochastic uncertainty of system operating conditions. It is generally accepted that there is a threat to the stability of power system with penetration of wind farm. In addition, the stochastic fluctuations of wind generation make PSSs tuning more difficult. In this paper, PSSs and SVC damping controller are employed for suppressing local and inter-area low frequency oscillation. In order to eliminate the adverse effect between PSSs and SVC damping controller, the MFOA based on the probabilistic eigenvalue is applied to coordinate and optimize their parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on two test systems.

Abstract: A general platform is introduced to study the dynamics of power systems with high voltage dc (HVDC) transmission links. Small-signal stability, voltage stability, and interaction phenomena of power systems with both line-commutated-converter HVDC (LCC-HVDC) and voltage-source-converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) are addressed using the proposed platform. In this platform, the entire power system is modeled as a multivariable feedback control system (FCS) which consists of three interconnected blocks. The contents as well as the inputs and outputs of the blocks are selected such that the conventional analysis tools for power system stability are applicable, both in the time and frequency domains. In the FCS model, the relationships between different instabilities are clear, and participant agents of each instability can be determined. The model is developed in a modular and hybrid style, to make it feasible for a large power system. The proposed model is validated against an electromagnetic transient simulation program (PSCAD) using time responses.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) refers to the consumers' activities for changing the load profile with the purpose of lowering cost, improving power quality or reliability of power system. Enhancement in participation of the DR is widely recognized as a profit-making pattern in distribution systems for both residential units (to increase their benefits) and distribution companies (DISCO) (to reduce their peak demand and costs). The target of this research is concentrated on proposing a new strategy for optimal scheduling of flexible loads for the next day. Then, the day ahead pricing (DAP) is modeled using the inclining block rates (IBR), assumed for retail electricity markets, to investigate the efficiency of the proposed strategy. At the same time, the appliances stochastic time of use (ASTOU) are taken into account in residential units for non-controllable part of the load during a day stochastically. Among five various copulas, the Gaussian copula (GC) function shows the best performance in modeling and estimation of non-controllable load consumption. Finally, simulations, performed with the GAMS, illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach which is formulated as a stochastic nonlinear programming (NLP) modeled by the GC. Notice that copulas use samples of real data gathered from residential units.

Abstract: We consider the problem of deriving an explicit approximate solution of the nonlinear power equations that describe a balanced power distribution network. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a practical solution to the power flow equations, and we propose an approximation that is linear in the active and reactive power demands of the PQ buses. For this approximation, which is valid for generic power line impedances and grid topology, we derive a bound on the approximation error as a function of the grid parameters. We illustrate the quality of the approximation via simulations, we show how it can also model the presence of voltage controlled (PV) buses, and we discuss how it generalizes the DC power flow model to lossy networks.

Abstract: Market power assessment is a prime concern when designing a deregulated electricity market. In this paper, we propose a new functional market power measure, termed transmission constrained network flow (TCNF), that unifies three large classes of transmission constrained structural market power indices in the literature: residual supply based, network flow based, and minimal generation based. Furthermore, it is suitable for demand-response and renewable integration and hence more amenable to identifying market power in the future smart grid. The measure is defined abstractly, and allows incorporation of power flow equations in multiple ways; we investigate the current market operations using a DC approximation and further explore the possibility of including detailed AC power flow models through semidefinite relaxation, and interior-point algorithms from Matpower. Finally, we provide extensive simulations on IEEE benchmark systems and highlight the complex interaction of engineering constraints with market power assessment.

Abstract: This paper proposes an appropriate offering strategy method for an electric railway company (ERC) to participate in reserve markets. In this respect, first the problem of energy and reserve scheduling for the ERC is modeled in a deterministic way. Next, a robust optimization technique is used to solve the problem taking into account the uncertain energy and reserve prices as well as the uncertain hourly energy demand of the electric railway substations. Afterward, a reserve offering curve construction algorithm based on the solution of robust energy and reserve scheduling is proposed. This algorithm takes into account the correlation between upward and downward reserve prices. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a realistic case study based on the characteristic of an ERC in Switzerland is presented.

Abstract: Without appropriate counteraction, the high amount of installed distributed generators (DG) at the low-voltage distribution level may cause overloading of electrical equipments and violation of voltage limits in many grids. Because of the historically grown low-voltage grids and their local and geographic dependencies, complex grid structures can be found. Thus, the discrimination of grids concerning their DG capacity is a difficult task. We propose a novel three-step classification strategy to distinguish various kinds of low-voltage grids regarding their DG capacity. Our method is based on a stochastic simulation procedure and a subsequent parametric stochastic modeling, which allows for a probability based classification approach. The classification results can be regarded as probabilistic class memberships or, if sharp memberships are required, the class with the maximum probability can be selected. The proposed approach will not only help distribution system operators to face the challenges in future grid planning and focus their work on further enhancement of weak grid structures, but it will also be valuable in choosing relevant grids for detailed surveys. To demonstrate that our approach actually leads to meaningful classification results for real low-voltage grids, we empirically evaluate the results for 300 real rural and suburban grids by comparing them to classification assessments of experts from distribution grid planning practice.

Abstract: Electromechanical stability of transmission systems has been challenged by many factors such as market re-regulation, high penetration of renewables, operation under stressed conditions. After the implementation of electricity markets, it appeared evident that the transmission grid needs autonomous capacity to control the system during sudden disturbances and new protection schemes to maintain stability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the complementarity, connection technology and network control strategy of offshore wind generation on the probabilistic small-signal stability of power systems. The cumulant-based theory is firstly applied to assess the variances of both the complementarity of combined wind power and the probabilistic small-signal stability of power systems. These variances are later employed as two indices to explain how the different complementarity levels, connection topologies and DC network control schemes of offshore wind generation affects the probabilistic distribution of critical eigenvalue and thus the probabilistic small-signal stability. In the paper, an example of 16-machine 5-area power system with three grid-connected offshore wind farms is presented. The index of probabilistic small-signal stability is computed and then compared under two complementarity conditions, two typical HVDC transmission systems through which the offshore wind farms are connected, and two DC grid control schemes, respectively. It is demonstrated that complementarity can effectively enhance probabilistic stability and multi-terminal HVDC may have either beneficial or detrimental impact on small-signal stability depending on the control pattern and setting when compared with point-to-point topology.

Abstract: The increasing injections of energy from renewable energy sources far away from load centers have resulted in a more congested transmission grid. As the construction of new lines is costly, other options should be exploited as well. One possible solution is dynamic thermal line rating (DLR), which, instead of static thermal line rating, adapts the transmission capacity based on the expected weather conditions. This results, on average, in higher transmission capacities. First pilot projects have proven its efficiency. This paper analyzes the potential of DLR and demonstrates how DLR can be integrated in a dispatch optimization while managing possible errors in the forecasts of the line ratings with two different approaches. Both approaches result in robust optimization problems and guarantee that there is a suitable remedial action for all realizations of forecast errors given by uncertainty sets. The first approach relies on corrective control actions that are calculated centrally, once the actual line rating is known. The second approach relies on affine policies, which directly relate the current line rating to corrective control measures. This approach can be deployed in a decentralized manner. In case studies, the two approaches are applied and the reduction of overall operational costs is investigated exemplarily as a function of the forecast accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper we present a framework to efficiently characterize the available operational flexibility in a multi-area power system. We focus on the available reserves and the tie-line flows. The proposed approach is an alternative to the current calculation of the available transfer capacity (ATC), as it considers location and availability of reserves, transmission constraints, and interdependencies of tie-line flows between different areas, while it takes into account the N - 1 security criterion. The method is based on computational geometry using polytopic projections. It requires only a limited amount of information exchange and does not need central coordination. The method has two versions: a passive approach, and an active approach where neighboring areas can share reserves. In that respect we also introduce the term "exportable flexibility". Case studies demonstrate the improved tie-line utilization, especially if reserves are shared, and the visualization benefits.

Abstract: The paper proposes a new reliability model of ageing distribution cable and simulation methodology for prioritization of cable replacement. The proposed reliability model combines IEC cable thermal model, Arrhenius aging model and Weibull probability distribution. Here, Weibull scale parameter is defined through the Arrhenius aging model, in which conductor temperature is governed by the cable thermal model. A novel estimation method for the calculation of Arrhenius model parameters is proposed. The cable reliability model is then incorporated into the developed sequential Monte Carlo simulation procedure and reliability indicators and loss-of-lives are calculated. An industry based cable ranking scheme is further proposed to prioritize individual cable due for replacement. The whole methodology is tested on several medium voltage distribution networks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the cooperative control problem of AC microgrids consisting of both voltage-controlled voltage-source inverters and current-controlled voltage-source inverters. The voltage-controlled voltage-source inverters dictate the frequency and voltage of the microgrid and the current-controlled voltage-source inverters provide quick and decoupled active and reactive power support to the microgrid. To handle the nonlinear and heterogeneous dynamics of the inverters, we have developed a distributed feedforward approach based on the cooperative control of multi-agent systems. The proposed controller presents three advantages in comparison with the existing works. First, all the inverters share one communication network, and the locations of the inverters over the communication network can be arbitrarily sited as long as all the inverters are connected. Second, the selection of the control gains does not rely on either the whole microgrid dynamics or the topology of the communication network. Third, the inverters' dynamics after input-output feedback linearization are allowed to be different. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by the simulation study of a microgrid system for three cases, i.e., frequency and voltage restoration after islanding, active and reactive power adjustment after abrupt load changes and system performance subject to communication link failure and restoration.

Abstract: The expected impact of distributed generation (DG) into Smart Grid represents a great challenge of the future for power systems. In particular, the integration of DG based on renewable energy sources (RESs) in distribution networks, without compromising the integrity of the grid, requires the development of proper control techniques to allow power delivery to customers in compliance with power quality and reliability standards. This paper proposes a coordinated local control approach that allows distribution system operator (DSO) and independent power producers (IPPs) to obtain benefits offering the voltage regulation ancillary service to DSO and maximizing allowable active power production for each RES unit belonging to the same IPP. The control is based on a cooperation of data transfer between DSO and IPPs. In order to realize such cooperation, a nonlinear constrained optimization problem is formulated and solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. The validation of the proposed control technique has been conducted through several time series simulations on a real MV Italian distribution system.

Abstract: Electricity markets are based on several sequential energy and reserve trading mechanisms to constantly maintain the balance between generation and demand. During the last years, reserve markets are getting much importance all around the world with the increasing social awareness of the renewable energy benefits. Additional reserve quantities and larger remunerations are being implemented by the regulators since this renewable energy is highly dependent on weather conditions uncertainties. Utilities are therefore demanding more and more powerful models to better optimize their reserve bidding curves to be sent to the system operators. This paper describes a new methodology to obtain an optimized real bidding curve for the secondary (spinning) reserve market. The approach is based on the maximization of a company profit, assuming a set of residual demand curves scenarios for its competitors' representation, and considering the day-ahead market opportunity cost to build the reserve cost curve. The case study validates the main features of the proposed methodology by its application to the Spanish secondary reserve market. This methodology is being daily used by one of the most important electricity companies in Spain.

Abstract: We prove that the active power through a branch (referred to as branch active power) in a power system is a continuous function of the bifurcation parameter in the closed interval from an initial parameter value to the bifurcation-point value of a saddle-node bifurcation (SNB) or limit-induced bifurcation (LIB) of the power flow equation (PFE). Then we show that generally there is a sequence of branch active powers meeting maxima when the parameters are equal to intermediate values in the closed interval. These results can be used to qualitatively evaluate and classify the state of power system operation conditions in terms of voltage stability. Also, they well explain the limitation of the direct current (DC) power flow methods on stressed power systems. Numerical simulations of the IEEE 118-bus and 57-bus systems are used to illustrate the studies and their applications.

Abstract: In conventional optimal power flow (OPF), parameters of electrical components such as resistance and thermal ratings of the overhead lines, are assumed to be constant despite the fact that they are strongly sensitive to the weather effect (e.g., temperature or wind speed) which influences the accuracy of optimal power flow results. This paper introduces a weather-based optimal power flow (WB-OPF) algorithm with wind farm integration by considering the temperature related resistance and dynamic line rating (DLR) of overhead transmission lines. A method of calculating the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead lines, given the weather conditions, is presented as a set of coupled temperature and power flow equations. A simplified general model is proposed to calculate the dynamic line rating (DLR) for maximizing the utilization of wind power. A Primal-dual Interior Point (PDIP) method is developed to solve the WB-OPF problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and demonstrated in the paper by two example power systems.

Abstract: Distributed energy storage ( DES) offers a number of benefits to improve the power system reliability. This paper presents an improved corrective security constrained optimal power flow (CSCOPF) with DES system. The proposed DES model takes into account the current state of charge (SOC) and the energy capacity model of the DES. The corrective control actions employed in the paper include not only the traditional long-term rescheduling control actions, but also the short-term post-contingency fast corrective control of the DES. A hybrid method is developed to solve the improved CSCOPF problem, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and demonstrated in the paper by three example power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved corrective security constrained optimal power flow (CSCOPF) for a meshed AC/DC power transmission network with voltage source converter based multi-terminal HVDC (VSC-MTDC) grids. The security constrains of N-1 contingencies for both AC and DC networks are fully considered in the CSCOPF problem. The corrective actions employed in this paper include not only the traditional long-term rescheduling control actions of the AC system, but also the short term post-contingency fast corrective control of multi-terminal VSC-HVDC. A hybrid method is developed to solve the improved CSCOPF problem and the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and demonstrated in this paper by two example meshed AC/DC power systems.

Abstract: Future power systems could benefit considerably from having a continuous real-time estimate of system inertia. If realized, this could provide reference inputs to proactive control and protection systems which could enhance not only system stability but also operational economics through, for example, more informed ancillary reserve planning using knowledge of prevailing system conditions and stability margins. Performing these predictions in real time is a significant challenge owing to the complex stochastic and temporal relationships between available measurements. This paper proposes a statistical model capable of estimating system inertia in real time through observed steady-state and relatively small frequency variations; it is trained to learn the features that inter-relate steady-state averaged frequency variations and system inertia, using historical system data demonstrated over two consecutive years. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a Gaussian Mixture Model with temporal dependence encoded as Markov chains. Applied to the U.K. power system, it produces an optimized mean squared error within 0.1 s(2) for 95% of the daily estimation if being calibrated on a half-hourly basis and maintains robustness through measurement interruptions of up to a period of two hours.

Abstract: As the amount of distributed generation (DG) is growing worldwide, the need to increase the hosting capacity of distribution systems without reinforcements is becoming nowadays a major concern. This paper explores how the DG hosting capacity of active distribution systems can be increased by means of network reconfiguration, both static, i.e., grid reconfiguration at planning stage, and dynamic, i.e., grid reconfiguration using remotely controlled switches as an active network management (ANM) scheme. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer, nonlinear, multi-period optimal power flow (MP-OPF) which aims to maximize the DG hosting capacity under thermal and voltage constraints. This work further proposes an algorithm to break-down the large problem size when many periods have to be considered. The effectiveness of the approach and the significant benefits obtained by static and dynamic reconfiguration options in terms of DG hosting capacity are demonstrated using a modified benchmark distribution system.

Abstract: Integrating wind power into power systems contributes to existing variability in system operations. Current methods to mitigate this variability and uncertainty focus on using conventional generator ramping capability. There is also the option of using wind power itself to mitigate the variability and uncertainty that it introduces into the system. This paper introduces the concept of a flexible dispatch margin as a means for wind to participate in mitigating net variability and net uncertainty. In providing a flexible dispatch margin, wind generators under-schedule in the hour-ahead energy market in order to have additional expected flexibility available for the real-time market. The implementation of the flexible dispatch margin is analyzed in a two-stage optimization model with recourse to the flexible dispatch margin, flexible demand and generator ramping. This modeling framework combines Monte Carlo simulations with AC OPF analysis, using the IEEE 39-bus test system. Results show that use of the flexible dispatch margin decreases the reliance on peaking generators to mitigate net variability and uncertainty, and also decreases the frequency of price spike events, particularly as wind penetration increases from 10% to 30%. The analysis emphasizes the importance of increasing flexible resource capability as power system variability and uncertainty increase.

Abstract: This paper presents a new polyhedral approximation for the quadratic cost curve of thermal units for the unit commitment problem. The approximation is tight, can be represented by rational numbers, and its size grows logarithmically with respect to the required precision. In addition, the scalability is improved compared to the direct resolution of the quadratic problem involved, due to the linear mixed-integer formulation. On the other hand, the particular structure of the unit commitment problem guarantees that the solution of the mixed-integer linear formulation proposed is an epsilon-optimal of the original problem. This property allows the direct comparison of the proposed approximation with the original formulation. In most cases, analyzed results indicate that the proposed approach has the best performance compared to other formulations where the bounds of the quadratic cost function are known.

Abstract: Traditional stochastic programming methods are widely used for solving hydroelectric reservoirs management problems under uncertainty. With these methods, random parameters are described using a scenario tree possessing an unstructured topology. Therefore, traditional methods can potentially handle high-order time-correlation effects, but their computational requirements grow exponentially with the branching level used to represent parameters (e.g., load, inflows, prices). Consequently, random parameters must be discretized very coarsely and, as a result, numerical solutions of mid-term optimization models can be quite sensitive to small perturbations to the tree parameters. In this paper, we propose a new approach for managing high-capacity reservoirs over an extended horizon (1-3 years). We partition the planning horizon in two stages and assume that a memory loss occurs at the end of the first stage. We propose a new Benders decomposition algorithm designed specifically to exploit this simplification. The low memory requirement of our method enables to consider a much higher branching level than would be possible with previous methods. The proposed approach is tested on a 104-week production planning problem with stochastic inflows.

Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum distributed energy resource (DER) capacity that can be connected to low-voltage (LV) networks without creating voltage-rise problems. That maximum capacity depends on the network characteristics and on the candidate sites for DER connection. When sites are multiple and LV networks are poorly characterized, such maximum capacity cannot be determined with power-flow or other admittance-matrix-based approaches. This paper proposes an approach to estimate voltage rise caused by DER under reduced network characterization. Such approach is built upon customary voltage and impedance measurements to be made at the sites of DER injection and gives sufficiently accurate results under most practical situations. The paper validates the accuracy of the proposed approach against exact power-flow results for well-characterized networks and load situations and provides guidelines for DER connection based on maximum capacity nodal allocation.

Abstract: Improved formulations of and solution techniques for the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem are critical to improving current market practices in economic dispatch. We introduce the IV-ACOPF formulation that unlike canonical ACOPF formulations-which represent network balancing through nonlinear coupling-is based on a current injections approach that linearly couple the quadratic constraints at each bus; yet, the IV-ACOPF is mathematically equivalent to the canonical ACOPF formulation. We propose a successive linear programming (SLP) approach to solve the IV-ACOPF, which we refer to as the SLP IV-ACOPF algorithm. The SLP IV-ACOPF leverages commercial LP solvers and can be readily extended and integrated into more complex decision processes, e.g., unit commitment and transmission switching. We demonstrate with the standard MATPOWER test suite an acceptable quality of convergence to a best-known solution and linear scaling of computational time in proportion to network

The proposed method has proved to be highly effective in terms of both reliability and sharpness through a real case study using measurement data obtained from Hong Kong Observatory.

Abstract: The paper assesses the cyber-security of power systems static state estimation (SE) in the possible presence of phasor measurement units (PMUs). Attacks are considered in the Jacobian matrix or the measurement function of the state estimation leading to the presence of coordinated leverage points. Leverage points, which are outliers, constitute a very challenging attack configuration even if randomly present. It is shown that coordinated cyber-attacks when applied to the Jacobian matrix raise major concerns about robust SE. The vulnerability of the least trimmed squares (LTS) estimator, which is robust towards leverage points, is shown. More generally, the weaknesses of robust regression equivariant estimators are discussed if attacks are developed and optimized based on a projection framework. Attack scenarios are outlined considering the number of attacked Jacobian elements, a decomposition of the system to maximize robustness, and whether a DC or AC formulation is used by the operator. Stealthy attacks that stay undetected with respect to the robust LTS are studied. Masked attacks are defined as well. Some possible solutions and remedial actions are proposed. Robust state estimation methods are evaluated and compared in the presence of different configurations of attacks through Monte Carlo simulations on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus test beds.

Abstract: Common information model (CIM) in vogue represents transmission and distribution components, and market operations in the perspective of electrical system, as unified modeling language (UML) objects. UML is object centric. CIM can offer interoperability and facilitate model exchange for large systems and is being adopted by many utilities. However, dealing effectively with multiple business processes is the backbone of the restructured power systems. Since CIM lacks chronological process sense, this has to be superimposed on CIM models, which is not easy due to inherent limitations of UML. To overcome this, this paper proposes to utilize business process modeling notation (BPMN) standards as a kind of pre-processor. BPMN is used to represent process centric interoperability requirements as business objects. UML object representation in CIM model is derived subsequently from it. The proposal is illustrated with an application use case-deriving CIM model of day-ahead market (DAM) transaction of distribution company, from its business process representation. Semantic model of DAM transaction using CIM IEC 62325 (Markets) and extensions required are presented with a sample Indian system. DAM models in BPMN and CIM can be utilized to build an efficient software application.

Abstract: This paper models and analyzes a power distribution system with sources connected through inverters. The stabilizing effect of generator rotational inertia is emulated through inverter droop control logic. We model the nonlinear dynamics of the system with multiple distributed droop inverters using dynamical phasors. Linearizing the system around the steady-state, we construct closed-loop transfer functions from exogenous disturbances to system states. This allows to evaluate the load disturbance impact on the inverter power and line voltage profile. As an example, the distribution system with 150 inverters is used to illustrate the approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-nodal intertemporal Cournot gaming model with transmission constraints and uses it to simulate energy-only and capacity-energy market designs in the presence of uncertainties stemming from intermittent renewable power generation. Both market paradigms are compared to a competitive benchmark in order to determine which one performs better in a concentrated market with significant penetration of wind and solar generation. As a specific example, the model is applied to the South Australian zone of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The simulation results for the time interval 2013-2030 show that the capacity-energy market has the potential to induce significant new capacity and push prices much closer to the competitive level in contrast to the current energy-only market design.

Abstract: This paper provides a systematic approach to address the fundamental electricity auction issue regarding how to include security boundaries associated with system stability into a security-constrained DC-OPF-based model. These boundaries are linearly approximated by a reduced number of hyperplanes, from which a set of linear inequality security/stability constraints is derived and included into a proposed voltage security-constrained DC-OPF auction model. This allows the proper implementation of a true DC formulation, taking full advantage of its associated simplicity and robustness in the solution algorithm. Case studies are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method and to demonstrate that the market clearing and power dispatch resulting from the optimization solution process are within the desired feasible and secure region, contrary to the typical security constrained DC-OPF auction model, which may fail to meet this condition.

Abstract: We consider the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem, formulated as a nonconvex Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) with complex variables. ACOPF may be solved to global optimality with a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation in cases where its QCQP formulation attains zero duality gap. However, when there is positive duality gap, no optimal solution to the SDP relaxation is feasible for ACOPF. One way to find a global optimum is to partition the problem using a spatial branch-and-bound method. Tightening upper and lower variable bounds can improve solution times in spatial branching by potentially reducing the number of partitions needed. We propose special-purpose closed-form bound tightening methods to tighten limits on nodal powers, line flows, phase angle differences, and voltage magnitudes. Computational experiments are conducted using a spatial branch-and-cut solver. We construct variants of IEEE test cases with high duality gaps to demonstrate the effectiveness of the bound tightening procedures.

Abstract: The total supply capability (TSC) is an important index for assessing the reliability of a distribution power system. In this paper, two models to evaluate the TSC are established. In the first, the TSC is acquired with the conditions that all load outages can be restored via network reconfiguration with transformers' N-1 contingencies, i.e., that all constraints related to branch thermal ratings and bus-voltage limits can be satisfied following restoration for each N-1 contingency. The second model, which is revision of the first, considers the daily load curves for different classes of customers, e.g., residential, commercial and industrial. Both models can be formulated as mixed integer problems with second-order cone programming (MISOCP), which can be solved using commercially available optimization software. Two test systems are used to demonstrate the applicability of the presented models. Numerical results show that the presented model is more accurate than the previously published models. This proposed analytical approach can be applied in a range of network planning studies, e.g., for selecting appropriate ratings of transformers, or for optimal locating of circuit breakers and distributed energy resources.

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient methodology is proposed to deal with segmented-time reconfiguration problem of distribution networks coupled with segmented-time reactive power control of distributed generators. The target is to find the optimal dispatching schedule of all controllable switches and distributed generators' reactive powers in order to minimize comprehensive cost. Corresponding constraints, including voltage profile, maximum allowable daily switching operation numbers (MADSON), reactive power limits, and so on, are considered. The strategy of grouping branches is used to simplify the formulated mathematical problem and a hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) method is presented to search the optimal solution. Fuzzy adaptive inference is integrated into basic HPSO method in order to avoid being trapped in local optima. The proposed fuzzy adaptive inference-based hybrid PSO algorithm (FAHPSO) is implemented in VC++ 6.0 program language. A modified version of the typical 70-node distribution network and several real distribution networks are used to test the performance of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed methodology is an efficient method for comprehensive cost minimization in distribution systems with distributed generators.

Abstract: A centralized reactive power compensation system is proposed for low voltage (LV) distribution networks. It can be connected with any bus which needs reactive power. The current industry practice is to locally install reactive power compensation system to maintain the local bus voltage and power factor. By centralizing capacitor banks together, it can help to maintain bus voltages and power factors as well as reduce the power cable losses. Besides, the centralized reactive power system can be easily expanded to meet any future load increase. A reasonably sized centralized reactive power compensation system will be capable of meeting the requirements of the network and the optimization algorithm proposed in this paper can help to find this optimal size by minimizing the expected total cost (ETCH). Different load situations and their respective probabilities are also considered in the proposed algorithm. The concept of the centralized reactive power compensation system is applied to a local shipyard power system to verify its effectiveness. The results show that an optimally sized centralized reactive power system exists and is capable of maintaining bus voltages as well as reducing the power losses in the distribution network. A significant power loss reduction can be obtained at the optimal capacity of the centralized reactive power compensation system in the case study.

Abstract: Distributed generations (DGs) introduce significant uncertainties to restoration of active distribution networks, in addition to roughly estimated load demands. An adjustable robust restoration optimization model with a two-stage objective is proposed in this paper, involving the uncertain DG outputs and load demands. The first stage generates optimal strategies for recovery of outage power and the second stage seeks the worst-case fluctuation scenarios. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved using the column-and-constraint generation method. The feasibility and reliability of the strategies obtained via this robust optimization model can be guaranteed for all cases in the predefined uncertainty sets with good performance. A technique known as the uncertainty budget is used to adjust the conservativeness of this model, providing a tradeoff between conservativeness and robustness. Numerical tests are carried out on the modified PG&E 69-bus system and a modified 246-bus system to compare the robust optimization model against a deterministic restoration model, which verifies the superiority of this proposed model.

Abstract: With the largest installed capacity in the world, wind power in China is experiencing a curtailment during operation. The large portion of the generation capacity from inflexible combined heat and power (CHP) is the major barrier for integrating this variable power source. This paper explores opportunities for increasing the flexibility of CHP units using electrical boilers and heat storage tanks for better integration of wind power. A linear model is proposed for the centralized dispatch for integrated energy systems considering both heat and power, with detailed modeling of the charging processes of the heat storage tanks. The model balances heat and power demands in multiple areas and time periods with various energy sources, including CHP, wind power, electrical boilers, and heat storage. The impact of introducing electrical boilers and heat storage systems is examined using a simple test system with characteristics similar to those of the power systems in Northern China. Our results show that both electrical boilers and heat storage tanks can improve the flexibility of CHP units: introducing electrical boilers is more effective at reducing wind curtailment, whereas heat storage tanks save more energy in the energy system as a whole, which reflect a different heating efficiency of the two solutions.

Abstract: In a hydro-thermal unit commitment (H-TUC) problem, accurate modeling of the hydro unit power generation, which is a nonlinear function of the net head and the total power release, is crucial but difficult due to its nonlinearity and non-concavity. This letter proposes an efficient mixed integer linear program (MILP) approximation method for the H-TUC problem based on the variable separation and piecewise linear (PWL) technique. Tests on different systems demonstrate the proposed method can provide high quality solutions more efficiently.

Abstract: Works by Celik and Abur suggest a weighted least absolute value state estimation with transformations (WLAV-T) for attaining insensitiveness of state estimation (SE) to bad measurements by mitigating the effect of leverage points. To further improve its applicability, this letter proposes a systematic approach to compute the optimal rotation angles and scaling factors of the WLAV-T, deriving a robust WLAV estimation approach with optimal transformations (WLAV-OT). The proposed approach has been preliminarily tested with promising results.

Abstract: A method is proposed to detect and identify power system transmission line outages in near real-time. The method exploits the statistical properties of the small random fluctuations in electricity generation and demand that a power system is subject to as time evolves. To detect and identify transmission line outages, a linearized incremental small-signal power system model is used in conjunction with high-speed synchronized voltage phase angle measurements obtained from phasor measurement units. By monitoring the statistical properties of voltage phase angle time-series, line outages are detected and identified using techniques borrowed from the theory of quickest change detection. As illustrated through case studies, the proposed method is effective in detecting and identifying single- and double-line outages in an accurate and timely fashion.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to compute linear sensitivity distribution factors (DFs) in near real time without relying on a power flow model of the system. Specifically, we compute the injection shift factors (ISFs) of a particular line of interest with respect to active power injections at all buses (all other DFs can be determined from ISFs). The proposed ISF estimation method relies on the solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations that arise from high-frequency synchronized measurements obtained from phasor measurement units. We exploit a sparse representation (i.e., one in which many elements are zero) of the vector of desired ISFs via rearrangement by electrical distance and an appropriately chosen linear transformation, and cast the estimation problem into a sparse vector recovery problem. As we illustrate through case studies, the proposed approach provides accurate DF estimates with fewer sets of synchronized measurements than earlier approaches that rely on the solution of an overdetermined system of equations via the least-squares errors estimation method.

Abstract: FERC Order 755 requires each RTO/ISO to use market-based mechanisms to select and compensate frequency regulation resources based on a two-part payment methodology, i.e., a capacity payment to keep the capacity in reserve and a performance payment to reflect the amount of work each resource performs in real-time in response to the system operator's dispatch signal. This paper discusses how MISO enhanced its market rules to implement a market-based regulation performance payment. The market enhancement includes four key areas: quantifying the movement of regulation, modifications to the market clearing processes, performance accuracy measurement, and performance-based two-part regulation compensation.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the optimal problems of dc-segmentation for multi-infeed HVDC systems based on stability performance and studies the selecting method for the optimal dc-segmentation scheme. First, three major stability problems of multiinfeed HVDC systems are pointed out, which implies the necessity of the optimization for dc-segmentation. Second, three typical evaluation indices which correspond to the above three stability problems are introduced: multi-infeed interaction factor, multi-infeed effective short-circuit ratio, and frequency bias factor. To improve evaluation effects of the typical indices, the subindices are presented. Third, in order to solve this multi-objective decision-making problem, a linear weighted sum model is built, and a comprehensive weight method is adopted to calculate the weight coefficients. Based on the stability problems, a selecting method is established to choose the optimal dc-segmentation scheme. Finally, a four-machine multi-infeed HVDC system and a practical multi-infeed HVDC system in China are taken as examples, respectively. Candidate dc-segmentation schemes of each system are evaluated by the proposed method, and the optimal one is selected. Detailed stability studies of the candidate schemes are executed. The result indicates that the stability of the optimal scheme is better than the stabilities of others, which verifies the validity of the proposed method.

Abstract: Bitumen tanks were tested to investigate the capability of industrial heating loads to provide frequency response to an electric power system. A decentralized control algorithm was developed enabling the tanks to alter their power consumption in proportion to the variations of grid frequency. The control maintains the normal operation of tanks and causes little impact on their primary function of storing hot bitumen. Field investigations were undertaken on 76 tanks with power ratings from 17 to 75 kW. A model of a population of controlled tanks was developed. The behavior of the tanks was compared between the simulations and the field tests. The model of controlled tanks was then integrated with a simplified Great Britain power system model. It was shown that the controlled tanks were able to contribute to the grid frequency control in a manner similar to and faster than that provided by frequency-sensitive generation.

Abstract: The development of a multi-terminal (MT) high voltage DC (HVDC) grid based on voltage source converter (VSC) technology has been envisaged as a key development for harnessing the vast offshore wind production potential of the North Seas. In this paper, market integration of a centrally dispatched MT HVDC Grid based on droop control is examined. Particular emphasis is given on the management of onshore imbalance volumes due to offshore wind power forecast errors. The economic importance of the control choices of the operator of such an active transmission grid is highlighted, and regulatory implications are briefly discussed. The main contribution of the paper is the coherent development of a droop-controlled MT HVDC grid scheme that integrates optimal power flow (OPF) dispatch, and imbalance volume management.

Abstract: The demand of electricity keeps increasing in this modern society and the behavior of customers vary greatly from time to time, city to city, type to type, etc. Generally, buildings are classified into residential, commercial and industrial. This study is aimed to distinguish the types of residential buildings in Singapore and establish a mathematical model to represent and model the load profile of each type. Modeling household energy consumption is the first step in exploring the possible demand response and load reduction opportunities under the smart grid initiative. Residential electricity load profiling includes the details on the electrical appliances, its energy requirement, and consumption pattern. The model is generated with a bottom-up load model. Simulation is performed for daily load profiles of 1 or 2 rooms, 3 rooms, 4 rooms and 5 rooms public housing. The simulated load profile is successfully validated against the measured electricity consumption data, using a web-based Customer Energy Portal (CEP) at the campus housings of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Abstract: The recently-developed Two-sided Arnoldi and Sensitive Pole Algorithm (TSA-SPA) is effective and robust in computing the most sensitive eigenvalues with respect to control parameter changes in large-scale power systems. This paper extends the TSA-SPA to handle different system parameters, including control, system operating and network parameters. The proposed algorithm makes use of perturbation in reduced matrix obtained from Arnoldi/ TSA method through linearization and successfully avoids the need for TSA-SPA to formulate the whole state matrix of the system and to explicitly calculate the elements' variations in system state matrix. A new deflation method is also proposed and adopted in the generalized algorithm to find other sensitive eigenvalues. Simulation results illustrate that the generalized algorithm is able to not only maintain the excellent properties of TSA-SPA in terms of convergence and robustness, but also consider various parameter changes effectively in large-scale power systems.

Abstract: Convex relaxations of the power flow equations and, in particular, the semi-definite programming ( SDP) and second-order cone (SOC) relaxations, have attracted significant interest in recent years. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is a departure from these relaxations in the sense that it imposes constraints to preserve stronger links between the voltage variables through convex envelopes of the polar representation. This paper is a systematic study of the QC relaxation for AC optimal power flow with realistic side constraints. The main theoretical result shows that the QC relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation and neither dominates nor is dominated by the SDP relaxation. In addition, comprehensive computational results show that the QC relaxation may produce significant improvements in accuracy over the SOC relaxation at a reasonable computational cost, especially for networks with tight bounds on phase angle differences. The QC and SOC relaxations are also shown to be significantly faster and reliable compared to the SDP relaxation given the current state of the respective solvers.

Abstract: The significant growth in gas-fired units worldwide has increased the grade of interdependency between power and natural gas networks. Since these units are usually required to ramp up during the peak and backup intermittent renewable generation and contingencies, the power system tends to demand more flexibility and reliability from the gas system. This paper contributes with a novel mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) formulation that couples power and gas networks taking into account the gas traveling velocity and compressibility. As a result, the model accounts for the gas adequacy needed to assure the power system reliability in the short term. The robustness of the MILP formulation allows guaranteeing global optimality within predefined tolerances. Case studies integrate the IEEE 24-bus system and Belgian high-calorific gas network for validating the formulation.

Abstract: Loss minimizing generator dispatch profiles for power systems are usually derived using optimization techniques. However, some authors have noted that a system's K-GL matrix can be used to analytically determine a loss minimizing dispatch. This letter draws on recent research on the characterization of transmission system losses to demonstrate how the K-GL matrix achieves this. A new proof of the observed zero row summation property of the Y-GGM matrix is provided to this end.

Abstract: Power system voltage control has traditionally been the responsibility of transmission-connected reactive power resources. Accordingly, high penetration levels of distributed generation present new challenges for reactive power management. Simply stipulating voltage control operation for distributed generators will not generally deliver voltage-responsive reactive power flows at the transmission system level, due mainly to the voltage-isolating effects of tap-changing bulk supply transformers. Additionally, the resistance of distribution system conductors establishes an unhelpful interaction between active power flows and voltage magnitudes. This work uses optimal power flow techniques to explore two ways to overcome these challenges. Most innovatively, a methodology is presented to optimally select static voltage control settings for distributed generators and transformers, such that they will provide an autonomous voltage-responsive behavior without supervisory control systems. In this scheme, distributed generators are exposed to transmission voltage fluctuations as far as is feasible, by blocking the tapping of the bulk supply transformer when operating within an optimally-determined range of transmission voltages. Comparatively, an active control scheme is presented, where reactive power and tap positions are dispatched period-to-period to support the transmission system voltage. Comparing these approaches suggests the level of smart-grids investment required to effectively harness the reactive power available from distributed generation.

Abstract: The relatively fixed residential day-ahead real-time electricity price reflects insufficient information of the market, so the response of residential energy management system (EMS) to the real-time pricing (RTP) is not complete and therefore retailers are exposed to the risk of price fluctuation in balance market. Direct load control (DLC) in cooperative game is proposed in this paper. A cooperative game union comprised of some users and a retailer is established to minimize the union costs. The union provides an opportunity to access the balance market indirectly for residents and to reduce risks and costs for the retailer. In addition, Shapley value which embodies the fairness is used in union profits allocation. The method that avoids bidding for residential users simplifies the thresholds of residents to participate in market. Furthermore, the DLC union contributes to imbalance self-management for the retailer, which helps him avoid paying for the regulation cost involved in the deviation between the total quantity bought at markets and the actual consumption. The achievement of union's goal respects the constraints set by users. The method that alleviates the disturbance of DLC to residents meets the dual goals of being both fully responsive and non-disruptive.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generator excitation voltage control scheme for emergency frequency regulation of island power systems with voltage-dependent loads. It is able to regulate the load voltages and their power demand to maintain stable frequency when the systems have no active power reserves. Taking an actual island power system with aluminum electrolysis loads as an example, a frequency and excitation voltage control model for the actual island power system is established. Then, by applying the output regulation theory, feedback control signals with the frequency deviations and the power imbalances are used to obtain a practical feasible control scheme whose structure is similar to that of primary and secondary frequency control. Furthermore, by taking into account the constraints of generator voltage controls and load bus voltages, two useful conditions are found to limit the power imbalances. Our control strategy can maintain the frequency and voltages in permitted ranges. Both the WSCC 9-bus system and the actual island power system are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Particle filters provide a general framework for dynamic state estimation (DSE) in nonlinear systems. The scope for particle filter-based DSE can be significantly enhanced by exploiting data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) when available at higher sampling frequencies. In this paper, we present a particle filtering approach to dynamically estimate the states of a synchronous generator in a multi-machine setting considering the excitation and prime mover control systems. The filter relies on typical output measurements assumed available from PMUs stationed at generator buses. The performance of the proposed filter is illustrated with dynamic simulations on IEEE 14-bus system including: 1) generators models with subtransient dynamics, 2) excitation units (IEEE DC1A, DC2A, AC5A), and 3) turbine-governor models (steam and hydro). The estimation accuracy of the proposed filter is assessed for three classes of disturbances assuming noisy PMUs' measurements and comparative results are presented with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The accuracy-computational burden trade-off is also analyzed and the results strengthen the feasibility of using particle filters for dynamic state estimation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the spinning reserve requirements of generating systems, taking into consideration the loss of load risk due to failures in the generation and transmission network. In order to provide a more flexible and robust tool to assess the risk indices for bulk power systems, a Monte Carlo simulation based tool is proposed. Due to the rarity of the events associated with this particular problem, an unbiased estimator based on importance sampling is applied, and the set of optimal parameters is obtained using a cross-entropy method. The proposed methodology is capable of assessing the operating reserve requirements, especially the one that is synchronized, to cope with failures and capacity restrictions of both generating and transmission systems. The IEEE-RTS (reliability test system) is used to test the proposed methodology and also some modifications of this system are created to fully verify the ability of the proposed approach to satisfactorily respond to the transmission constraints.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new probabilistic method based on chronological Monte Carlo simulation for computing optimal distribution substation spare transformers. The method allows the representation of events such as aging process, load growth, and other conditions not supported by traditional methods based on Poisson and Markov processes. The lifetimes of the transformers are represented by discrete probability distributions, determined by an algorithm that combines the aging of the insulating material, estimated by Arrhenius theory, with the loss of life caused by short-circuits, lightning and switching surges. To illustrate the importance of sizing the inventory based on reliability indices and costs, the proposed method is applied to a group of substations with 177 transformers of 138-13.8 kV, with power rating of 25 MVA. Finally, the proposed methodology is used in combination with a metaheuristic algorithm for determining the optimal timing strategy for composing of the stock of spare transformers over a pre-established planning horizon.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for ranking critical nodes in bulk power systems. The proposed approach is able to offer a list of nodes or substations, from which system planners can easily identify those facilities with more urgent investment needs. The ranking process includes both static (via optimal power flow) and dynamic (via transient stability) performance analyses to assess deterministic indices. These indices measure the static and dynamic vulnerabilities of the network. As an extension of the deterministic approach, a new ranking based on the same indices is evaluated through a Monte Carlo simulation, considering several load scenarios modeled through uncertainties and the related generating dispatches. Applications in a test system presenting the rank of critical nodes are provided and discussed.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) can be integrated into a single entity, namely, virtual power plant (VPP). The integration enables them to participate in competitive wholesale electricity markets. According to the different types of uncertainty faced by different DERs, this integration can also act as a risk-hedging mechanism providing a surplus profit. In this paper, using a two-stage stochastic programming approach, risk-averse optimal offering model for a VPP trading in a joint market of energy and spinning reserve service is presented. The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to control the risk of profit variability. Uncertainties involved in generation of renewables, consumption of loads, calls for reserve service, as well as prices in the day-ahead market, the spinning reserve market (RM) and the balancing (real-time) market (BM), are taken into consideration. This paper assesses how total and surplus profits of VPP are affected by risk-aversion, participation in the RM, and the pricing system in the BM. For this purpose, the role of the integration and the trends of energy and reserve transactions under both single and dual pricing systems in the BM are addressed in detail through a numerical study.

Abstract: This paper considers future distribution networks featuring inverter-interfaced photovoltaic (PV) systems, and addresses the synthesis of feedback controllers that seek real-and reactive-power inverter setpoints corresponding to AC optimal power flow (OPF) solutions. The objective is to bridge the temporal gap between long-term system optimization and real-time inverter control, and enable seamless PV-owner participation without compromising system efficiency and stability. The design of the controllers is grounded on a dual epsilon-subgradient method, while semidefinite programming relaxations are advocated to bypass the non-convexity of AC OPF formulations. Global convergence of inverter output powers is analytically established for diminishing stepsize rules for cases where: i) computational limits dictate asynchronous updates of the controller signals, and ii) inverter reference inputs may be updated at a faster rate than the power-output settling time.

Abstract: Voltage source converter (VSC)-based high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission is considered the future of offshore power transmission. This paper aims at providing a reliable VSC-HVDC transmission system architecture between offshore wind farms and onshore grids. In this paper, a large-capacity, low-speed flywheel energy storage system (FESS) based on a squirrel cage induction machine is applied in parallel with the VSC-HVDC at the grid side converter. The FESS is dedicated for surge power (due to power flow imbalance during fault) absorption instead of being dissipated in the form of resistive losses. Since the duration of these surges is relatively small, it has been shown that the flywheel can effectively mitigate this problem. In addition to the fault ride-through support during fault conditions, the FESS is employed for power leveling functionality during normal operation. The performance parameters of the proposed approach are investigated via both simulation and experimental results. A 132-kV, 100-MW HVDC system is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink during normal and fault conditions. The proposed architecture is substantiated experimentally through a scaled down test rig with a 2-kW FESS.

Abstract: This paper explores the effects of allowing large, price-responsive consumers to provide reserves in a power system with significant penetration of wind energy. A bilevel optimization model represents the utility maximization problem of a large consumer, subject to a stochastic day-ahead co-optimization of energy and reserves that a system operator would solve to clear the market while considering wind power uncertainty. An examination of the market outcomes from both an illustrative and a large-scale study using this model allows analysis of a) the effects of the type of behavior of the large consumer (i.e., strategic vs competitive), b) limits on the amount of reserves it is allowed to provide, and c) variability and accuracy of characterization of wind power uncertainty.

Abstract: When power grids are heavily stressed with a bulk power transfer, it is useful to have a fast indication of the increased stress when multiple line outages occur. Reducing the bulk power transfer when the outages are severe could forestall further cascading of the outages. We show that synchrophasor measurements of voltage angles at all the area tie lines can be used to indicate the severity of multiple outages. These synchrophasor measurements are readily combined into an "area angle" that can quickly track the severity of multiple outages after they occur. We present a procedure to define thresholds for the area angle that relate to the maximum power that can be transferred through the area until a line limit is reached. Then in real time we would monitor the area angle and compare it to the thresholds when line outages occur to determine the urgency (or not) of actions to reduce the bulk transfer of power through the area. The procedure also identifies exceptional cases in which separate actions to resolve local power distribution problems are needed. We illustrate the thresholds and monitoring with the area angle across several states of Northwestern USA.

Abstract: In this letter, we present an algorithm for rotor angle stability monitoring of power system in real-time. The proposed algorithm is model-free and can make use of high resolution phasor measurement units (PMUs) data to provide reliable, timely information about the system's stability. The theoretical basis behind the proposed algorithm is adopted from dynamical systems theory. In particular, the algorithm approximately computes the system's Lyapunov exponent (LE), thereby measuring the exponential convergence or divergence rate of the rotor angle trajectories. The LE serves as a certificate of stability where the positive (negative) value of the LE implies exponential divergence (convergence) of nearby system trajectories, hence, unstable (stable) rotor angle dynamics. We also show the proposed model-free algorithm can be used for the identification of the coherent sets of generators. The simulation results are presented to verify the developed results in the paper on the modified IEEE 162-bus system.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel entropy-based metric to characterize the fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) phenomenon. In particular, we make use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to determine both the rate and the level of voltage recovery following a fault or disturbance. The computation of the entropy-based measure relies on voltage time-series data and is independent of the underlying system model used to generate the voltage time-series. The proposed measure provides quantitative information about the degree of WECC voltage performance violation for FIDVR phenomenon. The quantitative measure for violation allows one to compare the voltage responses of different buses to various contingencies and to rank order them, based on the degree of violation.

Abstract: This paper presents a multiphase continuation power flow (MCPF) methodology to perform voltage security analyses on unbalanced multiphase distribution systems. The proposed tool includes comprehensive models of most network components, and allows for explicit representation of neutral cables and grounding connections. The methodology has been validated through comparisons with a commercial software and with results available in the literature. Additional analyses are presented using the IEEE 4-bus, the Neutral-to-Earth (NEV) and the IEEE 8500 Test Systems. These systems have been developed to present several challenges to distribution systems analytical tools. In particular, the influence of the 3-phase transformer connections on the PV curves have been demonstrated and has been useful to stress the importance of a complete system representation.

Abstract: Reliability analysis of power systems has been attracting increasing attention. Regulatory agencies establish reliability standards that, if infringed, result in costly fines for the utility suppliers. A special concern pertains to the distribution networks on which most failures occur. The allocation of switches is a possible strategy to improve reliability, by allowing network reconfiguration to isolate contingencies and restore power to dark areas. This paper proposes an optimization methodology to allocate switches on radially operated distribution networks. The solution framework considers sectionalizing and tie switches of different capacities, with manual or automatic operation schemes. The approach minimizes the costs of allocation and energy not supplied, under reliability and flow capacity constraints. The solution framework is based on memetic algorithm concepts with a structured population. Case studies with a large network and real-world scenarios were used to evaluate the methodology. The results indicate that significant cost reductions can be achieved using the proposed solutions.

Abstract: The increasing uptake of electric vehicles suggests that vehicle charging will have a significant impact on the electricity grid. Finding ways to shift this charging to off-peak periods has been recognized as a key challenge for integration of electric vehicles into the electricity grid on a large scale. In this paper, electric vehicle charging is formulated as a receding horizon optimization problem that takes into account the present and anticipated constraints of the distribution network over a finite charging horizon. The constraint set includes transformer and line limitations, phase unbalance, and voltage stability within the network. By using a linear approximation of voltage drop within the network, the problem solution may be computed repeatedly in near real time, and thereby take into account the dynamic nature of changing demand and vehicle arrival and departure. It is shown that this linear approximation of the network constraints is quick to compute, while still ensuring that network constraints are respected. The approach is demonstrated on a validated model of a real network via simulations that use real vehicle travel profiles and real demand data. Using the optimal charging method, high percentages of vehicle uptake can be sustained in existing networks without requiring any further network upgrades, leading to more efficient use of existing assets and savings for the consumer.

Abstract: The problem of optimally sizing hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) installed in electric railway systems, considering the effect of regenerative braking is studied in this paper. HESSs combine traditional batteries and newly developed ultracapacitors, taking advantage of the high energy capacity of batteries and of the flexibility and ability to capture high power density of ultracapacitors. A novel mixed integer linear programming formulation that includes the counting of battery cycles is presented. Some particularities of battery operation are included in the model, like the dependence of its performance on the number of cycles and the depth of discharge (DOD). Results are reported first for a illustrative case study, allowing us to perform sensitivity studies for several parameters; results are also reported and for a larger case, closely resembling the problem faced by railway energy systems planners and operators.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel formulation of the Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) optimization model. For a given electric three-phase circuit feeder, network models are built using a quasi-symmetric impedance matrix TRX representing the entire structure and topology of the radial network. As a key contribution, the state variables of demands and generators connected to large-scale distribution grids are obtained by using a convenient matrix reduction technique. As a result, the size of the optimization problem is considerably reduced with respect to the jacobian formulation by considering radial and weakly meshed exploitation and elimination of interconnecting nodes. Results and comparative analysis are presented using the IEEE 4-, 13-, 37-, 123-, and 8500-node test systems.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a hybrid AC-DC offshore wind power plant (OWPP) topology and to optimize its design in order to minimize the OWPP's total cost. This hybrid concept is based on clustering wind turbines and connecting each group to an AC/DC power converter installed on a collector platform which is located between the AC wind turbine array and the HVDC offshore platform. Thereby, individual power converters of each wind turbine are not required, since such AC/DC converters can provide variable speed generator control for each cluster. The optimal design for an OWPP based on the hybrid AC-DC topology is formulated as a MINLP problem. The capital costs of each component within the OWPP as well as the costs associated to the inherent losses of this topology are minimized. The optimal number of AC/DC converters and offshore collector platforms needed, as well as their locations, are determined. The cable route connecting the wind turbines between each other is also optimized. The results suggests a good potential for the hybrid AC-DC OWPP topology achieving a total cost saving of 3.76% for the case study compared to the conventional OWPP topology.

Abstract: The burden on conventional units to regulate the system frequency increases if they are replaced due to wind farms. This paper explores up to which time scales the rotating kinetic energy in wind turbines can smooth frequency variations and assist with the regulation task. To this end, a comparison is made between a standard wind turbine controller and optimal control of wind turbines, respectively derived from causal time-domain simulations and an optimization algorithm that allows predicting. The latter algorithm is used to give a benchmark for the smoothing potential, shown by plotting the Pareto efficiency of the normalized standard deviation of frequency variability versus a normalized measure of the energy yield. Results indicate that smoothing comes with an energy loss that is determined by the energy content of power imbalances. It is shown that a wind share of 20%, within the instantaneous generation mix, can absorb frequency variations on timescales up to 100 sec while the energy loss is limited to only 2%. A higher share of wind power aggravates frequency variability. Nevertheless, in such circumstances the potential of rotating kinetic energy in wind farms increases.

Abstract: The cycling regime of thermal power plants significantly increases in the presence of intermittent renewables, increasing fuel and operation and maintenance costs from startups. Some regional electricity market operators adopt complex bidding mechanisms to account for nonconvex cost components that are not reflected in the marginal cost of energy, while other markets rely solely on simple bids with revenue sufficiency conditions. This paper compares the impacts of different bidding rules on wholesale prices and on the remuneration of units in power systems with a significant share of renewable generation. We distinguish the effects of bidding rules from the effects of regulatory uncertainty that can unexpectedly increase renewable generation by considering two distinct situations: 1) an "adapted" capacity mix, which is optimized for any given amount of renewable penetration, and 2) a "nonadapted" capacity mix, which is optimized for zero renewable penetration, but operated with different nonzero levels of renewables. We show that, although in the transitory state the impact on remuneration of having a nonadapted system dominates over the effect of the startup remuneration mechanisms explored, in equilibrium, bidding rules play an important role in making power plants whole while impacting on the cost borne by consumers.

Abstract: In this work, the author discusses development of the Smart Electric Power System (SEPS) Laboratory at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ). The fully reconfigurable six-bus, three-phase power system hardware operates with ratings of 208 (at 60 Hz) and 0.2 kW. It is composed of various synchronous generators with associated prime movers, induction motors with associated dynamometers, transformers, transmission lines, contactors, constant-impedance loads, renewable generation-emulator modules, battery storage devices, and appropriate power electronic converters. The SEPS lab significantly expands the ability of faculty and students at TCNJ to study energy problems, providing a sound foundation for the institution's small but growing power engineering program. The National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Program provided external funding for the hardware.

Abstract: We report on the extension of a general stochastic simulation approach for power systems with integrated renewable resources to also incorporate the representation of utility-scale storage resources. The extended approach deploys models of the energy storage resources to emulate their scheduling and operations in the transmission-constrained hourly day-ahead markets. To this end, we formulate a scheduling optimization problem to determine the operational schedule of the controllable storage resources in coordination with the demands and the various supply resources, including the conventional and renewable resources. The incorporation of the scheduling optimization problem into the Monte Carlo simulation framework takes full advantage of the structural characteristics in the construction of the so-called sample paths for the stochastic simulation approach and to ensure its numerical tractability. The extended methodology has the capability to quantify the power system economics, emissions and reliability variable effects over longer-term periods for power systems with the storage resources. Applications of the approach include planning and investment studies and the formulation and analysis of policy. We illustrate the capabilities and effectiveness of the simulation approach on representative study cases on modified IEEE 118 and WECC 240-bus systems. These results provide valuable insights into the impacts of energy storage resources on the performance of power systems with integrated wind resources.

Abstract: This paper presents a tri-level reliability-constrained robust power system expansion planning (SEP) framework modeling the uncertainty of electricity demand, wind power generation, and availability of units and lines. In the proposed tri-level SEP model, electricity demand and wind power generation being continuous uncertain variables are modeled by bounded intervals and availability of units and lines being discrete uncertain variables are modeled by probability distributions. Simulation results on the Garver 6-bus, the IEEE 24-bus, and the IEEE 73-bus test systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed tri-level framework to cope with multi-fold planning uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper presents the coordinated design of multiple FACTS supplementary damping controllers to improve system small-signal stability. A BMI-based multi-objective multi-model system approach is formulated to solve the robust damping control problem. Two-step method is proposed to determine controller variables. Regional pole placement and control effort optimization are set as the control objectives. An SVC and a TCSC damping controller are designed sequentially with minimized decoupling effort. Selection of the feedback signals for the FACTS damping controllers is realized by evaluating the modal residues of each feedback signal to the system input. To cover multiple inter-area oscillation modes, wide-area decentralized control methodology is proposed and remote feedback signals are selected. Real-time simulation is carried out on real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to test the performance of the proposed controller. The results show that the FACTS damping controllers are feasible and able to increase system damping to a satisfactory level under different system operating points.

Abstract: We use a unit commitment (UC) model to quantify the operational impacts of subsidizing wind generation when energy prices are negative. Such prices occur increasingly often in U.S. and European Union (EU) markets. Subsidies such as production tax credits, feed-in tariffs, and renewable energy credits motivate renewable generators to submit negative price offers; this lessened flexibility increases system operation and management costs and, in some cases, CO2 emissions when energy prices are negative. Our simulations of large negative bids can also be interpreted as representing EU policies of granting wind absolute dispatch priority. Applications to four hypothetical systems with high wind penetration and distinct generation mixes quantify the UC and dispatch effects of negative bids. Larger negative bids lead to less wind spillage (reducing the 2.8% average curtailment under $0 bids to 1.0%), more conventional plant startups, higher system costs, and, in many cases, higher total CO2 emissions (by up to 2%). In some systems, wind power's effective incremental emissions are as high as coal's. This impact depends strongly on generation mix, carbon price, and the size of the negative bids. In general, there can be significant economic and, often, environmental benefits to reforming renewable support policies to encourage flexibility in operations.

Abstract: Demand response is a key solution in smart grid to address the ever-increasing peak energy consumption. With multiple utility companies, users will decide from which utility company to buy electricity and how much to buy. Consequently, how to devise distributed real-time demand response in the multiseller-multibuyer environment emerges as a critical problem in future smart grid. In this paper, we focus on the real-time interactions among multiple utility companies and multiple users. We propose a distributed real-time demand response algorithm to determine each user's demand and each utility company's supply simultaneously. By applying dual decomposition, the original problem is firstly decoupled into single-seller-multibuyer subsystems; then, the demand response problem in each subsystem can be distributively solved. The major advantage of this approach is that each utility company and user locally solve subproblems to perform energy allocation, instead of requiring a central controller or any third party. Therefore, privacy is guaranteed because no entity needs to reveal or exchange private information. Numerical results are presented to verify efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Installed capacities of distributed generation (DG) are projected to increase substantially in Great Britain and many other power systems. This paper will discuss the definition of capacity value of DG arising from its ability to support additional demand without the need for new network capacity, in analogy with the definition of effective load carrying capability (ELCC) at transmission level. This calculated ELCC depends on the precise detail of its definition; in particular in a demand group fed by a pair of circuits where the double outage state dominates the calculated reliability index, the ELCC will be very small unless the generator can run in islanded mode. Finally, requirements for use in practical planning studies and development of formal planning standards will be discussed.

Abstract: Previous studies of market power within a regional system have considered multiple competing generation operators and the role of transmission constraints. However, these studies typically assume simplified structures in which each operator is restricted to a unique node in a transmission constrained network. Real systems typically have operators making decisions for units in several zones at once. Past studies also implicitly treated market power as a static concept for a given set of market rules and network configuration. We demonstrate that market power is dynamic, and can vary significantly with fuel prices and even with large-scale weather patterns. We also demonstrate the impact on region-wide market power of operators that manage units in multiple zones. We use the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) as an illustrative case study, and apply a conjectured supply function equilibrium (CSFE) approach that accounts for transmission constraints. We show that the companies with greater influence on the market price will depend on the relative prices of coal and natural gas. We also show that a weather event, such as a period without any wind, can have a substantial impact on market power.

Abstract: Merit order of renewable generation has produced an increasing, relevant number of zero values in Spanish electricity spot prices since 2010, in contrast with the rest of markets which rarely present zero values. This letter shows that existing methodologies for normalizing the price distribution fail to yield a proper normalization. This letter proposes a new algorithm based on Nataf transformation which addresses this issue and ensures a correct normalization. Numerical results validate the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: A hierarchical decentralized network reconfiguration approach to minimize power losses for smart distribution systems was presented in Part I. In this paper, the proposed approach is applied to four test distribution systems to examine its performance. A demonstration system consisting of the test system and distributed intelligent agents is built using MATLAB/Simulink to illustrate how the decentralized approach is implemented. Simulation results of the proposed approach are then compared with results of a centralized implementation and the harmony search method. It is shown that the decentralized approach can achieve similar results as other methods with significantly reduced computation time. The impacts of time-varying loads and faults are also studied through dynamic network reconfiguration on the 118-bus test system. Simulation results illustrate that dynamic network reconfiguration with time-ahead planning can determine the optimal configuration for each operating period to significantly reduce system energy losses. The enhanced performance of the hierarchical decentralized approach is clearly established.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decentralized agent-based network reconfiguration methodology to minimize power losses for smart distribution systems. A novel formulation of the network reconfiguration problem is given in which the switch states are the decision variables, and a single-loop branch-exchange heuristic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The entire distribution system is decomposed into subsystems based on the connectivity of areas, and an individual agent is assigned to each decomposed subsystem. A two-stage method is defined for coordinating the reconfigurations of decomposed subsystems. The optimal configuration of the entire system results from collaborations of individual agents, and the decentralized approach significantly reduces the computation time. A 118-bus distribution system is used as the example to illustrate the implementation of the method. The development of a demonstration system and more detailed simulation studies are given in Part II to further illustrate the application of the proposed decentralized approach.

Abstract: Most existing approaches for distribution network reconfiguration assume that the distribution system is (three-phase) balanced and a single-phase equivalent is used. However, distribution feeders are usually unbalanced due to a large number of single-phase loads, nonsymmetrical conductor spacing, and three-phase line topology. This paper builds on our previous work and studies feeder reconfiguration for unbalanced distribution systems with distributed generation (DG). The three-phase bus locations and sizes of DG units are determined using sensitivity analysis and nonlinear programming, respectively, and distribution feeders are reconfigured every hour based on the status of time-varying loads, output power from DG units and faults on the network while minimizing the energy loss costs and DG operating costs. Simulation results show the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Intraday energy markets have been established in some power markets mainly because of large-scale wind power integration. Inspired by the Spanish power market, this paper proposes a modified market design which contains day-ahead and intraday energy bidding sections to better accommodate stochastic wind energy. Then coordinated operation of the wind farm (WF) and energy storage system (ESS) is studied. Rolling stochastic optimization formulations for day-ahead, intraday biddings and real-time operations are put forward to obtain the optimal bidding strategy of WF-ESS union in each bidding section to maximize its overall profit. Case studies and sensitivity analyses are carried out on a union of WFs and a pumped storage plant (PSP). Simulation results show that the proposed rolling optimization method can effectively utilize the updated wind power forecast data and regulation capability of ESS, and thus increase profit for the union prominently.

Abstract: Accurate forecasts of electrical substations are mandatory for the efficiency of the Advanced Distribution Automation functions in distribution systems. The paper describes the design of a class of machine-learning models, namely neural networks, for the load forecasts of medium-voltage/low-voltage substations. We focus on the methodology of neural network model design in order to obtain a model that has the best achievable predictive ability given the available data. Variable selection and model selection are applied to electrical load forecasts to ensure an optimal generalization capacity of the neural network model. Real measurements collected in French distribution systems are used to validate our study. The results show that the neural network-based models outperform the time series models and that the design methodology guarantees the best generalization ability of the neural network model for the load forecasting purpose based on the same data.

Abstract: This letter presents a constraint relaxation optimal power flow (OPF) model to tackle the issues when traditional OPF is infeasible under large variations such as wind generation output. In this model, the original hard constraints are relaxed into soft constraints and the objective function is adjusted for the cost of constraint violations. To guarantee the equivalence to the original OPF model when there are feasible solutions, an exact penalty function method is introduced to justify the selection of penalty factor of constraint violations. By solving an optimization problem, the lower bound of the proper penalty factor is obtained. The results of a 6-bus test system show that the proposed method achieves the same solution when the original OPF has feasible region, and an optimal solution can be obtained with minimum constraint violation when original OPF has no feasible region. Lastly, three large IEEE systems are tested to verify the effectiveness of proposed method.

Abstract: With increasingly large scale of intermittent and non-dispatchable resources being integrated into power systems, the power flow problem presents greater uncertainty. In order to obtain the upper and lower bounds of power flow solutions including voltage magnitudes, voltage angles and line flows, Cartesian coordinates-based power flow is utilized in this paper. A quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) model is then established to formulate the interval power flow problem. This non-convex QCQP model is relaxed to linear programming problem by introducing convex and concave enclosures of the original feasible region. To improve the solutions bounds while still encompassing the true interval solution, optimality-based bounds tightening (OBBT) method is employed to find a better outer hull of the feasible region. Numerical results on IEEE 9-bus, 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus test systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a bi-level branch-and-bound ((B&B) method to solve the economic dispatch problem with prohibited zones and network losses. The approach employs binary variables for each prohibited zone and utilizes the B-coefficient for network losses, which can be transformed into a mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming (MIQCQP), where linear relaxation technique is applied on each bilinear term. Due to the complexity in solving the MIQCQP problem, this paper proposes a bi-level B&B method to achieve global optimum. A spatial B&B method is utilized in the higher level to solve the quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, whereas a simple B&B method is employed in the lower level to solve a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The bi-level B&B algorithm that combines spatial and simple B&B methods is actually a deterministic optimization method and can produce global optimal solutions. Numerical results on 6-unit, 15-unit, and 40-unit test systems show that the bi-level B&B method can solve the MIQCQP problem with superior solution quality and convergence characteristics.

Abstract: This letter presents an optimal power flow model with the consideration of flexible transmission line impedance. By the use of big-M based complementary constraints, the original non-convex model can be transformed into a mixed integer quadratic programming that can be solved by branch and bound method. Numerical results from several test systems show that flexible transmission lines can provide better economic dispatch and reduce the total generation cost. Moreover, some infeasible optimal power flow scenarios can become solvable with optimal adjustment of the flexible transmission line impedance.

Abstract: Due to substantial generation and demand fluctuations in standalone green microgrids, energy management strategies are becoming essential for the power sharing and voltage regulation purposes. The classical energy management strategies employ the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms and rely on batteries in case of possible excess or deficit of energy. However, in order to realize constant current-constant voltage (IU) charging regime and increase the life span of batteries, energy management strategies require being more flexible with the power curtailment feature. In this paper, a coordinated and multivariable energy management strategy is proposed that employs a wind turbine and a photovoltaic array of a standalone DC microgrid as controllable generators by adjusting the pitch angle and the switching duty cycles. The proposed strategy is developed as an online nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm. Applying to a sample standalone dc microgrid, the developed controller realizes the IU regime for charging the battery bank. The variable load demands are also shared accurately between generators in proportion to their ratings. Moreover, the DC bus voltage is regulated within a predefined range, as a design parameter.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to determine suitable countermeasures against emerging aperiodic small disturbance rotor angle (ASD) instability. The method utilizes stability indicators, computed in real time, to define a criterion for ASD stability. Sensitivities of these stability indicators are then determined and used to identify the most influential nodes for countermeasures. To increase the computational speed, only nodes visited by a self-propagating graph, rooted at the vulnerable generator, will have their sensitivities calculated. The steady state voltages after a given countermeasure are then determined, using a grid transformation coefficient (GTC) and a numerical, iterative solution to an equation system. The stability criteria can then be assessed to evaluate the sufficiency of a suggested countermeasure. The method is demonstrated on a synthetic 8-bus network and a 464-bus model of the Western Denmark transmission grid. The method successfully demonstrates its ability to efficiently identify and evaluate countermeasures for a large, practical system.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources are here to stay for a number of important reasons, including global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels. We explore in this paper how a thermal-dominated electric energy system can be transformed into a renewable-dominated one. This study relies on a stochastic programming model that allows representing the uncertain parameters plaguing such long-term planning exercise. Being the final year of our analysis 2050, we represent the transition from today to 2050 by allowing investment in both production and transmission facilities, with the target of achieving a renewable-dominated minimum-cost system. The methodology developed is illustrated using a realistic large-scale case study. Finally, policy conclusions are drawn.

Abstract: To make better use of local generators' dynamic var reserve to improve short-term voltage stability (STVS), this paper proposes an integrated high side var-voltage control (IHSV C) for power plants in receiving-end power systems. The IHSV C consists of a plant-level multi-machine var coordinator (MMVC) and several unit-level high side voltage controllers (HSVCs). MMVC coordinates the reactive power output among generators and provides control parameters for HSVCs, while HSVCs can maintain the voltage of a pre-defined voltage control point (VCP) by regulating the voltage reference of the excitation control of each generator. Therefore, when the system suffers a serious fault, (IHSVC)-C-2 can drive the generators to provide stronger var support. Consequently, the voltage stability can be improved. A conceptual model of the receiving-end power system in China Southern Power Grid (CSG) is established, and the (IHSVC)-C-2 has been validated through a simulation analysis on the system. Both time-domain simulation results and the voltage sag severity index (VSSI) have fully demonstrated its performance. Therefore (IHSVC)-C-2 offers a new and effective approach to improve STVS of receiving-end power systems.

Abstract: In development studies carried out on large power systems, a need may arise for a reduction in which whole regions are seen as the nodes of a simplified graph whose edges replace the inter-regional links. The property required from this kind of backbone representation may be that reduced load flows stay close to their physical counterpart on the full grid. In the dc approximation, such a model can consist of a set of impedances attached to each edge, along with a flow characterizing a particular state of the system. The identification of the model accommodating best a large sample of flows, representative of all of their possible diversity, is a nonconvex problem for which two partially convex reformulations are proposed. Simple ad hoc algorithms are introduced as a way to find approximate solutions satisfying first-order optimality conditions.

Abstract: Proliferation of renewable energy resources in distribution networks has captured distribution companies' attention towards more active management tools. Thanks to the smart grid paradigm, hourly network reconfiguration, which is still among immature ideas, can bring the activeness required to handle fluctuating output of renewable resources. The aim of this study is to analyze the worthiness of the hourly reconfiguration in the presence of renewable energy resources. For doing so, a mathematical model is devised to minimize daily network losses via applying hourly reconfigurations. The model is a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem and is solved via MOSEK solver. The electrical demand variations as well as renewable power generation fluctuations during a day are taken into account. The proposed method is applied to the Baran 33-bus system and the results including a great deal of sensitivity analyses on key parameters are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Great emphasis has been placed on rational value assessment of wind power in system in recent times. Because there are different properties in various output levels of wind power, there should also be different values. This paper proposes a novel method for value assessment of wind power to get a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation. Wind power outputs are divided horizontally based on the wind layer model. Then comprehensive studies of cost and benefit are conducted layer by layer. Furthermore, the detailed characteristics in layers, storage benefit, and value allocation are analyzed. After that, the sensitivities about the chosen system, parameters, region size, and demand-side participation are discussed at length. The effectiveness and rationality of the model are proved by the case study. The model assesses the value of wind power more precisely and profoundly, which would provide significant guidance in the setting of price policy for wind power and market supervision.

Abstract: Grid connection of a DFIG for power generation changes the power system load flow and introduces dynamic interactions with the synchronous generators (SGs). A method is proposed in this paper for the separate examination of the impact of those two affecting factors, the change of load flow and dynamic interaction brought about by the DFIG, on the electromechanical oscillation modes of a power system. The method is developed on the establishment of a "closed-loop control system" type of state space model of the power system where the DFIG is treated as the feedback controller. The established model unambiguously indicates that the impact of the DFIG can be examined separately: (1) With the DFIG being modelled as a constant power injection into the system, the impact of the load flow change brought about by the DFIG on the oscillation modes is determined; (2) The impact of the dynamic interactions introduced by the DFIG is estimated by calculating the contribution of the damping torque from the DFIG with its full dynamics being considered. Thus a more detailed examination on and deeper insight into the impact of grid connection of the DFIGs on power system small-signal angular stability is obtained by using the proposed method.

Abstract: Although there are vast potential locations to install FACTS devices in a power system, the actual installation number is very limited due to economical consideration. Therefore the allocation strategy exhibits strong sparsity. This paper formulates FACTS device allocation problem as a general sparsity-constrained OPF problem and employs L-q(0 < q <= 1) norms to enforce sparsity on FACTS devices setting values to achieve solutions with desirable device numbers and sites. An algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve the sparsity-constrained OPF problem. The algorithm exploits the separability structure and decomposes the original problem into an NLP subproblem, an L-q regularization subproblem, and a simple dual variable update step. The NLP subproblem is solved by the interior point method. The L-q regularization subproblem has a closed-form solution expressed by shrinkage-threholding operators. The convergence of the proposed method is theoretically analyzed and discussed. The proposed method is successfully tested on allocation of SVC, TCSC, and TCPS on IEEE 30-, 118-, and 300-bus systems. Case studies are presented and discussed for both single-type and multiple-type FACTS devices allocation problems, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed formulation and algorithm.

Abstract: As climate concerns, low natural gas prices, and renewable technologies increase the electric power sector's dependence on natural gas-fired power plants, operational and investment models for gas and electric power systems will need to incorporate the interdependencies between these two systems to accurately capture the impacts of one on the other. Currently, few hybrid gas-electricity models exist. This paper reviews the state of the art for hybrid gas-electricity models and presents a new model and case study to illustrate a few potential coupling effects between gas and electric power systems. Specifically, the proposed model analyzes the optimal operation of gas-fired power plants in a competitive electricity market taking into consideration gas purchases, gas capacity contracting, and residual demand uncertainty for the generation company due to renewable energy sources.

Abstract: Utility scale battery storage will soon reach a level of maturity where the modular design of the technology and aggregation will allow custom-built solutions for energy and ancillary service needs of the power system. Several projects are in the demonstration phase worldwide and hold promise for successful incorporation of battery storage into traditional power systems operations. In contrast to thermal generators and pumped hydro stations, there is a strong connection between the short-term operation and life of the battery storage systems. Due to this long-term consequence of short-term decisions for battery technologies, a constant short-term cost model is inadequate. Instead an adaptable short-term cost model is required which reflects the operation of the battery. Such a model of the battery is presented considering battery cycling and depth of discharge. Further, this paper aims to elucidate this relation between short-term and long-term costs of utility scale battery energy storage and presents a mathematical formulation for short-term 24-h scheduling problem in conjunction with thermal generation. The model is illustrated and storage efficacy is examined by scheduling alongside traditional generation with prices typical in Ontario, Canada and battery storage is used to alleviate price spikes caused by ramping requirements.

Abstract: As penetration of wind power generation increases, system operators must account for its stochastic nature in a reliable and cost-efficient manner. These conflicting objectives can be traded-off by accounting for the variability and uncertainty of wind power generation. This letter presents a new methodology to estimate uncertainty sets for parameters of probability distributions that capture wind generation uncertainty and variability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new transmission-constrained unit commitment method that combines the cost-efficient but computationally demanding stochastic optimization and the expensive but tractable interval optimization techniques to manage uncertainty on the expected net load. The proposed hybrid unit commitment approach applies the stochastic formulation to the initial operating hours of the optimization horizon, during which the wind forecasts are more accurate, and then switches to the interval formulation for the remaining hours. The switching time is optimized to balance the cost of unhedged uncertainty from the stochastic unit commitment against the cost of the security premium of the interval unit commitment formulation. These hybrid, stochastic, and interval formulations are compared using Monte Carlo simulations on a modified 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System. The results demonstrate that the proposed unit commitment formulation results in the least expensive day-ahead schedule among all formulations and can be solved in the same amount of time as a full stochastic unit commitment. However, if the range of the switching time is reduced, the hybrid formulation in the parallel computing implementation outperforms the stochastic formulation in terms of computing time.

Abstract: This paper presents a symmetrical components approach for computing the phase-coordinates nodal admittance matrices of three-phase transformers, where each connection is comprised either of three single-phase units or one three-phase unit. The approach is based on assembling the symmetrical component circuits into the different three-phase connections; it can straightforwardly handle unsymmetrical transformer banks with different phase electrical characteristics or missing phases, and grounding impedances. The proposed approach easily accounts for the various clock numbers quoted in the British Standard (BS) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard on power transformers; this presents an advantage as compared to classical phase-coordinates approaches that require defining a distinct connection matrix corresponding to each transformer vector group.

Abstract: In market operations, distributed generators (DGs) and price-sensitive loads participate in a microgrid energy market implemented in JADE. Each DG and each price-sensitive load is represented by the respective agents which perform various functions such as scheduling, coordination and market clearing subject to system, DG and load constraints. Each agent is assigned to one of the several agent objectives which maximizes either DG or load surpluses or both. In simulated operation of a microgrid, hourly power reference signals and load control signals from JADE are passed to DG and load models developed in MATLAB/Simulink using MACSimJX. Simulated operation of DGs and loads are studied by performing simulations under different agent objectives. Results from simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing multi-agent system (MAS) in the distributed management of microgrids.

Abstract: This paper addresses an advanced vector current control for a voltage source converter (VSC) connected to a weak grid. The proposed control methodology permits high-performance regulation of the active power and the voltage for the feasible VSC range of operation. First, the steady state characteristics for a power converter connected to a very weak system with a short circuit ratio (SCR) of 1 are discussed in order to identify the system limits. Then, the conventional vector control (inner loop) and the conventional power/voltage control (outer loop) stability and frequency responses are analyzed. From the analysis of the classic structure, an enhanced outer loop based on a decoupled and gain-scheduling controller is presented and its stability is analyzed. The proposed control is validated by means of dynamic simulations and it is compared with classic vector current control. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control system could provide a promising approach to tackle the challenging problem of VSC in connection with weak AC grids.

Abstract: Higher variable renewable generation penetrations are occurring throughout the world on different power systems. These resources increase the variability and uncertainty on the system which must be accommodated by an increase in the flexibility of the system resources in order to maintain reliability. Many scheduling strategies have been discussed and introduced to ensure that this flexibility is available at multiple timescales. To meet variability, that is, the expected changes in system conditions, two recent strategies have been introduced: time-coupled multi-period market clearing models and the incorporation of ramp capability constraints. To appropriately evaluate these methods, it is important to assess both efficiency and reliability. But it is also important to assess the incentive structure to ensure that resources asked to perform in different ways have the proper incentives to follow these directions, which is a step often ignored in simulation studies. We find that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. We also find that look-ahead horizon length in multi-period market models can impact incentives. This paper proposes scheduling and pricing methods that ensure expected ramps are met reliably, efficiently, and with associated prices based on true marginal costs that incentivize resources to do as directed by the market. Case studies show improvements of the new method.

Abstract: Distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) is a multi-objective, nonlinear problem. This paper introduces a new, fast, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (FNSGA) for the purpose of solving the DSR problem in normal operation by satisfying all objectives simultaneously with a relatively small number of generations and relatively short computation time. The objectives of the problem are to minimize real power losses and improve the voltage profile and load balancing index with minimum switching operations. Instead of generating several ranks from the nondominated set of solutions, this algorithm deals with only one rank; then the most suitable solution is chosen according to the operator's wishes. If there is no preference and all objectives have the same degree of importance, the best solution is determined by simply considering the sum of the normalized objective values. Also, a guided mutation operation is applied instead of a random one to speed up convergence. Radial system topology is satisfied using graph theory by formulating the branch-bus incidence matrix (BBIM) and checking the rank of each topology. To test the algorithm, it was applied to two widely studied test systems and a real one. The results show the efficiency of this algorithm as compared to other methods in terms of achieving all the goals simultaneously with reasonable population and generation sizes and without using a mutation rate, which is usually problem-dependent.

Abstract: Unlike transmission systems, distribution feeders in North America operate under unbalanced conditions at all times, and generally have a single strong voltage source. When a distribution feeder is connected to a strong substation source, the system is dynamically very stable, even for large transients. However if a distribution feeder, or part of the feeder, is separated from the substation and begins to operate as an islanded microgrid, transient dynamics become more of an issue. To assess the impact of transient dynamics at the distribution level, it is not appropriate to use traditional transmission solvers, which generally assume transposed lines and balanced loads. Full electromagnetic solvers capture a high level of detail, but it is difficult to model large systems because of the required detail. This paper proposes an electromechanical transient model of synchronous machines for distribution-level modeling and microgrids. This approach includes not only the machine model, but also its interface with an unbalanced network solver, and a powerflow method to solve unbalanced conditions without a strong reference bus. The presented method is validated against a full electromagnetic transient simulation.

Abstract: In this paper, a new multi-agent control system (MACS) is proposed for smart distribution networks. It can: 1) eliminate the feeders' congestion, 2) globally correct voltage violations, and 3) coordinate the operation of reactive power control devices. In performing its functions, the MACS must prevent overstress on the substation voltage regulator tap changer under all operating conditions, and avoid selective active power curtailment from DG units. This can help to improve reliability, economic revenue, and power quality. A fuzzy rule-based system is employed for decision-making support in MACS. The proposed MACS can achieve the self-healing requirement of smart distribution network. It eliminates feeders' congestion by properly reconfiguring the distribution network. Meanwhile, it amends most of voltage violation problems by coordinated operation of voltage control devices in the distribution system. The MACS overcomes the severe voltage violation problems via distribution network reconfiguration. It is applied to the IEEE 33-bus test feeder. A full dynamic model is constructed using a parallel MATLAB-JADE simulation arrangement. Comparative performance evaluations of the MACS and other schemes are presented under various conditions.

Abstract: A new decentralized approach for solving the economic dispatch problem is presented in this paper. The proposed approach consists of either two or three stages. In the first stage, a flooding-based consensus algorithm is proposed in order to achieve consensus among the agents with respect to the units and system data. In the second stage, a suitable algorithm is used for solving the economic dispatch problem in parallel. For cases in which a nondeterministic method is used in the second stage, a third stage is applied to achieve consensus about the final solution of the problem, with a flooding-based consensus algorithm for sharing the information required during this stage. The proposed approach is highly effective for solving the non-convex formulation of the economic dispatch problem and for incorporating transmission losses accurately in a fully decentralized manner. Three case studies that were examined for validation purposes are described. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach aggregates many of the advantages of both centralized and fully decentralized mechanisms for solving the economic dispatch problem.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel particle filter based dynamic state estimation scheme for power systems where the states of all the generators are estimated. The proposed estimation scheme is decentralized in that each estimation module is independent from others and only uses local measurements. The particle filter implementation makes the proposed scheme numerically simple to implement. What makes this method superior to the previous methods which are mainly based on the Kalman filtering technique is that the estimation can still remain smooth and accurate in the presence of noise with unknown changes in covariance values. Moreover, this scheme can be applied to dynamic systems and noise with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions.

Abstract: Due to substantial use of gas turbines and their highly dynamic behavior, they have a profound impact on electrical grid. Although the control philosophies of various turbines are almost the same, there are some nuances in governor systems. As long as these details affect system response in extremely dynamic phenomena such as load rejection, they should be included in models. In this paper, the governor system is subjected to careful scrutiny; tasks of controllers are classified schematically and some special features such as back-tracing and feed-forward are discussed. The turbine is also modeled and a function is developed to calculate turbine exhaust gas temperature. The proposed governor-turbine model is validated by test results and a comparative analysis shows that the back-tracing method prevents wind-up phenomenon and the feed-forward method improves stability and response time.

Abstract: A model predictive controller (MPC) for load frequency control (LFC) of an interconnected power system is investigated. The MPC is based on a simplified system model of the Nordic power system, and it takes into account limitations on tie-line power flow, generation capacity, and generation rate of change. The participation factors for each generator are optimization variables, and suggestions are made as to how one can ensure tie-line power transfer margins through slack-variables, and pricing information through the objective function. The solution of MPC for LFC is completed by including a Kalman filter for state estimation. The presented MPC is compared against a conventional LFC/AGC scheme with proportional integral (PI) controllers. Simulations show that the MPC gives better frequency response while using cheaper resources. This paper illustrates that MPC could be a realistic solution to some of the LFC problems power systems are facing today.

Abstract: As the number of combined-cycle units increases, efficient modeling approaches for these units play important roles for independent system operators (ISOs). Based on various combinations of combustion turbines (CTs) and steam turbines (STs), the combined-cycle unit could work at different configurations (modes) with different efficiencies. In this paper, we propose an edge-based formulation for the combined-cycle units in the unit commitment problem to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of current modeling approaches. Our formulation can 1) clearly describe the transition processes among different configurations so as to satisfy the ISO financial offer submission requirements and (2) capture physical constraints of each turbine, including the exact min-up/down time and time dependent startup cost, in the combined-cycle units so as to increase the operational flexibility while ensuring system feasibility. This model fits well with the current U.S. deregulated electricity market. The final numerical studies show that our approaches perform better than the current configuration-based modeling approach.

Abstract: A novel integrated scheme based on relationships exploration (RE) is presented for the online estimation of the relative voltage stability margin (VSM). The proposed scheme can select the optimal variables as input features for estimation by detecting the relationship between each operation variable and the relative VSM in a large data set. Each relationship is given scores by the maximal information coefficient (MIC) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). The variables selected for estimation are corresponding to the relationships highly ranked by MIC and PCC, including linear relationships and nonlinear functional ones. Some of the highly ranked relationships are shown, curve fitted and described from the perspective of power system operation. If the data of the selected variables are obtained online from the wide area measurement system (WAMS), the relative VSM can be online estimated based on the explored relationships. The integrated scheme using RE-based process is examined on a 21-bus test system and a practical 1648-bus system provided by the software PSS/E, and it presents acceptable estimation accuracy. The impacts of training set size, selected relationships' types, total number and ranks on estimation accuracy are analyzed. The robustness of the scheme to measurement errors and topology variation is studied.

Abstract: With the growing development in demand response, load serving entities (LSEs) may participate in electricity market as strategic bidders by offering coupon-based demand response (C-DR) programs to customers. However, due to customers' versatile electricity consumption patterns under C-DR programs as well as the increasing penetration of wind power generation, obtaining the deterministic bidding decision becomes unprecedented complex for LSEs. To address this challenge, a new strategic bidding model for an LSE is proposed in which the primary objective is to maximize the LSE's profit by providing optimal C-DR considering high wind power penetration. The proposed strategic bidding is a bi-level optimization problem with the LSE's net revenue maximization as the upper level problem and the ISO's economic dispatch (ED) for generation cost minimization as the lower level problem. This bi-level model is converted to a stochastic mathematic program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) by recasting the lower level problem as its Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) optimality conditions. Then, the stochastic MPEC is transformed to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is solvable using available optimization software, based on strong duality theory. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified with simulation studies of two sample systems.

Abstract: Step changes in the curve of locational marginal prices (LMP) under load variation have been known characteristics given its present formulation. Identifying LMP intervals under wind uncertainty is important for market participants to assess and mitigate their risks when price forecast is needed. This work proposes a bi-level optimization model to calculate the LMP intervals under wind uncertainty without the repetitive Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The specific bus LMP maximization (or minimization) is the upper level problem, while the ISO's economic dispatch is the lower level problem. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology.

Abstract: We present a new methodology to support an energy trading company (ETC) to devise contracting strategies under an optimal risk-averse renewable portfolio. The uncertainty in the generation of renewable energy sources is accounted for by exogenously simulated scenarios, as is customary in stochastic programming. However, we recognize that spot prices largely depend on unpredictable market conditions, making it difficult to capture its underlying stochastic process, which challenges the use of fundamental approaches for forecasting. Under such framework, industry practices make use of stress tests to validate portfolios. We then adapt the robust optimization approach to perform an endogenous stress test for the spot prices as a function of the buy-and-sell portfolio of contracts and renewable energy generation scenarios. The optimal contracting strategy is built through a bilevel optimization model that uses a hybrid approach, mixing stochastic and robust optimization. The proposed model is flexible to represent the traditional stochastic programming approach and to express the ETC's uncertainty aversion in the case where the price distribution cannot be precisely estimated. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated with examples from the Brazilian market, where the proposed approach is contrasted to its stochastic counterpart and both are benchmarked against observed market variables.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new policy to calculate the locational marginal price (LMP) in the distribution networks containing distributed generation (DG). The proposed policy is based on remunerating the DG units to reduce the loss and emission of the network. LMP at each DG bus is calculated according to the contribution of the DG to the reduced amount of loss and emission. An iterative algorithm which is based on the nucleolus theory is proposed to allocate the loss and emission reduction. The proposed algorithm will provide a robust state estimation tool for distribution companies (DISCOs) in the next step of operation. The state estimation tool provides the decision maker with the ability to exert its control over private DG units when the loss and emission are minimized. Also, the proposed pricing policy requires decision maker to simply apply its best response strategy to the LMP based on the priority of loss, emission and DISCO's extra benefit. The proposed methodology is applied to two realistic distribution networks, and efficiency and accuracy of the method are verified.

Abstract: The DC power flow model is in widespread utilization in electricity-market applications and contingency analysis. The presented versions of this model can be classified into two categories: state-dependent, or Hot-Start, models and state-independent, or Cold-Start, models. A reasonable accuracy is reported in the literature regarding Hot-Start models as they take into account branch losses and bus voltages by using available base point. On the contrary, due to the absence of base point in Cold-Start models, branch losses must be either neglected or guessed (which is an uncertain precautionary measure), or evaluated by a cumbersome iteration process. In addition, the bus voltage profiles are inevitably considered to be flat. Hence, the accuracy of available Cold-Start models in different circumstances remains of great concern. This paper addresses this concern and unveils a new Cold-Start model that does not rely on a risky assumption. In other words, there will be no lossless or flat voltage profile assumption in the presented approach whereas the equations remain linear. Besides, the exact effect of the net reactive loads on phase angles is considered and, consequently, the reactive power balance equations are reflected in the model for the first time.

Abstract: This paper describes a fault location method which uses sparsely located wide-area synchronized phasor measurements. The main contribution is the way fault location is reformulated as a sparse estimation problem. Faulted system is modeled by equivalent terminal bus injections which would cause the same changes in bus voltages with the fault current drawn at any point along the faulted line. Once these injections are estimated, the fact that the ratio between equivalent injections at the two terminal buses depends only on the ratio of serial impedances on each side of the fault point can be used to locate the fault. It is shown that this formulation applies to both two terminal lines as well as teed lines regardless of fault type or resistance. Assuming availability of an accurate three-phase network model and a sufficient number of phasor measurements over the entire network, an underdetermined set of linear equations can be formed and then solved for the sparse equivalent bus injections. This is accomplished by applying two norm regularization optimization methods namely Lasso and overlapping group Lasso. Effectiveness of these methods are verified by extensive simulations.

Abstract: All-electric ship power systems include less generation capacity and smaller rotating inertia compared with large power systems. The systems include large portions of nonlinear loads and dynamic loads, which may reduce the stability margin. Moreover, various operational constraints, such as system frequency constraint, motor voltage constraint and dynamic cable constraint, need to be satisfied in operational real time. Further, pulse loads draw very high short-time power in an intermittent way, which may significantly deteriorate the power quality of the system. In this paper, a novel multi-agent system cooperative controller for a medium voltage AC (MVAC) system of all-electric ship power systems is developed to balance load and generation in real time while satisfying system's operational constraints and considering load priorities. The new method coordinates the pulse load and the propulsion load to reduce the impact of pulse load changes on the power quality of all-electric ship power systems. The dynamic behavior of the new method is evaluated using case studies in PSCAD software.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel functional observer based quasi-decentralized load frequency control scheme for power systems. Based on functional observers theory, quasi-decentralized functional observers are designed to implement any given state feedback controller. The designed functional observers are decoupled from each other and have a simpler structure in comparison to the state observer based schemes. The proposed functional observer scheme is applied to a complex nonlinear power system and the proposed design method is based on the entire network topology.

Abstract: An algorithm for the detection and frequency estimation of periodic forced oscillations in power systems is proposed. The method operates by comparing the periodogram of synchrophasor measurements to a detection threshold. This threshold is established by deriving a general expression for the distribution of the periodogram and is related to the algorithm's probabilities of false alarm and detection. Unlike classic detection algorithms designed for use with white Gaussian noise, the proposed algorithm uses a detection threshold that varies with frequency to account for the colored nature of synchrophasor measurements. Further, a detection method based on multiple segments of data is also proposed to improve the algorithm's performance as a monitoring tool in the online environment. A design approach that helps to ensure that the best available probability of detection from any one detection segment is constantly increasing with the duration of the forced oscillation is also developed. Results from application of the detection algorithm to simulated and measured power system data suggest that the algorithm provides the expected detection performance and can be used to detect forced oscillations in practical monitoring of power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel mixed-integer secondorder cone programming model for the robust multi-stage substation expansion planning problem considering stochastic demand. The stochastic nature of the demands is considered through a robust model that uses chance constraints to guarantee that the substation capacity limits are satisfied within a given robustness probability. Furthermore, a multi-objective formulation that takes into account the total expected expansion planning cost and the robustness probability related to the violation of the substation capacity limits is proposed. The optimal solution of the proposed model is guaranteed by the convexity of the formulation, when classical optimization techniques are used in its solution. The results found (construction of new substations, reinforcement of existing substations, and service area of each substation) for two test systems demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed model. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations were carried out in order to evaluate the extent to which the solutions found were able to satisfy the substation capacity limits.

Abstract: Portfolios of renewable electricity sources are interesting risk-management mechanisms for trading in electricity contract markets. When formed by players belonging to different companies, their stability relies on the way the benefit generated by the optimal portfolio is allocated. The challenge of finding a fair and efficient allocation can be mathematically formulated in terms of finding the Core of a cooperative game, which in turn is stated as an optimization problem with a set of constraints that exponentially grows with the number of participants, quickly becoming computationally intractable. Moreover, the right-hand-side of each constraint relies on a given coalition value, which in our case is obtained by a two-stage stochastic optimization model. This paper presents an efficient methodology based on mixed-linear programming and Benders decomposition to find the Nucleolus share of large-scale renewable portfolios. Case studies are presented with data from the Brazilian power system.

Abstract: The outage of transmission lines, especially of multiple lines, could cause power network islanding. Traditional line outage distribution factors cannot be directly used for the power flow calculation under network islanding. This letter proposes a direct and fast two-phase method for calculating shift factors under network islanding by leveraging existing shift factors of base case (pre-contingency) network.

Abstract: We present a stochastic programming framework for a multiple timescale economic dispatch problem to address integration of renewable energy resources into power systems. This framework allows certain slow-response energy resources to be controlled at an hourly timescale, while fast-response resources, including renewable resources, and related network decisions can be controlled at a sub-hourly timescale. To this end, we study two models motivated by actual scheduling practices of system operators. Using an external simulator as driver for sub-hourly wind generation, we optimize these economic dispatch models using stochastic decomposition, a sample-based approach for stochastic programming. Computational experiments, conducted on the IEEE-RTS96 system and the Illinois system, reveal that optimization with sub-hourly dispatch not only results in lower expected operational costs, but also predicts these costs with far greater accuracy than with models allowing only hourly dispatch. Our results also demonstrate that when compared with standard approaches using the extensive formulation of stochastic programming, the sequential sampling approach of stochastic decomposition provides better predictions with much less computational time.

Abstract: This paper presents a new framework of recovering missing synchrophasor measurements (erasures). Leveraging the approximate low-rank property of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, we connect the problem of recovering PMU data erasures with recent advances in low-rank matrix completion methods. Since the existing analysis for matrix completion methods assumes an independent-erasure model that does not capture the correlations in PMU erasures, we propose two models to characterize the temporal and the channel correlations in PMU erasures and provide theoretical guarantees of a matrix completion method in recovering correlated erasures in both models. We also propose an online algorithm that can fill in the missing PMU measurements for real-time applications. Numerical experiments on actual PMU data are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a statistical classifier that quickly locates line outages in a power system utilizing only time series phasor measurement data sampled during the system's transient response to the outage. The presented classifier is a linear multinomial regression model that is trained by solving a maximum likelihood optimization problem using synthetic data. The synthetic data is produced through dynamic simulations which are initialized by random samples of a forecast load/generation distribution. Real time computation of the proposed classifier is minimal and therefore the classifier is capable of locating a line outage before steady state is reached, allowing for quick corrective action in response to an outage. In addition, the output of the classifier fits into a statistical framework that is easily accessible. Specific line outages are identified as being difficult to localize and future improvements to the classifier are proposed.

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of displacing conventional synchronous generators with wind turbine generators (WTGs) on the damping of inter-area modes. The impact of tie-line power, which can be beneficial or detrimental with increased wind penetration on the damping of the inter-area mode in a two-area test system, is investigated. It is seen that the inter-area modes are more prone to instability when areas with high wind penetrations export power to remote areas. Furthermore, the performance of supplementary controllers in WTGs (i.e., terminal voltage control and inertia emulation) on the inter-area modes are evaluated. The results show that the controllers can mitigate the possible adverse effects of increased penetration of wind power on the inter-area modes. The results of the studies on the two area system are used to guide a study on a 14-generator model of the Australian grid.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enable frequent computational cycles in online dynamic security assessment by using the terms of the transient energy function (TEF) as input features to a machine learning algorithm. The aim is to train a single classifier that is capable of classifying stable and unstable operating points independent of the contingency. The network is trained based on the current system topology and the loading conditions. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the New England 39-bus test power system model using the support vector machine as the machine learning technique. It is shown that the classifier can be trained using a small set of data when the terms of the TEF are used as input features. The prediction accuracy of the proposed scheme was tested under the balanced and unbalanced faults with the presence of voltage sensitive and dynamic loads for different operating points.

Abstract: Formulating the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) as a polynomial optimization problem makes it possible to solve large instances in practice and to guarantee asymptotic convergence in theory. We formulate the ACOPF as a degree-two polynomial program and study two approaches to solving it via convexifications. In the first approach, we tighten the first-order relaxation of the nonconvex quadratic program by adding valid inequalities. In the second approach, we exploit the structure of the polynomial program by using a sparse variant of Lasserre's hierarchy. This allows us to solve instances of up to 39 buses to global optimality and to provide strong bounds for the Polish network within an hour.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of the rotor angle and speed of synchronous generators is instrumental in developing powerful local or wide-area control and monitoring systems to enhance power grid stability and reliability. Exogenous input signals such as field voltage and mechanical torque are critical information in this context, but obtaining them raises significant logistical challenges, which in turn complicates the estimation of the generator dynamic states from easily available terminal phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals only. To overcome these issues, the authors of this paper employ the extended Kalman filter with unknown inputs, referred to as the EKF-UI technique, for decentralized dynamic state estimation of a synchronous machine states using terminal active and reactive powers, voltage phasor and frequency measurements. The formulation is fully decentralized without single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) or excitation model assumption so that only local information is required. It is demonstrated that using the decentralized EKF-UI scheme, synchronous machine states can be estimated accurately enough to enable wide-area power system stabilizers (WA-PSS) and system integrity protection schemes (SIPS). Simulation results on New-England test system, Hydro-Quebec simplified system, and Kundur network highlight the efficiency of the proposed method under fault conditions with electromagnetic transients and full-order generator models in realistic multi-machine setups.

Abstract: Prior research has shown that autocorrelation and variance in voltage measurements tend to increase as power systems approach instability. This paper seeks to identify the conditions under which these statistical indicators provide reliable early warning of instability in power systems. First, the paper derives and validates a semi-analytical method for quickly calculating the expected variance and autocorrelation of all voltages and currents in an arbitrary power system model. Building on this approach, the paper describes the conditions under which filtering can be used to detect these signs in the presence of measurement noise. Finally, several experiments show which types of measurements are good indicators of proximity to instability for particular types of state changes. For example, increased variance in voltages can reliably indicate both proximity to a bifurcation and the location of increased stress. On the other hand, growth of autocorrelation in certain line currents is related less to a specific location of stress but, rather, is a reliable indicator of stress occurring somewhere in the system; in particular, it would be a clear indicator of approaching instability when many nodes in an area are under stress.

Abstract: This paper presents a new wind farm control framework for inertial and primary frequency response for a high wind integrated power system. The proposed architecture is unique in the sense that the methodology can be used for frequency regulation support during subsynchronous and super-synchronous operation of the wind turbines (farm). The architecture work with existing wind farm controllers thus avoiding any additional replacement or tuning. The methodology depends on reduced order modeling based on model order reduction (MOR) and subsequent on-line controller design. The approach is tested on a smaller wind farm and further evaluated on a larger reduced power grid with 39 buses and ten generators. The results show that the proposed architecture provides greater flexibility in wind farm control towards frequency oscillations.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal day-ahead generation profile for a wind power producer by exploiting wind speed forecasts provided by a meteorological service. In the considered framework, the wind power producer is called to take part in the responsibility of system operation by providing day-ahead generation profiles and undergoing penalties in case of deviations from the schedule. Penalties are applied only if the delivered hourly energy deviates from the schedule more than a given relative tolerance. The optimal solution is obtained analytically by formulating and solving a stochastic optimization problem aiming at maximizing the expected profit. The proposed approach consists in exploiting wind speed forecasts to classify the next day into one of several predetermined classes, and then selecting the optimal solution derived for each class. The performance of the bidding strategy is demonstrated using real data from an Italian wind plant and weather forecasts provided by a commercial meteorological service.

Abstract: Generation capacity expansion planning (GCEP) is the process of deciding on a set of optimal new investments in generation capacity to adequately supply future loads, while satisfying technical and reliability constraints. This paper shows the application of stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) to account for hydrological uncertainty in GCEP for the Chilean Central Interconnected System, using a two-stage SMIP multi-period model with investments and optimal power flow (OPF). The substantial computational challenges posed by GCEP imply compromising between the detail of the stochastic hydrological variables and the detail of the OPF. We selected a subset of hydrological scenarios to represent the historical hydro variability using moment-based scenario reduction techniques. The tradeoff between modeling accuracy and computational complexity was explored both regarding the simplification of the MIP problem and the differences in the variables of interest. Using a simplified OPF model, we found the difference of using a subset of hydro scenarios to be small when compared with using a full representation of the stochastic variable. Overall, SMIP with scenario reduction provided optimal capacity expansion plans whose investment plus expected operational costs were between 1.3% and 1.9% cheaper than using a deterministic approach and proved to be more robust to hydro variability.

Abstract: Power generation growth based on natural gas fired power plants (NGFPPs) has lead to increasing interactions between electric power and natural gas industries. More companies are progressively and simultaneously participating as big players in both markets. However, each company has traditionally been settled in one side, holding a particular competitive advantage: electric power generation companies mainly know how to operate their generation assets, whereas gas companies mainly know how to manage their gas supply contracts and make use of often regulated gas assets. Multi-product energy companies have even created independent departments which decisions are usually taken uncoordinatedly. In any case, companies (or departments) usually support their decision-making process in mathematical tools which represent each market with detail. This paper presents two methodologies for coupling two interdependent electricity and gas market models formulated as optimization problems. Each methodology fulfills different department wishes. The "electricity-perspective" methodology maximizes electricity market profits after calculating equivalent gas contracts with the gas market model. In contrast, the "gas-perspective" methodology minimizes gas operation costs after obtaining the relationship between the marginal revenue and the gas consumption with the electricity market model. This coordinated solution would allow companies to obtain synergies, resulting in a competitive advantage over other companies that operate uncoordinatedly in both markets

Abstract: Spatially distributed energy storage devices can provide additional flexibility to system operators, which is needed to transition from primarily fossil fuel based electricity generation to variable renewable generation. Aggregators in charge of controlling distributed energy storage can take advantage of existing economic incentives for more flexibility. However, controlling large numbers of energy storage devices with individual constraints in accordance with the strict rules of existing energy and reserve markets is challenging. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the design and performance of a system that enables aggregators to bring large numbers of dedicated and fully controllable energy storage devices to multiple markets concurrently. In particular, we propose algorithms and heuristic optimization methods that allow aggregators to control such energy resources in accordance with arbitrary market rules and participation strategies. Our evaluation is based on a realistic dual market (reserve and intra-day energy) use case. We find that effective market-conform control of large numbers of energy storage devices using the proposed algorithms is feasible, even on short time scales. Furthermore, our results also indicate that the scalability of the proposed system design can be further improved via parallelization without limiting the reserve/energy brought to market.

Abstract: Given the rapid increase in the number of phasor measurement units (PMU) installed in substations in recent years, it is not unrealistic to assume that most transmission systems will be fully observable by only PMU measurements in the not so distant future. Such a scenario will enable faster and numerically easier state estimation solution which will be non-iterative due to the linearity of the PMU measurement equations. However, as will be shown in this paper, the benefits do not end there and a closer look at these equations reveals further possibilities of simplification and therefore improved performance of state estimators that use only PMU measurements. Specifically, the paper formulates an alternative decoupled solution, which reduces the size of the state estimation problem, increases computational performance yet maintains high solution accuracy. Both state estimation as well as bad data processing can be efficiently carried out within the developed decoupled formulation.

Abstract: This paper is concerned about effective incorporation of a limited number of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements into the state estimation solution in order to enhance the state tracking accuracy and speed. This is particularly important for fast changing system conditions when rapid control action may be necessary based on the onset of voltage instability due to an unexpected event. Under such conditions, SCADA-based state estimators may be too slow in capturing the changes in system state due to the low scan rates of the order of seconds. PMU measurements on the other hand provide refresh rates of milliseconds; however, they may not provide full system observability. In this work, a solution is proposed in order to address the lack of observability by the PMU measurements while maintaining fast tracking capability as well as estimation robustness against pseudo-measurement and PMU errors. Robustness is accomplished via the use of the so-called least absolute value estimator which minimizes L-1 norm of the residuals. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the expected benefits of this implementation on test systems.

Abstract: Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in renewable energy forecasting, uncertainty quantification is a key input to maintain acceptable levels of reliability and profitability in power system operation. A proposal is formulated and evaluated here for the case of solar power generation, when only power and meteorological measurements are available, without sky-imaging and information about cloud passages. Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution of forecast errors do not follow any of the common parametric densities. This therefore motivates the proposal of a nonparametric approach to generate very short-term predictive densities, i.e., for lead times between a few minutes to one hour ahead, with fast frequency updates. We rely on an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a fast regression model, trained in varied ways to obtain both point and quantile forecasts of solar power generation. Four probabilistic methods are implemented as benchmarks. Rival approaches are evaluated based on a number of test cases for two solar power generation sites in different climatic regions, allowing us to show that our approach results in generation of skilful and reliable probabilistic forecasts in a computationally efficient manner.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of fault tree analysis to calculate the probability of failure of a substation monitoring system based on branch phasor measurement units. Results of the fault tree analysis are used in a reliability-based model for the contingency-constrained phasor measurement units (PMUs) placement to find the minimum number of substations where the branch PMUs must be located for enhancing the wide area monitoring system reliability. The algorithm selects the minimal number of substations to monitor the power system under normal operation and the most credible contingencies. Finally, four indexes will be computed to evaluate the robustness of any monitoring system placement solution. The methodology is tested on the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 57-bus test systems.

The proposed method exploits the ability and robustness of the factored load flow solution procedure to converge to complex solutions well beyond the maximum loadability points. Test cases on a diversity of benchmark cases show that the new method is computationally attractive when compared with existing continuation power flow methods.

Abstract: Wind power ramp events have become one of the major challenges of power balance in power systems with high wind power penetration. Conventional thermal or hydro units have to be dispatched, shut down or started up more frequently to keep the balance between generation and load. This paper proposes a wind power ramp control method with energy storage system (ESS) based on wind power ramp event forecast. An optimization model is established to optimize the output power of ESS and the wind curtailment to meet a hybrid wind power ramp limit. Three types of wind power ramp scenarios are presented based on the ramp event forecast, including normal scenario, positive ramp scenarios, and negative ramp scenarios. In each scenario, the optimization model is modified with scenario switching adjustment (SSA) to reduce the capacity demand of ESS and the curtailed wind energy. While the parameters for modification are obtained by different fuzzy logic systems (FLS). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed wind power ramp control method is verified through case studies.

Abstract: There is growing interest in discerning behaviors of electricity users in both the residential and commercial sectors. With the advent of high-resolution time-series power demand data through advanced metering, mining this data could be costly from the computational viewpoint. One of the popular techniques is clustering, but depending on the algorithm the resolution of the data can have an important influence on the resulting clusters. This paper shows how temporal resolution of power demand profiles affects the quality of the clustering process, the consistency of cluster membership (profiles exhibiting similar behavior), and the efficiency of the clustering process. This work uses both raw data from household consumption data and synthetic profiles. The motivation for this work is to improve the clustering of electricity load profiles to help distinguish user types for tariff design and switching, fault and fraud detection, demand-side management, and energy efficiency measures. The key criterion for mining very large data sets is how little information needs to be used to get a reliable result, while maintaining privacy and security.

Abstract: The impact of electric vehicles on power quality in electric distribution system is evaluated. Voltage deviations such as under/over voltage and voltage imbalance are probabilistically quantified using Monte Carlo. Moreover, distribution transformers overload and unbalance are assessed for different vehicle types (i.e., plug-in hybrid and battery electric), different vehicle penetration (up to 50%) while considering level 1 and level 2 charging. The results of Monte Carlo reveal that battery electric vehicles can cause more overload to distribution transformers compared to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Also level 2 and level 1 can be problematic resulting in secondary bus undervoltage and transformer unbalance, respectively.

Abstract: This letter investigates the situation that high use-of-system charge (UoSC) might appear for new network users and studies the potential of network investment to avoid the high charge. It proposes a method to strike the trade-off between UoSC and investment cost, in the form of connection charge (CC). It determines the utilization level where UoSC and CC reach equilibrium. Beyond this level, it is more economical to conduct network investment for new users to avoid high UoSC. The trade-off between the two type charges provides effective signals for new network users to manage their connecting size and location. The concept is illustrated on a two-busbar system.

Abstract: Dynamic state estimation (DSE) in power system combines forecasting technique with measurement data to accurately estimate system state. The current DSE techniques cannot handle the situation where communication failure occurs and measurement data are lost. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to address this problem. The proposed approach combines the extended Kalman filter (EKF) with load forecasting technique that predicts missing measurement data. A time-forward kriging model is used to forecast the missing load data from the available measurement data. The forecast load is then converted to forecast system state through power flow analysis. The EKF is used to combine the measurement data with the forecast state to obtain a more accurate filtered state. The proposed approach is tested on IEEE 14-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system using realistic load pattern from NYISO and PJM with various scenarios of measurement error and communication failure. The test results from the proposed approach are compared with traditional weighted least square (WLS) state estimation and DSE with multi-step ahead autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) load forecasting. From the case studies, we find that the proposed approach provides more accurate and faster state estimation under most scenarios.

Abstract: DC microgrids may have time-varying system structures and operation patterns due to the flexibility and uncertainty of distributed resources. This feature poses a challenge to conventional stability analysis methods, which are based on fixed and complete system models. To solve this problem, the concept of self-disciplined stabilization is introduced in this paper. A common stability discipline is established using the passivity-based control theory, which ensures that a microgrid is always stable as long as this discipline is complied by each individual converter. In this way, the stabilization task is localized to avoid investigating the entire microgrid, thereby providing immunity against system variations. Moreover, a passivity margin criterion is proposed to further enhance the stability margin of the self-disciplined control. The modified criterion imposes a tighter phase restriction to provide explicit phase margins and prevent under-damped transient oscillations. In line with this criterion, a practical control algorithm is also derived, which increases the converter's passivity through voltage feed forward. The major theoretical conclusions are verified by a laboratory DC microgrid test bench.

Abstract: The dc symmetrical component method is introduced for the analysis and control of bipolar dc distribution systems under asymmetrical operation. This method is an extension of the classical symmetrical component theory in three-phase ac power systems. The asymmetrical voltage and current in the positive and negative poles are decomposed into symmetrical components in common and differential modes. The equivalent circuit for each mode is derived, which forms decoupled mode networks. Consequently, it allows for independent investigation of each mode, and provides an insightful view of the static and dynamic behavior of a bipolar dc power system. The dc symmetrical component method is a general approach which is applicable to different aspects of system design. As an example, an enhanced common-mode voltage regulation scheme is described. It suppresses common-mode LC resonance by adding active damping control, and reduces common-mode impedance to improve power quality and voltage stability. The major theoretical conclusions are verified by experimental results.

Abstract: The voltage source converter (VSC) station is playing a more important role in modern power systems, but the dynamic behavior of the VSC station is quite different from that of the synchronous generator. This paper presents the synchronous generator emulation control (SGEC) strategy for the VSC-HVDC station. The SGEC strategy is divided into the inner control loop and the outer control loop. The inner controller is developed for fast current and voltage regulations. An inertia element is introduced into the frequency-power droop to determine the command reference of the frequency, and the inertia response and the primary frequency regulation are emulated. In addition, the secondary frequency regulation can be achieved by modulating the scheduled power in the SGEC strategy. The time-domain simulation results demonstrate the VSC station with the proposed control strategy can provide desired frequency support to a low-inertia grid. Therefore, the SGEC strategy provides a simple and practical solution for the VSC station to emulate the behavior of a synchronous generator.

Abstract: In deregulated electricity markets, producers offer their energy to the day-ahead market. As the subsidies for renewable producers are becoming lower and lower, they have to adapt to market prices. This paper models the energy trading in the day-ahead market for wind power producers. Different strategies are proposed for this purpose: 1) several wind farms offering their energy separately to the day-ahead market; 2) the same strategy as in 1) but compensating the imbalance among different wind farms; and 3) a joint offer involving several wind farms through an external agent in order to minimize the imbalances between the offer and the final power generation. The strategies are modeled with stochastic mixed integer linear programming and Conditional Value at Risk is used to consider the risk assessment. The expected profit including risk aversion is maximized for each wind power producer and for the set of wind power producers in the case of a joint offer. A comparison of the different cases is described in detail in a case study and relevant conclusions are provided.

Abstract: This paper presents a passivity-based control (PBC) for a type 2 static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) based on an Euler-Lagrange model. The proposed method is designed based on a Lyapunov function by considering dissipation to improve transient performance. An additional nonlinear damping term is designed to regulate the capacitor voltage. It is guaranteed that the equilibrium point of the system is locally exponentially stable in the operating range. The performance of the proposed method is validated via a 100 Mvar STATCOM system connected to the 345-kV grid system in SimPowerSystems, MATLAB/Siumlink. To compare with the input-output feedback linearization method, the proposed control method has improved convergence and reduction of oscillations of the active current and DC voltage, as shown in simulation results. Lastly, it shows that the proposed method is robust to model mismatches as the variation of the grid voltage and the degradation of the capacitance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage methodology for on-line identification of power system dynamic signature using phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements and data mining. Only transient stability status is usually predicted in the literature to assist with corrective control, without the dynamic behavior of generators in the event of instability. This paper uses traditional binary classification to identify transient stability in the first stage, and then develops a novel methodology to predict the nature of unstable dynamic behavior in the second stage. The method firstly applies hierarchical clustering to define patterns of unstable dynamic behavior of generators, and then applies different multiclass classification techniques, including decision tree, ensemble decision tree and multiclass support vector machine to identify characterized unstable responses. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a multi-area transmission test system. High prediction accuracy at both stages of identification is demonstrated.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new distributed framework for forecasting-aided state estimation in electric power systems, modeled by a nonlinear dynamic system. We first introduce the point-based Gaussian approximation filters that use Gaussian approximation and various quadrature rules for computing the related posteriors. These filters feature higher tracking accuracy for nonlinear systems compared to the conventional method, e.g., the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, motivated by the increasing demands for wide-area monitoring, we develop the distributed version of the point-based Gaussian approximation filter, based on statistical linearization. In distributed state estimation, each sub-station can only access their local measurements. In the absence of a control center, the average consensus algorithm is applied such that the sub-stations can maintain the global state through information exchange with neighbors.

Abstract: With recent developments in the infrastructure of smart meters and smart grid, more electric power data is available and allows real-time easy data access. Modeling individual home appliance loads is important for tasks such as non-intrusive load disaggregation, load forecasting, and demand response support. Previous methods usually require sub-metering individual appliances in a home separately to determine the appliance models, which may not be practical, since we may only be able to observe aggregated real power signals for the entire-home through smart meters deployed in the field. In this paper, we propose a model, named Explicit-Duration Hidden Markov Model with differential observations (EDHMM-diff), for detecting and estimating individual home appliance loads from aggregated power signals collected by ordinary smart meters. Experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate that the EDHMM-diff model and the specialized forward-backward algorithm can effectively model major home appliance loads.

Abstract: Recent advancements in high-performance parallel computing platforms and parallel algorithms have significantly enhanced the opportunities for real-time power system protection and control. This paper investigates application of Parareal in time algorithm for fast dynamic simulations. Parareal algorithm belongs to the class of temporal decomposition methods which divide the time interval into sub-intervals and solve them concurrently. Time-parallel algorithms face the difficulty of providing correct initial conditions for all the sub-intervals which impact the convergence rates. Parareal overcomes this difficulty by using an approximate trajectory. It has become popular in recent years for long transient simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics, fusion, reacting flows). This paper presents an approach for reliable implementation of Parareal with detailed models of power systems including saturation. Windowing approach is proposed for improving the convergence. Parareal is compared with the Newton-based time-parallel method. Effectiveness of the algorithm is analyzed by parallel emulation using extensive case studies on 10-generator 39-bus system and 327-generator 2383-bus system for various disturbances. Parareal with simulation windows of 1 s have shown convergence in 1 to 3 iterations for majority of the simulated cases, irrespective of the size of the system and nature of the disturbance. All the cases tested have converged with the proposed implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to early predict the transient stability status of a power system after being subjected to a severe disturbance. The proposed technique is based on rate of change of voltage vs. voltage deviation (ROCOV-Delta V) characteristics of the post-disturbance voltage magnitudes obtained from synchrophasor measurements. Converging and diverging nature of the post-disturbance trajectories on ROCOV-Delta V plane is used to recognize the transient stability status. The proposed technique is computationally simple and fast compared to the rotor angle based transient stability prediction methods. Offline simulations and real-time experimental studies carried out for the IEEE 39-bus test system showed over 99% overall success rate under symmetrical and asymmetrical faults as well as changes in pre-disturbance conditions and network topology changes.

Abstract: Increasing penetration of variable loads and renewable generation will cause the conventional operation strategy of the distribution system to become less certain and effective. This paper presents a method of determining the minimum loss network configuration of a distribution system with uncertain load and renewable generation. A robust optimization model is proposed wherein the optimal decisions on network configurations and losses are derived in two subsequent steps. The first step enforces the radiality constraint before knowing the actual system loads and output level of renewable generation. Power flows are computed next to achieve minimum network losses considering the worst operating conditions over the uncertainty sets. A mixed-integer two-stage robust optimization formulation and a decomposition algorithm in a master-slave structure are proposed to solve the problem. Results of an illustrative example and two test systems are presented to demonstrate the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a sequential power flow algorithm for hybrid ac/dc microgrids operating in the islanded mode. Unlike in grid-connected systems, variable, rather than fixed, frequency and voltage are utilized for power coordination between the ac and dc microgrids, respectively. The main challenge is to solve the power flow problem in hybrid microgrids while considering the absence of a slack bus and the coupling between the frequency and dc voltage. In the proposed algorithm, the ac power flow is solved using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method, thereby updating the ac variables and accordingly utilizing these variables in a proposed interlinking converter model for the dc problem. This sequential algorithm is iterated until convergence. The proposed algorithm is generic and can include different operational modes not only for the distributed generation units (DGs), but also for the interlinking converters. Detailed time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC have validated the algorithm's accuracy. Its robustness and computational cost are contrasted to those of conventional algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach for recharging electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed based on managing multiple discrete units of electric power flow, named energy demand particles (EDPs). Key similarities between EDPs and fluid particles (FPs) are established that allow the use of a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for scheduling the recharging times of EVs. It is shown, via simulation, that the scheduling procedure not only minimizes the variance of voltage drops in the secondary circuits, but it also can be used to implement a dynamic demand response and frequency control mechanism. The performance of the proposed scheduling procedure is also compared with alternative approaches recently published in the literature.

Abstract: This paper describes a probabilistic method for evaluating the number of spare units, regular spare transformers (RSTs), and mobile unit substations (MUSs) required for a group of similar distribution power transformers used at distribution stations in order to meet a pre-determined level of the group availability. The method uses a single Markov model for representing Class I and Class II failures of distribution transformers and a two-state model for representing the mobile unit substation (MUS). The two models are then convolved to obtain the required number of spare units. The proposed method is illustrated using a Hydro One sample of the distribution transformers and the results are compared with the previously published method.

Abstract: The European Union is targeting a 20% share of energy from renewable resources by 2020, and this increase is in turn expected to lead to operational challenges that will require various congestion management actions by system operators. In this paper, we deal with topology control of the transmission network as a congestion management resource and evaluate the impacts of topology control on the European electricity network. To do this, we co-optimize unit commitment and transmission switching over 24 h, and we use a decomposition scheme to tackle the resulting large-scale problem. Our analysis is conducted on different scenarios of load and renewable power generation. We find that topology control results in significant cost savings within Europe which tend to be inversely related to net load. The robustness of our results is supported by an extensive sensitivity analysis.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can be used to provide regulation reserve to the grid. We first argue that the aggregate flexibility offered by a collection of TCLs can be succinctly modeled as a stochastic battery with dissipation. We next characterize the power limits and energy capacity of this battery model in terms of TCL parameters and random exogenous variables such as ambient temperature and user-specified set-points. We then describe a direct load control architecture for regulation service provision. Here, we use a priority-stack-based control framework to select which TCLs to control at any time. The control objective is for the aggregate power deviation from baseline to track an automatic generation control signal supplied by the system operator. Simulation studies suggest the practical promise of our methods.

Abstract: As intermittent energy resources become more significant in power production, traditional capacity planning may be insufficient to ensure reliable system operation. A system planner must ensure that flexibility solutions are available to respond to large and uncertain ramping events. These solutions may be operational, such as improved unit commitment and dispatch, curtailment of renewables, or demand response; procurement based, such as new fast ramping resources or batteries; or involve market reform. This paper outlines a new methodology for modeling the economic tradeoffs in implementing flexibility solutions for integrating renewables. The proposed model includes both a stochastic treatment of system states to account for a wide range of operating conditions and an adapted production simulation methodology that weighs the cost of reliability and subhourly flexibility violations against the cost of the operational flexibility solutions available to mitigate them. The model's functionality is demonstrated with a case study of California at a 50% RPS in 2030. The model tests the value of 1088 MW of generic flexible units, relative to the same capacity of must-run resources, finding an expected annual value of $347 +/- 42 million/yr. Potential applications of the model for resource planning and procurement are also discussed.

Abstract: Imbalance settlement markets are managed by the system operators and provide a mechanism for settling the inevitable discrepancies between contractual agreements and physical delivery. In European power markets, settlements schemes are mainly based on heuristic penalties. These arrangements have disadvantages: First, they do not provide transparency about the cost of the reserve capacity that the system operator may have obtained ahead of time, nor about the cost of the balancing energy that is actually deployed. Second, they can be gamed if market participants use the imbalance settlement as an opportunity for market arbitrage, for example if market participants use balancing energy to avoid higher costs through regular trade on illiquid energy markets. Third, current practice hinders the market-based integration of renewable energy and the provision of financial incentives for demand response through rigid penalty rules. In this paper we try to remedy these disadvantages by proposing an imbalance settlement procedure with an incentive compatible cost allocation scheme for reserve capacity and deployed energy. Incentive compatible means that market participants voluntarily and truthfully state their valuation of ancillary services. We show that this approach guarantees revenue sufficiency for the system operator and provides financial incentives for balance responsible parties to keep imbalances close to zero.

Abstract: Demand response could provide reserves to power systems and market designs should enable cost-efficient exploitation of these resources. In direct load control programs, consumers provide demand response in exchange for incentive payments. The success of such contracts is a function of level of information sharing, consumer costs, and power system constraints/costs. In this paper, we compare three approaches to contract design, each of which assumes different levels of consumer privacy. Our aim is to explore tradeoffs between privacy, resource exploitation, and the reward earned by the load aggregator. The first approach assumes full and truthful information exchange between the consumer and the system operator. We then develop a novel centralized approach in which an aggregator applies mechanism design to offer contracts to consumers who reveal partial cost information. A novel decentralized approach is developed in which consumers act cooperatively to pool demand response reserves, enabling them to keep individual cost information private. Through simulation studies, we find that, in the centralized approach, resource exploitation/rewards are highly sensitive to the accuracy of the load aggregator's consumer cost curves approximations. We also find that in the decentralized approach, rewards can be small, especially if information exchange is costly.

Abstract: We address the optimal energy storage management and sizing problem in the presence of renewable energy and dynamic pricing associated with electricity from the grid. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program that aims to minimize the long-run average cost of electricity used and investment in storage, if any, while satisfying all the demand. We model storage with ramp constraints, conversion losses, dissipation losses and an investment cost. We prove the existence of an optimal storage management policy under mild assumptions and show that it has a dual threshold structure. Under this policy, we derive structural results, which indicate that the marginal value from storage decreases with its size and that the optimal storage size can be computed efficiently. We prove a rather surprising result, as we characterize the maximum value of storage under constant prices and i.i.d. net-demand processes: if the storage is a profitable investment, then the ratio of the amortized cost of storage to the constant price is less than 1/4. We further perform sensitivity analysis on the size of optimal storage and its gain via a case study. Finally, with a computational study on real data, we demonstrate significant savings with energy storage.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of continuous mixed p-norm (CMPN) algorithm-based adaptive control strategy with the purpose of enhancing the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants. The PV arrays are connected to the point of common coupling (PCC) through a DC-DC boost converter, a DC-link capacitor, a grid-side inverter, and a three-phase step up transformer. The DC-DC converter is used for a maximum power point tracking operation based on the fractional open circuit voltage method. The grid-side inverter is utilized to control the DC-link voltage and terminal voltage at the PCC through a vector control scheme. The CMPN algorithm-based adaptive proportional-integral (PI) controller is used to control the power electronic circuits due to its very fast convergence. The proposed algorithm updates the PI controller gains online without the need to fine tune or optimize. For realistic responses, the PV power plant is connected to the IEEE 39-bus New England test system. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is compared with that obtained using Taguchi approach-based an optimal PI controller taking into account subjecting the system to symmetrical, unsymmetrical faults, and unsuccessful reclosing of circuit breakers due to the existence of permanent fault. The validity of adaptive control strategy is extensively verified by the simulation results, which are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC software. With the proposed adaptive-controlled PV power plants, the LVRT capability of such system can be improved.

Abstract: The financial value of security service provided by dual-branch controller of a large-scale photovoltaic system (LPS) has been investigated in this paper. To perform this task, it is necessary to investigate the impact of LPS on small-signal stability of power network. To study the impact and performance of LPS on low-frequency oscillatory modes, a systematic scheme is developed to achieve an accurate model of multi-machine power network including of the LPS technology. A fully-described LPS model with all network-relevant control functions will be obtained. The proposed model has been then employed in the study of financial compensation strategy of security service provided by the LPS controller. The proposed compensation strategy in this paper is based on correlation of swing damping rate (SDR) criterion with generation cost (GC) criterion as dynamic and pecuniary indices, respectively. A weighted sum of performance and robustness indices is considered for SDR. The financial profit created by dual-branch controller of LPS as ancillary service (AS) is evaluated by a twopurpose optimization based on SDR and GC indices. The proposed strategy is tested on a modified 6-machine 3-area power system. Comprehensive discussion is provided to describe the performance of the presented method.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for short-term nodal voltage phasor forecasting in power systems to which a large number of renewable resources and microgrids are connected. Its motivation stems from the observation that such systems are characterized by an unconventional topology along with the presence of a number of buses with bursty power injection patterns, which in turn significantly impacts the temporal and spatial correlation of the nodal voltage phasors. Simulation results carried out on three IEEE test systems reveal that this new pattern affects the number of dominant buses, termed electrical hubs, and, subsequently, the time and spatial correlation among nodal voltage angles. They also reveal that the nodal voltage magnitudes exhibit time correlation, but no spatial correlation. In this paper, time series are represented by autoregressive (AR) processes while multivariate time series with spatial correlation are represented by vector autoregressive (VAR) processes. Statistical tests show that an order one for both models is adequate. The non-zero parameters of the VAR(1) models are identified using metrics on electrical connectivity, centrality, and node significance. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-, 118-, and 300-bus test systems in presence of large-scale distributed wind farms and microgrids, and under loss of system observability.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the use of quadratic time-frequency distributions ( QTFDs) to characterize the temporal variation of low-frequency electromechanical oscillations (LFEOs) using ringdown data. A refined Margenau-Hill distribution (MHD) and a procedure to extract the instantaneous frequencies and damping factors as well as initial phase angles of system low-frequency modes when the analyzed signal is multi-component are proposed. The refinement process enjoys a fast-converging iterative algorithm and without loss of generality it can be applied to other QTFDs for using in other applications. A non-stationary synthetic signal as well as simulated ringdown data of a 5-area, 16-machine power system and real measured data of Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) system are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in the presence of measurement noise.

Abstract: Demand response on the residential market is becoming a solution to adapt customer consumption to the offer available and therefore lower the electricity peak prices. Tariff incentives and direct load control of residential air-conditioners and electric heaters are flexible solutions to reduce the peak demand. To include residential demand response resources in planning operators, quantifying the demand reduction is becoming a major issue for all electrical stakeholders. Current methods are based on day or weather matching, regressions and control group approaches. In general, methods using available data from a control group give more accurate results. With the introduction of smart meters, the electric utilities generate a large amount of quality data, available almost in real time. In this paper, we suggest using these available residential load curves to select a control group based on individual load curves. One of the advantages of our method is that the selected control group could adapt at anytime to the number of individuals belonging to the demand reduction program, as this number evolves with customers entering and leaving the program. Constrained regression methods and an algorithm are developed and evaluated on real data, providing a reliable solution for an operational use.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel profit-based model for multistage distribution network expansion planning. In the proposed model, some capabilities of the distribution automation system are considered to achieve a plan that is more compatible with the strategic plan towards a smart distribution grid. Moreover, a method for reliability evaluation of a distribution network in the planning studies is proposed. The objective function of the planning problem is the net present value of the company's profit. The problem is solved by employing the genetic algorithm approach as a promising technique in solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The proposed method is evaluated on an illustrative test network and the obtained results are presented and discussed.

Abstract: In power system operation, network topology optimization (NTO) based on bus-branch model and opening/closing transmission lines has been previously proposed and utilized as a congestion mitigating tool to reduce operation cost. The bus-branch model cannot provide a detailed picture of all substation switching actions (e.g., bus splitting) that are well known to operators. In this paper, an NTO model based on substation and node-breaker modeling is presented to relieve congestion and consequently reduce cost. The substation reconfiguration provides a practical and realistic picture of switching actions, while having a higher flexibility in switching actions. However, due to introducing more number of nodes and binary variables associated with breakers, solving an NTO model would be challenging. Therefore, some tightening bounds are presented to maintain the reliability and accelerate the computations. Furthermore, using sensitivity analysis of substations, a method to cluster the network to congestion zones is then employed to determine suitable candidate substations for reconfiguration, thus significantly reducing the number of binary variables associated with breaker switchings. The results of applying the NTO model to the IEEE 118-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to remove congestion, while utilizing less number of switching actions compared to bus-branch switching.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the portfolio effect of a system consisting of a combined heat and power (CHP) plant and a wind farm. The goal is to increase the overall profit of the portfolio by reducing imbalances and, consequently, their implicit penalty in a two-price balancing market for electricity. We investigate two different operational strategies, which differ in whether the CHP plant and the wind farm are operated jointly or independently, and we evaluate their economic performance on a real case study based on a CHP-wind system located in the western part of Denmark. We present a comprehensive mathematical model for describing the different heat and power production units of the CHP plant and suggest different ways of determining its operation in a setup with two trading floors: a day-ahead market and a balancing market. We build a simulation framework that runs in a rolling-horizon fashion, so that forecasts for heat demand, wind power production, and market prices are updated at each iteration. We conclude that the portfolio strategy is the most profitable due to the two-price structure of the balancing market. This encourages producers to handle their imbalances outside the market.

Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) optimizes simultaneously the generation dispatch and the topology of a power system. It has been shown that taking some transmission lines out of service can significantly reduce the operating cost of the system while respecting the traditional deterministic N - 1 security criterion of operational reliability. However, topology modifications could adversely affect probabilistic security metrics. The operational reliability of a power system can be translated into a cost by multiplying the expected energy not served by the value of lost load. This paper therefore explores whether it is possible to maintain a positive economic balance with OTS when considering not only the cost of generation but also the expected socio-economic cost of disruptions in the supply. This is done in two steps: the computation of an N - 1 secure OTS and then the calculation of a probabilistic estimate of the operational reliability of the OTS solution. Based on the results obtained with two test systems, it is shown that OTS tends to significantly degrade probabilistic measures of security. It is thus not obvious that OTS can lead to a positive economic balance, even when N - 1 security is enforced. Consequently, a probabilistic security analysis should be performed before implementing an OTS solution.

Abstract: Cascading outages in power systems can lead to major power disruptions and blackouts and involve a large number of different mechanisms. The typical development of a cascading outage can be split in two phases with different dominant cascading mechanisms. As a power system is usually operated in security, an initiating contingency cannot entail a fast collapse of the grid. However, it can trigger a thermal transient, increasing significantly the likelihood of additional contingencies, in a "slow cascade." The loss of additional elements can then trigger an electrical instability. This is the origin of the subsequent "fast cascade," where a rapid succession of events can lead to a major power disruption. Several models of probabilistic simulations exist, but they tend to focus either on the slow cascade or on the fast cascade, according to mechanisms considered, and rarely on both. We propose in this paper a decomposition of the analysis in two levels, able to combine probabilistic simulations for the slow and the fast cascades. These two levels correspond to these two typical phases of a cascading outage. Models are developed for each of these phases. A simplification of the overall methodology is applied to two test systems to illustrate the concept.

Abstract: An on-going debate in the energy economics and power market community raises the question if energy-only power markets are increasingly failing due to growing feed-in shares from subsidized renewable energy sources (RES); the argument being essentially that the merit-order effect of RES production depresses day-ahead spot market prices, which in turn creates a situation where power plant owners cannot recover investment costs (missing-money problem). We argue in short that energy-only power markets are not failing in principle but are rather facing several market distortions that hinder proper market functioning, namely 1) the gap between the electricity volume actually traded at day-ahead spot markets versus the overall electricity consumption, and 2) the regulatory assumption that variable RES generation, i.e., wind and photovoltaic (PV), truly has zero marginal operation and grid integration costs. In this paper, we show that both effects over-amplify the well-known merit-order effect of RES power feed-in, and indirectly also the missing-money problem beyond a level that is explainable by underlying physical realities. We empirically analyze the impacts of wind and PV power feed-in on the day-ahead market for the EPEX German-Austrian market zone, a region that is already today experiencing significant feed-in tariff (FIT)-subsidized RES power feed-in (ca. 20% FIT share). Our analysis shows that, if necessary regulatory adaptations are taken, i.e., increasing the spot market's share of overall load demand and using the true marginal costs of RES units in the merit-order, energy-based power markets remain functional despite high RES power feed-in.

Abstract: This paper estimates the average Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) following islanding and/or cascading event/s using inflection points of frequency profile. Moreover, a frequency collapse barrier scheme is set up by tuning the frequency set points of Load Shedding (LS) relays as a dynamic variable using voltage drop data coordinated with plant protection scheme. A frequency anti stalling scheme is developed to interrupt more load feeders in case of frequency stall between consecutive set points. This time-based approach adjusts the time delay of the relay stages to disconnect the feeders with more voltage drop first, in order to bring the frequency back to the permissible range before the tolerable time period of plant protection relays is over. The load curtailment is stopped to avoid over LS, if the proposed algorithm recognizes that the frequency reaches the safe region in time based on estimated average ROCOF. Tripping of feeders, which inject active or reactive power to the grid due to penetration of dispersed generations into the load feeders is also prevented by considering the power flow direction of feeders.

Abstract: Load shedding (LS) is the last firewall and the most expensive control action against power system blackout. In the conventional under frequency LS (UFLS) schemes, the load drop locations are already determined independently of the event location. Furthermore, the frequency thresholds of LS relays are prespecified and constant values which may not be a comprehensive solution for widespread range of possible events. This paper addresses the decentralized LS in which the instantaneous voltage deviation of load buses is used to determine the frequency thresholds of LS relays. The higher frequency thresholds are assigned to the loads with larger voltage decay which are often located in the vicinity of disturbance location. The proposed method simultaneously benefits from individual UFLS and under voltage LS (UVLS) features which operate in the power system without coordination. Numerical simulations in DigSilent Power Factory software confirm the efficiency of proposed methodology in the stabilization of the power system after various severe contingencies.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to estimate modal parameters of power systems for monitoring and analyzing the embedded modes of small signal oscillations. The proposed approach applies continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to identify damping and frequency of critical modes based on its time-frequency localization capability. The CWT has modified Morlet function as its mother wavelet. A procedure is also presented to fine-tune settings of the modified Morlet function of the CWT based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Shannon's entropy criterion. Additionally, high computational burden of the time-frequency methods is an important obstacle in online monitoring of power systems by these methods. To remedy this problem, the convolution integral of the CWT is calculated by efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) routine in the proposed approach leading to a low computational burden. The proposed approach is compared with several other signal processing methods for modal identification of power systems. These comparisons illustrate effectiveness of the proposed approach, regarding run time, persistency against noise and estimation accuracy for online monitoring of small signal oscillations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) based sequential analytical approach for composite generation and transmission systems reliability assessment. The basic idea is to construct a CTMC model for the composite system. Based on this model, sequential analyses are performed. Various kinds of reliability indices can be obtained, including expectation, variance, frequency, duration and probability distribution. In order to reduce the dimension of the state space, traditional CTMC modeling approach is modified by merging all high order contingencies into a single state, which can be calculated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Then a state mergence technique is developed to integrate all normal states to further reduce the dimension of the CTMC model. Moreover, a time discretization method is presented for the CTMC model calculation. Case studies are performed on the RBTS and a modified IEEE 300-bus test system. The results indicate that sequential reliability assessment can be performed by the proposed approach. Comparing with the traditional sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, the proposed method is more efficient, especially in small scale or very reliable power systems.

Abstract: Owing to wind power inherent characteristics and technical constraints of power systems operation, a considerable amount of wind energy cannot be delivered to load centers and gets curtailed. Transmission congestion together with temporal mismatch between load and available wind power can be accounted as the main reasons for this unpleasant event. This paper aims to concentrate on the wind energy curtailment for which it provides a combinatorial planning model to maximize wind power utilization. Jointly operating the wind power generation system with pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), the planning procedure tries to reach schemes with the minimum level of wind energy curtailment as well as low imposed cost of transmission network reinforcement. In this regard, a well-organized posterior multi-objective (MO) optimization framework is proposed aimed to properly deal with wind energy curtailment cost, total social cost, and also storage units' revenue as some unavoidable factors in planning studies of power systems. The presented method is conducted on the modified IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE-RTS) and the obtained results introduce its applicability and efficiency in planning procedure of the renewable-based power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive two-stage robust security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) approach, which minimizes the operation cost of the base case while guaranteeing that the robust solution can be adaptively and securely adjusted in response to continuous load and wind uncertainty intervals as well as discrete N - K generation and transmission contingency security criteria. In addition, corrective capabilities of both non-quick-start and quick-start units are rigorously formulated. Specifically, unit commitment of quick-start units is adaptively adjusted in the recourse stage for satisfying security constraints under various uncertainties, which introduces mixed-integer recourse to the proposed two-stage robust SCUC model. The proposed model is solved by the combination of modified Benders decomposition (BD) method and column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm, which decompose the original problem into a master UC problem for the base case and security checking subproblems for uncertainties. Numerical case studies on the modified IEEE 118-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust SCUC approach. Although the modified BD does not provide the tightest lower bound and may not guarantee the global optimality, robustness performance tests indicate that a reasonable threshold on the violation of security checking subproblems would guarantee good enough solutions from engineering point of view.

Abstract: This paper proposes a measurement-based voltage stability monitoring method for a load area fed by N tie lines. Compared to a traditional Thevenin equivalent based method, the new method adopts an N buses equivalent system so as to model and monitor individual tie lines. For each tie line, the method solves the power transfer limit against voltage instability analytically as a function of all parameters of that equivalent, which are online identified from real-time synchronized measurements on boundary buses of the load area. Thus, this new method can directly calculate the real-time power transfer limit on each tie line. The method is first compared with a Thevenin equivalent based method using a 4-bus test system and then demonstrated by case studies on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 48-machine, 140-bus power system.

Abstract: Rational approximation of frequency-dependent network equivalents with vector fitting (VF) is widely used in power system analysis; however, a detailed examination of methods to determine the order of the model has not been reported. The traditional order identification method of the frequency response resonance peak is conservative, as demonstrated in this paper. We discuss the essential relationships between VF and Prony analysis (PA). A PA-based method is then proposed to identify the order of model, considering the resonance peaks. The method is computationally inexpensive, and the precision can be adjusted easily. Numerical investigations demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the method.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient method for evaluating composite system reliability via subset simulation. The central idea is that a small failure probability can be expressed as a product of larger conditional probabilities, thereby turning the problem of simulating a rare failure event into several conditional simulations of more frequent intermediate failure events. In existing methods, system states are simply assessed in a binary secure/failure manner. To fit into the context of subset simulation, the adequacy of system states is parametrized with a metric based on linear programming, thus allowing for an adaptive choice of intermediate failure events. Samples conditional on these events are generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed method requires no prior information before imulation. Different models for renewable energy sources can also be accommodated. Numerical tests show that this method is significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo simulation, especially for simulating rare failure events.

Abstract: The overall performance of emission trading (ET), a market-based emission regulation tool, strongly relies on participants' participation and responses. In order to improve market design, it is important for policy makers to understand the participants' trading behaviors in different market environments. However, human behaviors cannot be easily modeled with conventional analytical methods due to its "bounded rationality" characteristics. In this paper, based on the complementary features between experimental and agent-based computational methods, a hybrid interactive simulation methodology is proposed to solve human behaviors related problems. Human-subjected experiment based on European Union Emissions Trading System price data in 2006 is conducted, the results show that there is no fixed emission trading interval for generation companies, and the strategic behaviors of market participants are observed. Major driving factors of emission trading are categorized into emission price, emission quantity and time related factors, which are in accordance with empirical analysis results on EU ETS 2005-2006 transaction dataset. Furthermore, more human-subjected experiments are conducted under different emission price scenarios to obtain samples for quantitative analysis. Based on thousands of samples obtained, the joint influences of driving factors on emission trading behaviors are analyzed. The quantitative analysis results obtained can reflect the trading patterns of human participants, which provide basis for constructing computer agents that can act as useful substitutes for human participants.

Abstract: This paper investigates a special class of dynamic power system problem, namely subsynchronous resonance (SSR) resulted from a series-compensated network connecting doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms. A novel two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) control strategy combined with a damping control loop is designed and analyzed for enhancing the system stability and alleviates the SSR that may arise due to the induction generator effect (IGE). The proposed control strategy is tested at different operating conditions of series compensation levels and low wind speeds to ensure the system stability. The doubly-fed induction generator based wind farms without the proposed control strategy leads to overall system instability during high series compensation and low wind speeds. Hence, the mitigation of the SSR and damping enhancement are critical to the entire power system stability. A reliable way of analyzing the system and designing effective control strategies against SSR based on the eigenvalue analysis and impedance based stability criterion is deployed. Moreover, analytical explanations have been elaborated to verify the procedure of the controller design. Fault ride-though capability has also been investigated with the proposed control strategy that is flexible to be integrated with the FRT schemes so as to assist the wind farm in mitigating the SSR during the fault recovery stage. Finally, time domain simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for mitigating the SSR and damping power system oscillations.

Abstract: This paper deals with the development of a new electromagnetic transient (EMT)-transient stability (TS) hybrid simulation platform and its application to a detailed fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) study on the WECC system. A new EMT-TS hybrid simulation platform, which integrates PSCAD/EMTDC and the open source power system simulation software InterPSS has been developed. A combined interaction protocol with an automatic protocol switching control scheme is proposed. A multi-port three-phase Thevenin equivalent is developed for representing an external network in an EMT simulator. Correspondingly, the external network is represented in three-sequence, and a three-sequence TS simulation algorithm is developed. These techniques allow simulation of unsymmetrical faults within the internal network without the constraint of phase balance at the boundary. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is first tested on the IEEE 9-bus system. Subsequently, the proposed hybrid simulation approach is applied to a detailed FIDVR study on a large WECC system. The study shows that a normally cleared single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault in the transmission system could lead to an FIDVR event, with compressor motors of the air conditioning units on the faulted phases stalling first, followed by a propagation of motor stalling to the unfaulted phase. Moreover, similar events are observed in simulations with a wide range of load compositions. Lastly, the effect of the point-on-wave (POW) at which a fault is applied on the occurrence of an FIVDR event is also analyzed.

Abstract: We study the problem of detecting transmission line outages in power grids. We model the time series of power network measurements as a hidden Markov process, and formulate the line outage detection problem as an inference problem. Due to the physical nature of the line failure dynamics, the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov Model are sparse. Taking advantage of this fact, we further propose an approximate inference algorithm using particle filtering, which takes in the times series of power network measurements and produces a probabilistic estimation of the status of the transmission line status. We then assess the performance of the proposed algorithm with case studies. We show that it outperforms the conventional static line outage detection algorithms and is robust to both measurement noise and model parameter errors.

Abstract: This paper presents the distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP) method through quadratic programming (QP) designed to alleviate the congestion that might occur in a distribution network with high penetration of flexible demands. In the DLMP method, the distribution system operator (DSO) calculates dynamic tariffs and publishes them to the aggregators, who make the optimal energy plans for the flexible demands. The DLMP through QP instead of linear programing as studied in previous literatures solves the multiple solution issue of the aggregator optimization which may cause the decentralized congestion management by DLMP to fail. It is proven in this paper, using convex optimization theory, the aggregator's optimization problem through QP is strictly convex and has a unique solution. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the unique solution of the aggregator optimization ensure that the centralized DSO optimization and the decentralized aggregator optimization converge. Case studies using a distribution network with high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs) validate the equivalence of the two optimization setups, and the efficacy of the proposed DLMP through QP for congestion management.

Abstract: Severe overloads, caused by the outage of units in multi-transformer substations, may affect transformer life adversely. This paper presents a novel demand response (DR) based optimization model to limit load on healthy transformers during contingencies. The model selects combination of the best remedial actions among DR, load curtailment (LC) and transferring load to a neighboring substation. IEEE standard thermal and aging models are used for transformer loss-of-life (LOL) calculation. For a realistic study, the proposed model is applied to a Finnish residential two-transformer primary substation for case studies of load with and without DR. The load profile and flexibility of the demand are estimated by hourly metered consumption and survey data. Simulations are performed for two situations depending upon availability of connection with a neighboring substation. The results show that the LOL of transformers can be reduced by employing DR following contingency events and the capacity utilization can be increased correspondingly.

Abstract: The management of transformers' capacity is a vital task for planners and asset managers due to their high cost. This paper proposes an optimization model for capacity management of transformers in a substation over long-run. The model considers the present worth costs of investment, losses, maintenance, reliability, and the salvage value of transformers for providing the optimal selection and scheduling of multistage transformer installations and their refurbishments. In the optimization model, growing failure rate of transformers along with their age is incorporated and the cumulative loss-of-life (LOL) of transformers is also used in determining their salvage value. The developed model is applied for planning and management of transformer capacities for a residential load dominant two-transformer primary distribution substation over a period of 40 years. The simulations are performed for various case studies representing the situations encountered by utilities. An extensive sensitivity analysis is also conducted for several conditions of the system parameters. The numerical results indicate the worth of inclusion of variable failure rate and LOL of transformers in their capacity management.

Abstract: In interconnected power systems, operated by several system operators, the participating areas are strongly dependent on their neighbors. In order to identify the economically efficient generation dispatch in each area, a distributed multi-area optimal power flow (OPF) must be solved. Additionally, installation of an increasing number of HVDC lines to deal with increased power flows from renewable generation is expected to change the power system operation paradigm. The controllability introduced by the HVDC lines should be considered and incorporated in the OPF algorithm. In this paper we introduce a formulation for the distributed solution of the OPF problem in multi-area systems consisting of both HVAC and HVDC lines. We show the applicability of this formulation on two different operating schemes for HVDC grids and we compare their performance with a central solution for the mixed HVAC/HVDC grid. The proposed formulations are based on a linearized solution of the OPF problem. The only data to be exchanged between the areas pertains to the border nodes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized adaptive emergency control scheme against power system voltage instability. Decentralized control architecture is proposed by segregating the system into several local areas or zones based on the concept of electrical distance. Intelligent agents are assigned in each area to monitor the bus voltages and generator reactive powers to detect any threat of voltage collapse and to actuate countermeasures. A novel performance index has been formulated based on the load voltage and generator reactive power violations to identify the severity of disturbance and the risk of system emergency in each area. The coordination of the timing of the countermeasures among the agents is achieved through the formulation of the integral of the performance index. The simplicity and the adaptive nature of the proposed control scheme to provide countermeasures against any disturbance make it useful for real-time application. The robustness of the proposed approach has been validated through several case studies using the New England 39-bus test system and a more realistic Nordic32 test system.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized emergency control approach for preventing voltage instability by controlling the reactive power and voltage of the system. The proposed control algorithm is based on a distributed architecture of intelligent agents to identify the affected region and to activate timely countermeasures to achieve a fast and accurate response. By dividing the network into several areas, the voltage instability problem can be localized and countermeasures can be directed to the most affected area by the authorized local agent. This facilitates quick decision making within the system. To achieve effective voltage and reactive power support, a sensitivity based zone formation is proposed. The Nordic32 74-bus test system has been used for testing the proposed multi-agent emergency control (MAEC). The results from the case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MAEC approach.

Abstract: The penetration level of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has the potential to be notably increased in the near future, and as a consequence, power systems face new challenges and opportunities. In particular, PEVs are able to provide different types of power system ancillary services. The capability of storing energy and the instantaneous active power control of the fast-switching converters of PEVs are two attractive features that enable PEVs to provide various ancillary services, e.g., primary frequency control (PFC). However, concurrently, PEVs are obliged to be operated and controlled within limits, which curbs the grid support from PEVs. This paper proposes a new model for PEV using a participation factor, which facilitates the incorporation of several PEV fleets characteristics such as minimum desired state of charge (SOC) of the PEV owners, drive train power limitations, constant current and constant voltage charging modes of PEVs. In order to reduce computational complexity, an aggregate model of PEVs is provided using statistical data. In the end, the performance of PEVs for the provision of PFC is evaluated in a power system. Results show that PEV fleets can successfully improve frequency response, once all the operating constraints are respected.

Abstract: In the future, the number of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that will participate in the primary frequency control (PFC) is likely to increase. In our previous research, the computational complexity of the PFC problem for a large number of PEVs was reduced using aggregate models of PEVs. However, in the literature on the PFC, the distribution network characteristics have not been included in the aggregate models of PEVs for the PFC, despite the fact that PEVs will be dispersedly connected to the distribution network. This paper proposes an aggregate model of PEVs for the PFC that further incorporates distribution network characteristics, i.e., the distribution network power loss (DNPL) and the maximum allowed current (MAC) of the lines and transformers. The DNPL variation is formulated according to the line and transformer impedance, spatial distribution of PEVs and loads, and active power variation of PEVs. Then, DNPL variation together with the MAC of the lines and transformers are incorporated in the proposed model of PEVs. Finally, the simulation results show an excellent agreement of 98% between the detailed model and the proposed aggregate model of PEVs.

Abstract: Economic transmission switching has been proposed as a new control paradigm to improve the economics of electric power systems. In practice, the transmission switching operation itself is a disruptive action to the system. Frequently switching lines into or out of service can create undesirable effects on the security and reliability of power systems and may require new investments in the automation and control systems. In this paper, we formulate an economic seasonal transmission switching model where transmission switching occurs once at the beginning of a time period (season) and then the transmission topology remains unchanged during that period. The proposed seasonal transmission switching model is a large-scale mixed integer programming problem. The objective of the optimization model is to minimize the total energy generation cost over the season subject to loads and N-1 reliability requirements. We develop a novel decomposition method that decomposes the seasonal problem into one-hour problems which are then solved efficiently. We demonstrate our model and the decomposition approach on the 14-bus, 39-bus, and 118-bus power systems and show potential cost savings in each case.

Abstract: This paper discusses the need for short circuit analysis in real-time applications of modern distribution networks and presents a short circuit tool that builds on recent advances in Fortescue-based current injection power flow. The proposed short circuit computation (SCC) method is fundamentally based on the symmetrical components transformation of three-phase, two-phase, and one-phase systems. Unlike the classical symmetrical components SCC method that postulates a structurally symmetrical three-phase pre-fault network with balanced loading, the proposed method accounts for multiphase networks that are comprised of three-phase, two-phase, and one-phase network parts; given a pre-fault power flow solution, it requires a maximum of three current injection iterations to compute the short circuit current flow in the entire network. Numerical results show that the Fortescue SCC approach with multiphase lines exhibits significant computational performance improvement on large-scale networks as compared to classical SCC in phase coordinates.

Abstract: This paper discusses the need for the integration of storage systems on transmission networks having renewable sources, and presents a tool for energy storage planning. The tool employs robust optimization to minimize the investment in storage units that guarantee a feasible system operation, without load or renewable power curtailment, for all scenarios in the convex hull of a discrete uncertainty set; it is termed ROSION-Robust Optimization of Storage Investment On Networks. The computational engine in ROSION is a specific tailored implementation of a column-and-constraint generation algorithm for two-stage robust optimization problems, where a lower and an upper bound on the optimal objective function value are successively calculated until convergence. The lower bound is computed using mixed-integer linear programming and the upper bound via linear programming applied to a sequence of similar problems. ROSION is demonstrated for storage planning on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus networks, and the robustness of the designs is validated via Monte Carlo simulation.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources and energy storage systems present specific challenges to the traditional optimal power flow (OPF) paradigm. First, storage devices require the OPF to model charge/discharge dynamics and the supply of generated power at a later time. Second, renewable energy sources necessitate that the OPF solution accounts for the control of conventional power generators in response to errors of renewable power forecast, which are significantly larger than the traditional load forecast errors. This paper presents a sparse formulation and solution for the affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) of the multi-period OPF problem. The AARC aims at operating a storage portfolio via receding horizon control; it computes the optimal base-point conventional generation and storage schedule for the forecasted load and renewable generation, together with the constrained participation factors that dictate how conventional generation and storage will adjust to maintain feasible operation whenever the renewables deviate from their forecast. The approach is demonstrated on standard IEEE networks dispatched over a 24-h horizon with interval forecasted wind power, and the feasibility of operation under interval uncertainty is validated via Monte Carlo analysis. The computational performance of the proposed approach is compared with a conventional implementation of the AARC that employs successive constraint enforcement.

Abstract: This paper discusses the stability properties of electricity markets and their implications for the deregulated market environment. We formulate a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model for electricity markets to account for their uncertainty and nonlinearity and obtain realistic stability results. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the stability and instability of electricity markets. All the proposed stability and instability conditions can be tested using linear matrix inequalities. Simulation results demonstrate the application of the stability and instability tests to electric power market under different market conditions. The tests also demonstrate the importance of the including nonlinearities and uncertainty in the electricity market when investigating its stability.

Abstract: A study of small signal behavior of power systems including wind generation units and energy capacitor systems (ECSs) is presented in this paper. Modeling of wind units with squirrel-cage induction generators connected to power system through a full-scale AC/AC converter and ECS unit are explained thoroughly. The ECS unit (considered in this paper) consists of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) and DC/AC converter. Small signal behavior of three test systems are studied and compared with one another using digital computer simulations. The three systems are: S1) WSCC 9-bus system with three conventional synchronous generators (SGs), S2) the WSCC system with one of the conventional SGs replaced by a wind energy system, and S3) the same as S2) but with the addition of an ECS unit. The study includes comparing of dominant eigenvalues, the participant state variables, and the related participation factors for the three systems. In addition, the effects of loading on the unstable modes of the system with conventional SG, wind and ECS units (system S3) are studied using the trajectory of these modes as loads are increased.

Abstract: Security enhancement of distribution networks are constrained with multiple causes including limited availability of network resources and high penetration of intermittent distributed generation. In that context, this paper proposes a new methodology to enhance the security of power supply in a distribution network by strategically integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) micro grids based on the nodal criticality. The nodal criticality is assessed by integrating operational uncertainties of events into samples of Monte Carlo simulation and then classifying load interruptions on the basis of their magnitudes and frequencies. The load shedding due to criticality of system stress is classified into arrays of clusters on the basis of magnitudes of interrupted loads. The critical clusters that provide the largest disturbances to nodal loads are used as the reference capacities of PHEV micro grids to mitigate impacts. Case studies are performed by applying the methodology into a realistic model of a distribution network. Results depict that the proposed methodology can improve the system-wide security of supply. There are some nodes of which the security of supply can be improved significantly. The levels of improvement in security of supply of nodes are not consistent and some nodes can also receive marginal improvements.

Abstract: In traditional distribution system, power flow was unidirectional; thus loads were usually aggregated into the substation as an equivalent constant bus in the original risk analysis of transmission system. Detail structures of the distribution system were absolutely ignored. However, distribution system is transformed from passive to active nowadays with more and more distributed generations (DGs) being integrated into it. So, distribution system not only can be considered as loads but also can be considered as virtual power plants to supply power to local loads and even to send power back to the transmission system sometimes. In this paper, a hierarchical method is presented to evaluate the impact of role changing of the distribution system in power system risk assessment. In the study, DGs can supply critical loads in distribution system through re-dispatching after some contingency happens. Discrete probability model is employed to simulate the intermittent output of DGs. Available supply capacity (ASC) is used as a general constraint to guarantee the security level of distribution system that needs high reliability. Also, an iterative calculation between transmission system and distribution network is adopted to derive the risk indices with considering detail structures of the active distribution network. Further, impact of some factors on system risk calculation, such as DGs' capacities, dispersions, locations, and component outage probabilities, are discussed. Finally, correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated by a modified IEEE RTS and RBTS system.

Abstract: Aluminum production relies on the smelting process which consumes huge amounts of electrical energy. One possible solution to reduce the fossil fuel consumption by aluminum production is the integration of wind power. Based on this background, this paper studies an isolated power system for aluminum smelting production with a high penetration of wind power. A dynamic model of the aluminum smelter load (ASL) is introduced in this paper using the field experiment data. Based on this model, the dynamic model of the isolated system considering demand side participation is proposed. The MPC-based frequency controller is proposed to keep the frequency deviation within a proper range (0.1 Hz) under wind power fluctuation as well as to recover the system frequency after a large disturbance (such as one generator trip). Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC based frequency controller.

Abstract: In transient stability analysis, the fifth-order generator model neglects the stator transients and may result in different simulation results as compared with the seventh-order model. Based on the two-time scale property of generators, a dynamic correction method is proposed to offset the difference. Using the singular perturbation theory, fast components in the stator flux linkage is captured to restore stator dynamics and correct the electromagnetic torque. Simulations on a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) system and a 3-machine system show that, the difference between the two generator models can be remarkably reduced by the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents a general approach for coherency detection in bulk power systems using the projection pursuit (PP) theory. Supported by the concept of center of inertia (COI) in power systems, the PP theory is employed to model the wide-area coherency detection as an optimization problem. In the proposed method, the optimal projection direction in high dimensional orthogonal space is explored in order to detect the coherent groups via the data from synchronous phasor measurement units (PMUs). Two quantitative indices constructed with projection assessment index (PI), the objective of the optimization model, are then defined in order to determine the critical coherent group and the dominant coherent groups. The coherency detection criterion and the implementation framework for the proposed approach are also presented. Simulation data from the 16-machine 68-bus test system and China Southern power Grid (CSG), along with actual field-measurement data retrieved from WAMS database in the CSG, are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm under different disturbances. It is shown that the proposed methodology successfully detects the dominant coherent groups of generators and buses in bulk power system via the wide-area field-measurement data.

Abstract: A critical function in outage management for distribution systems is to quickly detect a fault and identify the activated protective device(s). With ongoing smart grid development, numerous smart meters and fault indicators with communication capabilities provide an opportunity for accurate and efficient outage management. Using the available data, this paper proposes a new multiple-hypothesis method for identification of the faulted section on a feeder or lateral. Credibility of the multiple hypotheses is determined using the available evidence from these devices. The proposed methodology is able to handle i) multiple faults, ii) protection miscoordination, and iii) missing outage reports from smart meters and fault indicators. For each hypothesis, an optimization method based on integer programming is proposed to determine the most credible actuated protective device(s) and faulted line section(s). Simulation results based on the distribution feeders of Avista Utilities serving Pullman, WA, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: A phasor measurement unit (PMU) only state estimator is intrinsically superior to its SCADA analogue with respect to speed, performance, and reliability. However, ensuring the quality of the data stream which enters the linear estimator is crucial before establishing it as the front end of an EMS or other network applications. One approach is to pre-process the phasor data before it arrives at the linear estimator. This paper presents an algorithm for synchrophasor data conditioning and repair that fits neatly as a prefix into the existing linear state estimation formulation. The methodology has been tested using field data obtained from PMUs installed in Dominion Virginia Power's (DVP's) EHV network. The results indicate that the proposed technique provides a computationally simple, elegant solution to the synchrophasor data quality problem.

Abstract: Finding a global solution to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is difficult due to its nonconvexity. A convex relaxation in the form of semidefinite programming (SDP) has attracted much attention lately as it yields a global solution in several practical cases. However, it does not in all cases, and such cases have been documented in recent publications. This paper presents another SDP method known as the moment-sos (sum of squares) approach, which generates a sequence that converges towards a global solution to the OPF problem at the cost of higher runtime. Our finding is that in the small examples where the previously studied SDP method fails, this approach finds the global solution. The higher cost in runtime is due to an increase in the matrix size of the SDP problem, which can vary from one instance to another. Numerical experiment shows that the size is very often a quadratic function of the number of buses in the network, whereas it is a linear function of the number of buses in the case of the previously studied SDP method.

Abstract: With the rising number of intermittent renewable energy sources and growing energy demand, transfer capabilities are very close to their limits. Consequently, redispatch events occur more frequently and flexibility of conventional generation and storage devices will become increasingly important. The cooperative multi-area optimization strategy presented here enables transmission system operators (TSOs) to dispatch/redispatch interconnected networks securely, while reducing dispatch/redispatch costs. Schedules for storage devices, conventional-and renewable generation are obtained considering network constraints and ramping rates. An optimal schedule for several control areas is attained, including storage operation to achieve congestion relief. The distributed approach preserves control area responsibilities. All participating control areas attain a schedule close to the global optimum. TSOs implement agreements to share resulting profits. The functionality was shown successfully using stressed 14- and 118-node systems. A cross border dispatch with use of storage devices is realized to maintain a high share of renewable energy source (RES) feed-in, while reducing overall dispatch costs.

Abstract: This paper examines the application of STATCOM and battery energy storage to enhance the transient stability of large-scale multimachine power systems with synchronous and doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs). A passivity-based control design method [interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC)] is developed for multimachine power systems and its performance is evaluated on a two-area system consisting of two synchronous generators (SGs) and two DFIG along with STATCOM/battery energy storage system. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) use of a STATCOM and battery energy storage system to enhance transient stability and provide voltage regulation with SG and DFIG; 2) demonstrating the application of nonlinear control theory (specifically the IDA-PBC methodology) for the design of a stabilizing feedback controller in large-scale power systems to improve transient system performance; and 3) developing a methodology that can use the additional degrees of freedom in large-scale power systems in order to further improve system performance, in particular the transient stability margin [measured through critical clearing time (CCT)] and the dynamic transient performance of the system. In order to achieve power angle stability along with the simultaneous regulation of frequency and voltage, the performance of the proposed control scheme after the occurrence of large disturbances is evaluated and compared with a conventional power system stabilizer and a feedback linearizing controller.

Abstract: This paper explores the impact that different network access arrangements have on the capacity factor of non-firm wind generator connections to distribution networks. Active network management (ANM) projects are increasing in application in distribution networks as the need to integrate distributed generation becomes a more serious challenge. An important aspect of ANM is the contractual arrangement of the participating generation developer and network operator parties. These are sometimes referred to as "Principles of Access" (PoA) and deals with the rights of the generator when curtailment of generation output is required to maintain the network within its limits. Currently, a Last in First Off (LIFO) PoA is implemented in most U.K. ANM deployments and is the prevailing PoA in the Orkney ANM scheme. The Orkney network is used in this paper as a case study to analyze different PoA and compare the renewable energy capacity factor (CF) which result from these arrangements. The archival value of this paper is in the application of optimal power flow (OPF) to the PoA analysis challenge, in the quantification of the impact of previously identified PoA and in the conclusions drawn on the implications of different PoA choices for ANM schemes at the current early stage of ANM deployment.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose a distributed electric vehicle (EV) coordination management which exploits the potentials of the bidirectional power flow between the grid and the EV. In the literature, the proposed distributed price-based EV coordination mechanisms aiming to achieve a valley-filling concept consider electric vehicles as mere manageable loads, which are served during valley hours given the EV energy requirements and mobility pattern. In this paper, a distributed EV coordination mechanism is proposed that utilizes 1) the flexibility of EV demand in order to efficiently allocate it during the valley period and hours with high distributed renewable energy production and 2) the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) EV capability in order to minimize the network load variance. The aim of the proposed EV coordination mechanism is to: 1) exploit the synergies between the renewable distributed energy resources (DER) and EV charging needs in order to increase the EV/RES penetration level of the grid without the need for further network investments and 2) exploit the bidirectional EV battery operation for more efficient network operation in terms of voltage profile and network losses. The proposed EV coordination mechanism is assessed through simulations of a realistic rural MV distribution network.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose a distributed electric vehicle (EV) coordination mechanism, which enables the management of the charging/discharging operation of an EV fleet, offering V2G regulation services to support system operation based on a day-ahead scheduling profile generated by an EV aggregator. Initially, a decentralized iterative algorithm is introduced to manage EV charging/discharging schedule aiming to meet the daily mobility energy requirement of an EV fleet with respect to the day-ahead schedule of the EV aggregator. Then, a droop-based control and a novel distributed regulation dispatch algorithm are developed aiming to meet the regulation dispatch signals send to the EV aggregator by the system.

Abstract: Independent system operators (ISOs) of electricity markets solve the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem to plan a secure and economic generation schedule. However, as the size of power systems increases, the current centralized SCUC algorithm could face critical challenges ranging from modeling accuracy to calculation complexity. This paper presents a distributed SCUC (D-SCUC) algorithm to accelerate the generation scheduling of large-scale power systems. In this algorithm, a power system is decomposed into several scalable zones which are interconnected through tie lines. Each zone solves its own SCUC problem and a parallel calculation method is proposed to coordinate individual D-SCUC problems. Several power systems are studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, a chance-constrained system of systems (SoS) based decision-making approach is presented for stochastic scheduling of power systems encompassing active distribution grids. Based on the concept of SoS, the independent system operator (ISO) and distribution companies (DISCOs) are modeled as self-governing systems. These systems collaborate with each other to run the entire power system in a secure and economic manner. Each self-governing system accounts for its local reserve requirements and line flow constraints with respect to the uncertainties of load and renewable energy resources. A set of chance constraints are formulated to model the interactions between the ISO and DISCOs. The proposed model is solved by using analytical target cascading (ATC) method, a distributed optimization algorithm in which only a limited amount of information is exchanged between collaborative ISO and DISCOs. In this paper, a 6-bus and a modified IEEE 118-bus power systems are studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Risk of blackouts is more than expected and must be considered in the power system studies. The interest of this paper is to minimize the blackouts risk during minimizing the costs in probabilistic transmission expansion planning (TEP). In this paper, a long-term reliability analysis, which was developed by self-organized criticality theory, is used in a multi-objective optimization to include risk of blackouts in TEP. The objective functions are costs and expected energy not supplied. Also, a new formulation for calculating transmission operating cost as a part of cost function is proposed. The problem is solved by a multi-objective particle swarm optimization to find an optimal Pareto set from which the decision-maker can choose the most desirable one, regarding existing budget. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 118-bus test system to investigate its applicability and scalability. The results are compared with security-constrained TEP, which uses famous deterministic criterion known as N-1. The proposed approach produces more efficient plans for suppressing cascading blackouts with less network investment. Moreover, the results provide motivation for considering the risk of cascading blackouts in TEP, which afford substantial saving to society.

Abstract: This paper makes use of the idea of prediction intervals (PIs) to capture the uncertainty associated with wind power generation in power systems. Since the forecasting errors cannot be appropriately modeled using distribution probability functions, here we employ a powerful nonparametric approach called lower upper bound estimation (LUBE) method to construct the PIs. The proposed LUBE method uses a new framework based on a combination of PIs to overcome the performance instability of neural networks (NNs) used in the LUBE method. Also, a new fuzzy-based cost function is proposed with the purpose of having more freedom and flexibility in adjusting NN parameters used for construction of PIs. In comparison with the other cost functions in the literature, this new formulation allows the decision-makers to apply their preferences for satisfying the PI coverage probability and PI normalized average width individually. As the optimization tool, bat algorithm with a new modification is introduced to solve the problem. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method are examined using datasets taken from different wind farms in Australia.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of the dynamic behavior of photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems on short-term voltage stability of the transmission system. First, the impact of the fault ride-through capability of a PV model is studied by setting several recovery speeds of the active current output when the operation of the PV system is interrupted because of a voltage sag. The results are analyzed by using transient P-V curves and a stability boundary, which has been proposed in our previous research. Further, we show that the installation of PVs severely impairs the short-term voltage stability if the PVs shut off after a voltage sag, and its recovery speed is low. Next, two countermeasures to control short-term voltage instability phenomena are tested. One is the operation of the PV system at a leading power factor in the normal state, and the other is the dynamic reactive power control by the inverters of the PV system after a voltage sag. Numerical examples are carried out for a one-load infinite-bus power system and a five-machine five-load power system. The results show that these countermeasures can play a substantial role in preventing the voltage instability phenomena caused when a PV system is suddenly interrupted because of a fault.

Abstract: This paper presented a combined scheduling and bidding algorithm for constructing the bidding curve of an electric utility that participated in the day-ahead energy markets. Day-aheadmarket price uncertainty was modeled using non-probabilistic information gap decision theory (IGDT). The considered utility consisted of generation units and a retailer part; the retailer part of the utility and its demand response program (DRP) could affect the utility's profit, which should be considered in the bidding strategy problem. The bidding strategy algorithm proposed in this paper dispatched units by optimizing the demand response programs of the retailer part. In addition, non-decreasing bidding curve was constructed according to the proposed IGDT-based method. Applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated using an illustrative example with 54 thermal units. Results were verified using after-the-fact actual market data.

Abstract: The smart grid technology enables an increasing level of responsiveness on the demand side, facilitating demand serving entities-large consumers and retailers-to procure their electricity needs under the best conditions. Such entities generally exhibit a proactive role in the pool, seeking to procure their energy needs at minimum cost. Within this framework, we propose a mathematical model to help large consumers to derive bidding strategies to alter pool prices to their own benefit. Representing the uncertainty involved, we develop a stochastic complementarity model to derive bidding curves, and show the advantages of such bidding scheme with respect to non-strategic ones.

Abstract: Distribution microgrids are being challenged by reverse power flows and voltage fluctuations due to renewable generation, demand response, and electric vehicles. Advances in photovoltaic (PV) inverters offer new opportunities for reactive power management provided PV owners have the right investment incentives. In this context, reactive power compensation is considered here as an ancillary service. Accounting for the increasing time-variability of distributed generation and demand, a stochastic reactive power compensation scheme is developed. Given uncertain active power injections, an online reactive control scheme is devised. This scheme is distribution-free and relies solely on power injection data. Reactive injections are updated using the Lagrange multipliers of a second-order cone program. Numerical tests on an industrial 47-bus microgrid and the residential IEEE 123-bus feeder corroborate the reactive power management efficiency of the novel stochastic scheme over its deterministic alternative, as well as its capability to track variations in solar generation and household demand.

Abstract: Time-varying renewable energy generation can result in serious under-/over-voltage conditions in future distribution grids. Augmenting conventional utility-owned voltage regulating equipment with the reactive power capabilities of distributed generation units is a viable solution. Local control options attaining global voltage regulation optimality at fast convergence rates is the goal here. In this context, novel reactive power control rules are analyzed under a unifying linearized grid model. For single-phase grids, our proximal gradient scheme has computational complexity comparable to that of the rule suggested by the IEEE 1547.8 standard, but it enjoys well-characterized convergence guarantees. Furthermore, adding memory to the scheme results in accelerated convergence. For three-phase grids, it is shown that reactive power injections have a counter-intuitive effect on bus voltage magnitudes across phases. Nevertheless, when our control scheme is applied to unbalanced conditions, it is shown to reach an equilibrium point. Numerical tests using the IEEE 13-bus, the IEEE 123-bus, and a Southern California Edison 47-bus feeder with increased renewable penetration verify the properties of the schemes and their resiliency to grid topology reconfigurations.

Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for economic dispatch in electric power grids. The method is inspired by statistical inference methods. Using discretized optimization variables, our algorithm finds the globally optimal, single time-step dispatch assignment for radial grids in linear time with respect to the number of network nodes. For such problems, the algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art mixed-integer scheduling, both in run-time and in the allowed complexity of component and line models. Moreover, the necessary computations can be performed in a distributed fashion, facilitating both practical implementation as well as information privacy. Our algorithm is thus optimally suited for the very large dispatch problems that will arise in future smart distribution grids with hosts of small, decentralized, and flexibly controllable prosumers, i.e., entities able to consume and produce electricity.

Abstract: This paper improves the existing Kalman-based technique for detecting electromechanical oscillations using Synchrophasor measurements. The novelty is the utilization of a distributed architecture to extract maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimations of oscillatory parameters. This was achieved by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. To improve initial condition estimation, initial correlation information through a forward backward (FB) Kalman-like particle filter (KLPF) was integrated into the proposed scheme. Performance evaluation was conducted using IEEE New England 39-Bus system and Synchrophasor measurements collected from New Zealand Grid. The proposed method accurately extracted oscillatory parameters when the measurements were contaminated by continuous random small load fluctuations. The method also improved the capability of detecting multiple oscillations with similar frequencies.

Abstract: Lightly damped electromechanical oscillations are major operating concerns if failed to be detected at an early stage. This paper improved the existing extended complex Kalman filter (ECKF) technique of tracking electromechanical oscillations using synchrophasor measurements. The proposed algorithm adopted a distributed architecture for estimating oscillatory parameters from local substations. The novelty lies in handling maximum likelihood (ML) to enhance the convergence property in tracking multiple modes using an expectation maximization (EM) approach. This was achieved by encapsulating the augmented Lagrangian (AL) in the maximization step of the EM algorithm, which utilized a novel ECKF-based smoother (ECKS). Performance evaluations were conducted using IEEE 68-bus system and recorded synchrophasor measurements collected from the New Zealand grid. Random noise variance test cases were generated to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm. To ensure the robustness to random noisy conditions, the algorithm was tested based on exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations. Comparisons were made with the existing Prony analysis (PA), Kalman filter (KF), and distributed EM-based FB-KLPF.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method to dynamically determine coherent generators and electrical areas of an interconnected power system. The proposed method is based on dynamic frequency deviations of both generator and non-generator buses, with respect to the system nominal frequency. The proposed method 1) largely overcomes the limitations of the existing model-based and measurement-based coherency identification methods, 2) enables dynamic tracking of the coherency time-evolution, and 3) provides noise immunity which is imperative in practical implementation. The method also promises the potential for real-time coherency calculation. The proposed method is applied to the 16-machine/68-bus NPCC system based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSS/E platform and the results are compared with those of the classical slow-coherency (model-based) method and a measurement-based method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for online monitoring of subsynchronous oscillations using ambient sensor data from high speed sampling devices such as digital fault recorders (DFRs). Ambient data is continuously available in the form of routine system responses to random load fluctuations. This paper shows the usefulness of ambient data for tracking the frequency, damping ratio and mode shape of torsional modes related to subsynchronous resonance (SSR). Frequency domain decomposition (FDD) and recursive least square (RLS) algorithms are tested for ambient monitoring of SSR modes. IEEE second SSR benchmark model is used as the study system. Nonlinear and linearized equations of this system are analyzed for testing the performance of measurement based methods and to compare their results with respective linearized system modes. It is shown that both electrical and mechanical signals can be used for the SSR monitoring while the torsional modes are more observable in mechanical signals such as generator speeds. In addition to estimating the frequency and damping ratio, torsional mode shapes can be identified by implementing FDD as a multi-dimensional method on the speeds of the masses of the turbine shaft. The algorithms are tested on an archived real system data set from a DFR.

Abstract: This paper aims to evaluate and improve the usefulness of publicly available electricity market prices for real-time optimal dispatching (RTOD) of a privately owned energy storage system (ESS) in a competitive electricity market. The RTOD algorithm seeks to maximize the revenue by exploiting arbitrage opportunities available due to the inter-temporal variation of electricity prices in the day-ahead market. The pre-dispatch prices, issued by the Ontario independent electricity system operator, and the corresponding ex-post hourly Ontario energy prices are employed as the forecast and the actual prices. A compressed-air ESS is sized and employed for evaluations due to its lower capital expenditure and its ability to be positively influenced by the availability of waste heat. First, the conventional RTOD algorithm is developed by formulating a mixed integer linear programming problem. It is demonstrated that the forecast inaccuracy of publicly available market prices significantly reduces the ESS revenue. Then, a new adaptive algorithm is proposed and evaluated which adapts the objective function of the optimization problem online based on historical market prices available before real-time. The outcomes reveal that the proposed adaptive RTOD can significantly increase the ESS revenue compared to the conventional algorithm as well as the back-casting method proposed in prior studies.

Abstract: The trend of integrating more nondispatchable renewable sources into the electric grid and phasing out dispatchable fossil-fueled power plants in the near future reduces the operational flexibility, increases the chance of transmission congestion, and endangers the stability of electric system. Utilities are investigating the application of large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) to address some of these imminent challenges to their power systems. In this paper, the application of privately owned large-scale ESSs for the purpose of congestion relief in transmission systems as an ancillary service is investigated. It is demonstrated that in conventional optimal dispatch algorithms for an ESS, the storage system cannot effectively contribute to congestion relief since the dispatch algorithm has not prepared the ESS in advance. Hence, a new real-time optimal dispatch (RTOD) algorithm is proposed that aims to generate revenue primarily by exploiting electricity price arbitrage opportunities in the day-ahead electricity market while optimally preparing the ESS to maximize its contribution to congestion relief as an ancillary service. A compressed-air ESS is sized and employed for evaluations of the proposed RTOD algorithm. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm are validated using real-world price data from Ontario's wholesale electricity market. An analysis is presented regarding the appropriate amount of financial compensation for the ESS owner due to this contribution to congestion relief in the studied electricity market.

Abstract: This paper presents a model for the microgrid planning problem with uncertain physical and financial information. The microgrid planning problem investigates the economic viability of microgrid deployment and determines the optimal generation mix of distributed energy resources (DERs) for installation. Net metering is considered for exchanging power with the main grid and lowering the cost of unserved energy and DER investments. A robust optimization approach is adopted for considering forecast errors in load, variable renewable generation, and market prices. The microgrid islanding is further treated as a source of uncertainty. The microgrid planning problem is decomposed into an investment master problem and an operation subproblem. The optimal planning decisions determined in the master problem are employed in the subproblem to examine the optimality of the master solution by calculating the worst-case optimal operation under uncertain conditions. Optimality cuts sent to the master problem will govern subsequent iterations. Numerical simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model and further analyze the sensitivity of microgrid planning results on variety levels of uncertainty.

Abstract: Distance relays are immune to inadvertent operation during power swings by a block known as "power swing blocking (PSB)". Its main function is discriminating faults from power swings. However, if a fault occurs during a power swing, PSB should be de-blocked and let the distance relay to operate normally and clear the fault accordingly. Meanwhile, discrimination of a three-phase fault from a power swing is the most difficult task due to their likelihood. This paper proposes a new method to overcome this issue by monitoring the transient period established in the process of current dynamic phasor estimation. In this regard, transient monitor (TM) index, which is the difference between the estimated current samples regenerated from the calculated dynamic phasors and the actual sample values, is used to distinguish the fault from the power swing. Fourier-Taylor transformation is applied to estimate the dynamic phasor of the current signal. Simulation results verify the inherent potential of the proposed method to overcome the issue.

Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally efficient technique for estimating the composite load model parameters based on analytical similarity of parameter sensitivity. When the model parameters are updated in the optimization procedure to best fit the actual load dynamics, i.e., measurements, parameters of similar sensitivity representation in the given mathematical model structure are updated in the same manner at every iterative step. This research allows for practically reducing the number of load model parameters to be identified in the estimation process and the overall computational cost while preserving the desired complexity and accuracy of the original model. This approach consequently facilitates the parameter estimation in the optimization process and helps manage increased number of parameters often criticized for adopting the dynamic composite load model via measurement-based approach. Case studies for the real power system demonstrate the computational efficiency and intact accuracy of the proposed method with reference to the existing methods of estimating all the parameters of the given composite load model independently.

Abstract: This paper presents a modified method for power system transient stability analysis, allowing the reduction of the computational requirements while retaining important system dynamics. The approach formulates the power balance equations depending on the area of interest. The detailed ac model, including full real and reactive power equations, is used for the area in which high accuracy is required, while the simpler dc model, including linear real power equation, is used for more remote areas where real power dynamics dominate. A high level of accuracy can be achieved using the ac model in the area of interest, and computational complexity can be reduced with the less detailed dc model in the remainder of the system. In order to prevent the loss of simulation accuracy, this paper proposes a way to compensate line losses neglected using the dc model. Case studies with the IEEE 118-bus system are provided to validate the performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper describes an analysis of a variable speed heat pump (VSHP), which responds to direct load control (DLC) signals to provide grid frequency regulation (GFR) ancillary service, while ensuring the comfort of building occupants. A data-driven dynamic model of the VSHP is developed through real-time experimental studies with a time horizon ranging from seconds to hours. The model is simple, yet still sufficiently comprehensive to analyze the operational characteristics of the VSHP. The DLC scheme is then experimentally applied to the VSHP to evaluate its demand response (DR) capability. Two control methods are considered for a practical implementation of the DLC-enabled VSHP and a further improvement of the DR capability, respectively. Additionally, a small-signal analysis is carried out using the aggregated dynamic response of a number of DLC-enabled VSHPs to analyze their contribution to GFR in an isolated power grid. For experimental case studies, a laboratory-scale microgrid is then implemented with generator and load emulators. We show that the DLC-enabled VSHP can effectively reduce grid frequency deviations and required reserve capacities of generators.

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic model of a variable speed heat pump (VSHP) in a commercial building that responds to direct load control (DLC) signals, updated every 4 s, for the improvement of grid frequency regulation (GFR). The model is simplified for real-time simulation studies with the time horizon ranging from seconds to hours, but still sufficiently comprehensive to analyze the operational characteristics such as the heat rate and coefficient of performance. A variable speed drive-controlled induction motor model is also established for the adjustment of the VSHP input power. A dynamic model of an experimental room is then developed to estimate the effect of the DLC application to the VSHP on its indoor air temperature for two different cooling systems. Furthermore, small signal analysis is performed to evaluate both the transient response of the DLC-enabled VSHP and its contribution to GFR. Finally, with an isolated microgrid implemented with MATLAB/SIMULINK, simulation studies demonstrate that the VSHP can be effectively exploited as the DLC-enabled load while still ensuring building occupant comfort and long-term device performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a frequency and voltage control strategy for a standalone microgrid with high penetration of intermittent renewable generation systems, which might cause large frequency and voltage deviation in the system due to unpredictable output power fluctuations. To this end, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is suggested for generating the nominal system frequency instead of a synchronous generator, from a frequency control perspective. This makes the system frequency independent of the mechanical inertia of the synchronous generator. However, a BESS has a capacity limitation; a synchronous generator is used to maintain the state of charge (SOC) of the BESS at a certain value. For voltage control, we proposed that a reactive power/active power (Q/P) droop control be added to the conventional reactive power controller. By adding a Q/P droop control, renewable generation acquires a voltage-damping effect, which dramatically alleviates the voltage fluctuation induced by its own output power fluctuation. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy from both frequency and voltage control perspectives.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that machine learning can be used to create effective algorithm selectors that select between power system control algorithms depending on the state of a network, achieving better performance than always using the same algorithm for every state. Also presented is a novel method for creating algorithm selectors that consider two objectives. The method is used to develop algorithm selectors for power flow management algorithms on versions of the IEEE 14- and 57-bus networks, and a network derived from a real distribution network. The selectors choose from within a diverse set of power flow management algorithms, including those based on constraint satisfaction, optimal power flow, power flow sensitivity factors, and linear programming. The network state-based algorithm selectors offer performance benefits over always using the same power flow management algorithm for every state, in terms of minimizing the number of overloads while also minimizing the curtailment applied to generators.

Abstract: DC microgrid provides a viable and more efficient option to cater for DC loads in the building space and, in particular, data centers. This paper investigates the opportunities associated for utilities to optimize industrial demand response for smart AC and DC microgrid environment thus facilitating distribution utility to reduce peak energy on the existing AC distribution system. A load shifting demand side management (DSM) technique is used to shift AC industrial loads in response to time of day (TOD) tariff. Hence, an attempt has been made to study the impact of DSM strategies with optimal shifting of AC devices in the presence of DC microgrid. Simulations are carried out on a practical distribution system having large industrial loads but it has been assumed that the AC distribution system has DC microgrid with renewables and battery storage systems (BSSs). DSM results for AC distribution grid are compared and analyzed with differing DC microgrid set ups, for example with and without battery storage. It has been observed that the DSM strategy with DC microgrid in the presence of solar renewables and battery storage can substantially reduce average energy cost for demand to response and peak load burden on AC distribution utilities.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of renewable energy sources in power system leads to the replacement of conventional power plants (CPPs) and consequently challenges in power system reliability and security are introduced. This study is focused on improving the grid frequency response after a contingency event in the power system with a high penetration of wind power. An energy storage system (ESS) might be a viable solution for providing inertial response and primary frequency regulation. A methodology has been presented here for the sizing of the ESS in terms of required power and energy. It describes the contribution of the ESS to the grid, in terms of inertial constant and droop. The methodology is applied to a 12-bus grid model with high wind power penetration. The estimated ESS size for inertial response and primary frequency regulation services are validated through real-time simulations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ESS can provide the response similar to that provided by the CPPs.

Abstract: It has been recently proven that the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the optimal power flow problem over radial networks is exact under technical conditions such as not including generation lower bounds or allowing load over-satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate the situation where generation lower bounds are present. We show that even for a 2-bus 1-generator system, the SDP relaxation can have all possible approximation outcomes, that is 1) SDP relaxation may be exact, 2) SDP relaxation may be inexact, or 3) SDP relaxation may be feasible while the optimal power flow (OPF) instance may be infeasible. We provide a complete characterization of when these three approximation outcomes occur and an analytical expression of the resulting optimality gap for this 2-bus system. In order to facilitate further research, we design a library of instances over radial networks in which the SDP relaxation has positive optimality gap. Finally, we propose valid inequalities and variable bound tightening techniques that significantly improve the computational performance of a global optimization solver. Our work demonstrates the need of developing efficient global optimization methods for the solution of OPF even in the simple but fundamental case of radial networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach in the modeling of stand-alone microgrids to predict their operational adequacy performance considering uncertainty of energy storage system (ESS), photovoltaic system (PVS) and conventional generator (CG). Instead of using the daily or hourly time step, operating period a minutely time step is considered to incorporate the effect of fast ramp up/down of system components on microgrid operating adequacy through expected energy not supplied (EENS) and expected energy not used (EENU), due to load and resource variations. A time varying state of charge (SOC) model is proposed to determine power output of an ESS in reliability modeling. The reliability of a PVS is modeled in detail based on the total cross-tied configuration (TCTC) of photovoltaic (PV) cells and arrays. The proposed technique and indices will be useful for system planners to select the type and size of microgrid systems that contain alternative energy sources and storage.

Abstract: In this paper, a new scenario-based stochastic optimization framework is proposed for price-maker economic bidding in day-ahead and real-time markets. The presented methodology is general and can be applied to both demand and supply bids. That is, no restrictive assumptions are made on the characteristics of the pool and its agents. However, our focus is on the operation of time-shiftable loads with deadlines, because they play a central role in creating load flexibility and enhancing demand response and peak-load shaving programs. Both basic and complex time-shiftable load types are addressed, where the latter includes time-shiftable loads that are uninterruptible, have per-time-slot consumption limits or ramp constraints, or comprise several smaller time-shiftable subloads. Four innovative analytical steps are presented in order to transform the originally nonlinear and hard-to-solve price-maker economic bidding optimization problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program. Accordingly, the global optimal solutions are found for the price and energy bids within a relatively short amount of computational time. A detailed illustrative case study along with multiple case studies based on the California energy market data are presented. It is observed that the proposed optimal price-maker economic bidding approach outperforms optimal price-maker self-scheduling as well as even-load-distribution.

Abstract: This paper presents a design of a power system damping controller using partial right eigenstructure assignment. The eigenstructure assignment technique selects a set of closed-loop eigenvalues along with their right or left eigenvectors. The selection of eigenvectors offers extra flexibility which is exploited in this paper by designing a robust damping controller which provides the required damping under multiple operating conditions. A multi-input controller is used to increase the degrees of freedom available for the design. Remote measurements available from synchronised phasor measurements are also considered. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem and solved using the nonlinear simplex function in MATLAB. The proposed technique is used to design a robust power system stabilizer for the interconnected New England New York simplified power system model. Four contingencies are selected as additional operating conditions. The designed controller is validated using a nonlinear simulation.

Abstract: Significant uncertainty surrounds the future development of electricity systems, primarily in terms of size, location and type of new renewable generation to be connected. In this paper we assess the potential for flexible network technologies, such as phase-shifting transformers, and non-network solutions, such as energy storage and demand-side management, to constitute valuable interim measures within a long-term planning strategy. The benefit of such flexible assets lies not only in the transmission services provided but also in the way they can facilitate and de-risk subsequent decisions by deferring commitment to capital-intensive projects until more information on generation development becomes available. A novel stochastic formulation for transmission expansion planning is presented that includes consideration of investment in these flexible solutions. The proposed framework is demonstrated with a case study on the IEEE-RTS where flexible technologies are shown to constitute valuable investment options when facing uncertainties in future renewable generation development.

Abstract: Utilities continually investigate ways to optimize the utilization of their existing plant and improve their network's flexibility and resiliency to future uncertainties. With respect to overhead lines (OHL), smart grid solutions aim to increase adequacy through the implementation of probabilistic thermal rating (PTR), dynamic thermal rating (DTR) or novel high temperature low sag (HTLS) conductor technologies. At present, the risks related to these particular solutions, both for the OHL plant and the power network, are not quantified. This paper presents a novel methodology for power network reliability evaluation which integrates a network level sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with a detailed modeling of OHL. This integration facilitates a holistic evaluation of power network reliability as it considers the properties of OHL design technologies and their associated ageing risks. As a result, the network performance (adequacy) and plant risks (ageing) introduced by increased OHL capacities through PTR, DTR, and HTLS solutions can be objectively quantified. An application of the methodology is demonstrated using the IEEE-RTS 96 network which is assessed considering PTR-based OHL capacities.

Abstract: In recent years, the penetration of renewable resources in electrical power systems has increased. These renewable resources add more complexities to power system operations, due to their intermittent nature. As a result, operators must acquire additional reserves in order to maintain reliability. However, one persistent challenge is to determine the optimal location of reserves and this challenge is exacerbated by the inability to predict key transmission bottlenecks due to this added uncertainty. This paper presents robust corrective topology control as a congestion management tool to manage power flows and the associated renewable uncertainty. The proposed day-ahead method determines the maximum uncertainty in renewable resources in terms of do-not-exceed limits combined with corrective topology control. The day-ahead topology control formulation is based on the direct current optimal power flow; therefore, topology control solutions obtained from these algorithms are tested for AC feasibility and system stability. The numerical results provided are based on the IEEE-118 bus test case and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) test system.

Abstract: This study develops an open-source 8-zone test system for teaching, training, and research purposes that is based on ISO New England structural attributes and data. The test system models an ISO-managed wholesale power market populated by a mix of generating companies and load-serving entities that operates through time over an 8-zone AC transmission grid. The modular extensible architecture of the test system permits a wide range of sensitivity studies to be conducted. To illustrate the capabilities of the test system, we report energy cost-savings outcomes for a comparative study of stochastic versus deterministic DAM security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) formulations under systematically varied reserve requirement levels for the deterministic formulation.

Abstract: In this paper, a technique for designing fixed parameter decentralized power system stabilizers (PSSs) for interconnected power systems is proposed. In the proposed method, local information available at each machine in the multimachine environment, is used to tune parameters of PSS. Conventional design techniques such as P-Vr frequency response approaches, and the method of residues are based on complete system information, wherein phase angles of residues are consistent with the P-Vr phase response and can be used with confidence for design purposes. It is shown that magnitude and phase information of the proposed GEP TF agrees closely with that of P-Vr TF and yields a robust stabilizer. Nonlinear simulation and eigenvalue analysis show the efficacy of the proposed stabilizer to damp out the interarea and local modes of oscillations effectively over a wide range of operating conditions. Superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional approaches is demonstrated with simulation studies on two widely used multimachine systems.

Abstract: Identification of optimal locations to deploy the phasor measurement units (PMUs) is a preliminary task in wide area monitoring and control of power systems. Given the cost and other associated restrictions, it is highly unlikely for any utility to install all the required number of PMUs to ensure the complete observability of the network. This necessitates judicious identification of locations in the network to deploy the PMUs. Ideally, the choice of location must depend on the intended purpose. In this paper, an approach for placement of PMUs considering both the stability and topological aspects is presented. First, a probabilistic framework based on proximity to instability is proposed to rank the generators/load buses in the order of vulnerability. Subsequently, a binary integer linear programming formulation is proposed to identify the optimal locations considering both stability and topological aspects. The optimal locations obtained using the proposed approach ensures a priori observability of most vulnerable buses in addition to enhancing the network observability. Results on IEEE 39-bus system and 246-bus equivalent system of Indian southern grid are presented to illustrate the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a new under-frequency load shedding technique based on the combination of random and fixed priority of loads. It has been observed that placing all of the loads in the distribution system with fixed priority results in un-optimum load shedding. On the other hand, designing the load priority with a combination of random and fixed priority provides the technique with some sort of flexibility in achieving the optimal load shedding. The validation of the proposed scheme on different scenarios proves that the proposed technique is capable of achieving the optimal load shedding and recovering frequency to nominal value without any overshoot.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic multiplier-based Lagrangian relaxation approach for the solution to multi-area economic dispatch (MAED) in a fully decentralized manner. Dynamic multipliers refer to the multipliers associated with power balance equations at tie-line buses in each area. Dynamic multipliers can be approximated as linear functions of tie-line power exports via sensitivity analysis and can serve as the equivalent supply/demand functions to neighboring areas. In contrast to the conventional static point-wise multiplier, which is unable to reflect the marginal cost change that results from variations in the power exchange level, the proposed dynamic multiplier provides each area the look-ahead capability to foresee the range of the marginal cost for power export over a range of tie-line exchange variations. In turn, this allows for a significantly faster convergence to the global optimal solution. The algorithm is also shown to be early termination friendly, which is very desirable in practice for ultra-large systems such as the State Grid of China. Numerical examples in a 6-bus system, a 3-area 354-bus IEEE system, and large test systems illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: We present a new formulation of a hybrid stochastic- robust optimization and use it to calculate a look-ahead, security-constrained optimal power flow. It is designed to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by efficiently accommodating renewable energy sources and by realistically evaluating system changes that could reduce emissions. It takes into account ramping costs, CO2 damages, demand functions, reserve needs, contingencies, and the temporally linked probability distributions of stochastic variables such as wind generation. The inter-temporal trade-offs and transversality of energy storage systems are a focus of our formulation. We use it as part of a new method to comprehensively estimate the operational net benefits of system changes. Aside from the optimization formulation, our method has four other innovations. First, it statistically estimates the cost and CO2 impacts of each generator's electricity output and ramping decisions. Second, it produces a comprehensive measure of net operating benefit, and disaggregates that into the effects on consumers, producers, system operators, government, and CO2 damage. Third and fourth, our method includes creating a novel, modified Ward reduction of the grid and a thorough generator dataset from publicly available information sources. We then apply this method to estimating the impacts of wind power, energy storage, and operational policies.

Abstract: As the number of renewable energy generation units and, consequently, solid-state based converters increases in the power grid, many power electronics concepts should be integrated into power system analysis and design. Thus, a power laboratory course with emphasis on the nexus between power electronics and power system is desired. However, the flexibility of instructors in designing a wide range of educational experiments is limited by the use of specialized educational setups. This problem can be resolved by allowing students to assemble their setups using laboratory scaled-down devices; however, implementation times can limit students to focus on the main concepts of the experiments. In particular, lacking experience with hardware description languages to develop switching patterns and control schemes for solid-state based converters further increases the implementation times. In this paper, a technique for rapidly implementing switching patterns and control schemes for power converters is proposed. This technique provides an easy-to-use laboratory allowing students to focus on reinforcing the theory learned in energy conversion, motor-drive, power electronics, and power system classes while still providing instructors with the flexibility to design a wide range of educational experiments.

Abstract: Long-term transmission and generation planning face numerous challenges to accommodate the integration of a high penetration of variable generation (VG). System flexibility, or the ability of a system to meet changes in demand and VG production, is one such issue receiving much attention. This paper presents a methodology to assess the flexibility of a power system while explicitly considering the limitations of the transmission network. By determining only the flexibility available from resources which could be realized in real-time operation due to transmission constraints, a more realistic assessment of a system's flexibility can be made. The flexibility of the IEEE Reliability Test System is assessed using two metrics. Transmission is shown to have a significant effect on the availability of flexibility and the risk posed to the system by net load ramps. The impact is seen to be strongly dependent on the variability of the net load and on the distribution of online resources. A nonlinear relationship between the installed VG and system flexibility is found, with regions of significant inflexibility occurring at certain VG penetrations.

Abstract: The power grid is a critical infrastructure that must be protected against potential threats. While modern technologies at the center of the ongoing smart grid evolution increase its operational efficiency, they also make it more susceptible to malicious attacks such as false data injection to electronic monitoring systems. This paper presents a game-theoretic approach to smart grid security by combining quantitative risk management techniques with decision making on protective measures. The consequences of data injection attacks are quantified using a risk assessment process where the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure provides an estimate of the defender's loss due to load shed in simulated scenarios. The calculated risks are then incorporated into a stochastic security game model as input parameters. The decisions on defensive measures are obtained by solving the game using dynamic programming techniques which take into account resource constraints. Thus, the formulated security game provides an analytical framework for choosing the best response strategies against attackers and minimizing potential risks. The theoretical results obtained are demonstrated through numerical examples. Simulation results show that different risk measures lead to different defense strategies, but the CVaR measure prioritizes high-loss tail events.

Abstract: IEC 61850 and IEC 61970-301 (CIM) are core standards in the electrical power domain. IEC 61850 is concerned with control and protection in a substation, while CIM addresses power management. There has been a great attention to unifying these standards to support interoperability in smart grids. However, due to their difference natures and independent evolution, the unification of IEC 61850 and CIM has been a great challenge. A prerequisite to their unification is unifying data types. In this paper, we present an approach for unifying data types of IEC 61850 and CIM. In the approach, the semantics of all the data types in the standards are analyzed to identify matching and non-matching types. Based on the analysis, data types are unified by applying a set of unification principles. We demonstrate tool support for transforming IEC 61850 and CIM data types to unified data types using Query/View/Transformation (QVT).

Abstract: Measuring the efficiency of power plant systems requires capturing fluctuations in the level of sales to customers as well as accounting for the effects of regulatory caps on emissions. This study proposes a novel effectiveness measure considering desirable outputs and undesirable outputs via data envelopment analysis (DEA). The new measure complements typical efficiency measures. We test the validity of the proposed measure with an empirical case study of the fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We find that the current interregional electricity transmission plan increases 8.56% in effectiveness. For the emissions control, we suggest a 9.8% reduction in electricity generation towards an effective production frontier. We conclude that the proposed effectiveness measure's ability to distinguish sales and regulation effects from typical productive efficiency eliminates the bias often found in currently used measures.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple method for voltage stability assessment by reducing the bus impedance matrix of a network into its two-bus equivalent model at a referred bus. Closed-form equations of the equivalent model could then be derived to facilitate an equivalent nodal analysis at the referred bus to determine its voltage stability limit. The method was also shown to have parallels with the well-accepted modal analysis of the Jacobian matrix. These include defining geometric indices to identify critical buses and participation factors to quantify contribution of network elements to their criticality. The method however does not require post power flow solution processing of the Jacobian matrix; such computational advantage may make it suitable for online applications. The IEEE 300-bus system was tested with the method which was shown to be valid and computationally robust and efficient.

Abstract: A microgrid can be a useful entity to support stable and efficient operation of power systems with large-scale penetration of distributed generators. Suppose that a microgrid should provide reserve operation in a decentralized environment; determining a suitable reserve capacity becomes an important problem for reliable and economic operation. To address this problem, in this paper we present a method of determining the optimal reserve capacity under the power exchange for frequency control (PXFC) market environment. After creating some penalty rules that take microgrid islanding into account, determining the optimal reserve capacity is formulated as an optimization problem. Microgrid islanding probability (MIP) is proposed as an index to describe the likelihood of microgrid islanding. The effectiveness of the method in terms of the operating cost is investigated using simulations, where our method and two further methods are applied to microgrids with different generation capabilities. The properties of MIP are also demonstrated by the simulations.

This paper shows that ac-feasibility, i.e., to find whether some generator dispatch can satisfy a given demand, is NP-hard for tree networks.

Abstract: Unit commitment (UC) is one of the core problems in short-term power generation scheduling and electricity market clearing. The problem is generally formulated as a mixed integer programming model that is computationally complex for large sized systems. Introducing valid inequalities (VIs) is an effective method to improve the computational efficiency. Recently the analytical necessary conditions for determining feasible commitment states are reported in literature, which provides an opportunity to form VIs for UC. In this paper, we equivalently convert the nonlinear necessary conditions into a group of linear inequalities by analyzing the problem structure, and add them to the original UC formulation as VIs. In the branch-and-cut framework, these VIs can quickly identify a large percentage of infeasible nodes and thus reduce the scale of the search tree. They can also assist in forming effective cuts to speed up the branch-and-cut process. A procedure of selecting the most effective VIs is developed to further improve the computational performance. Numerical results based on three testing systems show that the VIs added can significantly improve the computational efficiency in most cases.

Abstract: This paper presents a damping control to mitigate sub-synchronous interactions (SSI) in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines connected to series-compensated lines. This issue has gained attention due to the recent SSI phenomena reported in DFIG wind farms located near series capacitors. Two approaches which add a supplementary damping control signal are compared: one of them, integrated to the grid-side converter, and the other one, to the rotor-side converter. The SSI damping controls are designed using a multi-input multi-output state-space methodology. This allows to easily tune a high performance controller using several measurements and control inputs. Small- and large-signal stability analyses, robustness aspects, impact of the supplementary controls on the system modes, and influence of different operating conditions on the SSI are also discussed. The obtained results show that the supplementary control is able to properly damp the sub-synchronous oscillations of DFIG wind turbines by updating the existing DFIG control systems without the inclusion of expensive additional damping devices, and reducing the risk of wind generation tripping.

Abstract: With the popularization of electric vehicles (EVs), the influence on power systems is receiving increasing attention. According to statistics, EVs are in a parking state for more than 90% of the time, thus, the electric energy of the EVs accumulated by aggregators can be used to support the operation of power systems. This paper takes reducing operation costs as the objective function and considers the constraints of EVs and power systems to establish the optimal charging/discharging control of electric vehicles, which meet the operational safety of power systems and convenient driving. The influence on operation costs, peak load, and loss for the proposed charging/discharging two-way control, charging-only control, and free charging modes of EVs are compared. The influence of battery charging and discharging efficiency on these results is also discussed in this paper.

Abstract: We present a computationally efficient mixed-integer program (MIP) that determines optimal generator expansion decisions, as well as periodic unit commitment and dispatch. The model is applied to analyze the impact of increasing wind power capacity on the optimal generation mix and the profitability of thermal generators. In a case study, we find that increasing wind penetration reduces energy prices while the prices for operating reserves increase. Moreover, scarcity pricing for operating reserves through reserve shortfall penalties significantly impacts the prices and profitability of thermal generators. Without scarcity pricing, no thermal units are profitable, however scarcity pricing can ensure profitability for peaking units at high wind penetration levels. Capacity payments can also ensure profitability, but the payments required for baseload units to break even increase with the amount of wind power. The results indicate that baseload units are most likely to experience revenue sufficiency problems when wind penetration increases and new baseload units are only developed when natural gas prices are high and wind penetration is low.

Abstract: The small-signal stability analysis of power systems concerns the critical modes as well as the modes associated with a physical meaning, e.g., the interarea oscillation modes for weakly connected systems and the modes sensitive to a particular parameter. As the order of the power-system state matrix increases, it becomes more difficult to determine these modes. In this paper, a method is proposed to compute the interarea oscillation modes of large-scale power systems. The deviation in the active power of the transmission section is selected to identify the interarea oscillation modes. Then, the two-sided Jacobi-Davidson method combined with this selection is employed to compute these modes. Participation factors are used to separate the electromechanical oscillation modes. Numerical tests show that the proposed method is valid and efficient.

Abstract: This paper investigates a procedure of coordinated tuning of power system decentralized damping controllers based on reduced-order model (ROM). In the paper, the cross-gramian technique is applied to obtain an equivalent ROM for power systems. Once the controllers' locations are selected appropriately, the critical modes are approximated well in the reduced model. The controllers are designed on ROM using search algorithm and then tested on the unreduced system to demonstrate their availability. The benefit of adopting ROM is to decrease the complexity of objective function computation. The proposed method is tested on power systems with 4-machine and 156-machine to validate its efficiency.

Abstract: Time-delay exists widely in electric power systems, and is found to have significant effect on the performance of operation and control under certain conditions. It is shown that even a very small delay may destabilize the power system. Therefore, time-delay is of important concern and should be properly handled, especially in the wide-area measurement and control environment. However, only few results about the controller design for power system considering multiple time-delays are reported. In this paper, a multiple time-delayed power system model is constructed with power system stabilizer (PSS) considering time-delays. By using Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, two H-infinity control schemes are developed for time-varying multiple delayed systems. The proposed controllers guarantee the closed-loop system asymptotic stable with H-infinity performance. A two-area four-machine power system and the New England 10-machine 39-bus system are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methods. The simulation results verify that the designed controllers can improve the control performance significantly.

Abstract: Generating representative scenarios of wind power time series to reflect its stochastic characteristic is important for power system planning and operation. However, there is no comprehensive model to optimize the space and moment distances between original and generated scenarios simultaneously, which deteriorates the quality of generated scenarios. This letter proposes an optimal model to minimize the space and moment distances simultaneously and proposes a heuristic search method (HS) to solve it. Simulation results show that scenarios generated by the proposed model have better ability to approximate the original scenarios set both in moment distance and space distance than the traditional optimization model. Meanwhile, the HS method is much faster than the traditional backward/forward reduction methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a mathematical model of the multi-objective reactive power optimization (MORPO) problem in an ac-dc hybrid power system. To get an evenly distributed set of Pareto solutions of this MORPO problem throughout a whole day, we propose a piecewise normalized normal constraint (PNNC) method. Based on this method, the Pareto frontier is divided into four arcs so that the fluctuation of angle between the tangent line at each Pareto point and its sub-Utopia line is reduced. By doing so, the original MORPO problem is transformed into four sets of single objective optimization problems, which can be solved efficiently by a nonlinear primal-dual interior-point method. Performance of the PNNC method is tested on a real ac-dc interconnection system. The results demonstrate that it has the capability to generate a more evenly distributed set of Pareto solutions when compared with the normalized normal constraint (NNC) and weighted sum (WS) methods. In addition, a fuzzy-based membership value assignment method is employed to derive 96 optimal compromise solutions corresponding to 96 time periods in a whole day; the numerical outcomes show that a saving in active power loss and an improvement in the voltage profile can be gained simultaneously.

Abstract: Information framework of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) and the essential characteristics of coordinated reactive power optimization (RPO) in multi-area large-scale power systems are introduced in this paper. We consider that the change of optimal solutions (control settings) cannot be captured by simply using an equality constraint of the boundary values as which the voltages at boundary buses and power flows in tie lines are referred to. While many previous methods were proposed by using change of the boundary values to evaluate the change of optimal solutions, which might lead to failure in convergence, this paper puts forward a coordination strategy according to the correspondence between optimal solutions and boundary values based on a probing mechanism. This method is applied to a 472-bus power system; the simulation results show that the RPO scheme based on this strategy has strong convergence capability and high efficiency. Moreover, the proposed coordination strategy allows the transmission system operators (TSOs) to choose objective function and optimization algorithm independently.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel contribution factor (CF) approach to predict diversified daily peak load of low voltage (LV) substations. The CF for each LV template developed in part I of the paper is determined by a novel method-clusterwise weighted constrained regression (CWCR). It takes into account the contribution from different customer classes to substation peaks, respecting the natural difference in time and magnitude between LV substation peaks and the variance within the templates. In CWCR, intercept and coefficients are constrained to ensure that the resultant coefficients do not lead to reverse load flow and can respect zero-load substations. Cross validation is developed to validate the stability of the proposed method and prevent over fitting. The proposed method shows significant improvement in the accuracy of peak estimation over the current status quo across 800 substations of different mixes of domestic, industrial and commercial (I&C) customers. The work in the two parts of the paper is particularly useful for understanding the capabilities of LV networks to accommodate the increasing penetration of low carbon technologies without large-scale monitoring.

Abstract: In order to improve low voltage (LV) network visibility without extensive monitoring and integrate low carbon technologies (LCTs) in a cost-effective manner, this paper proposes a novel three-stage network load profiling method. It uses real-time information monitored from selective representative areas to develop network templates. The three stages are: clustering, classification and scaling. It can be used to identify the loading conditions of unmonitored LV systems with similar fixed data to those monitored LV substations. In the clustering stage, hierarchical clustering and K-means are used to cluster substations into groups based on the shape of the monitored load profiles. The classification tool designed with multinomial logistic regression maps an unmonitored LV substation into the most probable templates by using routinely available fixed data. Finally, clusterwise weighted constrained regression is employed to estimate peak for individual LV substations and the developed templates. The three-stage profiling is demonstrated on a practical system in the U.K. under the umbrella of a smart grid trail project. Ten LV templates are developed by using the metered data from 800 monitored LV substations. A comprehensive comparison between the estimated peaks using the three-stage process and the metered peaks suggests that the methodology can achieve superior accuracy. This is part I of the paper, introducing clustering and classification. The scaling (peak estimation) process will be introduced in part II of the paper.

Abstract: In this paper, a new ensemble forecasting model for short-term load forecasting (STLF) is proposed based on extreme learning machine (ELM). Four important improvements are used to support the ELM for increased forecasting performance. First, a novel wavelet-based ensemble scheme is carried out to generate the individual ELM-based forecasters. Second, a hybrid learning algorithm blending ELM and the Levenberg-Marquardt method is proposed to improve the learning accuracy of neural networks. Third, a feature selection method based on the conditional mutual information is developed to select a compact set of input variables for the forecasting model. Fourth, to realize an accurate ensemble forecast, partial least squares regression is utilized as a combining approach to aggregate the individual forecasts. Numerical testing shows that proposed method can obtain better forecasting results in comparison with other standard and state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This two-part paper considers the coordination of a population of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) with unknown parameters to achieve group objectives. The problem involves designing the bidding and market clearing strategy to motivate self-interested users to realize efficient energy allocation subject to a peak energy constraint. The companion paper (Part I) formulates the problem and proposes a load coordination framework using the mechanism design approach. To address the unknown parameters, Part II of this paper presents a joint state and parameter estimation framework based on the expectation maximization algorithm. The overall framework is then validated using real-world weather data and price data, and is compared with other approaches in terms of aggregated load response. Simulation results indicate that our coordination framework can effectively improve the operational efficiency of the distribution system and reduce power congestion at key times.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the coordination of a population of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) with unknown parameters to achieve group objectives. The problem involves designing the device bidding and market clearing strategies to motivate self-interested users to realize efficient energy allocation subject to a peak energy constraint. This coordination problem is formulated as a mechanism design problem, and we propose a mechanism to implement the social choice function in dominant strategy equilibrium. The proposed mechanism consists of a novel bidding and clearing strategy that incorporates the internal dynamics of TCLs in the market mechanism design, and we show it can realize the team optimal solution. This paper is divided into two parts. Part I presents a mathematical formulation of the problem and develops a coordination framework using the mechanism design approach. Part II presents a learning scheme to account for the unknown load model parameters, and evaluates the proposed framework through realistic simulations.

Abstract: The use of phasor angle measurements provided by phasor measurement units (PMUs) in fault detection is regarded as a promising method in identifying locations of power line outages. However, communication errors or system malfunctions may introduce errors to the measurements and thus yield bad data. Most of the existing methods on line outage identification fail to consider such error. This paper develops a framework for identifying multiple power line outages based on the PMUs' measurements in the presence of bad data. In particular, we design an algorithm to identify locations of line outage and recover the faulty measurements simultaneously. The proposed algorithm does not require any prior information on the number of line outages and the noise variance. Case studies carried out on test systems of different sizes validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Interconnection wide electric transmission system has been envisioned to facilitate the growth of renewable energy, enhance reliability, improve system operating efficiency, and reduce emissions. In this paper, we propose an explicit planning approach for transmission design at the national level. It has been applied to the U.S. system to design transmission overlays for multiple future generation scenarios. Associated simulation results suggest that a national transmission overlay provides economic, environmental, and system performance benefits.

Abstract: An efficient parallel Krylov-Schur method is proposed for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors related with oscillating modes of low damping for large-scale power systems. Improved restarting techniques are explained and demonstrated in details, which focus on a refined selection of kept subspace in contraction and a reliable mechanism of no missing target eigenvalues. Cayley and shift-invert transforms are used to de-couple the computation of eigen-analysis and enable the proposed parallelization with a master-slave scheme. Based on the improved restarting techniques, the strategy for adaptive allocation of shifts and the coordination of parallel computing tasks, the proposed method is capable of computing a large number of eigen-pairs with satisfactory accuracy, convergence rate and parallel acceleration. The computational efficiency is validated by three test cases from real-world large-scale power systems on a symmetric multi-processing (SMP) computer.

Abstract: This letter proposes a concept of the downside risk (DR) for the study of probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) with wind power integrated. It aims to obtain optimal dispatch solutions with the minimal expectation of generation cost and the minimal downside risk. This risk is manifested by semi-variance (semi-deviation) of generation cost in a uncertain environment of wind power. The downside risk constrained POPF is then solved via a multi-objective optimization algorithm in a numerical experiment to capture the trade off between the expected generation cost and the downside risk.

Abstract: This paper presents the nonlinear interval optimization (NIO) model to solve optimal power system dispatch (OPSD) with uncertain wind power integrated. In this model, not only the average of the dispatching objective, but its deviation are also taken into account. Therefore, the NIO model based on OPSD is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. An optimization algorithm, group search optimizer with multiple producers (GSOMP) is applied to obtain Pareto solutions, which show the tradeoff relationship between the average and deviation of the dispatching objective. Then, a decision-making method, the evidential reasoning (ER) approach, is applied to determine the final dispatch solution. Simulation results based on the modified IEEE 30-bus system prove the applicability and effectiveness of the NIO model to deal with the OPSD, considering the integration of the uncertain wind power.

Abstract: Large-scale wind farms are typically geographically separated from load centers and distributed in different control areas. Therefore, interregional energy dispatch is important for wind power generation via sharing spinning reserve capacity among interconnected systems. However, existing tie-line scheduling methods in China do not provide satisfactory performance in accommodating the recent large-scale integration of wind power. In this paper, we describe a coordination framework for tie-line scheduling and power dispatch to operate multi-area systems. Tie-line flows are updated hourly to hedge uncertainty in the near future, preserving the operational independence of areas. The coordinated tie-line scheduling problem is formulated using two-stage adaptive robust optimization to account for uncertainties in the available wind power and is solved using a column-and-constraint generation method in a coordinate-and-decentralize manner. Comparative simulations show that the method is effective in enabling further wind power penetration and can improve economic efficiency in multi-area systems. A case study using a large-scale power system demonstrates the benefits and scalability of the method in practice.

Abstract: Unsatisfiable transmission constraints (UTCs) may lead to failures in look-ahead dispatch. Hence, the detection of UTCs is a critical issue in power systems, and it may also aid in the discovery of unavailable transmission resources in online look-ahead dispatch. The Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm is a rapid and efficient approach to solving look-ahead dispatch (LD) problems; however, it does not readily handle infeasible problems. Here, we describe criteria and procedures for detecting infeasible LD and for locating and addressing UTCs via an LR framework. The proposed procedures for detecting infeasibility and locating unsatisfiability are incorporated into a conventional LR framework to develop an enhanced LR solution framework without affecting the original computational efficiency. Numerical simulations are carried out using an IEEE 24-bus system, 31-bus system, and several large-scale power systems; the results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the methods.

Abstract: Fluctuations in wind power in geographically distributed areas are typically complementary, and therefore a coordinated multi-area dynamic economic dispatch may enable greater wind power penetration in interconnected power systems. Here we describe a decentralized approach based on a modified generalized Benders decomposition in which locally optimal cost function of each area is introduced. The technique exhibits rapid convergence and does not require parameter tuning. It is suitable for multi-area interconnected systems with a hierarchical control architecture. Comparative numerical simulations demonstrate that the performance of our method is favorable in terms of accuracy, convergence and computational efficiency. A case study on a real power system is also carried out to demonstrate the potential of this technique to increase wind power penetration.

Abstract: In future smart grids, with distribution networks having loops more frequently, current transmission contingency analysis (TCA) which usually neglects the distribution power flow variations after a contingency may leave out severe outages. With more distribution management systems deployed on the distribution side, a new transmission CA method based on global power flow (GPF) analysis which integrates both the transmission and distribution power flow is proposed in this paper (named as GTCA) to address the problem. The definition and new features of GTCA are first introduced. Then, the necessity of GTCA is physically illustrated. Difference in the results of GTCA and TCA is mathematically analyzed. A GPF-embedded algorithm of performing GTCA is then provided. The data exchange process and the performance with communication interruptions are discussed. As multiple contingencies are considered in GTCA, several approaches are proposed and discussed to reduce communication burdens and improve the computational efficiency. Plenty of numerical tests are performed in several systems to verify the theoretical analysis. With theoretical analysis and numerical verification, it is suggested that GTCA should be performed instead of TCA to avoid potential false alarms, especially in the condition that DNs are more frequently looped in the future smart grids.

Abstract: As traditional transmission contingency screening (TCS) methods neglect impacts of distribution grids, the contingency selection result may not be always satisfactory, especially when distribution networks are more frequently looped in a smart grid. Two new contingency screening methods considering impacts of distribution grids are proposed in this letter. The first one is based on global power flow, and the second only utilizes distribution network equivalencing. Numerical tests show both new methods can give more reliable results than TCS.

Abstract: An unobservable false data injection (FDI) attack on AC state estimation (SE) is introduced and its consequences on the physical system are studied. With a focus on understanding the physical consequences of FDI attacks, a bi-level optimization problem is introduced whose objective is to maximize the physical line flows subsequent to an FDI attack on DC SE. The maximization is subject to constraints on both attacker resources (size of attack) and attack detection (limiting load shifts) as well as those required by DC optimal power flow (OPF) following SE. The resulting attacks are tested on a more realistic non-linear system model using AC state estimation and ACOPF, and it is shown that, with an appropriately chosen sub-network, the attacker can overload transmission lines with moderate shifts of load.

Abstract: Load-damping characteristic models the load response to the frequency deviation, which has important impact on system frequency response. The load-damping coefficient is normally considered as a constant, obtained from operational experiences in large-scale power systems or from detailed load models in isolated power systems. An industrial isolated power system for aluminum production driven by coal-fired power and large scale wind power is studied in this paper. Since the electrolytic aluminum load is driven by direct current, it is one type of voltage-sensitive load and does not respond to the frequency deviation. This paper proposes a load-damping characteristic control method for such isolated industrial power system with voltage-sensitive load. To decrease the maximum frequency deviation during transient process, a time-varying load-damping coefficient control scheme is presented. Simulation is done on real-time digital simulator (RTDS) and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control method to coordinate multiple energy storage systems (ESS) spread across an AC microgrid. Each storage unit controls its own local node voltage (i.e., where the storage is connected in the network) as well as a global node voltage (i.e., a remote location in the network) that is controlled by all ESSs together. The storage power output is controlled in a way that the node voltage is restored and maintained in case it drops or rises outside the predefined limits. This can occur due to disturbances, such as load changes, loss of distributed generators (DGs), or power limitations in the DGs. In order to determine the power reference for each storage unit, a state of charge (SoC) based adaptive deadband droop control is used. In this decentralized control, the storage power output is inversely proportional to its SoC. By using this approach, the ESS with higher SoC will inject more power whereas storage units with lower SoC will inject less power, leading to more balanced SoC levels among the ESSs. The controller is tested in a microgrid in both island-and grid-connected modes in different scenarios. The microgrid includes several DGs that operate in different control modes depending on the microgrid operation. The storage unit configurations differ in their response time and capacity. This has significant implication in dynamic response of the storage units which is scrutinized in this paper with time-domain simulation.

Abstract: Electric power systems can display a range of undesirable dynamic phenomena by which acceptable, stable operation may be lost. Quasi-steady-state operational problems such as the voltage instability phenomena are among these. Ill-conditioning of the power flow, reflected in high sensitivity of bus voltage magnitudes to load variation is an often observed precursor to such quasi-steady state operational problems. Motivated by this insight, work here will propose a voltage stability and conditioning monitor that is model-free in real-time, based solely on phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, arguing that such an approach is well suited to near-real-time application. We review model-dependent singular value analysis in voltage stability assessment, and relate these existing approaches to our proposed model-free method in real-time application. The proposed algorithm is first applied under the idealized assumption of full measurement data at all buses. This work then extends the algorithm to apply in the more practical case for which only subset of buses have available measurement data. The proposed approach is illustrated in IEEE test cases, augmented to include heavy load conditions that stress voltage stability. Algorithms for efficient computation of small numbers of singular values, as well as means to exploit low-rank updates in data, are reviewed to demonstrate opportunities for fast computation that allow these SVD methods to operate in near-real-time in large systems.

Abstract: This letter proposes a two-layer active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method with the compensation of estimated equivalent input disturbances (EID) for load frequency control (LFC) of multi-area interconnected power system. This method has a capability of rejecting the effects of random load variations and parameter uncertainties, and guaranteeing high dynamic performance. The state-space model of LFC system is established. Then a full-order generalized state observer (GSO) is employed in ADRC system to estimate EID. A stability condition is derived based on the small-gain theory. Simulation results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method, by comparing with traditional one.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) as distributed storage devices have the potential to provide frequency regulation services due to the fast adjustment of charging/discharging power. In our previous research, decentralized vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control methods for EVs were proposed to participate in primary frequency control. In this paper, our attention is on bringing a large number of EVs into the centralized supplementary frequency regulation (SFR) of interconnected power systems. An aggregator is the coordinator between EVs and the power system control center. The aggregator calculates the total frequency regulation capacity (FRC) and expected V2G (EV2G) power of EVs based on the data communicated between the aggregator and individual EVs or EV charging stations. With FRC and EV2G power, a V2G control strategy is proposed for the aggregator to dispatch regulation requirements to EVs and EV charging stations. In individual EV charging stations, the FRC is calculated on the basis of the V2G power at present time, and EV2G power is presented considering both frequency regulation and charging demands. Besides, V2G control strategies are developed to distribute regulation requirements to each EV. Simulations on an interconnected power grid based on a practical power grid in China have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a reliability evaluation method for a tidal power generation system ( TPGS) with a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The key to the method is the modeling of the tidal current speed-dependent failure rates of the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC). The models for calculating the rotor currents through the RSC and GSC and the rotor current state related failure rates are presented. Based on the Wake by distribution of tidal current speed, a multistate discrete probability distribution technique for rotor current is developed. Case studies are described using tidal current speed data from four coastal sites in North America. The results indicate that the failure rates of the RSC, GSC, and the entire TPGS vary with tidal current speeds and the probability distributions of tidal current speed. The TPGS suffers a much higher failure risk in the super-synchronous mode than in the idle and subsynchronous modes. The failure rate of the RSC is much higher than that of the GSC. The change trends in the failure rates of RSC and GSC in the operation modes are different. The probability distributions of tidal current speed have significant impacts on the reliability of the TPGS.

Abstract: In order to provide the ancillary service for smart grid, this paper proposes a modelling and control protocol design approach for the aggregation of heterogeneous thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). A 2-D state bin is proposed to model the second-order TCL dynamics in a population model. Detailed procedure of calculating the transition probability in the system matrix is provided. In the controller design, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed to obtain the optimal control actions along the prediction horizon. In addition, implementation of the control signal for adjusting TCLs' statuses are also investigated with practical situations considered. Simulation results reveal the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed modelling and control approach when applied on a large population of TCLs. Some factors that may affect the service performance are also discussed in this paper.

Abstract: Based on data available from phase measurement units (PMUs), this paper proposes an energy margin constrained online coordinated voltage control (CVC) algorithm. First, the energy function model is established, which is based on detailed device models that include the effects of shunt capacitor banks, reactive power output of generators and under-load-tap-changers (ULTCs). In order to improve the computational efficiency, a Lie derivative-based method is used to map the energy change into the system trajectory along the energy manifold. Then, the change of energy margin based on the Lie derivative is used as the objective function and the reactive power margin is used as a constraint to formulate a linear programming problem. A coordinated strategy is proposed to help achieve the optimal solution when the linear programming problem is solved. In comparison with the other control modes, the proposed method improves the stability margin and the control effectiveness of voltage profile. Numerical results are provided for a three-machine system, the IEEE-30 bus system and the New England-39 bus benchmark system.

Abstract: In this study, a new pinning-based distributed cooperative control scheme is proposed for multi-agent system (MAS)-based autonomous microgrids. By pinning parts of selected agents, only a small fraction of the pinned agents are controlled by simple feedback controllers, while the other DGAs in the MAS synchronize through the communication coupling among the pinned agents in a distributed manner. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) the proposal of a fully distributed control for autonomous microgrids where each agent shares its operation information only with its neighbors, which obviates the requirement for a central controller and complex communication topology; 2) the proposal of a pinning-based control scheme, which reduces the number of controllers, for a predefined consensus can be reached if a small fraction of the pinned agents is controlled; and 3) the proposal of the pinning consensus under uncertain communication topologies that can meet the requirements of line switches and plug-and-play operation. Simulation results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Cascading failure is one of the most damaging events to power systems. To mitigate the risk, it is essential to first evaluate the risk and then take corresponding protective measures. However, the issue of multiple solutions in DCOPF, which is a tool used in the existing OPA risk assessment models and a linear programming (LP) problem, has not been considered. In this letter, we show that the risk may be seriously under-estimated if we do not consider the existence of multiple solutions. The risk is evaluated by generating two dispatch plans based on a bilevel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for DCOPF. The solution to the bilevel MILP model is obtained by solving one LP and one MILP. Simulation results based on the IEEE 118-bus and 300-bus systems demonstrate the impact of multiple solutions in DCOPF and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: A frequency-based approach is proposed in this paper to size a battery-supercapacitor energy storage system for maintaining power balance of an isolated system with high penetration of wind generation, thus to maintain the grid frequency stability with the stochastic wind power fluctuations being considered. The sizing method proposed makes full use of the combined technical merits of two types of energy storage systems, battery and supercapacitor, as their specific power/energy densities and the corresponding expected life cycle cost/year are different. The power imbalance between hourly dispatched wind power and the corresponding actual real-time wind power output is decomposed into different time-varying periodic components by use of the Fourier transformation. Then two different types of energy storage systems are applied to balance the low-frequency and intermediate-frequency component respectively. A computational procedure is developed in the paper for choosing the optimal cut-off frequencies in determining the range of low and intermediate frequency for sizing the hybrid energy storage system. Comparative studies of a real isolated system in China are presented in the paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Frequency deviation of power systems caused by grid-connected wind power fluctuations is one of the key factors limiting the level of wind penetration. Applying an energy storage system (ESS) to overcome the constraint of frequency deviation can increase the level of permitted wind penetration. This paper proposes a method to evaluate the wind penetration as limited by grid frequency deviation and to size the ESS to increase the permitted wind penetration to an expected level. The proposed method treats wind power fluctuations as a stochastic process rather than deterministic signal and takes the frequency response characteristics of power grid into full consideration. Application of the proposed method is based on theoretical derivations and does not require conducting dynamic simulation. It can catch the stochastic characteristic of wind power fluctuations.

Abstract: This paper proposes two switching controllers working in a coordinated manner to enhance the transient stability of multi-machine power systems. One is switching excitation controller (SEC) and the other is switching governor (SG). The SEC switches between a bang-bang excitation controller (BEC) and a conventional excitation controller (CEC) and the SG switches between a bang-bang governor (BG) and a conventional governor (CG), via a state-dependent switching strategy. The BEC and the BG are designed as bang-bang constant funnel controllers (BCFC), which are able to provide fast switching of excitation voltage and valve position between their upper and lower limits. A detailed steam turbine model including boiler pressure effect is considered in the controller design process. Simulation studies are undertaken in the IEEE 16-generator 68-bus power system to evaluate the control performance of the switching controllers, which include the cases that three-phase-to-ground fault and transmission line outage occur in the system, respectively. Coordination between the excitation loop and speed governing loop is studied. Two system resilience indexes are introduced, and the short-term resilience is investigated for the power systems with and without switching controllers installed, respectively.

Abstract: We model post-contingency corrective actions in the security-constrained economic dispatch and consider multiple stages of rescheduling to meet different security constraints. The resulting linear program is not solvable by traditional LP methods due to its large size. We devise and implement a series of algorithmic enhancements based on the Benders' decomposition method to ameliorate the computational difficulty. These enhancements include reducing the number of subproblems, solving the LPs faster by using appropriate solver options, harnessing parallel computing and treating difficult contingencies separately by integrating an independent "feasibility checker" process in the algorithm. In addition, we propose a set of online measures to diagnose and correct infeasibility issues encountered in the solution process. The overall solution approach, coded directly in GAMS, is able to process the "N-1" contingency list in 10 min for all large network cases (e.g., the Polish 2383-bus case) available for experiments.

Abstract: This work presents a parallel transient stability simulation based on waveform relaxation for large-scale power systems. A power system described by large-scale differential-algebraic equations (DAE) is decomposed into several subsystems by a partitioning algorithm based on epsilon decomposition. The method adopts preconditioning and waveform prediction to accelerate convergence of the system. Moreover, a two-stage parallel strategy based on OpenMP further improves parallel efficiency. All subsystems are solved using a very dishonest Newton (VDHN) method combined with an iteration method based on Adomian decomposition independently after the state variables are discretized by implicit-trapezoidal rule. Finally, two large-scale test cases with detailed dynamic models verify the proposed algorithm. The computational results show that the proposed waveform relaxation method achieves high parallel efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents the impacts caused by the integration of variable speed wind turbines on long-term voltage stability. The technologies used are fully rated converter (FRC) and doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with two control strategies: grid-side converter (GSC) at unity power factor, which is usually adopted, and GSC controlling reactive power. Also, this paper considers wind turbines capability curves and its variable limits, since they are subject to several limitations that changes with the operating point and wind speed. This study also considers the dynamic models of over excitation limiter (OEL) and on-load tap changers (OLTC) combined with static and dynamic loads using time domain simulations. Different penetration levels of wind generation are analyzed. The results show that long-term voltage stability can be improved when GSC of DFIG is controlling reactive power. Moreover, the capability curve plays an important role in this analysis since reactive power is a key requirement to maintain voltage stability.

Abstract: Due to the increasing adoption of domestic photovoltaic (PV) systems, the use of technologies such as on-load tap changer (OLTC)-fitted transformers, capacitor banks, and remote monitoring are being considered to mitigate voltage issues, particularly in European-style low voltage (LV) networks. Depending on the control strategy, however, the effects on customer voltages and control actions (e.g., tap changes or capacitor switching) can vary significantly. This work presents a framework to assess the performance of different OLTC-based control strategies in terms of voltage compliance with the standard BS EN50160 and the number of control actions. Three control strategies are proposed: constant set-point (CSC), time-based (TBC) and remote monitoring-based (RMC). A week-long Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering a real UK LV network, three-phase power flows, different PV penetrations and seasonality. Results show that the TBC outperforms the CSC but at the expense of more tap changes. Due to the enhanced visibility, the RMC significantly increases the PV hosting capacity whilst limiting tap operations. Finally, when feeders have contrasting voltage issues, capacitor banks are found to provide additional flexibility and allow higher PV penetrations. These findings are expected to help the industry determining the benefits from OLTC-based solutions in future LV networks.

Abstract: The exceptional benefits of wind power as an environmentally responsible renewable energy resource have led to an increasing penetration of wind energy in today's power systems. This trend has started to reshape the paradigms of power system operations, as dealing with uncertainty caused by the highly intermittent and uncertain wind power becomes a significant issue. Motivated by this, we present a new framework using adaptive robust optimization for the economic dispatch of power systems with high level of wind penetration. In particular, we propose an adaptive robust optimization model for multi-period economic dispatch, and introduce the concept of dynamic uncertainty sets and methods to construct such sets to model temporal and spatial correlations of uncertainty. We also develop a simulation platform which combines the proposed robust economic dispatch model with statistical prediction tools in a rolling horizon framework. We have conducted extensive computational experiments on this platform using real wind data. The results are promising and demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of cost and reliability over existing robust optimization models as well as recent look-ahead dispatch models.

Abstract: Spinning reserve (SR) is one of the most important resources used by system operators to respond to unforeseen events. In a low-carbon economy mode, carbon capture plant is an important CO2 abatement option and might constitute a significant proportion of the generation mix. Due to their potential flexibility, such plants might affect the requirement for SR. This paper describes a multi-period optimization model for coordinating the generation, carbon capture and SR provision. In turn, this model is used to optimize the SR requirements, with the objective of minimizing the overall cost. Since this objective function combines the generation production cost, the expected energy not supplied (EENS) cost, SR provision cost and the carbon emission cost, it is better suited to evaluate the SR requirements of power system with carbon capture plants. Numerical results based on a 26-unit test system show that the proposed model is effective and practical.

Abstract: The need for improved utilization of existing system assets and energy sources, as well as the smooth incorporation of new technologies (such as electric vehicles) into the grid, has prompted the participation of small power consumers and generators in the energy markets. A problem of such scale however cannot be managed in a centralized manner in its full detail. This paper examines the idea of a decentralized approach in clearing the energy market. A general framework for the problem decomposition and its distributed solution is presented and analyzed. A key point of interest in this work is the fundamental question of how far decomposition may be pursued for a given system, while still achieving reasonable convergence properties. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated and solved through a parallel implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A thorough investigation of its convergence properties is conducted, and through its coordination with an additional proximal based decomposition method, we improve its scalability characteristics.

Abstract: Emerging smart-grid-enabling technologies will allow an unprecedented degree of observability and control at all levels in a power system. Combined with flexible demand and storage, they could allow procuring energy at minimum cost and environmental impact. That however presupposes real-time coordination of demand of individual households and industries down at the distribution level, with generation at the transmission level. This is closely related with the balancing market economic dispatch (ED) problem, which currently does not take into account distribution network constraints and flexible demand characteristics. Still, assuming a suitably modified form of that problem was available, due to both computational and communications requirements, its centralized solution in its full detail would not be tractable. While there is currently a wealth of literature dealing with distributed optimization applications in power systems, it typically focuses on smaller parts of the overall energy management problem (e.g., transmission area synchronization or electric vehicles management) often without considering its full scale or establishing any association with energy market mechanisms. The target of this paper is twofold: 1) identify a flexible demand and distribution network inclusive formulation for ED and 2) propose a solution method.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for processing real-time data error in generalized state estimation (GSE). Attention is focused on the two main types of error: network topology errors and bad data on analog measurements. The proposed approach is able to handle both errors without making any previous assumption regarding the nature of those errors. The degrading effects of topology errors over bad data processing when both topology and measurement errors occur at the same time are evaluated and new strategy is proposed to overcome it. GSE is treated as a constrained optimization problem where measurements and circuit-breaker status are modeled as equality constraints. Geometric tests based on the geometric interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier vector are then utilized to determine the source of the error. The proposed strategy is tested on two model power networks represented at the bus-section level which is derived from the IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems.

Abstract: The task of autonomous power sharing in a micro-grid is usually achieved by decentralized droop control on individual interface power converters, which may suffer from the dependence on output line impedances. Inaccurate reactive power sharing will occur under strongly non-uniform line impedances. Due to inherently distributed and heterogeneous nature of the micro-grid, it becomes an ideal platform for applications of consensus control algorithms. In this paper, the consensus-based droop control with sparse communication network is proposed to overcome the drawback of existing droop control methods. In particular, when line impedances of the power grid are either lossy with the uniform R/X ratio or even pure resistive, the consensus droop control is still an effective method for autonomous real and reactive power sharing. In addition, closed-loop system stability of the proposed consensus-based droop control method can be ensured by the energy function approach under certain conditions. Real-time simulations of two micro-grid systems are studied to validate the feasibility of the proposed consensus-based droop control method.

Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) dispatches controllable generation at minimum cost subject to operational constraints on generation and transmission assets. The uncertainty and variability of intermittent renewable generation is challenging current deterministic OPF approaches. Recent formulations of OPF use chance constraints to limit the risk from renewable generation uncertainty, however, these new approaches typically assume the probability distributions which characterize the uncertainty and variability are known exactly. We formulate a robust chance constrained (RCC) OPF that accounts for uncertainty in the parameters of these probability distributions by allowing them to be within an uncertainty set. The RCC OPF is solved using a cutting-plane algorithm that scales to large power systems. We demonstrate the RRC OPF on a modified model of the Bonneville Power Administration network, which includes 2209 buses and 176 controllable generators. Deterministic, chance constrained (CC), and RCC OPF formulations are compared using several metrics including cost of generation, area control error, ramping of controllable generators, and occurrence of transmission line overloads as well as the respective computational performance.

Abstract: Static reserve policies are used within security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) to ensure reliability. A common policy is that 10-min reserve must exceed the largest contingency. However, this condition does not guarantee reliability because voltage and thermal limits can hinder reserve deliverability. Many operators use zonal reserve markets to ensure reserves are dispersed across the grid. Such zonal models attempt to anticipate transmission bottlenecks, which is a difficult task when the future system state is uncertain. This paper examines the market implications of dynamic reserve policies used to mitigate uncertainty from renewable resources and contingencies. We study the market implications of policies recently proposed in the literature, such as hourly zones within day-ahead SCUC and an algorithm that formally disqualifies reserves that are expected to be undeliverable. A locational reserve pricing scheme is also proposed in connection with scenario-based reserve disqualification. Analysis on the RTS-96 test case shows that dynamic zones and reserve disqualification, along with the proposed compensation scheme, help direct reserve payments toward resources that more effectively respond to contingencies.

Abstract: Reserve requirements promote reliability by ensuring resources are available to rebalance the power system following random disturbances. However, reliability is not guaranteed when dispatch is limited by transmission constraints. In this work, we propose a modified form of reserve requirement that identifies response sets for distinct contingency scenarios. The approach disqualifies reserve from counting towards a particular scenario if transmission constraints are likely to render that reserve undeliverable. A decomposition algorithm for security-constrained unit commitment dynamically updates the response sets to address changing conditions. Testing on the RTS 96 test case demonstrates the approach applied in tandem with existing reserve policies to avoid situations where reserve is not deliverable due to transmission constraints. Operational implications of the proposed method are discussed.

Abstract: In medium-voltage DC (MVDC) systems, to manage the impacts of uncertainty and variability brought by the high-penetrated renewable energy sources (RES), this paper proposes a two-time-scale coordinated energy management method. Based on a hierarchical control framework, the droop control is used and its two key factors, operating point and droop coefficient, are co-optimized. To improve operational benefits, operating points are determined in the reference optimization, considering the long-term cooperative operation of various integrated units. To enhance system security, droop coefficients are optimized in the coefficient optimization, where controllers' responses to the system unbalanced power and changes of system voltage profile within the dispatch interval are both considered. Since these two optimizations are performed in different time scales, a two-time-scale coordinated strategy is designed to balance long-term economic benefits and short-term security performance. The proposed approach is verified on a typical MVDC system which has a meshed network topology. Conventional and renewable energy sources as well as schedulable and unschedulable load demands are considered. Numerical experiments indicate that, the proposed approach is capable of providing economical and reliable dispatch, such that the forecast errors and fluctuations brought by the high-penetrated RESs and other unschedulable units can be adapted to.

Abstract: Uneven load distribution leads to a 3-phase imbalance at the low voltage (LV) substation level. This imbalance has distinct impacts on main feeders and LV transformers: for main feeders, it reduces the available capacity as the phase with the least spare capacity determines the usable capacity; for LV transformers, phase imbalance reduces the available capacity due to additional power along the neutral line. To assess the additional reinforcement cost (ARC) arising from a 3-phase imbalance, this paper proposes two novel costing models for main feeders and LV transformers respectively. Each model involves the derivation of an accurate ARC formula based on the degree of three-phase imbalance and a linearized approximation through Taylor's expansion to simplify the detailed ARC formula, enabling quantification of future LV investment in scale. The developed models are tested on 4 cases where imbalance ranges from 0 to 10%, and reveals that i) a small imbalance degree may cause a substantial ARC on main feeders; ii) ARC grows exponentially as asset utilization is close to its capacity; and that iii) a main feeder is more sensitive to its respective imbalance degree than an LV transformer under the same condition. The models serve as an effective tool to assist distribution network operators (DNOs) to quantify a key cost (ARC) element from the phase imbalance, allowing DNOs to evaluate their future LV investment in scale.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate whether considering the fine structure of half-hourly electricity prices, the market closing prices of fundamentals (natural gas, coal and) and the system-wide demand can lead to significantly more accurate short-and mid-term forecasts of APX U.K. baseload prices. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of a number of univariate and multivariate time series models over a three-year out-of-sample forecasting period and compare it against that of a benchmark autoregressive model. We find that in the short-term, up to a few business days ahead, a disaggregated model which independently predicts the intra-day prices and then takes their average to yield baseload price forecasts is the best performer. However, in the mid-term, factor models which explore the correlation structure of intra-day prices lead to significantly (as measured by the Diebold-Mariano test) better baseload price forecasts. At the same time, we observe that the inclusion of fundamental variables-especially natural gas prices (in the short-term) and coal prices (in the mid-term)-provides significant gains. The prices, on the other hand, generally do not improve the price forecasts at all, at least in the time period considered in this study (April 2009-December 2013).

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem, where each contingency corresponds to the outage of an arbitrary number of lines and generators. The problem is studied by means of a convex relaxation, named semidefinite program (SDP). The existence of a rank-1 SDP solution guarantees the recovery of a global solution of SCOPF. We prove that the rank of the SDP solution is upper bounded by the treewidth of the power network plus one, which is perceived to be small in practice. We then propose a decomposition method to reduce the computational complexity of the relaxation. In the case where the relaxation is not exact, we develop a graph-theoretic convex program to identify the problematic lines of the network and incorporate the loss over those lines into the objective as a penalization (regularization) term, leading to a penalized SDP problem. We perform several simulations on large-scale benchmark systems and verify that the global minima are at most 1% away from the feasible solutions obtained from the proposed penalized relaxation.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. We have recently shown that a convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming (SDP) is able to find a global solution of OPF for IEEE benchmark systems, and moreover this technique is guaranteed to work over acyclic (distribution) networks. The present work studies the potential of the SDP relaxation for OPF over mesh (transmission) networks. First, we consider a simple class of cyclic systems, namely weakly-cyclic networks with cycles of size 3. We show that the success of the SDP relaxation depends on how the line capacities are modeled mathematically. More precisely, the SDP relaxation is proven to succeed if the capacity of each line is modeled in terms of bus voltage difference, as opposed to line active power, apparent power or angle difference. This result elucidates the role of the problem formulation. Our second contribution is to relate the rank of theminimum-rank solution of the SDP relaxation to the network topology. The goal is to understand how the computational complexity of OPF is related to the underlying topology of the power network. To this end, an upper bound is derived on the rank of the SDP solution, which is expected to be small in practice. A penalization method is then applied to the SDP relaxation to enforce the rank of its solution to become 1, leading to a near-optimal solution for OPF with a guaranteed optimality degree. The remarkable performance of this technique is demonstrated on IEEE systems with more than 7000 different cost functions.

Abstract: This paper takes into account the reliability and economic effects of line maintenance on the transmission network expansion planning considering line repairs and the reliability effect of line loadings. For this purpose, a quantitative relationship between line lifetimes and the value of the transmission system is introduced in order to formulate the economic effect of maintenance. Also, the failure rate and mean time to repair coefficients are employed to calculate reliability effects of line maintenance using the cost of load shedding. Furthermore, the effect of line loadings on transmission system reliability is formulated through the line failure rates. The proposed model is tested on the Garver's network and the IEEE Reliability Test System, which is followed by a discussion of the results.

Abstract: efficient analytical (EA) method is proposed for optimally installing multiple distributed generation (DG) technologies to minimize power loss in distribution systems. Different DG types are considered, and their power factors are optimally calculated. The proposed EA method is also applied to the problem of allocating an optimal mix of different DG types with various generation capabilities. Furthermore, the EA method is integrated with the optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm to develop a new method, EA-OPF which effectively addresses overall system constraints. The proposed methods are tested using 33-bus and 69-bus distribution test systems. The calculated results are validated using the simulation results of the exact optimal solution obtained by an exhaustive OPF algorithm for both distribution test systems. The results show that the performances of the proposed methods are superior to existing methods in terms of computational speed and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper deals with wind power offering strategies in day-ahead markets. A new plan is proposed in which a wind power producer participates in the day-ahead market while employing demand response (DR) to smooth its power variations. In this context, a new DR scheme is presented through which the wind power producer is able to achieve DR by establishing various DR agreements with DR aggregators. The proposed offering plan involves two stages: the first stage clears on the day-ahead market. The wind power producer decides on day-ahead offers as well as DR agreements with the aggregator. The second stage takes place on the balancing market. In a successive approach, the wind power producer determines its energy trading for each period until the whole day is covered. Additionally, proper DR agreements for each period are confirmed here. The proposed plan is formulated in a stochastic programming approach, where its validity is assessed on a case of the Nordic market.

Abstract: This paper considers a wind power producer playing strategically in a day-ahead market while willing to set demand response (DR) contracts with a DR aggregator. To this end, a bilevel problem including a single leader and two followers is formulated. The wind power producer is the leader aiming at maximizing its profit through offering into a day-ahead market and clearing its deviation in a balancing market. The strategic behavior of the producer in the day-ahead market is modeled through the market clearing process (follower 1). In addition, the DR aggregator behavior is modeled through a revenue function in which the aggregator is able to sell its DR product to the wind power producer, other competitors and the day-ahead market (follower 2). The overall problem is a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) in which wind power production and imbalance prices are associated with uncertainty. The problem is then transformed into a linear programming approach. A case of the Nordic market is chosen to assess the validity of the given problem.

Abstract: In order to increase the utilization of renewable energy sources and to reduce the need of generator-provided ancillary services and inefficient peaking generation, buildings are progressively transforming into smarter electricity consumers and active participants in power system operations. In this work, an R-C thermodynamic model of building that strongly relates to the power consumption of heating ventilation air-conditioning system (HVAC) is firstly introduced. To offer the aggregated flexible HVAC power to the grid as regulating power, we propose a building-aggregator-grid contract framework and formulate a robust model predictive control (MPC) algorithm which both maximizes the profit of aggregator and minimizes the payment of each participating building to optimally declare power flexibility. Lastly, simulation results on a group of real and hypothetical buildings validate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for single and simultaneous fault location in distribution networks by means of a sparse representation (SR) vector, Fuzzy-clustering, and machine-learning. The method requires few smart meters along the primary feeders to measure the pre- and during-fault voltages. The voltage sag values for the measured buses produce a vector whose dimension is less than the number of buses in the system. By concatenating the corresponding rows of the bus impedance matrix, an underdetermined set of equation is formed and is used to recover the fault current vector. Since the current vector ideally contains few nonzero values corresponding to fault currents at the faulted points, it is a sparse vector which can be determined by l(1)-norm minimization. Because the number of nonzero values in the estimated current vector often exceeds the number of fault points, we analyze the nonzero values by Fuzzy-c mean to estimate four possible faults. Furthermore, the nonzero values are processed by a new machine learning method based on the k-nearest neighborhood technique to estimate a single fault location. The performance of our algorithms is validated by their implementation on a real distribution network with noisy and noise-free measurement.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for N - 1 contingency constrained transmission capacity expansion planning (TCEP), which is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. In relatively well-designed power systems, a single outage of a majority of lines will not usually cause overload on other lines in most loading conditions. Thus they will not affect the feasible region and the optimal answer of the TCEP optimization problem, and can be safely removed from contingency analysis if we can identify them. A contingency identification index is developed to detect these lines and create variable contingency lists (VCL) for different network loading conditions. In our proposed method, we use results of a relaxed version of the original problem as a lower bound answer in the first step, and integrate contingencies into TCEP in the next steps to solve this optimization problem faster while still satisfying N - 1 criterion. For solving TCEP with contingencies, two options are offered, i. e., option A that uses an updated system as its base case (original existing network together with selected lines by the relaxed problem) and option B that uses the original existing network as its base case (without results of the relaxed problem). Option A is faster than option B because it usually should select fewer new lines compared to B, but cannot guarantee optimality. Option B provides the optimal answer while taking more computational time. An ERCOT case study is used to show capabilities of the proposed method for solving large scale problems, and the numerical result demonstrates this method is much faster than the integrated MIP method that directly incorporates all contingencies.

Abstract: This paper presents the modeling of intelligent energy control center (ECC) controlling distributed generators (DGs) using multi-agent system. Multi-agent system has been proposed to provide intelligent energy control and management in grids because of their benefits of extensibility, autonomy, reduced maintenance, etc. The multi-agent system constituting the smart grid and agents such as user agent, control agent, database agent, distributed energy resources (DER) agent work in collaboration to perform assigned tasks. The wind power generator connected with local load, the solar power connected with local load and the ECC controlled by fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The DER model is created in client and ECC is created in server. Communication between the server and the client is established using transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP). The results indicate that the controlling of DER agent can be achieved both from server and client.

Abstract: This letter presents a 0-1 semidefinite programming (SDP) approach to solve the problem of optimal placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs), considering the existence of conventional measurements and zero injections as well as the impact of PMU channel limits. The proposed formulation can prevent the wasteful utilization of different PMUs observing incident branch current phasors at a given bus more than once. The method is tested on the IEEE 57-bus test system.

Abstract: A new methodology for selecting a global group of the most effective preventive controls in the context of voltage stability analysis in electrical power systems for a set of multiple critical contingencies is developed in this paper. This methodology is based on a sensitivity analysis of the maximum loadability point with respect to voltage controls. Considering not only the effectiveness of the control elements but also their availability, coordination, and cost, the methodology determines a set of controllers to simultaneously eliminate all critical contingencies. The methodology is fast and suitable for online assessment of preventive control. The methodology was successfully tested in a reduced south-southeast Brazilian system composed of 107 buses.

Abstract: We consider a novel paradigm for demand side management, assuming that an aggregator communicates with a household only at the meter, imposing a capacity constraint, i.e., a restriction on the total power consumption level within a given time frame. Consumers are then responsible to adjust the set-points of the individual household devices accordingly to meet the imposed constraint. We formulate the problem as a stochastic household energy management program, with stochasticity arising due to local photovoltaic generation. We show how a demand bidding curve for capacity increments can be constructed as a by-product of the developed problem and provide a rigorous pricing analysis that results in a probabilistic "shadow" price envelope. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we compare it with an idealized real-time market price set-up and show how our analysis can provide guidelines to consumers when selecting a service contract for load curtailment.

Abstract: The medium-term generation planning over a yearly horizon for generation portfolios including hydro generation and non-dispatchable renewables such as wind power and solar photovoltaic generation reveals how the penetration of these technologies reduces the share of other technologies and how it changes the profits and the profit spread in liberalized electricity markets. The matching of the load duration curves in different periods and the forced outages of generation units are here addressed through probabilistic methods and a heuristic is employed to guess which of the load-matching constraints may be active at the solution. There are well-established models for hydro generation in medium-term planning, but specific models are necessary to account for wind power and photovoltaic generation. A proposal for these is made in this work, which is suitable for use in the load duration curve matching through probabilistic methods. Moreover the stochasticity of the renewable sources requires the use of stochastic programming employing scenario trees, here developed using quasi-Monte Carlo techniques. Medium-term pumping schemes are also considered. Several realistic cases will be solved for two behavioral principles of a pure pool market: endogenous cartel and equilibrium.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new method of removing thermal overloads and voltage limits in an electric power system by means of the Evolution of Corrective and Preventive control Actions (ECPA). The goal is to find the minimum number of control actions that solve the identified limit violations at minimum cost. A recombination operator based on form theory allows the codification of control actions in a natural and simple way. ECPA has been tested on the IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 118-bus systems. The limit violations are solved at minimum cost and with fewer control actions on average than alternative methods.

Abstract: Incentives to encourage the uptake of renewable energy generation have fostered wind energy in many power systems. These incentives usually take the form of market instruments (e.g., feed-in tariff or premium) that are not directly amenable to optimization representations of the market. In this paper, we propose an equilibrium model of the short-term market to address the impact of wind operation under different structural assumptions. The model is formulated for several price taking, risk averse firms in competition. It accounts for wind generation uncertainty and embeds a representation of the day ahead and balancing mechanisms. The consumer is modeled by a linear inverse demand function. We focus on feed-in premium as the incentive to wind as this is the instrument most favored today in European discussions. The model is formulated as a stochastic equilibrium problem where the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions from the optimization problem of each firm are simultaneously solved together with market clearing conditions on energy, capacity for reserve and energy for reserve. The problem for each firm consists of a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with a recourse function based on the conditional value at risk (CVaR(theta)) as a risk measure. Due to price taking assumptions the model is a single stage complementarity problem; it is implemented and solved using the software GAMS. An example based on a stylized simplification of the Spanish power market and motivated by the impact of wind penetration on the revenue of conventional plants is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes some methods for the purpose of reactive power and voltage control. Real cases show them as potentially harmful for power systems, since dynamic instability and voltage collapse may appear. Control actions like tap changers, active and reactive power redispatch may help the system voltage stability, but may present reverse results for some operating conditions. This paper is firstly devoted to identify and classify an operating point under the voltage stability point of view. Following this classification, an index to assess the robustness of a bus is proposed. The studies are carried out with the help of the QV curves. Methods to change the region of operation of a bus are then discussed with the help of a real Brazilian system with all limits considered.

Abstract: Isolated microgrid power systems are prone to large frequency and voltage deviations, since they have limited generation and finite inertia and may include pulse power loads and large proportion of dynamic loads. Thus, they require effective power management methods to operate optimally, while satisfying operating and security constraints. In this paper, a novel integrated security-constrained model-based power management approach is proposed for isolated microgrids in all-electric ships during the normal/alert operating state. The new power management method was formulated as a multi-objective optimal control problem. A method based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II was developed to solve the problem. The developed integrated security-constrained power management approach was applied to a notional all-electric ship computer model. The simulation results, conducted in PSCAD, showed the effectiveness of the new power management method.

Abstract: The deeper penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in microgrids (s) has led to their wider deployment in specific applications. The inherent variability in loads and in renewable energy resource outputs necessitates the development and implementation of effective voltage control strategies so as to reliably serve the loads, particularly under is-landed operations mode. We propose a dispersed control strategy to maintain voltage levels within the operational limits by means of the DERs reactive and active power outputs. We implement an optimization approach and demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed voltage control scheme using a set of representative studies from the extensive testing of the simulation approach performed with the methodology. Simulation results demonstrate the absence of any opportunity cost to implement the control action and the maximization of active power production by renewable energy resources.

Abstract: We investigate the potential for aggregations of residential thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as air conditioners, to arbitrage intraday wholesale electricity market prices via non-disruptive load control. We present two arbitrage approaches: 1) a benchmark that gives us an optimal policy but requires local computation or real-time communication and 2) an alternative based on a thermal energy storage model, which relies on less computation/communication infrastructure, but is suboptimal. We find that the alternative approach achieves around 60%-80% of the optimal wholesale energy cost savings. We use this approach to compute practical upper bounds for savings via arbitrage with air conditioners in California's intraday energy market. We investigate six sites over four years and find that the savings range from $2-$37 per TCL per year, and depend upon outdoor temperature statistics and price volatility.

Abstract: Fossil fuel generation companies (GenCos) trade in multiple uncertain energy markets: fuel and carbon markets on upstream side while electricity market on downstream side. Global economic and environmental benefits lead these markets to pursue overlapping goals, making them highly interactive. GenCos may identify optimal trading strategies for upstream and downstream trading in an integrated framework, to manage an overall secure and profitable position. Further, severe unpredictability of energy market prices may necessitate a GenCo to make trading plans which perform better meeting its goals. Under severe uncertainty of involved markets, this paper proposes Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) based approach to select three interrelated trading portfolios, in an integrated framework. Results from a realistic case study provide a comprehensive decision insight to address risk-averse and risk-seeking behavior of GenCo, explicitly highlighting importance of co-variation in prices of interactive markets.

Abstract: Adoption of dispersed renewable energy technologies requires transmission network expansion. Besides the transmission system operator (TSO), restructuring of electricity industries has introduced a merchant investor (MI), who earns congestion rents from constructing new lines. We compare these two market designs via a stochastic bi-level programming model that has either the MI or the TSO making transmission investment decisions at the upper level and power producers determining generation investment and operation at the lower level while facing wind power variability. We find that social welfare is always higher under the TSO because the MI has incentive to boost congestion rents by restricting capacities of transmission lines. Such strategic behavior also limits investment in wind power by producers. However, regardless of the market design (MI or TSO), when producers behave a la Cournot, a higher proportion of energy is produced by wind. In effect, withholding of generation capacity by producers prompts more transmission investment since the TSO aims to increase welfare by subsidizing wind and the MI creates more flow to maximize profit.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new multi-objective framework for primary distribution system planning (DSP). Further consideration is devoted to early DSP formulations in order to assess the risk imposed by probabilistic customer choices on reliability (CCOR). The CCOR is a buy/sell strategy that permits customers to pay the electricity price equiponderant to the reliability level provided by the distribution utility over the contract period. A Monte Carlo-based simulation is carried out to examine the effects of the probability of a customer's interest in adopting the CCOR on profit-at-risk. Furthermore, the DSP was conducted to simultaneously minimize both total planning cost and profit-at-risk. The resultant optimization problem is solved through the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) accompanied by a fuzzy decision making method to select the best result among the obtained Pareto optimal set of solutions. The developed method is applied to an actual large-scale distribution system with about 140 000 customers, followed by a discussion on results.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an approach for a fast assessment of the dynamic characteristics of system frequency during the period of cold load pickup following a large-scale blackout. The approach is developed based on a load model and a model of generation control system: the load model considers the unique time-dependent characteristic of inrush power surges during the period of cold load pickup, while the model of generation control system mimics the characteristics of various governors that are crucial to the determination of the key variables including initial rate of frequency change, frequency nadir and settling frequency. With the proposed linearization and estimation methods, the model of generation control system can be quickly constructed to offer a great amount of flexibility and simplicity for the study of the impact of cold load on frequency response. The proposed approach allows system operators to quickly evaluate many different options for system restoration. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system. The differences between the results obtained using the proposed approach and those obtained from complete PSS/E simulation are very small, which suggests that the linearized model of generation control system is fast, and accurate enough to address the major concerns of cold load pickup in system restoration.

Abstract: While gas turbines are popular in power networks due to reduced emissions and economical operation, their frequency response characteristics are substantially different from other conventional generation technologies; hence, gas turbine dynamics may influence system stability during significant frequency excursions. This study characterizes the impact of gas turbine combustor lean blowout (LBO) while considering large frequency excursions and, in particular, during short-circuit faults. Studies have shown that combined-cycle gas turbines are more vulnerable to an LBO condition during short-circuit events when they operate at rated power output. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out against a number of factors influencing the LBO, revealing that generator loading and rate-of-change-of-frequency are the main contributing factors for the LBO. Furthermore, mitigation strategies are also proposed to alleviate the LBO condition during large frequency excursions.

Abstract: If an interarea oscillatory mode has insufficient damping, generator redispatch can be used to improve its damping. We explain and apply a new analytic formula for the modal sensitivity to rank the best pairs of generators to redispatch. The formula requires some dynamic power system data and we show how to obtain that data from synchrophasor measurements. The application of the formula to damp interarea modes is explained and illustrated with interarea modes of the New England 10-generator power system.

Abstract: This letter presents an important finding: the parameters of secondary frequency control based on integral or proportional integral control can be tuned to achieve economic operation and frequency regulation simultaneously. We show that if the power imbalance is represented by frequency deviation, an iterative dual ascent based economic dispatch solving is equivalent to integral control. An iterative method of multipliers based economic dispatch is equivalent to proportional integral control. Similarly, if the controller parameters of the secondary frequency controls are chosen based on generator cost functions, these secondary frequency controllers achieve both economic operation and frequency regulation simultaneously.

Abstract: This paper develops an analytical model of an unbalanced radial distribution system consisting of a single-phase photovoltaic (PV), a three-phase induction machine load, a three-phase power factor correction capacitor (PFC), and a load. The analytical model is based on dynamic phasors (DP) for phases. The single-phase PV model includes inverter current control [proportional resonance (PR) controller], an L, or an LCL filter. The induction machine model is based on positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence components' dynamic phasors. The sequence-based induction machine model was converted to the DP-reference frame and interconnected with other grid components. The developed analytical model is capable of small-signal analysis and can be used to identify variety of stability and/or harmonic issues in distribution networks, e.g., instability due to weak grid. Impact of unbalance on system dynamic performance can also be investigated using this model. The analytical model is benchmarked with a high-fidelity model built in Matlab/SimPowerSystems where power electronic switching details are included. The small-signal analysis results are validated via Matlab/SimPowerSystems time-domain simulations.

Abstract: The paper focuses on the small-signal stability analysis of large power systems with inclusion of multiple delayed signals. The following four techniques are compared: 1) a Chebyshev discretization scheme of an equivalent partial differential equations that resembles the original delay differential-algebraic equations (DDAEs); 2) an approximation of the time integration operator; 3) a linear multistep discretization of the DDAEs based on an high-order implicit time-integration scheme; and 4) the well-known Pade approximants. These techniques are compared using a GPU-based parallel implementation of the Shur method and QR factorization and tested through a real-world transmission system.

The proposed model proves to be numerically robust and allows representing both short lines as well as the internal electrical nodes that compose substations. Parallel and lossy zero impedance branches can also be straightforwardly defined. A detailed discussion of the features and numerical performance of all models considered in this letter is carried out by means of the a 21,177-bus model of the European ENTSO-E transmission.

Abstract: This letter provides a comparison between the current and power injection models for angle and voltage stability analysis of power systems. Traditionally, it is believed that the current injection model is computationally more efficient. On the other hand, the power injection model requires computing the products of currents and voltages and, hence, is expected to be computationally more demanding than the current injection one. This letter compares the two approaches using a unique framework. The two formulations are compared through a dynamic 1479-bus model of the all-island Irish transmission system.

In particular, the case study, based on a 2383-bus system, shows that the fixed points of these methods are not necessarily a solution of the power flow problem.

Abstract: The paper presents a methodology for estimation of dynamic response of aggregate load at distribution network buses by taking into account daily variation in demand composition and generic dynamic responses of different types of load. Dynamic load models for different load categories obtained from field or laboratory measurements or through appropriate mathematical modeling are used in combination with hourly load composition at the given bus. The load composition is derived based on past demand surveys, and daily loading curves for different classes of customers. Uncertainties in both dynamic load models/responses of individual loads and load compositions at different times of the day are modeled probabilistically. With established dynamic signatures of different load categories and load compositions at different times of the day, Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate probabilistic real and reactive power responses, including ranges of variation of these responses, for every hour of the day for a given or anticipated mix of demand.

Abstract: We propose a fully distributed Gauss-Newton algorithm for state estimation of electric power systems. At each Gauss-Newton iteration, matrix-splitting techniques are utilized to carry out the matrix inversion needed for calculating the Gauss-Newton step in a distributed fashion. In order to reduce the communication burden as well as increase robustness of state estimation, the proposed distributed scheme relies only on local information and a limited amount of information from neighboring areas. The matrix-splitting scheme is designed to calculate the Gauss-Newton step with exponential convergence speed. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in various numerical experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, a small signal model has been developed for a grid connected photovoltaic (PV)-diesel engine (DE) system feeding also to an induction motor at the low voltage level. The comprehensive mathematical model of the system has been developed by linearizing the system of equations around an operating point. To analyze the stability of the system, the eigen values and thus the modes of the system have been obtained from the resultant analytical A matrix. Further, to validate this small signal model, a complete nonlinear time-domain analysis of the system has been carried out. In order to enhance the stability of the system, a supplementary controller in the PV control loop has been proposed and its results have been verified both from the eigen values and from the nonlinear analysis.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to control the output power of a wind farm with the aim of improving the transient stability of a multi-machine power system. Doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) are considered for the variable speed wind farms. The variation of the frequency of the DFIG terminal bus is used to modulate the torque reference and thus the output power of the DFIG in the post-disturbance condition. This in turn modifies the electrical power of the nearby alternators and causes improvement of stability. The proposed control technique is validated in WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system and IEEE 16-machine 68-bus system. The study is carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC as well as in MATLAB platforms.

Abstract: This paper addresses the formulation and solution of an optimal energy storage management problem under risk consideration and transaction costs of trading energy with the power grid. The price evolves as a stochastic process, capable of correctly explaining the seasonality effects as well as the tail fatness and spikiness in its distribution. Transaction costs capture the price impact of the storage operation on the electricity spot price. A risk analysis of an optimal risk neutral deterministic policy as well as the simple myopic policy indicates that the realized operational cost may notably differ from the expected cost by a considerable probability. This difference suggests that we need to consider risk. Using the downside risk measure of conditional value-at-risk, an optimal risk averse conversion and transmission strategy, among the grid, the renewable power generation source, and an energy storage is proposed to fully satisfy the electricity demand and minimize the expected operational cost as well as the risk. Our numerical study using data from NYISO demonstrates the impacts of risk consideration and the transaction cost parameters on the optimal strategy structure, its expected cost, and its risk.

Abstract: Time-shiftable loads have recently received an increasing attention due to their role in creating load flexibility and enhancing demand response and peak-load shaving programs. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: how can a time-shiftable load, that itself may comprise of several smaller time-shiftable subloads, submit its demand bids to the day-ahead and real-time markets so as to minimize its energy procurement cost? Answering this question is challenging because of the inter-temporal dependencies in choosing the demand bids for time-shiftable loads and due to the coupling between demand bid selection and time-shiftable load scheduling problems. Nevertheless, we answer the above question for different practical bidding scenarios and based on different statistical characteristics of practical market prices. In all cases, closed-form solutions are obtained for the optimal choices of the price and energy bids. The bidding performance is then evaluated in details by examining several case studies and analyzing actual market price data.

Abstract: In this paper, a new optimization framework is proposed to coordinate the operation of large, price-maker, and geographically dispersed energy storage/battery systems in a nodal transmission-constrained energy market. The energy storage units are assumed to be investor-owned and independently-operated, seeking to maximize their total profit. Various design factors are taken into consideration such as the location, size, efficiency, and charge and discharge rates of the energy storage units as well as the joint impact of the energy storage operations on the locational marginal prices. While the formulated optimization problem is originally nonlinear and hard to solve, nonlinearities are tackled both in the objective function and in the constraints and the problem is transformed into a tractable mixed-integer linear program, for which the global optimal solutions are found for the charge and discharge schedules of each energy storage unit. Both deterministic and stochastic design scenarios are addressed. Various case studies are presented. It is observed that transmission line congestion is often, but not always, desirable for the coordinated storage systems. Locational diversity, practice of arbitrage, robust design, self-scheduling versus economic bidding, and the overall power system performance are also investigated.

Abstract: An optimal supply and demand bidding, scheduling, and deployment design framework is proposed for battery systems. It takes into account various design factors such as the day-ahead and real-time market prices and their statistical dependency, as well as the location, size, efficiency, lifetime, and charge and discharge rates of the batteries. Utilizing second-life/used batteries is also considered. Without loss of generality, our focus is on the California Independent System Operator (ISO) energy market and its two available bidding options, namely self-schedule bidding and economic bidding. While the formulated stochastic optimization problems are originally nonlinear and difficult to solve, we propose a methodology to decompose them into inner and outer subproblems. Accordingly, we find the global optimal solutions within a short amount of computational time. All case studies in this paper are based on real market data.

Abstract: With an increasing penetration of wind power, there is likely to be an increasing need for fast-ramping generating units. These generators ensure that no load is lost if supply drops due to the uncertainties in wind power generation. However, it is observed in practice that, in a presence of network constraints, fast-ramping generating units are prone to act strategically and exercise market power by withholding their ramp rates. In this paper we model this gaming behavior on ramp rates. We assume a market operator who collects bids in form of marginal costs, quantities, and ramp rates. He runs a ramp-constrained economic dispatch given the generators' bids, forecasted demand, and contingencies. Following the game-theoretic concepts, we set up a multi-level optimization problem. The lower-level problem is the ramp-constrained economic dispatch and the higher-level represents the profit maximization problems solved by strategic generators. The whole problem is formulated as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). The outcome of the EPEC problem is a set of Nash equilibria. To tackle the multiple Nash equilibria problem, the concept of the extremal-Nash equilibria is defined and formulated. We model the concept of extremal-Nash equilibria as a single-stage mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) and demonstrate the application of this mathematical framework on an illustrative case and on a more realistic case study with tractable results.

Abstract: Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in "tighter" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.

Abstract: Research on electric power systems has considered the impact of foreseeable plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) penetration on its regulation, planning, and operation. Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the vehicle level. A case study highlights the effects of including the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) term in the objective function and calculates two metrics referred to as the expected value of aggregation and flexibility.

Abstract: Charging schedules of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) coordinated by an aggregating agent may increase system efficiency of allocating generation, transmission and distribution resources. Decentralized self-scheduling and local charging control appear to be preferred by vehicle manufacturers and PEV drivers who are simultaneously concerned about the longevity and reliability of their energy storage systems. In such a setting, the aggregator would have to determine energy retail prices as means to indirect load control. This paper proposes a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints optimizing the aggregator's decisions. It endogenously determines the profit-optimal price level subject to the cost minimizing charging schedule of the final customers, who are reacting to a combination of retail price signals and distribution use-of-system network charges. This active response follows an affine demand-price relationship, which is individually parametrized for each vehicle by local information of vehicle characteristics and mobility pattern. The proposed program is applied to two cases: 1) a small case study with 3 vehicles, which highlights the model functionality with detailed hourly information per vehicle; 2) a large-scale fleet of 1000 vehicles provides insights on computational burden. Numerical results indicate that adequate competition in the retail market is necessary to limit the aggregator's monopolistic profitability. Finally, sensitivity runs show dependency on the individual's willingness to pay, the cost of alternative fueling opportunities and minimum state-of-charge requirements.

Abstract: Private investors, flexibility, efficiency and environmental requirements from deregulated markets have led the existence and building of a significant number of combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) in many power systems. These plants represent a complex optimization problem for the short-term planning unit commitment (UC) carried out by independent system operators due to their multiple operating configurations. Accordingly, this paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulation of the configuration-based model of CCGTs, which is commonly utilized for bid/offering market processes. This formulation is simultaneously tighter and more compact than analogous MIP-based models; hence, it presents a lower computational burden. The computational efficiency of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by solving network-constrained UC case studies, of different size and complexity, using three of the leading commercial MIP solvers: CPLEX, GUROBI, and XPRESS.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the transmission network expansion planning under generalized joint generation and transmission security criteria. The proposed methodology identifies the optimal expansion plan while modeling the power system operation under both normal and contingency states. An adjustable robust optimization approach is presented to circumvent the tractability issues associated with conventional contingency-constrained methods relying on explicitly modeling the whole contingency set. The adjustable robust model is formulated as a trilevel programming problem. The upper-level problem aims at minimizing the investment, operation, and system power imbalance costs. The middle-level problem identifies, for a given expansion plan, the contingency state leading to maximum power imbalance if any. Finally, the lower-level problem models the operator's best reaction for a given contingency and investment plan by minimizing the system power imbalance. The resulting trilevel program is solved by a primal-dual algorithm based on Benders decomposition combined with a column-and-constraint generation procedure. The proposed approach is finitely convergent to the optimal solution and provides a measure of the distance to the optimum. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed methodology over conventional contingency-constrained models.

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic energy level balancing between distributed storage devices as a strategy to improve frequency regulation and reliability in droop controlled microgrids. This has been achieved with a distributed multi-agent cooperative control system which modifies the output power of droop controlled storage devices so that they reach a balanced energy state. As the storage devices approach a common energy level they are able to contribute their full power capacity to deal with generation and demand fluctuations in the microgrid. The cooperative control system also provides secondary frequency control, restoring the microgrid to the reference frequency. Simulations have been completed showing that the cooperative control system improves frequency regulation compared to traditional droop control strategies when the storage devices begin at different energy levels and the microgrid experiences generation or demand variability. A control input saturation constraint has been developed which ensures that the cooperative control system will not overload the storage devices.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-agent control strategy to coordinate power sharing between heterogeneous energy storage devices distributed throughout a DC microgrid. Without requiring a central controller, the proposed control strategy extends the benefits offered by hybrid energy storage systems to DC microgrids with batteries and ultracapacitors spatially distributed at different levels of the power distribution hierarchy. The proposed control strategy has the following advantages. 1) The high frequency microgrid load is provided by the ultracapacitors. 2) The low frequency load is provided by batteries used for bulk energy storage during islanded mode, and the main grid during grid connected operation. 3) The ultracapacitor voltages are regulated at a desired reference. 4) State of charge balancing is provided between the batteries. 5) The energy storage systems cooperate based on neighbor-to-neighbor output feedback over a sparse communication network. The only communication requirement is a spanning tree from the ultracapacitor leaders and battery leaders to their respective followers. Simulations are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed control strategy for a 380 VDC datacenter during grid connected and islanded operation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified distributed control strategy for DC microgrid operating modes, without bus voltage signaling or mode detection mechanisms that are normally required for decentralized control strategies. The proposed control strategy is based on the novel integration of distributed controllers for energy balancing between DC microgrid energy storage systems with distributed controllers used to regulate the average DC microgrid bus voltage, and a new method for controlling the grid connected rectifier that maintains the distributed control structure. Under the proposed control strategy, seamless mode transitions are achieved between qualitatively different operating modes, namely, 1) grid connected operation with the rectifier providing load balancing, 2) grid connected operation with the rectifier charging the energy storage systems, and 3) islanded operation. In all operating modes, the average DC microgrid bus voltage is regulated to the microgrid voltage reference, and the energy storage systems are controlled independently of the operating mode to achieve and maintain a balanced energy level. Simulations are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed control strategy for a 380 VDC datacenter with intermittent photovoltaic generation and communication delays expected from a WiFi control network implementation.

Abstract: This paper describes the design of the ERCOT modeling extensions to the IEC 61968/70 standards to enable Common Information Model (CIM) schema support of dynamic ratings methodologies. Implementation of dynamic ratings was driven by current economic and environmental constraints placed on the construction of additional electrical transmission infrastructure, thus creating a need to operate the existing equipment closer to its physical limitations. In order to effectively utilize these dynamic limits, the necessary data constructs must be modeled, so ERCOT extended the CIM representation of the balanced three-phase power system model used to operate its various grid functions, in order to support the modeling and use of dynamic ratings in its operational real-time and congestion hedging market models. This paper also explains how the process utilized in the identification and extension of the CIM model for this purpose is flexible enough for generic application within the power industry.

Abstract: Meeting the reliability requirements in wind integrated power systems is a challenging problem due to the volatility of wind power generation. Wide implementation of demand response (DR) programs is an effective solution for this problem. This paper studies the impacts of DR programs on short-term reliability assessment of wind integrated power systems. A new algorithm including the effects of time and components initial states is presented for short-term reliability evaluation. This algorithm involves a multi-segment optimal power flow (OPF) approach to model the lead-time of DR and reserve resources. Taking into account the uncertainties associated with DR programs, a new model for these programs is also proposed. In addition, a reliability modeling is developed for wind energy conversion systems to be employed in short-term studies. The results show that DR programs can eliminate the negative impacts of wind energy volatility on power system reliability. It is also shown that the actual operating conditions, such as the uncertainties in demand-side participation and elasticity estimation, and the lead-time of remedial resources, may significantly affect the efficiency of DR programs. Therefore, it seems that these issues should also be included in the reliability-based planning of DR resources.

Abstract: The power grid is becoming more dependent on information and communication technologies. Complex networks of advanced sensors such as phasor measurement units (PMUs) are used to collect real time data to improve the observability of the power system. Recent studies have shown that the power grid has significant cyber vulnerabilities which could increase when PMUs are used extensively. Therefore, recognizing and responding to vulnerabilities are critical to the security of the power grid. This paper proposes a risk mitigation model for optimal response to cyber-attacks to PMU networks. We model the optimal response action as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to prevent propagation of the cyber-attacks and maintain the observability of the power system.

Abstract: This paper addresses the multistage expansion planning problem of a distribution system where investments in the distribution network and in distributed generation are jointly considered. Network expansion comprises several alternatives for feeders and transformers. Analogously, the installation of distributed generation takes into account several alternatives for conventional and wind generators. Unlike what is customarily done, a set of candidate nodes for generator installation is considered. Thus, the optimal expansion plan identifies the best alternative, location, and installation time for the candidate assets. The model is driven by the minimization of the net present value of the total cost including the costs related to investment, maintenance, production, losses, and unserved energy. The costs of energy losses are modeled by a piecewise linear approximation. As another distinctive feature, radiality conditions are specifically tailored to accommodate the presence of distributed generation in order to avoid the isolation of distributed generators and the issues associated with transfer nodes. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed-integer linear program for which finite convergence to optimality is guaranteed and efficient off-the-shelf software is available. Numerical results illustrate the effective performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper describes the incorporation of uncertainty and reliability in the dynamic expansion planning of distribution network assets and distributed generation. Several alternatives for the installation of feeders, transformers, and distributed generation are considered. Thus, the optimal expansion plan identifies the best alternative, location, and installation time for the candidate assets under the uncertainty related to demand and renewable energy sources. To that end, an iterative algorithm is devised to yield a pool of high-quality candidate solutions in terms of total investment and operational costs. Each candidate solution results from a stochastic-programming-based model driven by the minimization of the expected investment and operational costs. The associated scenario-based deterministic equivalent is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program for which finite convergence to optimality is guaranteed and efficient off-the-shelf software is available. Standard metrics are subsequently applied to each candidate solution to characterize its reliability so that valuable information is provided to the distribution system planner. Numerical results illustrate the effective performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Demand response programs are currently being proposed as a solution to deal with issues related to peak demand and to improve the operation of the electric power system. In the demand response paradigm, electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently, time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the individual residential demands, innovative electricity price structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient solution approach based on Benders' decomposition to solve a network-constrained ac unit commitment problem under uncertainty. The wind power production is the only source of uncertainty considered in this paper, which is modeled through a suitable set of scenarios. The proposed model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming problem, whose first-stage refers to the day-ahead market, and whose second-stage represents real-time operation. The proposed Benders' approach allows decomposing the original problem, which is mixed-integer nonlinear and generally intractable, into a mixed-integer linear master problem and a set of nonlinear, but continuous subproblems, one per scenario. In addition, to temporally decompose the proposed ac unit commitment problem, a heuristic technique is used to relax the inter-temporal ramping constraints of the generating units. Numerical results from a case study based on the IEEE one-area reliability test system (RTS) demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Residential-scale low carbon technologies (LCTs) can help decarbonizing our economies but can also lead to technical issues, particularly in low voltage (LV) distribution systems. To quantify these problems this work proposes a probabilistic impact assessment methodology. First, realistic 5-min time-series daily profiles are produced for photovoltaic panels, electric heat pumps, electric vehicles, and micro combined heat and power units. Then, to cater for the uncertainties of LCTs (e.g., size, location, and behavior), a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering 100 simulations for different penetration levels (percentage of houses with a LCT). This methodology is applied to 128 real U.K. LV feeders showing that about half of them can have voltage and/or congestion issues at some penetration of LCTs. Furthermore, to identify the relationships between the first occurrence of problems and key feeder parameters (e.g., length, number of customers), a correlation analysis is developed per LCT. Crucially, these results can be translated into lookup tables to help distribution network operators in producing preliminary estimates of the LCT hosting capacity of a given feeder.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of scheduling a large population of electric water heaters (EWHs) by incorporating a physically-based aggregate model of the population into the day-ahead unit commitment (UC). This goal has been accomplished via several innovations: (i) consideration of a large controllable temperature range over which random distributions of heaters can take many different shapes; (ii) modeling the random nature of the heater population and its dynamics via histograms and their transition equations; (iii) for varying levels of energy stored in the EWH population, finding the specific shapes of stationary EWH histograms that have minimum overlaps with the uncontrollable temperature zones; (iv) from such histograms, computing the bounds on the number of heaters that can be turned on/off in terms of the energy stored in the population; (v) incorporating the aggregate EWH power consumed and energy stored and their constraints into a modified UC; (vi) developing a scheme whereby individual EWHs self-dispatch to meet the scheduled histograms along with their aggregate energy and power levels. Numerical simulations illustrate the applicability and benefits of the approach, which, with minor extensions, can be extended to other forms of electric loads with energy storage such as space heating and cooling systems and electric vehicles.

Abstract: Currently, demand response resources can sell load reductions in wholesale energy markets. However, paying for load reductions ultimately results in an unbalanced market, where the amount of resources sold (megawatts) is less than the amount of resources bought (megawatts and "negawatts"). To resolve this imbalance, the ISO must allocate the cost of compensating demand response to those buyers who benefit from reduced LMPs. Current cost allocation methods are quite broad and based on each energy buyer's share of the total load. In an uncongested network, this results in a "fair" allocation of costs, i.e., an allocation proportional to the benefits that each party accrues. However, in a congested network, this is no longer the case, as price separation occurs between nodes. In this paper, we therefore propose a cost allocation method based on LMP sensitivity that accounts for the effect of congestion on the distribution of benefits between nodes with different LMPs. Since this sensitivity-based method only takes into account the cost allocation per node, we also propose a means of allocating costs between individual load serving entities (LSEs) at a single node. Due to this refinement, LSEs are rewarded according to their individual contribution to demand response. Finally, we define a fairness index to evaluate the performance of the proposed method as compared to a load-based allocation. We find that when load reductions are small (1%-3% total load), the fairness index of the proposed method is very close to zero, indicating almost identical benefit to cost ratios for all market participants. Although the fairness index increases with increasing load reductions, results show that even for larger load reductions, the fairness index is still lower for the proposed method than for the load-based allocation method.

Abstract: Integration of wind power generation (WPG) is increasing rapidly worldwide. The variability and uncertainty of wind energy may lead to significant load-generation imbalances resulting in large frequency deviations, hence increasing system operational risks, especially in small and isolated power systems with low inertia and limited capabilities of providing frequency responses. This raises the need for investigating alternatives to current power system operation planning approaches to cope with the uncertain nature of the intermittent generation. This paper presents a risk assessment approach to analyze power system security for operation planning under high penetration of wind power generation. The proposed approach deals with not only steady-state voltage and overload evaluations, but also frequency response adequacy. For fast identification of operational limit violations in the proposed risk assessment method, we develop an analytical procedure for approximating frequency response and assessing the consequences of limit violations without performing dynamic simulations. As a result, the frequency response adequacy assessment can be run simultaneously with the steady-state voltage and overload evaluations. The proposed risk assessment approach is illustrated via its application to a model of a power system with high wind power penetration.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation tool for demand-side management of domestic hot water systems in distribution systems. The tool accurately models and predicts potential peak demand reductions through direct load control of domestic hot water systems. It employs a unique multi-layer thermally stratified hot water cylinder model and Monte Carlo simulations to generate hot water load profiles of domestic customers. To meet peak reduction targets set by the tool user, switching programs found via iterative optimizations are applied to hot water systems. The structure and individual components of the tool are described, and case studies are presented. Impacts of different switching programs on customer's comfort are evaluated and discussed.

Abstract: A recent solution to tackle environmental issues is the electrification of transportation. Effective integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into the grid is important in the process of achieving sustainable development. One of the key solutions regarding the need for charging stations is the installation of PEV parking lots (PLs). However, contrary to common parkings, PLs are constrained by various organizations such as municipalities, urban traffic regulators, and electrical distribution systems. Therefore, this paper aims to allocate PLs in distribution systems with the objective of minimizing system costs including power loss, network reliability, and voltage deviation as possible objectives. A two-stage model has been designed for this purpose. PLs' behavior considering market interactions is optimized at the first stage to provide profit to the PL owner. At the second stage, the PL allocation problem is solved considering various network constraints. Conclusions are duly drawn with a realistic example.

Abstract: The steady-state performance of low frequency AC (LFAC) systems for bulk power transmission is proposed and investigated in this paper. It is demonstrated that the LFAC is superior to the conventional 60 Hz AC system in terms of power transfer capability and voltage stability. An existing power system can increase its power transfer capability by up to more than eleven times if it operates at 5 Hz. In low operating frequency conditions, the transmission overhead line reactance is significantly lowered and thus results in less voltage drop along the line. If the system operating frequency is in the range of 1 to 10 Hz, the voltage profile along a transmission line is comparable to the surge impedance loading at the no-load condition or approaches that of the HVDC system at the full-load condition. More importantly, the V-P and Q-V characteristic curves show that the dependency of voltage on the real and reactive power flow is greatly reduced. In other words, the sensitivity of voltage on reactive power variations is diminished and results in a more stable voltage and a higher stability margin for the LFAC system compared to the conventional 60 Hz system.

Our model works by assessing the impact of consumption aggregation from customers of different types, in order to determine the mean and variance of loading profile in each distribution transformer in the network. Such parameters are then adjusted by correlating with real-time information taken from the supervisory control and data acquisition system. Studies have been conducted on actual data to verify the proposed model and show its application for the optimal meter placement in distribution networks.

Abstract: This paper presents optimal pricing design for demand response (DR) integration in the distribution network. In particular, we study the energy scheduling problem for a load serving entity (LSE) that serves two types of loads, namely inflexible and flexible loads. Inflexible loads are charged under a regular pricing tariff while flexible loads enjoy a dynamic pricing tariff that ensures cost saving for them. Moreover, flexible loads are assumed to be aggregated by several DR aggregators. The interaction between the LSE and its customers is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem where the LSE is the leader and DR aggregators are the followers. The optimal solution of this problem corresponds to the optimal pricing tariff for flexible loads. The key advantage of the proposed model is that it can be readily implemented thanks to its compatibility with existing pricing structures in the retail market. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed approach provides a win-win solution for both the LSE and its customers.

Abstract: Dynamic response of loads has a significant effect on system stability and directly determines the stability margin of the operating point. Inherent uncertainty and natural variability of load models make the stability assessment especially difficult and may compromise the security of the system. We propose a novel mathematical "robust stability" criterion for the assessment of small-signal stability of operating points. Whenever the criterion is satisfied for a given operating point, it provides mathematical guarantees that the operating point will be stable with respect to small disturbances for any dynamic response of the loads. The criterion can be naturally used for identification of operating regions secure from the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation. Several possible applications of the criterion are discussed, most importantly the concept of robust stability assessment (RSA), that could be integrated in dynamic security assessment packages and used in contingency screening and other planning and operational studies.

Abstract: Integration of renewable energy resources in microgrids has been increasing in recent decades. Due to the randomness in renewable resources such as solar and wind, the power generated can deviate from forecasted values. This variation may cause increased operating costs for committing costly reserve units or penalty costs for shedding load. In addition, it is often desired to charge/discharge and coordinate the energy storage units in an efficient and economical way. To address these problems, a novel battery operation cost model is proposed which considers a battery as an equivalent fuel-run generator to enable it to be incorporated into a unit commitment problem. A probabilistic constrained approach is used to incorporate the uncertainties of the renewable sources and load demands into the unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch problems.

Abstract: The integration of the dynamic line rating (DLR) of overhead transmission lines (OTLs) in power systems security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) potentially enhances the overall system security as well as its technical/economic performances. This paper proposes a scalable and computationally efficient approach aimed at integrating the DLR in SCUC problem. The paper analyzes the case of the SCUC with AC load flow constraints. The AC-optimal power flow (AC-OPF) is linearized and incorporated into the problem. The proposed multi-period formulation takes into account a realistic model to represent the different terms appearing in the Heat-Balance Equation (HBE) of the OTL conductors. In order to include the HBE in the OPF, a relaxation is proposed for the heat gain associated to resistive losses while the inclusion of linear approximations are investigated for both convection and radiation heat losses. A decomposition process relying on the Benders decomposition is used in order to breakdown the problem and incorporate a set of contingencies representing both generators and line outages. The effects of different linearization, as well as time step discretization of HBE, are investigated. The scalability of the proposed method is verified using IEEE 118-bus test system.

Abstract: This paper proposes the notion of "critical cluster" in inverter based droop controlled microgrids, thus representing the neighborhood of the distributed generation units that determines the small signal stability margin of the entire system. The clustering starts from the lowest impedance electrical connection between distributed generators, termed as "critical line". At first, the systematic study of few similar microgrids by means of the eigen-value analysis of their small signal models reveals the correlation between the location of their dominant low frequency modes and the individual connections between neighboring inverters. Second, the sensitivity analysis of active power droop gain with respect to network parameters confirms the previous findings and shows the dominating effect of the critical line's impedance. Simulations and small signal analysis studies assess the impact of the choice of various interconnection points when two individual droop controlled islanded microgrids are connected to form a single microgrid. At the same time, simplified models on the basis of critical clusters allow the effective approximation of the stability margin corresponding to the original systems. The results reveal that different interconnection points lead to strong variations in the performance of the coupled microgrid both in terms of transient response and small signal stability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized two-level structure for real-time modal estimation of large power systems using ambient synchrophasor data. It introduces two distributed algorithms that fit the structure well, namely, 1) decentralized frequency domain decomposition and 2) decentralized recursive stochastic subspace identification. As opposed to present-day oscillation monitoring methodologies, the bulk of the algorithmic computations is done locally at the substation level in the two-level framework. Substation modal estimates are sent to the control center where they are grouped, analyzed, and combined to extract system modal properties of local and inter-area modes. The framework and the proposed algorithms provide a scalable methodology for handling oscillation monitoring from a large number of substations efficiently. The two-level structure and the two decentralized algorithms are tested using simulated data from standard test systems and from archived real power system synchrophasor data.

Abstract: Increasing wind penetration in non-interconnected power systems represents a techno-economic challenge for system operators. To accommodate the increased variability and uncertainty adequate reserve levels and advanced solutions that increase the controllability of wind power output, such as hybrid power stations, are used to ensure system stability. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic optimization model for the joint scheduling of energy and reserves of conventional units and hybrid power stations in insular power systems. The proposed methodology is based, in general, on the recently established regulatory framework for the non-interconnected island systems of Greece. The main scope of the paper is to analyze wind and pumped-storage solutions for the normal operation of saturated insular power systems. In this context, the introduction of hypothetical hybrid power stations in a real-life system, the insular power system of Crete, Greece is examined. Test results are analytically presented and thoroughly discussed.

Abstract: Accurate control of deferrable electrical loads results in an aggregate load profile more desirable to the system operator. This in turn could lead to reduced peak consumption of power, less ramping of generators and lower emissions of greenhouse gases. In this paper, we describe an algorithm which automatically schedules deferrable loads. The scheduling is carried out by a greedy algorithm which attempts to reduce the error between the scheduled load profile and a predefined "target" load profile. We develop scheduling algorithms for two scenarios: a notified system where load demands are known in advance and a stochastic system, where load demands are random. The algorithms rely on appropriate approximation methods and are evaluated in a dataset collected from a large number of households. We show the algorithms can be used for reducing peak consumption and describe a correspondence between deferrability and storage devices.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method of describing the load shifting ability of flexible electrical loads in a manner suitable for existing power system dispatch frameworks. The concept of an asymmetric block offer for flexible loads is introduced. This offer structure describes the ability of a flexible load to provide a response to the power system and the subsequent need to recover. The conventional system dispatch algorithm is altered to facilitate the dispatch of demand response units alongside generating units using the proposed offer structure. The value of demand response is assessed through case studies that dispatch flexible supermarket refrigeration loads for the provision of regulating power. The demand resource is described by a set of asymmetric blocks, and a set of four blocks offers is shown to offer cost savings for the procurement of regulating power in excess of 20%. For comparative purposes, the cost savings achievable with a fully observable and controllable demand response resource are evaluated, using a time series model of the refrigeration loads. The fully modeled resource offers greater savings; however the difference is small and potentially insufficient to justify the investment required to fully model and control individual flexible loads.

Abstract: High net load variability, driven by high penetrations of wind and solar generation, will create challenges for system operators in the future, as installed wind generation capacities increase to unprecedented levels globally. Maintaining system reliability, particularly at shorter time-scales, leads to increased levels of conventional plant starts and ramping, and higher levels of wind curtailment, with sub-hourly unit commitment and economic dispatch required to capture the increased cycling burden. The role of energy storage in reducing operating costs and enhancing system flexibility is explored, with key storage plant characteristics for balancing at this time-scale identified and discussed in relation to existing and emerging grid-scale storage technologies. Unit dispatches for the additional storage plant with varying characteristics highlight the unsuitability of energy only markets in incentivizing suitable levels of flexibility for future systems with high net load variability.

Abstract: Load modeling is essential for designing and operating power systems. This paper presents an approach for load modeling on smaller power systems that could be "islanded," an approach that preserves the detail of a full differential equation simulation of relevant loads while requiring far less computation by employing behavioral models of important loads. Mixed domain models, e.g., stochastic, finite-state machine, and differential equation models, are employed to provide accuracy in a computationally tractable framework. Where simple load models may not be adequate, particularly for generation-constrained systems (in a paper by Sotiropoulos et al.), and full models are computationally unfavorable, this approach provides excellent results that enable "what-if" studies and flexible re-evaluation during power system design and operational assessment. Naval vessels, particularly warships with relatively large and increasing load power requirements, offer a unique laboratory for understanding isolated power grids. This paper examines the DDG-51 power distribution system as an example.

Abstract: This paper presents a generalized energy storage system model for voltage and angle stability analysis. The proposed solution allows modeling most common energy storage technologies through a given set of linear differential algebraic equations (DAEs). In particular, the paper considers, but is not limited to, compressed air, superconducting magnetic, electrochemical capacitor and battery energy storage devices. While able to cope with a variety of different technologies, the proposed generalized model proves to be accurate for angle and voltage stability analysis, as it includes a balanced, fundamental-frequency model of the voltage source converter (VSC) and the dynamics of the dc link. Regulators with inclusion of hard limits are also taken into account. The transient behavior of the generalized model is compared with detailed fundamental-frequency balanced models as well as commonly-used simplified models of energy storage devices. A comprehensive case study based on the WSCC 9-bus test system is presented and discussed.

Abstract: The transition to a deregulated electric power system industry has created a highly competitive electricity market with immense power transfer activity performed between the market participants. A poorly-damped oscillation of small-signal instability is usually imminent during a stress power system condition attributed by the base case power transfer or available transfer capability (ATC) compounded with an outage of critical line. The contingency ranking by means of lowest damping ratio is introduced so that execution of the most critical line outage will incite to a poorly-damped oscillation during the base case ATC. The rescheduling of few critical generators determined by using the normalized participation factor is presented in this paper as a novel, non-intricate and cost-effective solution for estimating a new value of ATC while ensuring a secure power system operating condition. Sturdiness of the proposed method is verified through comparison with the weighted-average sensitivity of stability index required for rescheduling the critical generators performed in a case study of 39-bus New England system. Comparative study on the results of cost minimization in generators rescheduling has also been done based on the critical generators selected by the two methods.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient and fast-converging optimization technique based on a modification of the traditional big bang-big crunch method for optimal placement and sizing of voltage controlled distributed generators. The proposed algorithm deals with the optimization problems incorporating multiple distributed generators for the sake of power as well as energy loss minimization in balanced/unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB environment and tested on the 33-bus feeder system and the IEEE 37-node feeder. Validation of the proposed method is done via comparing the results with published results obtained from other competitive methods.

Abstract: The growth of demand response programs and renewable generation is changing the economics of transmission. Planners and regulators require tools to address the implications of possible technology, policy, and economic developments for the optimal configuration of transmission grids. We propose a model for economic evaluation and optimization of inter-regional transmission expansion, as well as the optimal response of generators' investments to locational incentives, that accounts for Kirchhoff's laws and three important nonlinearities. The first is consumer response to energy prices, modeled using elastic demand functions. The second is resistance losses. The third is the product of line susceptance and flows in the linearized DC load flow model. We develop a practical method combining Successive Linear Programming with Gauss-Seidel iteration to co-optimize AC and DC transmission and generation capacities in a linearized DC network while considering hundreds of hourly realizations of renewable supply and load. We test our approach for a European electricity market model including 33 countries. The examples indicate that demand response can be a valuable resource that can significantly affect the economics, location, and amounts of transmission and generation investments. Further, representing losses and Kirchhoff's laws is also important in transmission policy analyses.

Abstract: Small isolated power systems often experience generator outages, which are responsible for the activation of the under-frequency load shedding scheme with the corresponding negative impact on electricity consumers and, hence, market loss. There are three main causes of this problem: the power system's low inertia, the speed governors' low capacity, and a poor size-ratio between generator and system. The most extensive research line in this area is focused on the optimization of the load shedding scheme, which is a partial solution. Another research line is presented to solve the problem from the point of view of the system operator. This paper proposes an online method to predict and correct possible load shedding by redistributing load dispatching. This proposal uses artificial intelligence techniques, in particular neural networks, and a special-purpose power system simulator. In order to evaluate the proposal, the achieved solution is applied to a real case study: the island of Gran Canaria. This application shows the improvement that might be achieved by implementing this simple method. The method proposed in this paper is strongly recommended for regions that have suitable geographical sites as well as energy problems similar to those of the Canary Islands (see tech. rep. "Map of the Canary Islands Power Systems" by Red Electrica de Espana).

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a strengthened MILP formulation for certain gas turbine unit commitment problems, in which the ramping rates are no smaller than the minimum generation amounts. This type of gas turbines can usually start-up faster and have a larger ramping rate, as compared to the traditional coalfired power plants. Recently, the number of this type of gas turbines increases significantly due to affordable gas prices and their scheduling flexibilities to accommodate intermittent renewable energy generation. In this study, several new families of strong valid inequalities are developed to help reduce the computational time to solve these types of problems. Meanwhile, the validity and facet-defining proofs are provided for certain inequalities. Finally, numerical experiments on a modified IEEE 118-bus system and the power system data based on recent studies verify the effectiveness of applying our formulation to model and solve this type of gas turbine unit commitment problems, including reducing the computational time to obtain an optimal solution or obtaining a much smaller optimality gap, as compared to the default CPLEX, when the time limit is reached with no optimal solutions obtained.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of wind farms causes volatile bus net injections. Although these fluctuations are anticipated, their timing, magnitude and duration cannot be predicted accurately. In order to maintain the operational reliability of the system, this uncertainty must be adequately addressed at the day-ahead generation scheduling stage. The ad-hoc reserve rules incorporated in deterministic unit commitment formulations do not adequately account for this uncertainty. Scenario-based stochastic unit commitment formulations model this uncertainty more precisely, but require computationally demanding simulations. Interval and robust optimization techniques require less computing resources, but produce overly conservative and thus expensive generation schedules. This paper proposes a transmission-constrained unit commitment formulation that improves the performance of the interval unit commitment. The uncertainty is modeled using upper and lower bounds, as in the interval formulation, but inter-hour ramp requirements are based on net load scenarios. This improved interval formulation has been tested using the IEEE RTS-96 and compared with existing stochastic, interval and robust unit commitment techniques in terms of solution robustness and cost. These results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing interval technique both in terms of cost and computing time.

Abstract: Energy storage can alleviate the problems that the uncertainty and variability associated with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar create in power systems. Besides applications such as frequency control, temporal arbitrage or the provision of reserve, where the location of storage is not particularly relevant, distributed storage could also be used to alleviate congestion in the transmission network. In such cases, the siting and sizing of this distributed storage is of crucial importance to its cost-effectiveness. This paper describes a three-stage planning procedure to identify the optimal locations and parameters of distributed storage units. In the first stage, the optimal storage locations and parameters are determined for each day of the year individually. In the second stage, a number of storage units is available at the locations that were identified as being optimal in the first stage, and their optimal energy and power ratings are determined. Finally, in the third stage, with both the locations and ratings fixed, the optimal operation of the storage units is simulated to quantify the benefits that they would provide by reducing congestion. The quality of the final solution is assessed by comparing it with the solution obtained at the first stage without constraints on storage sites or size. The approach is numerically tested on the IEEE RTS 96.

Abstract: Day-ahead energy market clearing relies on a deterministic equivalent model with a limited time horizon, which may lead to inefficient scheduling of generating units from the point of view of generators. For this reason, generators may wish to assume the risk of self-committing their units with the hope of securing greater profits. This phenomenon may reduce the room for economic signals in the day-ahead market. In this paper we investigate the influence of risk aversion and price volatility on the decision of generators to self-commit units. We present a stochastic programming model for self-committing combined cycle units under price uncertainty with a conditional value at risk criterion. We use Benders decomposition to solve the problem and present results on a case study to draw conclusions.

Abstract: We present a parallel implementation of Lagrangian relaxation for solving stochastic unit commitment subject to uncertainty in renewable power supply and generator and transmission line failures. We describe a scenario selection algorithm inspired by importance sampling in order to formulate the stochastic unit commitment problem and validate its performance by comparing it to a stochastic formulation with a very large number of scenarios, that we are able to solve through parallelization. We examine the impact of narrowing the duality gap on the performance of stochastic unit commitment and compare it to the impact of increasing the number of scenarios in the model. We report results on the running time of the model and discuss the applicability of the method in an operational setting.

Abstract: Contingency analysis has been an integral part of power system planning and operations. Dynamic contingency analysis is often performed with offline simulation studies, due to its intense computational effort. Due to a large number of possible system variations, covering all combinations in planning studies is very challenging. Contingencies must be chosen carefully to cover a wider group of possibilities, while ensuring system security. This paper proposes a method to classify dynamic contingencies into different clusters, according to their behavioral patterns, in particular, with respect to voltage recovery patterns. The most severe contingency from each cluster becomes the representative of other contingencies in the corresponding cluster. Using the information of contingency clusters, a new concept called dynamic voltage control area (DVCA) is derived. The concept of DVCA will address the importance of the location of dynamic reactive reserves. Simulations have been completed on the modified IEEE 162-bus system to test and validate the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a mixed-integer formulation with nonlinear production functions of the day-ahead hydro unit commitment problem for hydro-dominant power systems. The objective is to minimize unit startup and shutdown costs and maximize water use efficiency in the daily operation of multiple hydro plants. Determination of hourly generation dispatches and unit configurations is subject to reservoir dynamics, power balance, as well as target constraints coupling short-term generation with long-term reservoir operation goals. In addition, ac power flow constraints are considered. An equivalent quadratically-constrained quadratic formulation is approximated by successive convex semidefinite programming relaxations in a branch-and-bound algorithm for optimal solutions. Numerical case studies for several system configurations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the relaxation algorithm.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, a least-cost generation capacity expansion model to control carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is proposed in this paper. The mathematical model employs a decomposed two-stage stochastic integer program. Realizations of uncertain load and wind are represented by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random samples generated via the Gaussian copula method. Two policies that affect CO2 emissions directly and indirectly, carbon tax and renewable portfolio standard (RPS), are investigated to assess how much CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced through those policies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a two-stage stochastic program for transmission planning. The model has two dependent random variables, namely, total electric load and available wind power. Given univariate marginal distributions for these two random variables and their correlation coefficient, the joint distribution is modeled using a Gaussian copula. The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is solved based on the linearized direct current (DC) power flow. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) network model and its load and wind data are used for a test case. A 95% confidence interval is formed on the optimality gap of candidate solutions obtained using a sample average approximation with 200 and 300 samples from the joint distribution of load and wind.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of shortage of ramping resources in the real-time operation of power systems. To explain and remedy this problem systematically, in this paper we take a novel look at the way the day-ahead unit commitment (UC) problem represents the information about load, generation and ramping constraints. We specifically investigate the approximation error made in mapping of the original problem, that would decide the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories of the committed generating units, onto the discrete-time problem that is solved in practice. We first show that current practice amounts to approximating the trajectories with linear splines. We then offer a different representation through cubic splines that provides physically feasible schedules and increases the accuracy of the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories by capturing sub-hourly variations and ramping of load in the day-ahead power system operation. The corresponding day-ahead UC model is formulated as an instance of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), with the same number of binary variables as the traditional UC formulation. Numerical simulation over real load data from the California ISO demonstrate that the proposed UC model reduces the total day-ahead and real-time operation cost, and the number of events of ramping scarcity in the real-time operations.

Abstract: The variable and uncertain nature of the leading renewable energy resources, such as wind power generation, imposes the development of a sophisticated balance mechanism between supply and demand to maintain the consistency of a power system. In this study, a two stage stochastic programming model is proposed to procure the required load-following reserves from both generation and demand side resources under high wind power penetration. Besides, a novel load model is introduced to procure flexible reserves from industrial clients. Load following reserves from load serving entities (LSE) are also taken into account as well as network constraints, load shedding and wind spillage. The proposed methodology is applied to an illustrative test system, as well as to a 24-node system.

Abstract: This paper deals with the distribution network reconfiguration problem in a multi-objective scope, aiming to determine the optimal radial configuration by means of minimizing the active power losses and a set of commonly used reliability indices formulated with reference to the number of customers. The indices are developed in a way consistent with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. A key contribution of the paper is the efficient implementation of the epsilon-constraint method using lexicographic optimization in order to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. After the Pareto efficient solution set is generated, the resulting configurations are evaluated using a backward/forward sweep load-flow algorithm to verify that the solutions obtained are both non-dominated and feasible. Since the epsilon-constraint method generates the Pareto front but does not incorporate decision maker (DM) preferences, a multi-attribute decision making procedure, namely, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, is used in order to rank the obtained solutions according to the DM preferences, facilitating the final selection. The applicability of the proposed method is assessed on a classical test system and on a practical distribution system.

Abstract: This paper investigates load frequency control (LFC) of power systems with probabilistic interval delays. The LFC design specifically takes the probability distribution characteristic of the communication delays into account. Firstly, by considering the probability distribution characteristic of the communication delays in the modeling, the original power systems with a PI-based LFC are transformed into a stochastic closed-loop time-delay system. Secondly, by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, sufficient delay-distribution-dependent stability and stabilization criteria are derived for the power systems with a PI-based LFC. Following this, an algorithm is provided to obtain the gain of PI-based LFC and the allowable upper bound of the communication delay simultaneously while preserving the desired performance. Finally, a case study is applied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed delay-distribution-dependent PI-based LFC design method.

Abstract: The feeder reconfiguration problem chooses the on/off status of the switches in a distribution network in order to minimize a certain cost such as power loss. It is a mixed-integer nonlinear program and, hence, hard to solve. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm that is based on the recently developed convex relaxation of the ac optimal power flow problem. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales linearly with the number of redundant lines. It requires neither parameter tuning nor initialization for different networks. It successfully computes an optimal configuration on all four networks we have tested. Moreover, we have proved that the algorithm solves the feeder reconfiguration problem optimally under certain conditions for the case where only a single redundant line needs to be opened. We also propose a more computationally efficient algorithm and show that it incurs a loss in optimality of less than 3% on the four test networks.

Abstract: This paper formulates an optimality criterion for the selection of synchrophasor signals to be used in ambient mode estimators. This criterion, which is associated with each measured signal and each dominant mode, is defined as the asymptotic variance of the corresponding estimated mode damping ratio. The value of the criterion is computed directly from an estimated autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. Because the online computation of the defined criterion (for each measured signal in the system) may be computationally expensive, a fast pre-selection method for initial signal ranking is formulated. The pre-selection method is used to effectively determine a set of the candidate signals for which the formal criterion is evaluated in a second stage. The methodology is illustrated using synthetic measurements from the KTH Nordic 32 and the IEEE 39-bus test systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new formulation for the corrective security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem with DC power flow constraints. The goal is to produce a generation schedule which has a minimal number of post-contingency corrections as well as a minimal amount of total MW rescheduled. In other words, the new SCOPF model effectively clears contingencies with corrective actions that have a minimal impact on system operations. The proposed SCOPF model utilizes sparse optimization techniques to achieve computational tractability for large-scale power systems. We also propose two efficient decomposition algorithms. Extensive computational experiments show the advantage of the proposed model and algorithms on several standard IEEE test systems and large-scale real-world power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of hydro power plants with pelton-type turbine-generator sets that are coupled hydraulically and electrically. In particular, the dynamic behavior and speed performance of this type of power plants at black-start is analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD) and relative gain array (RGA). Following, robust control theory is used to design a hydro-stabilizer that improves the performance of coupled turbines while accounting for typical uncertainties in actuators.

Abstract: This paper discusses methods for estimation of area's frequency response characteristic (AFRC) during large frequency changes. The operating point changes significantly during such transient events; consequently the estimation method should adapt to the time-varying nature of the AFRC. Moreover, available measurements have a poor time resolution and are considerably contaminated by errors. Therefore, new estimation methods are proposed that are based on local correlation between the frequency deviation and interchange power variation measured on all area's tie-lines. The presented estimation methods were compared with a classical approach that is based on the ratio of mean changes as well as with conventional least squares parameter estimators. Extensive numerical simulations and field measurements were applied for performance evaluation, where the obtained results show robust and satisfactorily accurate responses of the proposed estimation methods.

Abstract: This letter presents an unambiguous distance-based mixed-integer quadratic programming (UDB-MIQP) model to solve economic dispatch problems with disjoint operating zones. By considering the distances among the prohibited zones, the unnecessary variables will be eliminated and, consequently, a significant decrease, both in terms of variables and constraints, is obtained. The results show that the UDB model compared to existing MIQP models in the literature can achieve the global optimal solution with a significantly reduced problem complexity, both in terms of variables and constraints. In addition, the results indicate the superiority of the method in computational time reduction.

Abstract: In Part I of this tutorial, we provided a canonical modeling framework for sequential, stochastic optimization (control) problems. A major feature of this framework is a clear separation of the process of modeling a problem, versus the design of policies to solve the problem. In Part II, we provide additional discussion behind some of the more subtle concepts such as the construction of a state variable. We illustrate the modeling process using an energy storage problem. We then create five variations of this problem designed to bring out the features of the different policies. The first four of these problems demonstrate that each of the four classes of policies is best for particular problem characteristics. The fifth policy is a hybrid that illustrates the ability to combine the strengths of multiple policy classes.

Abstract: There is a wide range of problems in energy systems that require making decisions in the presence of different forms of uncertainty. The fields that address sequential, stochastic decision problems lack a standard canonical modeling framework, with fragmented, competing solution strategies. Recognizing that we will never agree on a single notational system, this two-part tutorial proposes a simple, straightforward canonical model (that is most familiar to people with a control theory background), and introduces four fundamental classes of policies which integrate the competing strategies that have been proposed under names such as control theory, dynamic programming, stochastic programming and robust optimization. Part II of the tutorial illustrates the modeling framework using a simple energy storage problem, where we show that, depending on the problem characteristics, each of the four classes of policies may be best.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel solution method is proposed for the optimal topology control problem in AC framework with N-1 reliability. The resultant new topology of the proposed method is guaranteed to yield a better objective function value than the global solution of the problem with the original topology. In order to prove our statement, semi-definite programming relaxation is formulated to find a lower bound to the objective function value of the problem. The proposed method is favorable for parallelization to increase the computational efficiency, and the parallel computing flowchart is presented. Computational time of the algorithm for IEEE test cases is reported. An in-house power market simulator is developed to simulate a market environment complete with optimal topology control mechanism. Simulations held by participating human subjects are analyzed under the subtitles of the total operating cost, real power losses, and locational marginal price (LMP) variance. A simple example is illustrated to show that the resultant network topology may increase the real power losses while still providing a lower operating system cost than that of the original topology.

Abstract: Non-local measurements from wide area measurement systems can be used to synthesize feedback signals for FACTS or HVDC based power oscillation damping controllers. Although non-local feedback signals may have better damping influence than local feedback signals, they involve greater complexity and reduced robustness due to the possibility of partial or complete loss of communication. A composite control strategy is proposed in this paper, which uses both local and non-local feedback channels to achieve enhanced damping and improved robustness. Special local signals and their non-local equivalents are identified for series reactive and shunt real power injection devices, which facilitate the design of controllers with a simple structure and fewer parameters. Unlike modal speed signals, synthesis of these signals does not require an online eigen-solution. Case studies are presented which demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of this strategy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for the probabilistic risk assessment of rotor angle instability in power systems using fuzzy inference systems (FISs). The novel two-step approach first models the stochastic uncertainties present within the power system to produced probability density functions (pdfs) for stability indicators. These stability indicators are established for both small and large disturbance rotor angle stability analysis. The pdfs produced are subsequently decomposed into regions based on user-specified threshold values. The outputs from this decomposition are analyzed using fuzzy techniques to complete the risk assessment of instability. The methodology is applied to a multi-area test network into which a VSC-MTDC grid has been embedded to support power transfer from a number of large wind farms. This new combination of probabilistic and fuzzy techniques is shown to provide an effective methodology for quantifying the influence of system uncertainties on the risks of rotor angle stability.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates a number of uncertainty importance measures for use in power system stability studies. Sensitivity analysis of uncertain system parameters is vital as new technologies proliferate and the total level of system uncertainty grows. Accurate assessment of the importance of different uncertainties can guide power system operators towards parameters which will require the greatest levels of mitigation or increased monitoring in order to reduce the uncertainty and its subsequent impact. Local and global sensitivity analysis techniques are described and evaluated within this paper, including nonparametric methods, variance-based approaches, and distribution-based techniques. The techniques are illustrated using a large 295-bus realistic network model of a generic distribution system. Numerical experiments on dynamic models are used in order to assess the impact of uncertainties on the mitigation of system frequency excursions using single-site and distributed energy storage devices.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to efficiently estimate the probability of small-disturbance rotor angle instability of uncertain power systems. Traditional Monte Carlo (MC) approaches are computationally intensive and inefficient, particularly when used to study low probability conditions which result in small disturbance instabilities and develop into serious outage events high impact. The proposed methodology uses importance sampling to focus on conditions which contain the high information content required to make relevant decisions about low probability events. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is used to efficiently bound the search space and identify operating conditions leading to a marginally stable or unstable system response. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a model of a multi-area transmission network with a significant capacity of intermittent generation connected through a multi-terminal voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) grid. It is demonstrated that the methodology yields accurate results with just a small fraction of the sample points required using a conventional numerical MC approach.

Abstract: In this paper, the empirical observability Gramian calculated around the operating region of a power system is used to quantify the degree of observability of the system states under specific phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement. An optimal PMU placement method for power system dynamic state estimation is further formulated as an optimization problem which maximizes the determinant of the empirical observability Gramian and is efficiently solved by the NOMAD solver, which implements the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm. The implementation, validation, and the robustness to load fluctuations and contingencies of the proposed method are carefully discussed. The proposed method is tested on WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system and NPCC 48-machine 140-bus system by performing dynamic state estimation with square-root unscented Kalman filter. The simulation results show that the determined optimal PMU placements by the proposed method can guarantee good observability of the system states, which further leads to smaller estimation errors and larger number of convergent states for dynamic state estimation compared with random PMU placements. Under optimal PMU placements an obvious observability transition can be observed. The proposed method is also validated to be very robust to both load fluctuations and contingencies.

Abstract: In this paper, the interactions between component failures are quantified and the interaction matrix and interaction network are obtained. The quantified interactions can capture the general propagation patterns of the cascades from utilities or simulation, thus helping to better understand how cascading failures propagate and to identify key links and key components that are crucial for cascading failure propagation. By utilizing these interactions a high-level probabilistic model called interaction model is proposed to study the influence of interactions on cascading failure risk and to support online decision-making. It is much more time-efficient to first quantify the interactions between component failures with fewer original cascades from a more detailed cascading failure model and then perform the interaction model simulation than it is to directly simulate a large number of cascades with a more detailed model. Interaction-based mitigation measures are suggested to mitigate cascading failure risk by weakening key links, which can be achieved in real systems by wide-area protection such as blocking of some specific protective relays. The proposed interaction quantifying method and interaction model are validated with line outage data generated by the AC OPA cascading simulations on the IEEE 118-bus system.

Abstract: Uncertainty and geographical diversity of wind speeds create risk for a wind power generation company (WGenco) to make the maximum profit from power market trading. A probabilistic approach is proposed to estimate the profit of a WGenco considering geographical diversity and uncertainty of wind speeds and market prices. The objective of the optimization problem is to assist a WGenco to do the optimal bidding in market trading in order to make the maximum profit under various market and wind speed uncertainties. The point estimate method (PEM) has been improved to facilitate stochastic modeling of the aggregated power output of wind turbine generators in different locations in the problem formulation. The principal component analysis (PCA) is used to manage correlated wind speeds.

Abstract: This paper studies the general problem of operating energy storage under uncertainty. Two fundamental sources of uncertainty are considered, namely the uncertainty in the unexpected fluctuation of the net demand process and the uncertainty in the locational marginal prices. We propose a very simple algorithm termed Online Modified Greedy (OMG) algorithm for this problem. A stylized analysis for the algorithm is performed, which shows that comparing to the optimal cost of the corresponding stochastic control problem, the sub-optimality of OMG is controlled by an easily computable bound. This suggests that, albeit simple, OMG is guaranteed to have good performance in cases when the bound is small. Meanwhile, OMG together with the sub-optimality bound can be used to provide a lower bound for the optimal cost. Such a lower bound can be valuable in evaluating other heuristic algorithms. For the latter cases, a semidefinite program is derived to minimize the sub-optimality bound of OMG. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the use of the algorithm.

Abstract: Dynamic line rating based on real time meteorological data has been shown to be useful in transmission line capacity management. Based on a binary rating forecast, we propose a distributionally robust congestion management model that selectively uses dynamic ratings on critical lines and keeps the risk of thermal overloading below a prescribed level. A case study illustrates that the proposed model can effectively alleviate transmission congestion with a low error rate.

Abstract: Due to the significant variability and uncertainty of wind power over short time scales, high penetration of wind power can be problematic in an electric grid. One of the critical issues is how to keep increasing wind penetration without jeopardizing grid security and reliability. This paper explores the possibility of changing transmission network topology, by transmission switching, to accommodate higher utilization of wind power and reduce the generation costs of thermal units. Considering the uncertainty in wind power output, we use chance constraints to ensure that the wind energy utilized exceeds a minimal usage level at a certain probability. We develop a deterministic approximation approach using sample average approximation and provide a strong extended formulation. Numerical results show the potential benefit the proposed model can achieve.

Abstract: The restoration of the bulk power system after a partial or complete blackout relies on black-start (BS) resources. To prepare for system restoration, it is important to procure the right amount of BS resources at the right locations in the grid so that the total restoration time can be minimized. Achieving this goal requires that resource procurement planning takes the restoration process into account. In this study, we integrate the BS resource procurement decision with a restoration planning model and develop an optimization model that produces a minimal cost procurement plan that satisfies the restoration time requirement.

Abstract: As a clean fuel source, natural gas plays an important role in achieving a low-carbon economy in the power industry. Owing to the uncertainties introduced by increasing utilization of natural gas in electric power system, gas system and electricity system should be planned in an integrated manner. When considering these two systems simultaneously, there are many emerging difficulties, e.g., increased system complexity and risk, market timeline mismatch, overall system reliability evaluation, etc. In this paper, a novel expansion co-planning (ECP) framework is proposed to address the above challenges. In our approach, the planning process is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem. The best augmentation option is a plan with the highest cost/benefit ratio. Benefits of expansion planning considered are reductions in operation cost, carbon emission cost, and unreliability cost. By identifying several scenarios based on statistical analysis and expert knowledge, decision analysis is used to tackle market uncertainties. The operational and economic interdependency of both systems are well analyzed. Case studies on a three-bus gas and two-bus power system, plus the Victorian integrated gas and electricity system in Australia are presented to validate the performance of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Natural gas is an important fuel source in the power industry. Electricity and natural gas are both energy that can be directly consumed. To improve the overall efficiency of the energy infrastructure, it is imperative that the expansion of gas power plants, electricity transmission lines and gas pipelines can be co-planned. The co-planning process is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem to handle conflicting objectives simultaneously. We propose a novel model to identify the optimal co-expansion plan in terms of social welfare. To evaluate the robustness of plans under different scenarios, the flexibility criterion is used to identify each plan's adaptation cost to uncertainties, such as demand growth, fuel cost and financial constraints, etc. We developed a systematic and comprehensive planning model to understand, develop and optimize energy grids in order to reach higher social welfare, and is therefore of great importance in terms of supporting and guiding investment decisions for the power and gas industry. Meanwhile, we use the sequential importance sampling (SIS) to perform scenario reduction for achieving a higher computational efficiency. A comprehensive case study on the integrated IEEE 14-bus and a test gas system is conducted to validate our approach.

Abstract: The restructuring of electric power industry has brought in plenty of challenges for transmission expansion planning (TEP), mainly due to uncertainties. The commonly used probabilistic TEP approach requires the network to meet an acceptable risk criterion. However, a series of blackouts in recent years caused by extreme weather-related events have raised the concerns about network vulnerability through calculating the expected risk value. In this paper, we have proposed the concept that TEP should be economically adjusted in order to make network less vulnerable to extreme events (EEs) caused by climate change, e.g., floods or ice storms. We firstly give the explicit definitions of economic adjustment (EA) index and adjusted risk value. Then we formulate our model as a risk-based decision making process while satisfying the deterministic criterion. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system. Results based on various risk aversion levels are given and comparison studies with other risk-based TEP approaches have been done. Also, sensitivity analysis of parameter setting has been conducted. According to the numerical results, the proposed risk-based TEP model is a flexible decision-making tool, which can help decision makers make a tradeoff between economy and security.

Abstract: In a carbon-constrained world, the continuing and rapid growth of gas-fired power generation (GPG) will lead to the increasing demand for natural gas. The reliable and affordable gas supply hence becomes an important factor to consider in power system planning. Meanwhile, the installation of GPG units should take into account not only the fuel supply constraints but also the capability of sending out the generated power. In this paper, a novel expansion co-planning (ECP) model is proposed, aiming to minimize the overall capital and operational costs for the coupled gas and power systems. Moreover, linear formulations are introduced to deal with the nonlinear nature of the objective functions and constraints. Furthermore, the physical and economic interactions between the two systems are simulated by an iterative process. The proposed linear co-planning approach is tested on a simple six-bus power system with a seven-node gas system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system with a 14-node gas system. Numerical results have demonstrated that our co-planning approach can allow systematic investigations on supporting cost-effective operating and planning decisions for power systems.

Abstract: High penetrations of domestic electric vehicles (EVs) in U.K. low voltage (LV) networks may result in significant technical problems. This paper proposes an implementable, centralized control algorithm, currently being trialed in 9 U.K. residential LV networks, that uses limited information to manage EV charging points to mitigate these technical problems. Two real U.K. LV networks are used to quantify the potential impacts of different EV penetration levels and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control algorithm (using different control cycles) for simultaneous thermal and voltage management. Monte Carlo simulations (adopting 1-min resolution data) are undertaken to cater for domestic and EV demand uncertainties. Results for these LV networks show that problems may occur for EV penetrations higher than 20%. More importantly, they highlight that even for a 100% penetration and control cycles of up to 10 min, the control algorithm successfully mitigates problems on the examined LV networks. Crucially, to determine effects on the comfort of EV users, a metric is introduced and discussed. The results of different control settings are presented to analyze potential adaptations of the control strategy. Finally, a comparison with an optimization framework highlights that the proposed algorithm is as effective while using limited information.

Abstract: This paper applies a new technique for modal decomposition based solely on measurements to test systems and demonstrates the technique's capability for partitioning a power network, which determines the points of separation in an is landing strategy. The mathematical technique is called the Koopman mode analysis (KMA) and stems from a spectral analysis of the so-called Koopman operator. Here, KMA is numerically approximated by applying an Arnoldi-like algorithm recently first applied to power system dynamics. In this paper we propose a practical data-driven algorithm incorporating KMA for network partitioning. Comparisons are made with two techniques previously applied for the network partitioning: spectral graph theory which is based on the eigenstructure of the graph Laplacian, and slow-coherency which identifies coherent groups of generators for a specified number of low-frequency modes. The partitioning results share common features with results obtained with graph theory and slow-coherency-based techniques. The suggested partitioning method is evaluated with two test systems, and similarities between Koopman modes and Laplacian eigenvectors are showed numerically and elaborated theoretically.

Abstract: A method for solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem including HVDC connected offshore wind farms is presented in this paper. Different factors have been considered in the proposed method, namely, voltage source converter (VSC-HVDC) and line-commutated converter high-voltage DC (LCC-HVDC) link constraints, doubly fed induction generators' (DFIGs) capability curve as well as the uncertainties of wind power generation. Information gap decision theory (IGDT) is utilized for handling the uncertainties associated with the volatility of wind power generation. It is computationally efficient and does not require the probability density function of wind speed. The proposed decision-making framework finds the optimal decision variables in a way that they remain robust against the considered uncertainties. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied on the IEEE 118-bus system. The obtained results validate the applicability of the proposed IGDT-based OPF model for optimal operation of AC/DC power systems with high penetration of offshore wind farms.

Abstract: This paper investigates the interconnection of current-source converters (CSCs) to a very weak grid using the conventional vector control in the rotating reference frame. It is shown that the system stability is degraded under weak-grid conditions due to the implementation of the synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (PLL). Supplementary controllers are proposed and integrated to the outermost control loops of the CSC to alleviate the associated negative impacts of the PLL. The proposed compensators do not alter the dynamic characteristics of the conventional vector control. More importantly, they enable the CSC to inject 1.0 per-unit of active power at a unity short-circuit ratio. Small-signal stability analysis and controllers design procedures are presented in details. The design of the proposed compensators is independent of the conventional vector control and hence no extensive coordination and parameters tuning are needed. Time-domain simulations results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

Abstract: We consider an energy management system that controls a cluster of price-responsive demands. Besides these demands, it also manages a wind-power plant and an energy storage facility. Demands, wind-power plant, and energy storage facility are interconnected within a small size electric energy system equipped with smart grid technology and constitute a virtual power plant that can strategically buy and sell energy in both the day-ahead and the real-time markets. To this end, we propose a two-stage procedure based on robust optimization. In the first stage, the bidding strategy in the day-ahead market is decided. In the second stage, and once the actual scheduling in the day-ahead market is known, we decide the bidding strategy in the real-time market for each hour of the day. We consider that the virtual power plant behaves as a price taker in these markets. Robust optimization is used to deal with uncertainties in wind-power production and market prices, which are represented through confidence bounds. Results of a realistic case study are provided to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a general framework for determining the effect of communication delays on the convergence of certain distributed frequency regulation (DFR) protocols for prosumer-based energy systems, where prosumers are serving as balancing areas. DFR relies on iterative and distributed optimization algorithms to obtain an optimal feedback law for frequency regulation. But, it is, in general, hard to know beforehand how many iterations suffice to ensure stability. This paper develops a framework to determine a lower bound on the number of iterations required for two distributed optimization protocols. This allows prosumers to determine whether they can compute stabilizing control strategies within an acceptable time frame by taking communication delays into account. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated on two realistic power systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating the cost of a transmission system among load and generator entities. It is a known instance of the classical cooperative game theoretic problem. To solve this problem is a formidable task, as we are dealing with a combinatorial game with transferable utilities. This is an NP hard problem. Therefore, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Marginal pricing is a pragmatic alternative to solve this problem since both Kirchhoff current law and voltage law are strictly adhered to. However, the generic complexity of cooperative game theoretic problems cannot be just wished away. It now manifests as the difficulty in choosing an economic slack bus, which may even be dispersed. We propose the application of min-max fairness policy to solve this problem and give an algorithm which will run in polynomial time. During network cost allocation, min-max fairness policy minimizes the maximum regret among participating entities at each step. Maximum regret is measured in terms of price, and lexicographic application of this principle leads to a fair and unique equilibrium price vector. Results on a large network demonstrate fairness as well as tractability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The Holomorphic Embedding Load-Flow Method (HELM) solves the power-flow problem to obtain the bus voltages as rational approximants, that is, a ratio of complex-valued polynomials of the embedding parameter. The proof of its claims (namely that: 1) it is guaranteed to find a solution if it exists; 2) it is guaranteed to find only a high-voltage (operable) solution; and 3) that it unequivocally signals if no solution exists) are rooted in complex analysis and the theory developed by Antonio Trias and Herbert Stahl. HELM is one variant of the holomorphic embedding method (HEM) for solving nonlinear equations, the details of which may differ from those available in its published patents. In this paper we show that the HEM represents a distinct class of nonlinear equation solvers that are recursive, rather than iterative. As such, for any given problem, there are an infinite number of HEM formulations, each with different numerical properties and precision demands. The objective of this paper is to provide an intuitive understanding of HEM and apply one variant to the power-flow problem. We introduce one possible PV bus model compatible with the HEM and examine some features of different holomorphic embeddings, giving step-by-step details of model building, germ calculation, and the recursive algorithm.

Abstract: Due to progressive displacement of conventional power plants by wind turbines, dynamic security of large-scale wind integrated power systems is significantly compromised. In this paper we first highlight the importance of dynamic reactive power support/voltage security in large-scale wind integrated power systems with least presence of conventional power plants. Then we propose a mixed integer dynamic optimization based method for optimal dynamic reactive power allocation in large-scale wind integrated power systems. One of the important aspect of the proposed methodology is that unlike static optimal power flow based approaches, the proposed method considers detailed system dynamics and wind turbine grid code compliance while optimizing the allocation of dynamic reactive power sources. We also advocate that in large-scale wind integrated power systems, 1) better utilization of existing wind turbines especially wind farms with additional grid support functionalities like dynamic support (e.g., dynamic reactive power support, etc.) and 2) refurbishment of existing conventional central power plants to synchronous condensers could be one of the efficient, reliable and cost-effective option to address not only the issue of dynamic voltage security but also to strengthen other dynamic capabilities of the system including system inertia, etc. that are also significant challenges in large-scale wind penetrated power system. The proposed methodology is applied to the detailed model of the western Danish power system which is characterized by large-scale wind integration and least presence of central power plants.

Abstract: Frequency-scan approaches for conducting Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction (SSCI) studies of wind farms is becoming a normal practice in the industry. Modern power electronics control used in many wind generators has a characteristic that couples two frequency components, similar to saliency effects of conventional generators. As a consequence, treating both wind farm and grid as single-dimension impedances could generate an inaccurate result. This paper describes a two-dimension transfer function approach that can be practically applied to ensure accuracy when evaluating SSCI aspects of power-electronic equipment such as renewable generation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic power flow analysis technique based on the stochastic response surface method. The probability distributions and statistics of power flow responses can be accurately and efficiently estimated by the proposed method without using series expansions such as the Gram-Charlier, Cornish-Fisher, or Edgeworth series. The stochastic continuous input variables following normal distributions such as loads or non-normal distributions such as photovoltaic generation and wind power and their multiple correlations can be easily modeled. The correctness, effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparing the probabilistic power flow analysis results of the IEEE 14-bus and 57-bus standard test systems obtained from the proposed method, the point estimate method, and the Monte Carlo simulation method.

Abstract: The potential for cascading failure in power systems adds substantially to overall reliability risk. Monte Carlo sampling can be used with a power system model to estimate this impact, but doing so is computationally expensive. This paper presents a new approach to estimating the risk of large cascading blackouts triggered by multiple contingencies. The method uses a search algorithm (Random Chemistry) to identify blackout-causing contingencies, and then combines the results with outage probabilities to estimate overall risk. Comparing this approach with Monte Carlo sampling for two test cases (the IEEE RTS-96 and a 2383-bus model of the Polish system) illustrates that the new approach is at least two orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo, without introducing measurable bias. Moreover, the approach enables one to compute the sensitivity of overall blackout risk to individual component-failure probabilities in the initiating contingency, allowing one to quickly identify low-cost strategies for reducing risk. By computing the sensitivity of risk to individual initial outage probabilities for the Polish system, we found that reducing three line-outage probabilities by 50% would reduce cascading failure risk by 33%. Finally, we used the method to estimate changes in risk as a function of load. Surprisingly, this calculation illustrates that risk can sometimes decrease as load increases.

Abstract: The adoption of residential-scale low carbon technologies, such as photovoltaic panels or electric vehicles, is expected to significantly increase in the near future. Therefore, it is important for distribution network operators (DNOs) to understand the impacts that these technologies may have, particularly, on low voltage (LV) networks. The challenge, however, is that these LV networks are large in number and diverse in characteristics. In this work, four clustering algorithms (hierarchical clustering, k-++, improved k-++, and Gaussian Mixture Model-GMM), are applied to a set of 232 residential LV feeders from the North West of England to obtain representative feeders. Moreover, time-series monitoring data, presence of residential-scale generation, and detailed customer classification are considered in the analysis. Multiple validity indices are used to identify the most suitable algorithm. The improved k-++ and GMM showed the best performances resulting in eleven representative feeders with prominent characteristics such as number and type of customers, total cable length, neutral current, and presence of generation. Crucially, the results from studies performed on these feeders can then be extrapolated to those they represent, simplifying the analyses to be carried out by DNOs. This is demonstrated with a hosting capacity assessment of photovoltaic panels in LV feeders.

Abstract: This paper proposes a quasi-steady-state modeling approach for an approximation of long-term frequency dynamics in power systems. A specific phenomenon of concern is an onset of frequency swings during load/generation imbalance scenarios. The effects of system voltage characteristics, system inertia, and, more importantly, damping controllers are explained and quantified using the described quasi-steady-state models. Application of the methodology to a 14-generator benchmark system demonstrates that described models are suitable for simulation of different disturbance scenarios that can trigger frequency instability. Moreover, linearization of the proposed models can provide convenient means for impact assessment and coordinated design of damping controllers. To demonstrate this, coordinated tuning of multiband power system stabilizers to improve frequency dynamics has been performed and validated through nonlinear simulations using a commercial transient stability software.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to optimally set the reactive power contributions of distributed energy resources (DERs) present in distribution systems with the goal of regulating bus voltages. For the case when the network is balanced, we use the branch power flow modeling approach for radial power systems to formulate an optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Then, we leverage properties of the system operating conditions to relax certain nonlinear terms of this OPF, which results in a convex quadratic program (QP). To efficiently solve this QP, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we include the unbalanced three-phase formulation to extend the ideas introduced for the balanced network case. We present several case studies to demonstrate the method in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to optimally set the tap position of voltage regulation transformers in distribution systems. We cast the problem as a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP), in which the transformer tap ratios are captured by 1) introducing a secondary-side "virtual" bus per transformer, and 2) constraining the values that these virtual bus voltages can take according to the limits on the tap positions. Then, by relaxing the non-convex rank-1 constraint in the rank-constrained SDP formulation, one obtains a convex SDP problem. The tap positions are determined as the ratio between the primary-side bus voltage and the secondary-side virtual bus voltage that result from the optimal solution of the relaxed SDP, and then rounded to the nearest discrete tap values. To efficiently solve the relaxed SDP, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We present several case studies with single- and three-phase distribution systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed ADMM-based algorithm, and compare its results with centralized solution methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to solve the restoration problem in balanced radial distribution systems. The restoration problem, originally modeled as mixed integer nonlinear programming, is transformed into a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem, which can be solved efficiently using several commercial solvers based on the efficient optimization technique family branch and bound. The proposed mathematical model considers several objectives in a single objective function, using parameters to preserve the hierarchy of the different objectives: 1) maximizing the satisfaction of the demand, 2) minimizing the number of switch operations, 3) prioritizing the automatic switch operation rather than a manual one, and 4) prioritizing especial loads. General and specialized tests were carried out on a 53-node test system, and the results were compared with other previously proposed algorithms. Results show that the mathematical model is robust, efficient, flexible, and presents excellent performance in finding optimal solutions.

Abstract: The problem of imbalance detection in a three-phase power system using a phasor measurement unit (PMU) is considered. A general model for the zero, positive, and negative sequences from a PMU measurement at off-nominal frequencies is presented and a hypothesis testing framework is formulated. The new formulation takes into account the fact that minor degree of imbalance in the system is acceptable and does not indicate subsequent interruptions, failures, or degradation of physical components. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed and shown to be a function of the negative-sequence phasor estimator and the acceptable level of imbalances for nominal system operations. As a by-product to the proposed detection method, a constrained estimation of the positive and negative phasors and the frequency deviation is obtained for both balanced and unbalanced situations. The theoretical and numerical performance analyses show improved performance over benchmark techniques and robustness to the presence of additional harmonics.

Abstract: A power transmission grid is exposed to numerous weather conditions. One of the critical hazards is icing on structural elements of the overhead high voltage lines. This paper shows the application of extreme value analysis aimed at determining wet snowfall and predicting the occurrence of extreme icing on power lines. We presented the modeling of icing on the basis of metrological measurements and compared them with direct icing measurements. The analysis of the icing size on a given territory can allow us to identify adequate measures to counteract vast power grid failures caused by extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: With increasing wind penetration levels on power systems worldwide, conventional thermal plant, along with the ancillary services they provide are being displaced. To address this issue, modern variable speed wind turbines can offer a short-term controlled response to temporary power imbalances, by harnessing their stored rotational energy, a so called emulated, or synthetic, inertial response. However, unlike conventional frequency response services, the emulated inertial response is dependent on the wind turbine operating condition and provides a response which is distinct to that from synchronously connected plant. While much research has investigated the harnessing of such a response from wind turbines and its effect on system frequency, this paper investigates potential issues associated with the system-wide integration of the technology at scale. The ability for wind generation to provide frequency support through emulated inertia is assessed, as well as the potential for tuning such a distributed response resource to ensure timely and effective frequency recovery under different system conditions. It is shown that the frequency response capability of future systems and the operating protocols for system participants, including wind generation, will require development if emulated inertia technology is adopted at scale.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fuzzy logic controlled bridge type fault current limiter (FCL) to enhance the transient stability of multi-machine power systems. The transient stability performance of the fuzzy logic controlled bridge type FCL is compared with that of another static nonlinear controlled bridge type FCL. The total kinetic energy (TKE) of the generators in the system is used to determine the transient stability enhancement index. Also, the critical clearing time has been presented as a stability limit. Instead of conventional reclosing, the optimal reclosing of circuit breakers is considered. Simulations are performed by using the Matlab/Simulink software. Simulation results of both permanent and temporary faults at different points of the IEEE 30-bus power system indicate that the fuzzy logic controlled bridge type FCL can enhance the transient stability of the system well. Also, the performance of the proposed fuzzy logic controller is better than that of the static nonlinear controller.

Abstract: Time varying prices by motivating customers to reduce their consumption in peak periods propel the electricity industry towards a higher efficiency compared to that of common flat prices. Focusing on time-of-use (TOU) sale prices, this paper establishes a stochastic model for the medium-term decision making problem faced by a distribution company (DisCo). The developed model deals with the DisCo's decisions on the level of involvement in forward contracts and in the pool as well as the sale prices offered to customers. The demand response to TOU prices is captured using a price elasticity matrix (PEM). The objective is to maximize the DisCo's profit while the exposure risk imposed by uncertainties is limited to a given level. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem that can be effectively solved via commercial software packages. A typical Finnish 20-kV urban distribution network is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model.

Abstract: In this paper we address some shortcomings in existing nonlinear dynamic models of power system experiencing symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in their transmission/distribution networks. The shortcomings relate to: 1) approximations relating to stator dynamics, internal voltage of the positive sequence network and the dynamics of the negative and zero sequence networks, and 2) existing models are time -variant, which may not be suitable for system studies such as stability and fault detection studies that require time invariant model. The approximations outlined in 1) adversely affect the modeling accuracy, especially that of the system response during the period immediately after the occurrence of faults. We present in this paper a full fault-dependent time-invariant dynamical model of power systems experiencing symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in their transmission/distribution networks and verify it through simulation studies mimicking real life scenarios. IEEE 30 bus power system is considered as the study case. The simulation results are compared to Matlab's "SimPower" and PSCAD/EMTDC software packages.

Abstract: Traditionally, electric system operators have dispatched generation to minimize total production costs, ignoring the flexibility of the transmission system. Implementation of smart-grid systems could allow operators to co-optimize flexible transmission alongside generation dispatch; the technologies that would enable such co-optimization are still regulated as part of the monopoly transmission system. One particular flexible transmission asset is variable impedance flexible AC transmission system (FACTS). This paper 1) points out the positive externality problem existing in a recent market design proposal with active transmission participation, and 2) proposes a sensitivity-based method to estimate the marginal market value of FACTS adjustments to overcome this positive externality problem. The marginal value would suggest efficient impedance adjustments to the operator and provide the right financial incentives for the FACTS owners to operate their assets in a socially optimal way. Revenue adequacy is demonstrated under specific conditions and more broadly investigated through simulation studies. An analytical example on a two-bus system as well as a numerical study on the IEEE 118-bus system are presented. The results suggest that inclusion of a price signal for FACTS devices would lead to significant social welfare improvements in competitive power markets.

Abstract: Reserve requirements serve as a proxy for N-1 reliability in the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, there is no guarantee that the reserve is deliverable for all scenarios (post-contingency states). One cheap way to improve reserve deliverability is to harness the flexibility of the transmission network. Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices are able to significantly improve the transfer capability. However, FACTS utilization is limited today due to the complexities these devices introduce to the DC optimal power flow problem (DCOPF). With a linear objective, the traditional DCOPF is a linear program (LP); when variable impedance based FACTS devices are taken into consideration, the problem becomes a nonlinear program (NLP). A reformulation of the NLP to a mixed integer linear program, for day-ahead corrective operation of FACTS devices, is presented in this paper. Engineering insight is then introduced to further reduce the complexity to an LP. Although optimality is not guaranteed, the simulation studies on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the method finds the globally optimal solution in 98.8% of the cases. Even when the method did not find the optimal solution, it was able to converge to a near-optimal solution, which substantially improved the reliability, very quickly.

Abstract: Transmission systems are under stress and need to be upgraded. Better utilization of the existing grid provides a fast and cheap alternative to building new transmission. One way to improve the utilization of the transmission network is power flow control via flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. While FACTS devices are used today, the utilization of these devices is limited; traditional dispatch models (e.g., security constrained economic dispatch) assume a fixed, static transmission grid even though it is rather flexible. The primary barrier is the complexity that is added to the power flow problem. The mathematical representation of the DC optimal power flow, with the added modeling of FACTS devices, is a nonlinear program (NLP). This paper presents a method to convert this NLP into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The MILP is reformulated as a two-stage linear program, which enforces the same sign for the voltage angle differences for the lines equipped with FACTS. While this approximation does not guarantee optimality, more than 98% of the presented empirical results, based on the IEEE 118-bus and Polish systems, achieved global optimality. In the case of suboptimal solutions, the savings were still significant and the solution time was dramatically reduced.

Abstract: Transmission switching (TS) has shown to be an effective power flow control tool. TS can reduce the system cost, improve system reliability, and enhance the management of intermittent renewable resources. This letter addresses the state-of-the-art problem of TS by developing an AC-based real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) package with TS. The package is tested on real power system data, taken from energy management systems of PJM, TVA, and ERCOT. The results show that post-contingency corrective switching is a ready to be implemented transformational technology that provides substantial reliability gains. The computational time and the performance of the developed RTCA package, reported in this letter, are promising.

Abstract: Active management strategies such as coordinated on load tap changer (OLTC) voltage control and reactive power compensation (RPC) are frequently suggested for voltage regulation in a distribution system with a high level of distributed generation (DG). This paper proposes a control and coordination algorithm for these two active management strategies. Voltage control through OLTC is achieved by using state estimation (SE) to determine the voltage in the network. To lower the implementation cost of the proposed control strategy, pseudo-measurements are used together with real-time measurement data in the SE. Moreover, the deadband of the automatic voltage control (AVC) relay is relaxed so that the AVC relay acts on the network's maximum or minimum voltage obtained through the SE. This is found to be simpler to realize than adjusting the set point of the AVC relay. Voltage control through RPC is actualized by using integral controllers implemented locally at the wind turbine site. Furthermore, RPC from the local wind turbine is also used to mitigate an overvoltage at a remote bus on the same feeder when the remote wind turbine reaches its regulation limit. The applicability of the proposed voltage regulation algorithm is successfully demonstrated using a case study system.

Abstract: Energy theft is a notorious problem in electric power systems, which causes great economic losses and threatens the reliability of the power grid. Recently, the Smart Grid has been proposed as the next-generation power system to modernize the current grid and improve its efficiency, sustainability, and security. Key technologies of the Smart Grid include smart meters, which allow system operators to collect real-time power consumption data from users, and microgrids, which allow users to own and control renewable resources. However, the Smart Grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks, thus making stealing energy much easier in it. Most existing energy theft detection schemes require the collection of real-time power consumption data from users, i.e., users' load profiles, which violates their privacy. In this paper, we first propose a centralized energy theft detection algorithm utilizing the Kalman filter, called SEK. It can efficiently identify the energy thieves but cannot protect users' privacy. Then, based on SEK, we develop a privacy-preserving energy theft detection algorithm called PPBE, which privately finds the energy thieves by decomposing the Kalman filter into two parallel and loosely coupled filters. Finally, we conduct thorough privacy analysis and extensive simulations to validate our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: This paper incorporates, as part of an attacker-defender (AD) model for an electric power transmission grid, an inventory of "recovery spares" for high-voltage transformers (HVTs). In this sequential-game model, an attacker first uses limited resources to disable grid components, seeking to maximize second-stage "total cost." This value corresponds to a defender who operates the damaged grid to minimize generating and economic load-shedding costs. The defender's problem includes 1) optimal power-flow solutions to represent post-attack operations, 2) optimized replacement of disabled HVTs with quickly installable recovery spares, and 3) longer-term replacements using new procurements. Global Benders decomposition, with a mixed-integer subproblem, solves the AD model; new enumerative techniques help solve the decomposition's master problem and subproblems. Computational tests demonstrate tradeoffs between the number of recovery spares and worst-case total cost, and show how the model could help guide an inventory strategy for recovery spares in an adversarial setting.

Abstract: This paper takes advantage of wide-area measurements to propose a centralized nonlinear controller that acts on power system stabilizers (PSSs), to cooperatively increase the damping of problematic small-signal oscillations all over the system. Details are given to utilize existing stabilizers while causing minimum changes to the equipment and warranting improvement, or at least no detriment, of current system behavior. A set of gains is designed by linear state feedback control to respond to representative system conditions, and these are coordinated with an equal number of decision trees in charge of scheduling by switching. The resulting nonlinear controller is implemented on a model that resembles the characteristics of the Central American System, exemplifying its feasibility to be applied in large systems. The effect of time delay in the control loop is assessed, and the limits for tolerance to latency in this application are determined.

Abstract: A more realistic management of electric vehicle (EV) charging points requires to cope with stochastic behavior on vehicle staying patterns. This paper presents a stochastic programming model to achieve optimal management taking into account price variation in day-ahead and intraday electricity markets, together with regulating reserve margins. In this model, first-stage decisions determine day-ahead energy purchases and sales and the upward and downward reserve margins committed. Second-stage decisions correspond to intraday markets and deal with reserve requirements and several possible scenarios for vehicle staying pattern. The design of the objective function prioritizes supplying energy to EV batteries while minimizing the net expected energy cost at the EV charging point. A case study describing a parking for 50 EVs is analyzed. The case includes household, commercial and mixed EV staying patterns with several intraday arrival and departure scenarios. Pure and hybrid EVs are included, taking into account their respective energy characteristics. Sensitivity analysis is used to show the potential energy cost savings and the impact of different non-supply penalizations. The case study considers several vehicle staying patterns, energy price profiles and discharge allowances. The model achieves energy cost reductions between 1% and 15% depending on the specific case. A model validation by simulation has been done.

Abstract: Inertial response from remote offshore wind farms (WFs) connected through point-to-point DC links relies on emulation of the onshore AC system frequency variation at each offshore wind turbine generator (WTG). This is not straightforward for a DC grid interconnecting WFs to multiple onshore AC systems. To address this problem, this paper builds up on a communication-less approach previously reported for provision of frequency services from offshore WFs connected through a DC grid. A weighted frequency scheme is adopted which relies on the fiber optic link embedded within the sub-sea cables for fast communication of onshore frequency variations up to the offshore converters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown analytically and also through a case study on a 4-terminal DC grid interconnecting an offshore wind farm and two onshore AC systems.

Abstract: The paper proposes a scalable and tractable algorithm for dynamic topology optimization of power systems involving changes in branch on/off status, while respecting small-signal stability (SSS) constraints. A procedure for fast updates of the system matrices (in descriptor form) and without additional full matrix inversions is proposed. To additionally reduce the computation time, only critical eigenvalues (right-most or those in a specified damping ratio and frequency range) are calculated. A quadratic optimization approach is proposed for optimized generation re-dispatch to satisfy SSS constraints. The approach is applied to two (medium- and large-scale) real-world test power systems.

Abstract: An aggregator acts as a mediator between the system operator and residential customers, enabling mutually beneficial coordination for electric vehicle (EV) owners and the power system. The aggregator aims to maximize its profits from trading energy and regulation reserve in wholesale markets. Since the aggregator does not own EV batteries, the EV owners must be reimbursed for the degradation of their batteries due to the additional cycling beyond transportation needs. This paper proposes a bidding strategy for the aggregator to maximize its profits from participating in competitive energy and different regulating reserves markets, while compensating EV owners for degradation. The results show that depending on the battery cost, the aggregator splits its resources between the energy and reserves markets. The results also show the system operator attains cost savings, if an aggregator uses EVs to provide services.

Abstract: For a successful rollout of electric vehicles (EVs), it is required to establish an adequate charging infrastructure. The adequate access to such infrastructure would help to mitigate concerns associated with limited EV range and long charging times. Battery swapping stations are poised as effective means of eliminating the long waiting times associated with charging the EV batteries. These stations are mediators between the power system and their customers. In order to successfully deploy this type of stations, a business and operating model is required, that will allow it to generate profits while offering a fast and reliable alternative to charging batteries. This paper proposes an optimization framework for the operating model of battery swapping stations. The proposed model considers the day-ahead scheduling process. Battery demand uncertainty is modeled using inventory robust optimization, while multi-band robust optimization is employed to model electricity price uncertainty. The results show the viability of the proposed model as a business case, as well as the effectiveness of the model to provide the required service.

Abstract: This paper discusses a recent event in the western American power system when a forced oscillation was observed at a frequency that was close to a well-known 0.38-Hz inter-area electromechanical mode frequency of the western system. The event motivates a systematic investigation in this paper on the possibility of resonant interactions between forced oscillations and electromechanical inter-area oscillatory modes in power systems. When the natural oscillatory mode of a power system is poorly damped, and the forced oscillation occurs at a frequency close to system mode frequency at critical locations for the mode, resonance is observed in simulation test cases of the paper. It is shown that the MW oscillations on tie-lines can be as high as 477 MW from a 10-MW forced oscillation in Kundur test system because of resonance. This paper discusses the underlying system conditions and effects as related to resonance in power systems caused by forced oscillations and discusses ways to detect such scenarios using synchrophasors. Simulated data from Kundur two-area test power system as well as measurement data from western American power system are used to study the effect of forced oscillations in power systems.

Abstract: Recent widespread interest in Convex Hull Pricing has not been accompanied by an equally broad understanding of the method. This paper seeks to narrow the gap between enthusiasm and comprehension. The connection between Convex Hull Pricing and basic electricity market clearing processes is clearly developed, and a new formulation of the pricing problem is presented. From this formulation, several important consequences of the method are derived and discussed. Some counterintuitive properties of Convex Hull Pricing are highlighted and demonstrated with simple examples. It is hoped that this paper will spur additional research on Convex Hull Pricing so that an informed judgment can be made regarding its costs and benefits.

Abstract: Distribution systems are naturally unbalanced as a consequence of unbalanced loads and the electrical network itself, where the use of single-phase or two-phase sections is not uncommon. In addition, a detailed representation of a typical distribution system can have tens of thousands of nodes, depending on the area selected for study and whether a three-phase representation is employed. This contrasts with Transmission systems, where typical sizes in terms of number of nodes are much smaller and where a balanced (single-phase) representation is sufficient in most situations. Thus, Transmission and Distribution systems have traditionally been studied separately, but this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate for various reasons. This paper then proposes a methodology that integrates Transmission and Distribution systems into a common electrical model. At the core of the methodology there are 1) single-and three-phase models for each component (branches, transformers, loads, etc.) and 2) interchangeable balanced and unbalanced network equivalents that allow for analyzing specific areas of a given complete network. Potential gains brought about by the proposed methodology are illustrated through its application in a real-world electric system.

Abstract: Quantifying the impact of new technologies on a single distribution feeder is a tractable analysis problem. But the analysis of a single distribution feeder does not provide insight into the complexities and variations of a system-wide deployment. The inability to extrapolate system-wide impacts hinders the deployment of many promising new technologies. This paper presents a three-stage method of extrapolating technological impacts, either simulated or from a field demonstration, from a limited number of distribution feeders to the entire system. The size of the system can vary from the service territory of a single utility, to a region, or to an entire country. The paper will include an example analysis using the United States Department of Energy funded Smart Grid Investment Grant projects, extrapolating their benefits to a national level, and an example of a regionalized deployment of Volt-VAR optimization for peak demand reduction. Both of the example analyses utilize the presented three-stage extrapolation method.

Abstract: The increased level of demand that is associated with the restoration of service after an outage, Cold Load Pick-Up (CLPU), can be significantly higher than pre-outage levels, even exceeding the normal distribution feeder peak demand. These high levels of demand can delay restoration efforts and in extreme cases damage equipment. The negative impacts of CLPU can be mitigated with strategies that restore the feeder in sections, minimizing the load current. The challenge for utilities is to manage the current level on critical equipment while minimizing the time to restore service to all customers. Accurately modeling CLPU events is the first step in developing improved restoration strategies that minimize restoration times. This paper presents a new method for evaluating the magnitude of the CLPU peak, and its duration, using multi-state load models. The use of multi-state load models allows for a more accurate representation of the end-use loads that are present on residential distribution feeders.

Abstract: The penetration of renewable distributed generation (DG) sources has been increased in active distribution networks due to their unique advantages. However, non-dispatchable DGs such as wind turbines raise the risk of distribution networks. Such a problem could be eliminated using the proper application of energy storage units. In this paper, optimal planning of batteries in the distribution grid is presented. The optimal planning determines the location, capacity and power rating of batteries while minimizing the cost objective function subject to technical constraints. The optimal long-term planning is based on the short-term optimal power flow considering the uncertainties. The point estimate method (PEM) is employed for probabilistic optimal power flow. The batteries are scheduled optimally for several purposes to maximize the benefits. A hybrid Tabu search/particle swarm optimization (TS/PSO) algorithm is used to solve the problem. The numerical studies on a 21-node distribution system show the advantages of the proposed methodology. The proposed approach can also be applied to the realistic sized networks when some sensitive nodes are considered as candidate locations for installing the storage units.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for solving the short-term unit commitment and loading problem for a specific hydropower system. Dynamic programming is used to compute maximum power output generated by a power plant. This information is then used as input of a two-phase optimization process. The first phase solves the relaxation of a nonlinear mixed-integer program in order to obtain the water discharge, reservoir volume and number of units working at each period in the planning horizon. The second stage solves a linear integer problem to determine which combination of turbines to use at each period. The goal is to maximize total energy produced over all periods of the planning horizon which consists of a week divided in hourly periods. Start-up of turbines are penalized. Numerical experiments are conducted on thirty different test cases for two Rio Tinto Alcan power plants with five turbines each.

Abstract: The digital Taylor-Fourier transform (DTFT) is used to identify low-frequency electromechanical modes in power systems. The identification process is based on the time-frequency analysis of nonlinear signals that arise after a large disturbance. The DTFT creates a signal decomposition, from which mono-component signals are extracted by spectral analysis using a filter bank. This analysis is accomplished through sliding-window data, which is updated each sample, yielding estimates of the reconstructed signal and providing information of its instantaneous damping and frequency. Results demonstrate the applicability of the proposition.

Abstract: This paper studies a unified steady-state power flow analysis considering electrical, natural gas, and district heating networks all together. The important reason of such a view is the increasing utilization of cogeneration plants which makes a strong coupling between these networks. Another reason is the increasing usage of district heating networks because they have a higher efficiency besides a lower carbon dioxide emission than localized boilers. In this paper, interdependencies of the mentioned infrastructures are considered in detail including a nonlinear part-load efficiency performance for units. An integrated framework based on the Newton-Raphson technique is presented to solve the combined power flow problem and several case studies are utilized to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper presents a new stochastic multi-layer agent-based model to study the behavior of electricity market participants. The wholesale market players including renewable power producers are modeled in the first layer of the proposed multi-agent environment. The players optimize bidding/offering strategies to participate in the electricity markets. In the second layer, responsive customers including plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners and consumers who participate in demand response (DR) programs are modeled as independent agents. The objective of the responsive customers is to increase their benefit while retaining welfare. The interaction between market players in day-ahead and real-time markets is modeled using an incomplete information game theory algorithm. Due to the uncertainties of resources and customers' behavior, the model is developed using a stochastic framework. A case study containing wind power producers (WPPs), PEV aggregators and retailers providing DR is considered to demonstrate the usefulness and proficiency of the proposed multi-layer agent-based model.

Abstract: An all-electric ship (AES) uses integrated power generators and an energy storage system (ESS) to match its propulsion and service loads, thus forming an isolated microgrid. Existing work has hitherto set the minimisation of the AES operational cost as the single optimisation objective, with the reduction of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission merely treated as a constraint of the optimisation. Moreover, the potential of the ESS as part of the scheduling has not been fully exploited. The work presented in this paper emphasises the environmental concerns and makes GHG mitigation a separate objective, thus expanding the optimisation into multi-objective. In achieving both objectives, the ESS-integrated joint generation - voyage scheduling of the AES is proposed: the generation scheduling is combined with the load management (propulsion load - cruising speed) and the ESS dispatch to optimally operate the diesel generators. The optimisation is formulated using optimal control, and is solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Extensive simulations demonstrate that optimising the cruising speed (voyage) jointly with the generation scheduling results in the reduction of both operational cost and GHG emission, compared to the fixedvoyage generation scheduling. Integrating the ESS dispatch into the generation scheduling further enhances the benefits.

Abstract: Cooperation between controllable loads such as electrical vehicles (EVs) and wind power is regarded as a promising way to promote the integration of wind power. A novel layered and distributed charging load dispatch mechanism is proposed for the control of thousands of EVs in this paper. Based on the Lagrangian Relaxation and Auxiliary Problem Principle, the dispatch framework is developed, consisting of layers of system operator, generation units/EV aggregators, and EVs, and the cooperation between the generation and EVs is considered. Furthermore, the necessity of EV aggregators is analyzed, and the function of them is stressed. Compared with existing distributed methods, the proposed method is proper for large populations of EVs and gains an advantage in reducing generation cost directly. In addition, it is with a wider application scope such as problems with coupled constraints. The case study on IEEE-RTS verifies the method is feasible and valid and the charge load dispatch based on it reduces generation cost and wind power spillage.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach to test and validate a number of power system dynamic state estimation (PSDSE) algorithms, utilizing Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS), a real-time simulation tool. WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 30-bus systems have been utilized to demonstrate the proposed approach. The test systems are developed on the RSCAD software of the RTDS. The conventional remote terminal unit (RTU) measurements and the phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements are sent from the RTDS runtime environment to the MATLAB based PSDSE application at regular intervals for the estimation of the states, using software-in-the-loop (SIL) configuration. The PSDSE is solved by utilizing the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) approaches, and their relative performances are studied with the help of the simulation results on the two test systems.

Abstract: Simulations of production costs, flows, and prices are crucial inputs to generation and transmission planning studies. To calculate average system performance for many alternatives over long time periods, it is necessary to simulate large numbers of hourly combinations of renewable production and loads across large regions. As this is usually impractical for full network representations of such systems, aggregation of buses and lines is desirable. We propose an improved aggregation method for creating multi-area representations of power systems that yields more accurate estimates of the quantities required by planners. The method is based on partitioning the original large system into smaller areas and making a reduced equivalent for each area. The partitioning is based on available transfer capability (ATC) between each pair of network buses. Because ATC depends on net load conditions, separate partitions are defined for subsets of similar load and wind conditions, significantly enhancing the accuracy of optimal power flow solutions. We test the method on the IEEE 118-bus test system and the Polish 3120-bus system considering 150 load/wind scenarios, comparing the results to those of admittance-based partitioning methods. Accuracy is improved with only a negligible increase in simulation time.

Abstract: To diminish damaging consequences of power system major disturbances, under frequency load shedding (UFLS) plans are devised so as to prevent power networks from collapse. Since load shedding scenarios in conventional UFLS plans are specified regardless to voltage stability criteria, they cannot bring desired outcomes at the event of severe and combinational contingencies. In these circumstances, the location of load drops, in addition to their amounts, should be determined as well. This paper presents a two-unit wide-area adaptive load shedding scheme based on synchrophasors. In the first unit, an adaptive precise system frequency response (SFR) model is developed, by the help of which, the appropriate amount of load rejections is determined such that the dynamic and steady state frequency limitations are fulfilled. Incorporation of both static and dynamic loads into the adaptive SFR model results in a negligible error in calculations. Specifying the best location of load drops based on suitable voltage stability criteria is the main task of the second unit. These two units are executed in a parallel way; the computational burden of the proposed approach is thus tractable for real world applications. The new method is successfully testified in the IEEE 39-bus system and Khorasan network.

Abstract: Several transient stability software packages are widely used for power grid planning and operations. Prior research and software documentations have shown that packages can vary in the implementations of dynamic models, and hence could potentially yield different results for the same system simulation. This paper presents a systematic methodology to determine the sources of the discrepancies seen in results obtained from different transient stability packages. This methodology can be applied to various types of dynamic models and is illustrated with generator-associated dynamic models in this paper. Consistent metrics, data mining techniques, and engineering heuristics are used to determine the discrepancy sources. This hybrid top-down+bottom-up method has been implemented on a practical, large-system case to demonstrate its scalability and transferability to real-world system studies.

Abstract: The challenges power systems engineers are facing today require the development of new system planning tools for analyzing generation and environmental policy options in the transmission-constrained electricity market. The requirements of a power-system equivalent to be used with such tools are very different from those assumed in the traditional network reduction process. To solve this issue, a novel structure-preserving network equivalent is proposed in this paper for modeling large power systems in the context of analyzing policy options and emissions. In the proposed method, a power system is first clustered into zones based on the similarity of the power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs); network reduction is achieved by aggregating buses (generators/loads) on a zonal basis and modeling inter-zonal transactions (power flows) using equivalent transmission lines. The proposed equivalent is superior to existing bus-aggregation-based equivalents in its accuracy under both the base case and change-case operating conditions. In addition, the method is more computationally efficient than other bus aggregation methods proposed heretofore. This paper also examined several classic clustering techniques and identified their performance and computational efficiencies when applied to very large power systems. The proposed network equivalencing approach is tested on an illustrative six-bus system as well as the 62,000-bus and 80,000-branch Eastern Interconnection (EI).

Abstract: In this paper, a robust approach to the energy storage system (ESS)-based stabilizer is proposed to select its installation location, feedback signals, and damping control loop, and to tune the stabilizer parameters. Based on the linearized model of the power system with ESS and application of damping torque analysis (DTA), the maximum of all minimum damping torque indices (DTIs) under multi-operational conditions is used as the index for selecting ESS installation locations, feedback signals and damping control loops. The operational condition for the minimum DTI provides the condition for tuning the ESS-based stabilizer parameters for robust operation. And a proper compensation angle is selected by a robust method to design the ESS-based stabilizer parameters. The eigenvalue analysis and non-linear simulation results of a four-machine power system and New England ten-machine power system with ESS show that power system oscillations are suppressed effectively and robustly by the ESS-based stabilizer.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) power generation is being decentralized and introduced on various scales in electric power systems that are expanding over wider areas. To understand the effect of PV power generation on these electric power systems (in areas ranging from power generation operation and control to voltage management of the distribution system), areal solar irradiance must be estimated for a target area, particularly, for the position and surface area that correspond to the PV power generation equipment location. By applying spatiotemporal kriging and covariance analysis to observed solar irradiance time series (obtained from sparsely distributed solar irradiance meters), we developed a technique that determines areal solar irradiance for an arbitrary location and surface area to estimate its surficial distribution. The weather conditions under which the spatiotemporal kriging technique can be applied were clarified using solar irradiance and meteorological observations during a one-year period at 25 observation points in the Kansai area.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient approach on static spatial power network expansion planning integrated with generation expansion, while considering complicated environments based on the raster map in geographic information systems (GIS). Candidate plants could be built on any cell in the map, which means that terminals of candidate lines connected to candidate plants are not fixed. This is a remarkable difference from the literature in which the terminals of candidate lines are fixed. The objective is to minimize the total system cost, subject to prevailing investment and operation constraints. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem via integer algebra techniques. A two-step approach is proposed to address the computational complexity. The first step searches optimal electric line routes via dynamic programming, while the second step solves a simplified MILP problem for obtaining final optimal generation and transmission planning strategies based on optimal line routes derived from the first step. In most cases, the proposed two-step approach would derive the same global optimal solutions as those by solving the original formulation directly. Thus, the proposed two-step approach can significantly improve the computational efficiency while maintaining the solution optimality. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of the size and controller settings of an ultracapacitor (UC) on frequency stability. Underfrequency load-shedding (UFLS) schemes play an important role in protecting the system against frequency instability and their performance is used as a measure for the enhancement of frequency stability thanks to the UC. To this end, a simplified but still accurate model of the UC is developed. In addition, a meaningful procedure is proposed to size the UC's power and energy storage capacities in function of the system parameters and operation constraints in order to improve frequency stability. Finally, the impact of the UC on the UFLS scheme is studied for many generation dispatch scenarios and for all possible single generating unit outages of a Spanish isolated power system. An analysis with respect to the UC's control parameters and its size in terms of power and energy storage capacities is carried out, too. Appropriate control parameter settings improve the UC's impact on frequency stability.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved mixed-integer model for the thermal unit commitment problem. By introducing new variables for the temperature of each thermal unit, the off-time-dependent start-up costs are modeled accurately and with a lower integrality gap than state-of-the-art formulations. This new approach significantly improves computational efficiency compared to existing formulations, even if they only model a rough approximation of the start-up costs. Our findings were validated on real-world test cases using CPLEX.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized algorithm for real-time control of oscillatory dynamics in power systems. The algorithm integrates dynamic state estimation (DSE) with an extended linear quadratic regulator (ELQR) for optimal control. The control for one generation unit only requires measurements and parameters for that unit, and hence the control at a unit remains completely independent of other units. The control gains are updated in real-time, therefore the control scheme remains valid for any operating condition. The applicability of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated on a representative power system model.

Abstract: We examine the problem of a generator offering generation and ancillary services from a set of cascaded hydroelectric units to a centrally dispatched market that does not account for watershed constraints. By modeling the least-cost dispatch problem and computing the resulting schedules and market prices, we formulate a stochastic bilevel optimization problem that maximizes the generator's expected profits under different demand and supply realizations. To account for potential infeasibilities in the resulting hydroelectric dispatch, we include penalties in the generator's objective function. We propose a simple technique that replaces the lower-level dispatch problem with its linearized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions to convert the problem to a single-level mixed-integer program. We use two numerical case studies, based on actual river systems, to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of a wind power producer participating in a short-term electricity market that allows for the continuous, but potentially illiquid, intraday trading of energy. Considering the realistic case of a wind farm operating in the western Danish price area of Nord Pool, we build a simple but effective algorithm for the wind power producer to fully benefit from the Elbas intraday market. We then investigate the sensitivity of the obtained benefits to the maximum volume of energy the wind power producer is willing to trade in the intraday market, the ultimate aim of the trade (either to decrease energy imbalances or to increase profits) and to the installed capacity of the wind farm. Our numerical results reveal that the wind power producer can substantially increase his revenues by partaking in the intraday market but with diminishing returns to scale-a result that we attribute to the low liquidity of Elbas.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer linear optimization problem for unit commitment and economic dispatch of power generators in a meshed isolated power system. The optimization problem is referred to as the optimal reserve planning problem (ORPP). The ORPP guarantees that the system frequency is kept above a predefined limit in the event of a contingency. The minimum frequency constraints are formulated using novel sufficient conditions that take into account the system inertia and the dynamics of the power generators. The proposed sufficient conditions are attractive from both a computational and a modelling point of view. We compare the ORPP to a unit commitment problem that only considers the stationary behavior of the frequency. Simulations based on a Faroe Islands case study show that, without being overly conservative, potential blackouts and power outages can be avoided using the ORPP. In the particular case study, the cost increase associated with the additional security provided by the ORPP is less than 3%.

Abstract: The modeling of cascading failure in power systems is difficult because of the many different mechanisms involved; no single model captures all of these mechanisms. Understanding the relative importance of these different mechanisms is important for choosing which mechanisms need to be modeled for particular applications. This work presents a dynamic simulation model of both power networks and protection systems, which can simulate a wider variety of cascading outage mechanisms relative to existing quasi-steady-state (QSS) models. This paper describes the model and demonstrates how different mechanisms interact. In order to test the model, we simulated a batch of randomly selected contingencies for several different static load configurations, and found that the distributions of blackout sizes and event lengths from the simulator correlate well with historical trends. The results also show that load models have significant impacts on the cascading risks. Finally, the dynamic model was compared against a simple dc-power-flow based QSS model; we find that the two models tend to agree for the early stages of cascading but produce substantially different results for later stages.

Abstract: This letter proposes a graphical method to compute the stabilizing values of proportional-integral (PI) controller parameters for a single-area load frequency control (LFC) system with time delay. The method is based on the stability boundary locus. The stability region is displayed in controller parameter space and time-domain simulation studies are carried to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The extensive usage of open communication networks in power system control causes inevitable time delays. This paper studies impacts of such delays on the stability of one-area and two-area load frequency control (LFC) systems and proposes an analytical method to determine delay margins, the upper bound on the delay for stability. The proposed method first eliminates transcendental terms in characteristic equation of LFC systems without making any approximation and transforms the transcendental characteristic equation into a regular polynomial. The key result of the elimination process is that real roots of the new polynomial correspond to imaginary roots of the transcendental characteristic equation. With the help of new polynomial, it is also possible to determine the delay-dependency of system stability and root tendency with respect to the time delay. An analytical formula is then developed to compute delay margins in terms of system parameters. For a large set of controller gains, delay margins of LFC systems are computed to investigate the qualitative effect of controller gains on the delay margin. Finally, simulations studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The merit order stack is used to tackle a wide variety of problems involving electricity dispatch. The simplification it relies on is to neglect dynamic issues such as the cost of starting stations. This leads the merit order stack to give a poor representation of the hourly pattern of prices and under-estimate the optimal level of investment in both peaking and inflexible baseload generators, and thus their run-times by up to 30%. We describe a simple method for incorporating start-up costs using a single equation derived from the load curve and station costs. The technique is demonstrated on the British electricity system in 2010 to test its performance against actual outturn, and in a 2020 scenario with increased wind capacity where it is compared to a dynamic unit-commitment scheduler. Our modification yields a better representation of electricity prices and reduces the errors in capacity investment by a factor of two.

Abstract: In this paper we propose approximate bisimulation relations and functions for reduction of power system dynamic models in differential- algebraic (descriptor) form. The full-size dynamic model is obtained by linearization of the nonlinear transient stability model. We generalize theoretical results on approximate bisimulation relations and bisimulation functions, originally derived for a class of constrained linear systems, to linear systems in descriptor form. An algorithm for transient stability assessment is proposed and used to determine whether the power system is able to maintain the synchronism after a large disturbance. Two benchmark power systems are used to illustrate the proposed algorithm and to evaluate the applicability of approximate bisimulation relations and bisimulation functions for reduction of the power system dynamic models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a tractable and scalable algorithm to identify and analyze bifurcation points of a large-scale power system model, which are directly related to dynamic voltage instability problems. Different types of bifurcations are analyzed, including: saddle-node (fold), Hopf, singularity-induced and limit-induced. An algorithm that combines optimization and predictor- corrector procedure is proposed for equilibrium tracing. The algorithm is based on calculation of only critical (rightmost and closest-to-zero) eigenvalues. The proposed algorithm is extended to the case of dynamic voltage stability assessment for power systems with optimized topology (simultaneously subjected to the topology control changes and generation re-dispatch). The proposed approach is illustrated on two (medium- and large-scale real-world) test power systems.

Abstract: Distribution system reliability, defined by the expected frequency and duration of load service interruptions caused by component failures, is shown to be dependent on the topology of the distribution network, as well as on the relative placement of loads and generators within the system. In a shipboard electrical distribution system, a network topology based on the breaker-and-a-half scheme is shown to confer greater reliability than equivalent distribution topologies based on the ring bus and double bus, double breaker designs. The overall service interruption rate in the breaker-and-a-half topology is 17.8% less than that in the ring bus topology and 40.0% less than that in the double bus, double breaker topology. Further, an optimized equipment placement configuration is algorithmically identified for the loads and generators within the breaker-and-a-half distribution network, further increasing reliability. The optimal equipment placement decreases the overall system interruption rate by 0.54%. The paper also determines an optimal location for additional in-feeds that should be connected to the ship's most critical loads so that maximum benefits to service reliability are obtained.

Abstract: The ancillary services that could be provided by the distributed generators and the energy storage systems are expected to give great added value to the microgrid-based smart grid topologies. These services must be integrated into the control system of the microgrids. In this paper, the pseudo-state-of-charge concept is introduced to improve energy storage management. Additionally, a noninvasive-to-the-inverter PV-plant control strategy, based on the remote control of PV-strings actuators, is presented and applied on a microgrid-based smart grid topology. The operation of the microgrid with the improved control infrastructure and the iterative algorithm is compared, in terms of reliability, to a microgrid with a different control strategy and topology. The experimental results highlight the advantages of the developed strategy.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method based on phasor measurement units (PMUs) for the estimation of voltage stability margin in a power system to increase operator's situational awareness. The method assumes a PMU measurement preprocessing technique as a priori in order to eliminate data inconsistency and uncertainty caused by random load disturbances. The measurements are then used in the computation of voltage stability margin based on the coupled single-port Thevenin equivalent model and the cubic spline extrapolation technique. Moreover, some practical operating constraints such as the generator reactive power limits are taken into account for practical assessment of the method's performance. Extensive case studies conducted on several standard IEEE test systems are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Distribution networks, which are already complex large scale systems with diverse loads, are becoming more complicated in the smart grid era due to the increasing connections of distributed generators (e.g., solar and wind) and smart devices (e.g., electric vehicles and storage batteries). Although highly automated and integrated control systems have been proposed, systems with coverage from the zone substation to the low-voltage feeders practically do not exist. Based on the natural voltage decomposition of distribution networks and authors' previous research on distribution system control, this paper proposes an efficient multi-objective hierarchical optimization strategy that can fully exploit the capabilities of both traditional and emerging devices, expand network load capacity and accommodate more renewable connections. Detailed simulations are performed on a real Australian distribution network over 24 hours to verify the feasibility, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed hierarchical optimization and some future work is also discussed.

Abstract: Delta-connected switched capacitors are common in three-wire MV distribution systems as found in Europe and Australia but the majority of past studies focus on star-connected capacitors as applied in North America. This study presents a comprehensive optimization based sequential strategy and a multi-objective optimization based real-time strategy for the optimal placement and control of delta-connected switched capacitors. Considering load variations, a comprehensive optimization for capacitor placement is formulated to maximize the net annual returns from network loss reduction and capacity release. A sequential strategy based on loss sensitivity analysis is presented for efficient capacitor placement on large-scale unbalanced distribution networks. Then a capacitor control strategy is proposed to simultaneously minimize network losses, voltage deviations and voltage unbalance factor (VUF) while a weighted sum method reflects the preferences on the mutually conflicting control objectives. For the mixed integer programming (MIP) problems of capacitor placement and control, an improved backward/forward sweep (BSFS) load flow based particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used. Finally, the robustness of the proposed capacitor placement and control strategies are verified by comparison against existing popular schemes through detailed simulations over 24 h on a real unbalanced Australian MV network.

Abstract: This paper presents an application of multiple linear regression (MLR) to extract significant correlations between damping of electromechanical modes and system operating conditions and to forecast future damping values, based on existing day-ahead market forecasts for power flows and generation. The presented analysis uses measurements from the Nordic power system. First, a static MLR model is developed to explain the variability of the damping of the 0.35-Hz inter-area mode in the Nordic system. Together with the static model, a dynamic MLR model is used for forecasting the damping 24 hours ahead, using day-ahead market forecasts. Test results indicate the proposed methods are able to correctly predict about 90% of the low damped operating conditions observed during a year, if day-ahead market forecasts are accurate. These results suggest that the methods could be used to issue early warnings about future operating conditions with low damping.

Abstract: Phase balancing is essential to safe power system operation. We consider a substation connected to multiple phases, each with single-phase loads, generation, and energy storage. A representative of the substation operates the system and aims to minimize the cost of all phases and to balance loads among phases. We first consider ideal energy storage with lossless charging and discharging, and propose both centralized and distributed real-time algorithms taking into account system uncertainty. The proposed algorithm does not require any system statistics and asymptotically achieves the minimum system cost with large energy storage. We then extend the algorithm to accommodate more realistic non-ideal energy storage that has imperfect charging and discharging. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulation and compared with that of a benchmark greedy algorithm. Simulation shows that our algorithm leads to strong performance over a wide range of storage characteristics.

Abstract: Short-term load forecasting at the distribution level predicts the load of substations, feeders, transformers, and possibly customers from half an hour to one week ahead. Effective forecasting is important for the planning and operation of distribution systems. The problem, however, is difficult in view of complicated load features, the large number of distribution-level nodes, and possible switching operations. In this paper, a new forecasting approach within the hierarchical structure is presented to solve these difficulties. Load of the root node at any user-defined subtree is first forecast by a wavelet neural network with appropriate inputs. Child nodes categorized as "regular" and "irregular" based on load pattern similarities are then forecast separately. Load of a regular child node is simply forecast as the proportion from the parent node load forecast while the load of an irregular child node is forecast by an individual neural network model. Switching operation detection and follow-up adjustments are also performed to capture abnormal changes and improve the forecasting accuracy. This new approach captures load characteristics of nodes at different levels, takes advantage of pattern similarities between a parent node and its child nodes, detects abnormalities, and provides high quality forecasts as demonstrated by two practical datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve the multistage long-term expansion planning problem of electrical distribution systems (EDSs) considering the following alternatives: increasing the capacity of existing substations, constructing new substations, allocating capacitor banks and/or voltage regulators, constructing and/or reinforcing circuits, and modifying, if necessary, the system's topology. The aim is to minimize the investment and operation costs of the EDS over an established planning horizon. The proposed model uses a linearization technique and an approximation for transforming the original problem into an MILP model. The MILP model guarantees convergence to optimality by using existing classical optimization tools. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed methodology, a 24-node test system was employed.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct, fit, and validate a hidden Markov model for predicting variability and uncertainty in generation from distributed (PV) systems. The model is unique in that it: 1) predicts metrics that are directly related to operational reserves, 2) accounts for the effects of stochastic volatility and geographic autocorrelation, and 3) conditions on latent variables referred to as "volatility states." We fit and validate the model using 1-min resolution generation data from approximately 100 PV systems in the California Central Valley or the Los Angeles coastal area, and condition the volatility state of each system at each time on 15-min resolution generation data from nearby PV systems (which are available from over 6000 PV systems in our data set). We find that PV variability distributions are roughly Gaussian after conditioning on hidden states. We also propose a method for simulating hidden states that results in a very good upper bound for the probability of extreme events. Therefore, the model can be used as a tool for planning additional reserve capacity requirements to balance solar variability over large and small spatial areas.

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes the power loss in an electrical network by optimizing the voltage and power delivered at the network buses, and is a nonconvex problem that is generally hard to solve. By leveraging a recent development on the zero duality gap of OPF, we propose a second-order cone programming convex relaxation of the resistive network OPF, and study the uniqueness of the optimal solution using differential topology, especially the Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem. We characterize the global uniqueness for different network topologies, e.g., line, radial, and mesh networks. This serves as a starting point to design distributed local algorithms with global behaviors that have low complexity, are computationally fast, and can run under synchronous and asynchronous settings in practical power grids.

Abstract: This paper presents a sliding mode robust control based active-power modulation (SMAPM) for voltage source converter based multi-terminal HVDC (VSC-MTDC) systems, which could enhance the stability of the onshore power system subjected to disturbances by fast changing transmitted power of onshore VSCs. The development of the SMAPM includes three steps. First, the onshore disturbed ac system could be divided into two areas with generators sharing different swing modes. The center of the inertia (COI) reference frame is utilized to be the representative of the area's behavior. Secondly, an index called sensitive index is proposed to quantify the sensitivity of generator angular speed to the active-power change of an onshore VSC. A strategy is developed to determine the modulation direction and intensity of each onshore converter. Thirdly, the final control law is derived based on sliding mode variable structure control method. Simulation verifications are run in a four-machine ac system and a modified New England 39-bus system.

Abstract: In this paper, the authors firstly present the theoretical foundation of a state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification method, the dimension-adaptive sparse grid interpolation (DASGI), for introducing it into the applications of probabilistic power flow (PPF), specifically as discussed herein. It is well-known that numerous sources of uncertainty are being brought into the present-day electrical grid, by large-scale integration of renewable, thus volatile, generation, e.g., wind power, and by unprecedented load behaviors. In presence of these added uncertainties, it is imperative to change traditional deterministic power flow (DPF) calculation to take them into account in the routine operation and planning. However, the PPF analysis is still quite challenging due to two features of the uncertainty in modern power systems: high dimensionality and presence of stochastic interdependence. Both are traditionally addressed by the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) at the cost of cumbersome computation; in this paper instead, they are tackled with the joint application of the DASGI and Copula theory (especially advantageous for constructing nonlinear dependence among various uncertainty sources), in order to accomplish the dependent high-dimensional PPF analysis in an accurate and faster manner. Based on the theory of DASGI, its combination with Copula and the DPF for the PPF is also introduced systematically in this work. Finally, the feasibility and the effectiveness of this methodology are validated by the test results of two standard IEEE test cases.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a long-term planning model of transmission line expansion based on balancing investment cost and reducing consumer cost. We achieve this by formulating a hierarchical framework that is sensitive to different agents operating on different timelines, the relationships of which may be competitive, cooperative or somewhere in between. The advantage of this framework is that while it captures the complexity of long-term decision making, it maintains clarity of information flow between models, agents and timelines. For our purposes, we introduce an equilibrium model that combines grid operational concerns with the short-term competitive behavior of generation firms. An iterative solution technique is proposed to provide a Nash solution where each optimization problem is solved globally. This solution is then used to inform an overarching transmission planning model that we solve using derivative-free optimization. Using a de-congested network as a benchmark, numerical results indicate a non-alignment of the objectives of planning and operational entities, whereby easing line congestion may not offer monetary benefits to the wholesale consumer.

Abstract: A two-stage load control scheme is presented to address severe under-frequency conditions. The first stage is event-based under-frequency load shedding that guarantees fast response to the detected high-consequence disturbances, for initial system protection. The control signals are obtained by solving mixed-integer programming problems. After the first stage, model predictive control is triggered in the second stage for step-by-step online closed-loop control of interruptible loads, the amount of which is identified via solving linear programming problems. Trajectory sensitivities are used in the optimization problems in both stages to facilitate the analysis. The proposed scheme has been tested on a 9-bus system and on the New England 39-bus system.

Abstract: Increasing penetration of renewable power sources (RESs) is bringing more uncertainties to power systems. Real-time economic dispatch should be able to handle the fluctuations caused by the load as well as RESs, and obtain new optimal operating points after deviating from original generation schedules. This paper proposes a generation adjustment algorithm based on the base point and participation factor method. The objective of the method is to obtain fast adjustments to generators' real power outputs in real-time economic dispatch. The proposed method achieves significant and consistent improvements comparing to the original participation factor method by using a more precise model of transmission losses in the optimization process. The computational burden and execution time of the proposed method is much less than OPF and heuristic economic dispatch methods. The proposed method and its effectiveness are tested using IEEE 30-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, and GuangDong 1018-bus system. Simulation results are demonstrated with comparisons and discussions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to energy exchange between electric vehicle (EV) load and wind generation utilities participating in the day-ahead energy, balancing, and regulation markets. An optimal bidding/offering strategy model is developed to mitigate wind energy and EV imbalance threats, and optimize EV charging profiles. A new strategy model is based on optimizing decision making of a wind generating company (WGenCO) in selecting the best option among the use of the balancing or regulation services, the use of the energy storage system (ESS) and the use of all of them to compensate wind power deviation. Energy imbalance is discussed using conventional systems, ESS, and EV-Wind coordination; results are compared and analyzed. Stochastic intra-hour optimization is solved by mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Uncertainties associated with wind forecasting, energy price, and behavior of EV owners based on their driving patterns, are considered in the proposed stochastic method and validated through several case studies.

Abstract: Should energy storage buy and sell power at wholesale prices like utilities and generators, or should its physical and financial operation be asynchronyous as with transmission lines? In the first case, storage straightforwardly profits through inter-temporal arbitrage, also known as load shifting and peak shaving. In this paper, the latter case, referred to as passive storage, is examined. Because passive storage does not make nodal price transactions, new mechanisms are necessary for its integration into electricity markets. This issue is addressed by further developing the analogy between energy storage and transmission. Specifically, financial rights are defined for storage, and tracing is extended to multiperiod power flows linked by storage. Like flowgate transmission rights, the new financial storage rights redistribute the system operator's merchandising surplus and enable risk-averse market participants to hedge against nodal price volatility resulting from storage congestion. Simple examples are given demonstrating the implementation of the new mechanisms. Game-theoretic analysis suggests that financial storage rights mitigate gaming when both the generator and load bid strategically.

Abstract: Electricity demand forecasts are needed for decisions regarding generation dispatch for lead times as short as just a few minutes. Imbalance between generation and demand causes deviation of the system frequency from its target, which in Great Britain is 50 Hz. This, in turn, causes a change in demand, due largely to motor loads. For Great Britain, the change is estimated to be 2.5% of demand per 1 Hz of frequency deviation from its target. This can be used to calculate the demand that would have occurred if frequency had been at 50 Hz. Modeling and forecasting the resulting frequency-corrected demand provides a better basis for dispatching generation. This paper evaluates methods for forecasting frequency-corrected demand up to 10 min ahead. We introduce an exponential smoothing model that, like the system operator's proposed Kalman filter approach, jointly models frequency and demand. We also evaluate a set of univariate methods applied directly to the series of frequency-corrected demand. These methods have not previously been considered for lead times less than 10 min. In our empirical analysis, the best results were produced by a seasonal exponential smoothing method applied directly to the series of frequency-corrected demand.

Abstract: This paper deals with the short-circuit level constrained transmission expansion planning (TEP) problem through a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. The proposed framework is outlined by a master problem and three subproblems based on the Benders decomposition technique. The master problem incorporates the optimal investment planning model. System security and short-circuit level constraints are examined by subproblems I and II, respectively. In case of any violation, infeasibility cuts are derived to reflect the appropriate modification in the master problem solution. The short-circuit study is inherently a nonlinear analysis and hard to concurrently be tackled in power system studies. To overcome this difficulty, a linear approximation is developed for the short-circuit analysis which not only mitigates the computational burden of the problem, but even is efficient for taking the advantage of decomposed schemes. Subproblem III examines optimality of the investment solution from the operation point of view and, through optimality cuts, steers the master problem toward the optimal solution. The proposed model is tested on the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system and its effectiveness is assured by comprehensive simulation studies.

Abstract: Microprocessor-based relays protecting against fault current have revolutionized power automation industry. The leverage using commercially available information communication technologies has been the currency for future cyberinfrastructure deployment, which enables plausible electronic manipulation that can affect system operation. The bus differential protection has been recognized as one of the most critical protection schemes, if compromised, that would disconnect a large number of components within a substation. A hypothesized substation outage is the worst case scenario of intrusion attack events. This paper proposes an impact analysis of critical cyber assets in substations that capture historical load and topology conditions. This is to identify critical substations and other "nightmare" hypothesized combinations for security protection planning. The proposed metrics of attack scenarios incorporate electronic instrumentation in relation to the physical system for impact and dependency evaluation. Combinatorial verification of these hypothesized events based on the proposed reverse pyramid model ( RPM) is validated using IEEE 30- and 118-bus systems.

Abstract: High penetration of wind generation will increase the requirement for fast frequency response services as currently wind plants do not provide inertial response. Although the importance of inertia reduction has been widely recognized, its impact on the system scheduling has not been fully investigated. In this context, this paper proposes a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for stochastic unit commitment that optimizes system operation by simultaneously scheduling energy production, standing/spinning reserves and inertia-dependent fast frequency response in light of uncertainties associated with wind production and generation outages. Post-fault dynamic frequency requirements, 1) rate of change of frequency, 2) frequency nadir and 3) quasi-steady-state frequency are formulated as MILP constraints by using the simplified model of system dynamics. Moreover the proposed methodology enables the impact of wind uncertainty on system inertia to be considered. Case studies are carried out on the 2030 Great Britain system to demonstrate the importance of incorporating inertia-dependent fast frequency response in the stochastic scheduling and to indicate the potential for the proposed model to inform reviews of grid codes associated with fast frequency response and future development of inertia-related market.

Abstract: Increased penetration of renewable energy leads to increased challenges for the transmission system operators (TSOs) to operate their system in a secure way. Through the limited means available to the TSOs to manage power flows in the system, reliability is jeopardized. Reliability must be managed differently, replacing the current ways of reliability management which fails as uncertainty increases. In this paper, a novel risk-based approach of system operation is proposed that can be helpful for the TSOs to assess the confidence of system operation day-ahead, that is, the probability of the forecasted system to end up in an insecure state is calculated. This paper only focuses on violation of power flow constraints in the system. It also demonstrates the increase of this operation confidence using already installed power flow controlling devices. It is shown that these devices aid in enhancing confidence of system operation by shifting power flows to a more optimal one in the light of generation uncertainty. The main emphasis is laid on preventive action. The proposed approach is demonstrated on test systems.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of variable and uncertain generation from renewable resources poses a challenge for balancing the power system supply and demand. Violations of this constraint seriously impact system reliability and thus carry with them a very high cost. In order to address the issues created by variable generation increased system flexibility is required. System operators are considering modifications to the conventional real-time economic dispatch model to provide improved ramp flexibility. In this paper an operational flexibility metric called lack of ramp probability (LORP) is proposed for the real-time economic dispatch. Further, a two-step robust optimization based framework is introduced to simultaneously guarantee LORP flexibility metric and ensure ramp deliverability in a multi-zonal setting. The proposed framework is illustrated on a 3-zone modified IEEE 73 bus (RTS-96) test system.

Abstract: Power router technology is maturing to the point of becoming a cost-effective enabler of increased transmission asset utilization. Power routers can enable a desirable increase in control of power systems, especially as infrastructure ages and degrades. This paper presents a formal extension to the traditional security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) algorithm, named flexible security-constrained optimal power flow (FSCOPF), which utilizes power router control in the post-contingency timeframe. The operational improvement is enabled by the fast-response capability of FACTS-based power routers to change setpoints in response to power system contingencies. The FSCOPF algorithm, developed in this paper, allows for power routers to be used as a real-time dispatchable resource. We show that further power system savings are achieved when compared to the traditional SCOPF.

Abstract: French electricity load forecasting has encountered major changes during the past decade. These changes are, among other things, due to the opening of the electricity market and the economic crisis, which require the development of new automatic time adaptive prediction methods. The advent of innovating technologies also needs the development of some automatic methods because thousands or tens of thousands of time series have to be studied. In this paper we adopt for prediction a semi-parametric approach based on additive models. We present an automatic procedure for explanatory variable selection in an additive model and show how to correct middle term forecasting errors for short term forecasting. First, we consider an application to the EDF customer load demand which is typical of a load demand at an aggregate level. The goal of the application is to select variables from a large explanatory variables dictionary. The second application presented is an application on load demand of GEFCom 2012 competition, which we consider as a local application, where a major difficulty is to select some meteorological stations.

Abstract: The use of natural gas as fuel for electricity generation in thermal plants has played a key role in the development of power systems. The development of gas pipelines and other related infrastructure imposes availability constraints, which are often ignored when determining the optimal dispatch of the electric power system. This research proposes the use of an integrated optimization model, based on a stochastic dual dynamic programming methodology, to simulate both the scheduling of a hydrothermal power system and the transportation and availability of natural gas. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed model through the implementation of different case studies in the context of the main Chilean power network. We conclude that it is essential to consider the limitations that occur in natural gas power plant's dispatch due to the fuel availability constraints, because they induce the use of power plants with higher variable costs, directly impacting the total operational costs and marginal costs.

Abstract: There is significant interest in building HVDC transmission to carry out transnational power exchange and deliver cheaper electricity from renewable energy sources which are located far from the load centers. This paper presents a market-based approach to solve a long-term TEP for meshed VSC-HVDC grids that connect regional markets. This is in general a nonlinear, non-convex large-scale optimization problem with high computational burden, partly due to the many combinations of wind and load that become possible. We developed a two-step iterative algorithm that first selects a subset of operating hours using a clustering technique, and then seeks to maximize the social welfare of all regions and minimize the investment capital of transmission infrastructure subject to technical and economic constraints. The outcome of the optimization is an optimal grid design with a topology and transmission capacities that results in congestion revenue paying off investment by the end the project's economic lifetime. Approximations are made to allow an analytical solution to the problem and demonstrate that an HVDC pricing mechanism can be consistent with an AC counterpart. The model is used to investigate development of the offshore grid in the North Sea. Simulation results are interpreted in economic terms and show the effectiveness of our proposed two-step approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generalized approach of the per unit normalization, named complex per unit normalization (cpu), to improve the performance of fast decoupled power flow methods applied to emerging distribution networks. The proposed approach takes into account the changes envisaged and also already faced by distribution systems, such as high penetration of generation sources and more interconnection between feeders, while considering the typical characteristics of distribution systems, as the high R/X ratios. These characteristics impose difficulties on the performance of both backward-forward sweep and decoupled-based power flow methods. The cpu concept is centred on the use of a complex volt-ampere base, which overcomes the numerical problems raised by the high R/X ratios of distribution feeders. As a consequence, decoupled power flow methods can be efficiently applied to distribution system analysis. The performance of the proposed technique and the simplicity of adapting it to existing power flow programs are addressed in the paper. Different distribution network configurations and load conditions have been used to illustrate and evaluate the use of cpu.

Abstract: This paper presents a generic rms model of voltage source converter (VSC) in modular multilevel converter (MMC) topology for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) application. The generic rms model is suitable for stability analysis of a MMC-VSC-HVDC interconnected to ac power system. Based on the rms model, a linearized model for analytical model analysis is also developed and described. The parameters of the generic rms model are identified via an established averaged EMT model. The dynamic performance of the proposed generic model is tested in both time and frequency domain analysis using a typical high-voltage transmission system.

Abstract: It is of paramount importance that power system operators be able to assess transient stability in order to realize a reliable and stable power supply. Transient stability analysis can be formulated as a large-scale system of differential and algebraic equations (DAE). However, as power systems are becoming larger and more complex, it is becoming difficult to solve DAE in a practical amount of time for system operations. Parallel computing based on the waveform relaxation method is an effective solution to achieve faster calculations for transient stability analysis. To enhance the performance of the waveform relaxation method, a proper partitioning of the original problem is essential. Although various partitioning approaches have been used, those approaches might not be effective when analyzing a weakly damped low-frequency oscillation. In particular, in the Japanese 60-Hz power system, this oscillation becomes an important problem. To resolve this issue, in this paper we have developed a new partitioning method that is better suited to analyzing a weakly damped low-frequency oscillation based on eigenvalue analysis. Specifically, effective partitioning can be automatically determined by the proposed index, which can evaluate the validity of the partitioning. The proposed method was tested using the Japanese standards of the IEEJ WEST10 system model and the WEST30 system model.

Abstract: In this paper we present a novel method for daily short-term load forecasting, belonging to the class of "similar shape" algorithms. In the proposed method, a number of parameters are optimally tuned via a multi-objective strategy that minimizes the error and the variance of the error, with the objective of providing a final forecast that is at the same time accurate and reliable. We extensively compare our algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we apply our approach upon publicly available data and show that the same algorithm accurately forecasts the load of countries characterized by different size, different weather conditions, and generally different electrical load profiles, in an unsupervised manner.

Abstract: The United States targets to supply 20% of its electricity generation using wind energy by 2030. The expansion of renewable resources, especially weather-based resources such as wind, creates more uncertainty and variability in the operation of the power grid. New methods and approaches in electricity market operations are needed to efficiently manage the continuing increase in variability and uncertainty caused by expanding intermittent wind. This paper proposes an improved stochastic programming approach for incorporating wind uncertainty into energy markets. The proposed formulation improves the two-stage stochastic unit commitment problem by introducing a dynamic decision making approach similar to a multi-stage formulation in the presence of wind power scenarios which are not well represented by a scenario tree. The numerical results present up to 1%-2% decrease in operational costs compared to the two-stage stochastic unit commitment formulation.

Abstract: Integration of wind turbines introduces new challenges in terms of planning criteria. In this study, a new transmission expansion planning methodology considering N-1 contingency conditions is proposed to minimize investment cost and curtailed wind energy over planning period. To deal with the uncertainty of load and output power of wind turbines, probabilistic method based on clustering is used for determination of load and wind model. To incorporate the wind power curtailment into the proposed methodology, optimal power flow which uses DC-power flow equations is utilized by including cost functions of generators and overall optimization is carried out by using an integer genetic algorithm. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to the modified IEEE RTS 24-bus test system by considering different case studies in order to show the effects of including cost functions.

Abstract: Variable power sources are becoming increasingly common in low-inertia microgrids. Inadequate amounts, however, can disrupt electric service if ramped events occur too quickly. The authors introduce an approach to predict how long microgrids can withstand ramped events as a function of local inertia. Although microgrids can ride through disturbances using local inertia and other technologies, it is not clear for how long disturbances can be tolerated-particularly when in progress. The estimated reaction times are presented, first, as stability margins to illustrate how ramp-rate magnitudes relate to local inertia. Then, use of the reaction times is demonstrated as a forward-looking capability to anticipate frequency deviation times as a microgrid model undergoes large solar ramp rates. It is shown that the available remaining times can be estimated even as disturbances and remedial actions take place.

Abstract: Copper losses in low voltage distribution circuits are a significant proportion of total energy losses and contribute to higher customer costs and carbon emissions. These losses can be evaluated using network models with customer demand data. This paper considers the under-estimation of copper losses when the spiky characteristics of real customer demands are smoothed by arithmetic mean averaging. This is investigated through simulation and by analysis of measured data. The mean losses in cables and equipment supplying a single dwelling estimated from half-hourly data were found to have significant errors of 40%, compared to calculations using high resolution data. Similar errors were found in estimates of peak thermal loading over a half-hour period, with significant variation between results for each customer. The errors reduce as the demand is aggregated, with mean losses for a group of 22 dwellings under-estimated by 7% using half-hourly data. This paper investigates the relationship between the demand data time resolution and errors in the estimated losses. Recommendations are then provided for the time resolution to be used in future measurements and simulation studies. A linear extrapolation technique is also presented whereby errors due to the use of averaged demand data can be reduced.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel control algorithm for improving steady-state (quasi-static) voltage stability by use of an embedded voltage source converter (VSC) based high voltage direct current (HVDC) system. In this paper, the terms "steady-state" and "quasi-static" are used interchangeably. By embedded HVDC, we refer to a meshed AC system with all HVDC terminals connected within the same AC grid. The sensitivity between VSC control input and the voltage stability margin is introduced. Based on this sensitivity, the proposed control algorithm jointly satisfies system-wide voltage stability margin as well as local voltage magnitude requirements. The proposed approach is to first migrate the entire system to have sufficient voltage stability margin, and then to correct any voltage magnitude violation while keeping that stability margin. A contour-based visualization of the VSC capability space for maintaining system voltage stability is introduced, which can effectively illustrate how the singular value sensitivity (SVS) based control achieves both the local and global voltage stability requirements. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is shown via case studies on a 6-bus and 118-bus system with and without static VAR compensation.

Abstract: This paper presents a wide-area control approach to improve the transient stability of the power systems while also damping the post-fault inter-area oscillations. The proposed approach employs a nonlinear Kalman filter to estimate the inter-area modes using phasor measurement units (PMUs). The wide-area control system then uses the estimated inter-area dynamics through the developed control algorithms to improve the first swing and damping stability of the system. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the simplified Australian test system with different load models including induction motors and the results show significant improvement in the stability of the system by simply adding the wide-area control signals to the available controllers in the system. The application of the proposed wide-area control system is shown to be feasible on realistic systems by improving the system stability and efficiency.

Abstract: In several countries, the wind power penetration increased tremendously in recent years. To ensure the proper functioning of the power system, some grid operators already require the capability to provide inertial response or primary control with wind turbines. This paper discusses the emulated inertial response with wind turbines by means of the synthetic inertia and the droop control strategy. The behavior of the synthetic inertia strategy is determined by the inertial and the droop constant, whereas droop control only has a droop constant. When these strategies are used, it is important to tune the control parameters depending on the power system to which the wind turbines are connected. Simulations show that it is possible to enhance but also to deteriorate the frequency response of the system, dependent on these parameters. For different power system compositions, the optimal inertial constant is always close to zero. This way, the synthetic inertia strategy reduces to a fast droop control strategy. This is an important outcome, as it means that no differentiation of the frequency is needed to obtain an optimal inertial response from the wind turbines, which is beneficial in terms of robustness. Consequently, droop control is a viable alternative for the synthetic inertia.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a measurement-based approach to the real-time security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED). The real-time SCED is a widely used market scheduling tool that seeks to economically balance electricity supply and demand and provide locational marginal prices (LMPs), while ensuring system reliability standards are met. To capture network flows and security considerations, the conventional SCED formulation relies on sensitivities that are typically computed from a linearized power flow model, which is vulnerable to phenomena such as undetected topology changes, changes in the system operating point, and the existence of incorrect model data. Our approach to the formulation of the SCED problem utilizes power system sensitivities estimated from phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. The resulting measurement-based real-time SCED is robust against the aforementioned phenomena. Moreover, the dispatch instructions and LMPs calculated with the proposed measurement-based SCED accurately reflect real-time system conditions and security needs. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach via several case studies.

Abstract: Neatly represented and properly classified load profiles are fundamental to many control optimization techniques of modern power systems, especially in a distribution area. This paper presents a novel load profile management software framework for boosting the efficiency of power systems operation. The proposed framework encodes and classifies load profiles in real-time. Imperfections as well as time-shifts in the input (measured power consumption levels) are tolerated by the suggested system, thus always providing accurate, fast and reliable output. The framework's fully component based structure allows easy customizations of the encoding as well as the classification engines. The default encoding engine is based on an artificial neural network, a variant known as a deep learning auto-encoder comprised from stacked sparse auto-encoders. The default classifier engine is based on an implementation of a locality sensitive hashing algorithm. The developed methodology was tested on the real case of a set of anonymous customers supplied by a power distribution company. The paper also contains an elaboration about the experiences gained during the design, implementation and testing phase of this system as well as a detailed engineering use case of the framework's applicability.

Abstract: The integration of intermittent generation in power grids, such as wind energy, imposes new challenges for transmission congestion management. In order to solve this problem, energy storage systems (ESS) have been proposed in the literature, as they provide an efficient mechanism for balancing variability while reducing operational costs. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interactions between wind energy curtailment and an energy storage system (ESS) when the ramping rates of power plants are considered. An analytical framework is developed to study different mitigation measures in terms of total energy curtailed, total congestion costs, line load factor and congestion probability. This framework is tested in a real case study and a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the influence of the main ESS design parameters in congestion mitigation performance.

Abstract: In this study, implementation of flatness-based control on doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is investigated. Flatness-based approach is well adopted to control systems in two-level control structure where the tasks of planning, trajectory generation, and tracking the desired trajectories can be easily separated. As a result, the system is decoupled into two trivial linear systems. While in vector control the trajectories are found using PI controllers, in the proposed control structure the trajectories are computed directly, through algebraic equations. Desired active and reactive power are used to develop the set points for trajectory generation. Tracking of the desired trajectories is guaranteed through feedback linearization. The two-level control structure enables active power control and the opportunity for wind plants to contribute in frequency regulation. The proposed control shows promising results in tracking the desired reactive power and the active power across a variety of scenarios and in providing ancillary service to support the frequency regulation of the grid.

Abstract: This paper describes the first reliable Newton algorithm for the sequential computation of the set of dominant poles of scalar and multivariable transfer functions of infinite systems. This dominant pole algorithm incorporates a deflation procedure, which is derived from the partial fraction expansion concept of analytical functions of the complex frequency s and prevents the repeated convergence to previously found poles. The pole residues (scalars or matrices), which are needed in this expansion, are accurately computed by a Legendre-Gauss integral solver scheme for both scalar and multivariable systems. This algorithm is effectively applied to the modal model reduction of multivariable transfer functions for two test systems of considerable complexity and containing many distributed parameter transmission lines.

Abstract: With a large-scale introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), a new entity, the PEV fleet aggregator, is expected to be responsible for managing the charging of, and for purchasing electricity for, the vehicles. We approach the problem of an aggregator bidding into the day-ahead electricity market with the objective of minimizing charging costs while satisfying the PEVs' flexible demand. The aggregator places demand bids only (no vehicle-to-grid is considered). The aggregator is assumed to potentially influence market prices, in contrast to what is commonly found in the literature. Specifically, the bidding strategy of the aggregator is formulated as a bilevel problem, which is implemented as a mixed-integer linear program. The upper level problem represents the charging cost minimization of the aggregator, whereas the lower level problem represents the market clearing. Since the bids of other market participants are not known to the aggregator ex ante, a simple strategy is used to estimate them, based on historical data. An aggregated representation of the PEV end-use requirements as a virtual battery, with time varying power and energy constraints, is proposed, derived from individual driving patterns. Since driving patterns cannot be perfectly forecasted, we introduce a probabilistic virtual battery model. We compare the results of the proposed bidding strategy with those of a bidding strategy assuming exogenous prices, uncontrolled charging, and a central dispatch of the fleet. We also explore the impacts of different sources of uncertainty. Results show that with the proposed bidding strategy, costs are significantly lower than under inflexible charging and are lower than assuming exogenous prices. Moreover, the approach also performs well under uncertainty. Results also suggest that the aggregator only has limited market power potential at moderate PEV penetrations.

Abstract: Long-term contracting is the traditional governance mechanism to deal with the transaction costs associated with the specificity of gas industry assets. Long-term contracts have been often used to allocate risks among players, and to that end, they often include take-or-pay provisions. These clauses specify that buyers take the volume risk, as they are obliged to pay for a minimum amount of gas consumption. In exchange, buyers pay a predefined price, supposedly lower than the risk-neutral expectation of short-term gas prices. In that view, if the buyer is able to resell that gas in the short term, the contract is an effective hedge against short-term volatility. Otherwise, the contract does not act as a hedge but it becomes a sunk cost. The corresponding power producers' behavior involves not only output decisions but also financial decisions. To analyze that situation, this paper develops a new quantitative methodology that allows comparing risk-neutral valuations of gas and power markets decisions. We test the model in a real-size system, and show the additional cost of the power system associated with a possible illiquidity of the short-term gas market.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-level voltage controller for large-scale power systems. The aim of the controller is to maintain a near-optimal voltage profile in the transmission network by coordinating discrete reactive power (var) control devices in the system. The controller is targeted for implementation in electric power transmission utility companies where most of the voltage controls are coordinated by switching of discrete var devices such as shunt capacitor and reactor banks and transformer banks load tap changers (LTCs). By effectively dividing the controller responsibilities between local substation controls and a central coordinator at control center level, the design is aimed at voltage control of large-scale power systems. At local level, the substation controllers maintain their respective substation bus voltages by local power-flow-like computations using mostly local PMU measurements. The central coordinator computes and provides the voltage set-points to the substation controllers and also coordinates by enabling or disabling the local controllers as needed. The controller is being designed towards prototype implementation in Southern California Edison (SCE), starting with local controllers at specific substations in the first stage. It is tested on real-time dynamic models and large-scale power-flow simulations of SCE transmission network.

Abstract: Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has gradually become commonplace within the utilities industry and has brought with it numerous improvements in all related fields. Specifically in tariff setting and demand response models, classification of smart meter readings into load profiles helps in finding the right segments to target. This paper addresses the issue of assigning new customers, for whom no AMI readings are available, to one of these load profiles. This post-clustering phase has received little attention in the past. Our framework combines commercial, government and open data with the internal company data to accurately predict the load profile of a new customer using high performing classification models. The daily load profiles are generated using Spectral Clustering and are used as the dependent variable in our model. The framework was tested on over 6000 customers from GDF SUEZ in Belgium and six relevant load profiles were identified. The results show that the combination of internal data with commercial and cartographic data achieves the highest accuracy. Using external data alone, the model was still able to adequately place customers into their relevant load profile.

Abstract: Environmental concerns have motivated governments in the European Union and elsewhere to set ambitious targets for generation from renewable energy (RE) technologies and to offer subsidies for their adoption along with priority grid access. However, because RE technologies like solar and wind power are intermittent, their penetration places greater strain on existing conventional power plants that need to ramp up more often. In turn, energy storage technologies, e.g., pumped hydro storage or compressed air storage, are proposed to offset the intermittency of RE technologies and to facilitate their integration into the grid. We assess the economic and environmental consequences of storage via a complementarity model of a stylized Western European power system with market power, representation of the transmission grid, and uncertainty in RE output. Although storage helps to reduce congestion and ramping costs, it may actually increase greenhouse gas emissions from conventional power plants in a perfectly competitive setting. Conversely, strategic use of storage by producers renders it less effective at curbing both congestion and ramping costs, while having no net overall impact on emissions.

Abstract: Demand response can be used for providing regulation services in the electricity markets. The retailers can bid in a day-ahead market and respond to real-time regulation signal by load control. This paper proposes a new stochastic ranking method to provide regulation services via demand response. A pool of thermostatically controllable appliances (TCAs) such as air conditioners and water heaters are adjusted using direct load control method. The selection of appliances is based on a probabilistic ranking technique utilizing attributes such as temperature variation and statuses of TCAs. These attributes are stochastically forecasted for the next time step using day-ahead information. System performance is analyzed with a sample regulation signal. Network capability to provide regulation services under various seasons is analyzed. The effect of network size on the regulation services is also investigated.

Abstract: With the recent development of advanced metering infrastructure, real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is anticipated to be introduced in future retail electricity market. This paper proposes an algorithm for a home energy management scheduler (HEMS) to reduce the cost of energy consumption using RTP. The proposed algorithm works in three subsequent phases namely real-time monitoring (RTM), stochastic scheduling (STS) and real-time control (RTC). In RTM phase, characteristics of available controllable appliances are monitored in real-time and stored in HEMS. In STS phase, HEMS computes an optimal policy using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) to select a set of appliances to be controlled with an objective of the total cost of energy consumption in a house. Finally, in RTC phase, HEMS initiates the control of the selected appliances. The proposed HEMS is unique as it intrinsically considers uncertainties in RTP and power consumption pattern of various appliances. In RTM phase, appliances are categorized according to their characteristics to ease the control process, thereby minimizing the number of control commands issued by HEMS. Simulation results validate the proposed method for HEMS.

Abstract: A novel integrated exchange-based and flow-based model is presented in this paper, which attains simultaneously (a) intuitive exchanges, (b) maximum flows at the critical branches (up to their physical limits denoted by their Remaining Available Margin), and (c) it is cleared at one-shot. The model practically represents two problems that are forced to equilibrate: the first problem aims at the maximization of supply/demand surplus subject to respective supply/demand limits; the second aims at the maximization of intuitive branch exchanges subject to respective boundaries of exchange volumes as imposed by physical flow limits. The solution results attain a simultaneously physically feasible and "commercially" rational solution. The model is formulated as a Mixed Complementarity Problem, comprising linear complementarity conditions of the associated quantity and price variables, thus leading to computationally efficient solutions even in large-scale day-ahead electricity markets. The model is compared in terms of social surplus and cleared bilateral exchanges with the "intuitive patch" currently applied in the Central-Western European region, proving its superiority in attaining optimal intuitive solutions.

Abstract: This paper summarizes an instability monitoring and protection method based on local identification of global voltage instability (LIVES) and applies it to an IEEE test system for voltage stability and security assessment. The identification method (LIVES-alarm) is tested with both detailed and Quasi-Steady-State simulation tools, and two protection schemes, based respectively on reverse Load Tap Changer operation (LIVES-restore) and firm load shedding, are evaluated and compared using the unstable scenario provided with the test system. The effect of load sensitivity to voltage is also investigated.

Abstract: Analysis of transient stability of strongly nonlinear post-fault dynamics is one of the most computationally challenging parts of dynamic security assessment. This paper proposes a novel approach for assessment of transient stability of the system. The approach generalizes the idea of energy methods, and extends the concept of energy function to a more general Lyapunov functions family (LFF) constructed via semidefinite programming techniques. Unlike the traditional energy function and its variations, the constructed Lyapunov functions are proven to be decreasing only in a finite neighborhood of the equilibrium point. However, we show that they can still certify stability of a broader set of initial conditions in comparison to the energy function in the closest-UEP method. Moreover, the certificates of stability can be constructed via a sequence of convex optimization problems that are tractable even for large scale systems. We also propose specific algorithms for adaptation of the Lyapunov functions to specific initial conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a number of IEEE test cases.

Abstract: Unit commitment, as one of the most important control processes in power systems, has been studied extensively in the past decades. Usually, the goal of unit commitment is to reduce as much production cost as possible while guaranteeing the power supply operated with a high reliability. However, system operators encounter increasing difficulties to achieve an optimal scheduling due to the challenges in coping with uncertainties that exist in both supply and demand sides. This study develops a day-ahead two-stage multi-objective unit commitment model which optimizes both the supply reliability and the total cost with environmental concerns of thermal generation systems. To tackle the manifold uncertainties of unit commitment in a more comprehensive and realistic manner, stochastic and fuzzy set theories are utilized simultaneously, and a unified reliability measurement is then introduced to evaluate the system reliability under the uncertainties of both sudden unit outage and unforeseen load fluctuation. In addition, a cumulative probabilistic method is proposed to address the spinning reserve optimization during the scheduling. To solve this complicated model, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed. Finally, a series of experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this research; we also justify its feasibility on test systems with generation uncertainty.

Abstract: Markets for ramp products (called "flexiramp" in the California ISO and "ramp capability" in the Midcontinent ISO) have been proposed to address the need for generator flexibility due to increased renewable penetration. Flexiramp is committed capacity reserved to meet unexpected ramps in net load. We evaluate flexiramp market designs by comparing solutions of 1) an ISO real-time market simulation (a deterministic real-time unit commitment (RTUC) model with flexiramp requirements) with 2) a stochastic RTUC model, used as a baseline for evaluating flexiramp solutions. The flexiramp constraint improves the expected performance of ISO real-time markets, but is inefficient compared to stochastic RTUC. Flexiramp markets are inefficient in part because the deterministic model disregards the possibility of higher than anticipated energy production by capacity reserved for ramp. Thus, for instance, capacity with low commitment costs but high running costs might be overcommitted, increasing energy costs under high ramp outcomes. The amount of flexiramp acquired strongly affects costs. Too little results in under-commitment of generators and high price fluctuations and even demand curtailment; too much leads to over-commitment, inflating production costs. Hence, careful design of the ramp market and consideration of the use of full stochastic dispatch and commitment models is recommended.

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of modern power systems and the integration of volatile renewable energy bring great challenges to the existing security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) solution engines. This paper presents a fully parallel stochastic SCUC approach to obtain an efficient and fast solution for a large-scale power system with wind energy uncertainty. Variables duplication and auxiliary problem principle (APP) techniques are adopted to fully decompose the original stochastic optimization problem into three major solution modules: the unit commitment (UC) module solves multiple single UC problems; the optimal power flow (OPF) module handles multiple hourly DC-OPF problems; and the bridge module builds a connection between the UC and OPF modules. These three modules are conducted for both base case and scenarios, and can be totally solved in a parallel manner. Numerical case studies on a modified IEEE 118-bus system and a practical 1168-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach which will offer the power system a secure and economic operation under various uncertainties.

Abstract: As more non-dispatchable renewable resources are integrated into the grid, it will become increasingly difficult to predict the transfer capabilities and the network congestion. At the same time, renewable resources require operators to acquire more operating reserves. With today's deterministic reserve requirements unable to ensure optimal reserve locations, improvements to reserve policies are needed to ensure reserve deliverability while maintaining a reliable system at least cost. This paper proposes a daily reserve zone determination procedure, which is able to reflect system operating conditions by utilizing probabilistic power flows. A statistical clustering algorithm is used to cluster buses together to produce the zones; the algorithm uses a centrality measurement, which is based on weighted power transfer distribution factors. The proposed method is validated by testing it on a modified IEEE 118-bus system for multiple days; the proposed method is compared against existing reserve zone partitioning procedures. While the proposed reserve zone determination method is a heuristic, it is shown to be effective and it is a computationally tractable method. The proposed method can be used on its own and can be used along with stochastic programming techniques that implicitly determine reserves.

Abstract: This paper proposes a rule-based power management algorithm to enable the dispatch of a utility-scale PV power plant consisting of a hybrid energy storage system, in accordance with the Australian national electricity rules. This algorithm is purposely designed to regulate the instantaneous power of a PV plant with the same level of dispatchability as conventional power plants. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is robust under large forecasting errors (up to 60%) of solar irradiance and it can be easily implemented in practice. Specifically, this algorithm can be executed within seconds even when considering detailed market operation and model nonlinearities. A 30 MW PV plant, including a 7.5 MW/1.25 MWh vanadium redox battery and a 1.5 MW/0.25 MWh suppercapacitors bank, has been modeled using MATLAB/Simulink and PLECS software environment. The simulation results were based on various scenarios and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed power management algorithm. It has been shown that even in the worst-case scenario of solar forecasting error of 60%, the proposed algorithm still managed to deliver over 94% of the available energy for a given solar irradiance profile of one month.

Abstract: A novel online line switching methodology for increasing load margins to static stability limit of a look-ahead power system is developed. A design goal of the methodology is to balance speed (for online computation) and effectiveness (for quality of line switching solutions). Instead of dealing with the combinatorial nature of line switching problem, the proposed methodology employs the strategy of screening, ranking and identifying to find a set of high-quality solutions. The proposed methodology ensures the satisfaction of operational and engineering constraints of (look-ahead) post-switching power system. The proposed methodology also determines multiple solutions of line switching for operators to choose a desired one. The effectiveness of the online line switching methodology is evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus and a 1648-bus power systems with very promising results.

Abstract: Subsynchronous resonance (SSR) was observed in wind farms located in North China. These wind farms prevailingly consist of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) and are connected to series-compensated transmission lines. The observed resonant frequency is about 6 similar to 8 Hz, which is much lower than that of the reported SSR occurred in Texas. The frequency varies during the occurrence and this phenomenon is observed for the first time. The output power is usually within a certain range, when SSR occurs. Based on the practical system, an equivalent simulation system has been established, in which wind farms are modeled as many identical low rating DFIGs. Then, the SSR event is reproduced by simulations. Analysis results indicate that SSR happens even when the equivalent transmission system compensation level seen from wind farms is only 6.67%. Eigenvalue analysis shows that this phenomenon is an electrical resonance, and could be affected considerably by wind speed, number and control of DFIGs. The number of in-service DFIGs has a nonlinear impact on the damping of SSR. An equivalent electric circuit is deduced to intuitively explain why SSR happens and how the above factors affect it. Considering its features, this phenomenon is recognized as DFIG control participated induction generator effect.

Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) provides promising development for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) applications, including multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) and renewable energy integration. This paper, considering an offshore wind farm (OWF) integrated MMC MTDC system, investigates its start-up process with three main developments: 1) it further develops the mathematical model of MTDC with active networks and proposes a hierarchical start-up control scheme; 2) for the terminal which connects the OWF, it proposes a reduced dc voltage control scheme of mitigating the current surges with deblocking the converter at zero voltage difference on submodules (SMs) and proposes an overall sequential start-up control scheme for the offshore integrated MTDC; and 3) it analyzes and compares different start-up control schemes. To evaluate the proposed sequential start-up control scheme, an offshore MMC HVDC system is established on the RTDS. The simulation results verify effectiveness of the proposed scheme on the MMC MTDC system with two control paradigms, i.e., master-slave control and droop control, respectively. In comparison with different start-up control schemes, the superiority of the mitigation of voltage spikes and current surges are shown using the proposed scheme with less complexity and easier implementation.

Abstract: The analysis of severe blackouts has become an essential part of transmission grid planning and operation. This may include evaluation of rare-event probabilities, which can be difficult to estimate. While simulation offers flexibility to model large complex systems, efficiency remains a big concern when estimating very small probabilities. This paper presents an effective simulation technique to evaluate rare-event probabilities associated with cascading blackouts in an electric grid. We test our technique on an IEEE 118-bus electric network and show that it can dramatically improve simulation efficiency. We also demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively locate vulnerable links. These are links whose failures lead to the highest probabilities of a blackout event.

Abstract: Variations of load demands and generations bring multiple uncertainties to power system operation. Under this situation, power flows become increasingly uncertain, especially when significant distributed generations (DGs), such as wind and solar, are integrated into power systems. In this paper, a Complex Affine arithmetic based unbalanced Three-phase Forward-Backward Sweep power flow model (CATFBS) is proposed to study the impacts of uncertainties in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. An index of Relative Influence of Uncertain Variables on Outcomes (RIUVO) is proposed for quantifying the impacts of individual uncertain factors on power flows and bus voltages. The CATFBS method is tested on the modified IEEE 13-bus system and a modified 292-bus system. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms the Monte Carlo method for exploring the impacts of uncertainties on the operation of distribution systems. The proposed CATFBS method can be used by power system operators and planners to effectively monitor and control unbalanced distribution systems under various uncertainties.

Abstract: An adaptive damping control scheme based on classification and regression tree (CART) using wide-area signals is proposed in this paper. Different polytopes are chosen using classification trees. Next, a family of robust polytopic controllers is designed off-line. Finally, using regression trees and PMU data, the desired polytopic controller is identified in real time. A 16-generator, 68-bus system is used as the test system. Remote signals obtained from PMUs are employed for control purposes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control scheme is able to provide adequate damping for the oscillation modes of interest with respect to varying operating conditions without any prior knowledge of the post-disturbance state.

Abstract: This paper proposes a graphic modeling approach, fault diagnosis method based on fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FDSNP), for power transmission networks. In FDSNP, fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems) with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to model candidate faulty sections and an algebraic fuzzy reasoning algorithm is introduced to obtain confidence levels of candidate faulty sections, so as to identify faulty sections. FDSNP offers an intuitive illustration based on a strictly mathematical expression, a good fault-tolerant capacity due to its handling of incomplete and uncertain messages in a parallel manner, a good description for the relationships between protective devices and faults, and an understandable diagnosis model-building process. To test the validity and feasibility of FDSNP, seven cases of a local subsystem in an electrical power system are used. The results of case studies show that FDSNP is effective in diagnosing faults in power transmission networks for single and multiple fault situations with/without incomplete and uncertain SCADA data, and is superior to four methods, reported in the literature, in terms of the correctness of diagnosis results.

Abstract: Most existing carbon emission management strategies only control the total carbon emission without focusing on both the regional carbon emission and the stochastic properties of the system. Correlated regional loads and unpredictable renewable energies in the power system make regional carbon emission management (RCEM) increasingly challenging and necessary. A complex multi-objective RCEM model based on probabilistic power flow (PPF) considering correlated variables is contributed in this paper. The three objective functions to be minimized are 1) the cost of electricity generated, 2) the total carbon emission, and 3) the carbon emission difference among regions which reflects the regional carbon emission imbalance from the supply side. A new clonal selection algorithm (CSA) coupled with a fuzzy satisfying decision method and an extended 2m + 1 point estimate method (PEM) is proposed to solve this multi-objective RCEM model. The proposed method is illustrated through IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 118-bus and simplified Shanghai case studies. The proposed model can help reduce the total carbon emission, control regional carbon emission, prevent probabilistic congested lines from overloading, and choose the most suitable region for wind farms (WFs).

Abstract: Sustained oscillations observed in power systems can damage equipment, degrade the power quality and increase the risks of cascading blackouts. There are several mechanisms that can give rise to oscillations, each requiring different countermeasure to suppress or eliminate the oscillation. This work develops mathematical framework for analysis of sustained oscillations and identifies statistical signatures of each mechanism, based on which a novel oscillation diagnosis method is developed via real-time processing of phasor measurement units (PMUs) data. Case studies show that the proposed method can accurately identify the exact mechanism for sustained oscillation, and meanwhile provide insightful information to locate the oscillation sources.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for integrated generation and transmission maintenance scheduling model (IMS) that takes into consideration N-1 contingencies. The objective is to maximize the maintenance preference of facility owners while satisfying N-1 security and other constraints. To achieve this goal, Benders decomposition is employed to decompose the problem into a master problem and several sub-problems. A Relaxation Induced (RI) algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the large mixed integer programming (MIP) master problem. This algorithm is based on the solution of the linear relaxed problem. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reach a near-optimal solution that is usually satisfactory. If this near-optimal solution is not acceptable, it is used as the initial solution to fast start the solution of the original IMS problem. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using a modified version of the IEEE 30-bus system and a model of the power system of a Chinese province. Case studies show that the proposed algorithm can improve the computational efficiency by more than an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Natural disasters can cause large blackouts. Research into natural disaster impacts on electric power systems is emerging to understand the causes of the blackouts, explore ways to prepare and harden the grid, and increase the resilience of the power grid under such events. At the same time, new technologies such as smart grid, micro grid, and wide area monitoring applications could increase situational awareness as well as enable faster restoration of the system. This paper aims to consolidate and review the progress of the research field towards methods and tools of forecasting natural disaster related power system disturbances, hardening and pre-storm operations, and restoration models. Challenges and future research opportunities are also presented in the paper.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel comprehensive operation and self-healing strategy for a distribution system with both dispatchable and nondispatchable distributed generators (DGs). In the normal operation mode, the control objective of the system is to minimize the operation costs and maximize the revenues. A rolling-horizon optimization method is used to schedule the outputs of dispatchable DGs based on forecasts. In the self-healing mode, the on-outage portion of the distribution system will be optimally sectionalized into networked self-supplied microgrids (MGs) so as to provide reliable power supply to the maximum loads continuously. The outputs of the dispatchable DGs will be rescheduled accordingly too. In order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumptions, we formulate the problems as a stochastic program. A scenario reduction method is applied to achieve a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden. A modified IEEE 123-node distribution system is used as a test system. The results of case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: We present a rolling decision-making process for electrical power systems, in which unit commitment, dispatch and reserve policies are co-optimized in order to minimize expected short-run operating costs in the presence of uncertainty arising from demand and renewable infeeds. The uncertainty is assumed to be bounded, with estimated first and second moment statistics available. The rolling "look-ahead" process employs a planning horizon of several hours, with re-optimization taking place each time the first step has been implemented. We present an expected-cost formulation incorporating multi-stage recourse on continuous decision variables-plans for adjusting the dispatch in the light of future information to be discovered at each stage of the optimization horizon. The generic formulation allows the flexibility of devices such as energy storage units to be exploited in the reserve mechanism. We demonstrate using closed-loop numerical tests that significant reductions in the cost of accommodating uncertainty are attainable relative to a time-decoupled reserve mechanism. In contrast to previous results, we show that a time-coupled cost function is not required for this benefit to be observed. In addition, we show that relaxing binary unit commitment decisions after the first step of the horizon brings significant computational speed-ups, and in some cases also reduce closed-loop system operation costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a method that in real-time determines remedial actions, which restore stable operation with respect to aperiodic small signal rotor angle stability (ASSRAS) when insecure or unstable operation has been detected. An ASSRAS assessment method is used to monitor the stability boundary for each generator in real-time. The ASSRAS boundary represents the condition when a generator reaches the maximum steady state active power injection. The proposed control method exploits analytically derived expressions for the ASSRAS boundary and other characteristic curves in the injection impedance plane to determine an active power redispatch among selected generators to restore stable and secure operation. Since the method is purely based on analytically derived expression, the computation of the remedial actions is fast and well suited for real-time operation. The method was tested on the IEEE 14-bus and the Nordic32 test systems where results show that the method can efficiently determine the required active power redispatch to avoid an imminent instability.

Abstract: Decentralized demand control can help to ensure the balance between electricity demand and supply. In this paper, a multi-agent demand control system is proposed where residential demand is controlled to provide spinning reserves. With the proposed control framework, an aggregator of dynamic demand is able to control the consumption and the response on frequency changes of a cluster of loads. The primary frequency support by the cluster of loads can emulate the primary control of a conventional generator. The total customer welfare remains maximal during the frequency support by applying utility functions for each device.

Abstract: The rapid development of wind power generation imposes unprecedented challenges on power system operations due to its stochastic variations. This paper proposes the concept of dispatchable region (Disp-Reg) of the variable wind generation, and reveals its geometrical property. Disp-Reg is a polytope that indicates exactly how much nodal injected wind uncertainty a power system can handle. This concept can lead to a measure on the flexibility of economic dispatch strategies, or an extended version of the crucial concept "security region" in the uncertainty space. Moreover, this paper develops a systematic algorithm to compute the boundaries of Disp-Reg by solving linear programs and mixed integer linear programs. The PJM 5-bus system is used for illustrating the Disp-Reg concept. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real power grid in China to demonstrate its practical implications.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider dispatchability as the set of all admissible nodal wind power injections that will not cause infeasibility in real-time dispatch (RTD). Our work reveals that the dispatchability of the affine policy based RTD (AF-RTD) is a polytope whose coefficients are linear functions of the generation schedule and the gain matrix of affine policy. Two mathematical formulations of the dispatchability maximized energy and reserve dispatch (DM-ERD) are proposed. The first one maximizes the distance from the forecast to the boundaries of the dispatchability polytope subject to the available production cost or reserve cost. Provided the forecast value and variance of wind power, the generalized Gauss inequality (GGI) is adopted to evaluate the probability of infeasible RTD without the exact probability distribution of wind power. Combining the first formulation and the GGI approach, the second one minimizes the total cost subject to a desired reliability level through dispatchability maximization. Efficient convex optimization based algorithms are developed to solve these two models. Different from the conventional robust optimization method, our model does not rely on the specific uncertainty set of wind generation and directly optimizes the uncertainty accommodation capability of the power system. The proposed method is also compared with the affine policy based robust energy and reserve dispatch (AR-ERD). Case studies on the PJM 5-bus system illustrate the proposed concept and method. Experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the applicability of our method on moderate sized systems and its scalability to large dimensional uncertainty.

Abstract: Energy storage systems play a significant role in both distributed power systems and utility power systems. Among the many benefits of an energy storage system, the improvement of power system cost and voltage profile can be the salient specifications of storage systems. Studies show that improper size and placement of energy storage units leads to undesired power system cost as well as the risk of voltage stability, especially in the case of high renewable energy penetration. To solve the problem, a hybrid multi-objective particle swarm optimization (HMOPSO) approach is proposed in the paper to minimize the power system cost and improve the system voltage profiles by searching sitting and sizing of storage units under consideration of uncertainties in wind power production. Furthermore, the probability cost analysis is first put forward in this paper. The proposed HMOPSO combines multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm with elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and probabilistic load flow technique. It also incorporates a five-point estimation method (5PEM) for discretizing wind power distribution. The IEEE 30-bus system is adopted to perform case studies. The simulation results for each case clearly demonstrate the necessity for optimal storage allocation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper discusses how fast-response distributed battery energy storage could be used to implement post-contingency corrective control actions. Immediately after a contingency, the injections of distributed batteries could be adjusted to alleviate overloads and reduce flows below their short-term emergency rating. This ensures that the post-contingency system remains stable until the operator has redispatched the generation. Implementing this form of corrective control would allow operators to take advantage of the difference between the short-and long-term ratings of the lines and would therefore increase the available transmission capacity. This problem is formulated as a two-stage, enhanced security-constrained OPF problem, in which the first-stage optimizes the pre-contingency generation dispatch, while the second-stage minimizes the corrective actions for each contingency. Case studies based on a six-bus test system and on the RTS 96 demonstrate that the proposed method provides effective corrective actions and can guarantee operational reliability and economy.

Abstract: We introduce emerging utility-scale energy storage (e.g., batteries) as part of the set of control measures in a corrective form of the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. This enhanced SCUC (ESCUC) leverages utility-scale energy storage for multiple applications. In the base case, the storage units are optimally charged and discharged to realize economic operation. Immediately following a contingency, the injections of storage units are adjusted almost instantly to alleviate short-term emergency overloads, thereby avoiding potential cascading outages and giving slow ramping generating units time to adjust their output. The ESCUC is a large two-stage mixed-integer programming problem. A Benders decomposition has been developed to solve this problem. In order to achieve computational tractability, we present several acceleration techniques to improve the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Case studies on the RTS-79 and RTS-96 systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: An island formation identification scheme utilizing both phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) information, in conjunction with an analytical method, is developed and presented. The motivation for this work came from the investigation of the islanding event in the Entergy, Louisiana power system in 2008. During Hurricane Gustav in September of 2008, 14 transmission lines were lost which led to the formation of a large electrical island containing much of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This work proposes a method for identifying any specific area of the transmission system that is vulnerable to islanding as the result of losing a system branch. PMU measurements are then utilized to verify SCADA reports that a system branch has been lost. The proposed identification scheme is called the one line remaining (OLR) algorithm. The proposed algorithm identifies potential island formations based on the criteria that a single bus, or a number of buses, are connected to the rest of the system by only a single branch as a direct result of a branch outage. The OLR algorithm is detailed and applied to several small test systems to motivate and validate the approach. The OLR algorithm is then applied to a large Entergy test system for the Gustav islanding event and correctly identifies the last tie line that was lost and created the island.

Abstract: As wind penetration increases in power systems around the world, new challenges to the controllability and operation of a power system are encountered. In particular, frequency response is impacted when a considerable amount of power-electronics interfaced generation, such as wind, is connected to the system. This paper uses small-signal analysis and dynamic simulation to study frequency response in power systems and investigate how Type-3 DFAG wind turbines can impact this response on a test power system, whose frequency response is determined mainly by a frequency-regulation mode. By operating the wind turbines in a deloaded mode, a proposed pitch-angle controller is designed using a root-locus analysis. Time simulations are used to demonstrate the transient and steady-state performance of the proposed controller in the test system with 25% and 50% wind penetration.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of joint optimal allocation and sizing of dynamic Var sources (ODynVarS) for short-term dynamic performance enhancement of power systems. A heuristic optimization based approach is proposed with the aim of achieving a desirable performance under multiple contingencies with respect to a reference short-term voltage response. Based on a pre-selected set of credible contingencies and potential candidate locations for device additions, the approach employs the mean-variance mapping optimization (MVMO) in combination with an integrated mixed-integer search strategy (IMIS) and two intervention schemes, to accelerate and guide the search process towards a techno-economically optimum solution. The first intervention is performed at fitness evaluation stage to screen economic solutions which entail technical feasibility and to reduce computational effort. IMIS and the second intervention is concerned with MVMO's knowledge management, which facilitates the search for solutions comprising a small number of devices with relatively large VAr capacity. The approach is tested using the IEEE 39-bus New England system.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new methodology to formulate storage behavior in medium- and long-term power system models that use a load duration curve. Traditionally in such models, the chronological information among individual hours is lost; information that is necessary to adequately model the operation of a storage facility. Therefore, these models are not fully capable of optimizing the actual operation of storage units, and often use pre-determined data or some sort of peak-shaving algorithm. In a rapidly changing power system, the proper characterization of storage behavior and its optimization becomes an increasingly important issue. This paper proposes a methodology to tackle the shortcomings of existing models. In particular, we employ the so-called system states framework to recover some of the chronological information within the load duration curve. This allows us to introduce a novel formulation for storage in a system states model. In a case study, we show that our method can lead to computational time reductions of over 90% while accurately replicating hourly behavior of storage levels.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a DC optimal power flow (OPF) framework for storage portfolio optimization in transmission-constrained power networks. In particular, this model is designed to investigate two problems: 1) optimizing storage operation and allocation over a network given a fixed technology portfolio and 2) optimizing the storage portfolio (i.e., the size, technology, and network allocation of these resources). We demonstrate this framework using case studies based on the IEEE 14-bus test system with four different storage technologies. Our results show that although certain technologies are generally classified as being suitable for either power or energy services, many technologies can add value to the system by performing both fast-time scale regulation (power) and load-shifting (energy) services. These results suggest that limiting the type of service that a certain technology is compensated for may result in inefficiencies at the system level and under-valuation of storage.

Abstract: The expected increase in the penetration of renewables in the approaching decade urges the electricity market to introduce new products-in particular, flexible ramping products-to accommodate the renewables' variability and intermittency. A risk-limiting economic dispatch scheme provides the means to optimize the dispatch and provision of these products. In this paper, we adopt the extended loss-of-load probability as the definition of risk. We first assess how the new products distort the optimal economic dispatch by comparing to the case without such products. Specifically, using parametric analysis, we establish the relationship between the minimal generation cost and the two key parameters of the new products: the up-and down-flexible ramping requirements. Such relationship yields a novel routine to efficiently solve the non-convex risk-limiting economic dispatch problem. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results suggest that our approach may substantially reduce the cost for incorporating the new products. We believe our approach can assist the ISOs with utilizing the ramping capacities in the system at the minimal cost.

Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems with flexible resources for managing the variability of renewable energy sources (RES). The flexible resources include thermal units with up/down ramping capability, energy storage, and hourly demand response (DR). The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used in this paper for simulating random outages of generation units and transmission lines as well as representing hourly forecast errors of loads and RES. Numerical tests are conducted for a 6-bus system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system and the results demonstrate the benefits of applying demand response as a viable option for managing the RES variability in the least-cost stochastic power system operations.

Abstract: The efficient location identification of multiple line outages is critical to not only cascading failure elimination but also repair cost reduction. Most of existing methods, however, fail to handle location identification well. This failure typically occurs because the methods cannot overcome two challenges: the very limited number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and the high computational complexity. This paper presents an efficient algorithm inspired by the ambiguity group theory to identify the locations of line outages with limited PMUs. Using 14-, 57-, 118-, 300-, and 2383-bus systems, our experimental study demonstrates that the proposed technique successfully identifies the most likely multiple line outages while attaining a 500 speedup when compared to the method of exhaustive search.

Abstract: This paper presents tighter formulations and dynamic global cutting plane solution approaches for accelerating network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problems, as the computational bottleneck of NCUC problems is always a concern to independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission owners (RTOs). Specifically, this paper explores tighter mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based NCUC formulations, via locally ideal reformulation for piece-wise linear cost functions of generators and valid cover inequalities by linking system load balance/power flow constraints with generation capacity limits. The paper also discusses an enhanced solution approach by dynamically generating global cutting planes at infeasible/sub-optimal nodes of the branch-and-cut (BAC) tree, which would prevent similar infeasible/suboptimal nodes from being explored repeatedly. Since the major computational complexity of NCUC is caused by the large number of binary UC variables, the proposed strategies, being directly related to binary UC variables, could quickly identify infeasible/suboptimal binary solutions, reduce the search space in the BAC tree, and in turn improve the computational performance. Numerical case studies show that the proposed approach could significantly reduce the overall computational time as compared to the traditional NCUC approach.

Abstract: Motivated by several recent incidents, this paper investigates the impact of wind farm spatial distribution and shunt compensation levels on triggering system-side sub-synchronous oscillations (SSO) in wind-integrated power systems. Quantitative analysis on system eigenvalue sensitivities with respect to wind farm and transmission line parameters as well as system operating conditions is performed systematically to understand the multi-wind-farm-induced SSO. Coupling relationship for wind turbines with identical and different parameter settings on the studied SSO modes is investigated. Electro-magnetic simulations are performed on a multi-machine wind farm model derived from a practical wind-integrated power system, in order to verify the proposed study.

Abstract: Many singular value decomposition (SVD) problems in power system computations require only a few largest singular values of a large-scale matrix for the analysis. This letter introduces two fast SVD approaches recently developed in other domains to power systems for speeding up phasor measurement unit (PMU) based online applications. The first method is a randomized SVD algorithm that accelerates computation by introducing a low-rank approximation of a given matrix through randomness. The second method is the augmented Lanczos bidiagonalization, an iterative Krylov subspace technique that computes sequences of projections of a given matrix onto low-dimensional subspaces. Both approaches are illustrated on SVD evaluation within an ambient oscillation monitoring algorithm, namely stochastic subspace identification (SSI).

Abstract: Local and inter-area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically identified using spatial profiles of poorly damped modes, and they are mitigated via carefully tuned decentralized controllers. In this paper, we employ non-modal tools to analyze and control inter-area oscillations. Our input-output analysis examines power spectral density and variance amplification of stochastically forced systems and offers new insights relative to modal approaches. To improve upon the limitations of conventional wide-area control strategies, we also study the problem of signal selection and optimal design of sparse and block-sparse wide-area controllers. In our design, we preserve rotational symmetry of the power system by allowing only relative angle measurements in the distributed controllers. For the IEEE 39 New England model, we examine performance tradeoffs and robustness of different control architectures and show that optimal retuning of fully-decentralized control strategies can effectively guard against local and inter-area oscillations.

Abstract: Many interconnected power systems are constructed to meet the ever-increasing electric power transfer demand. A disturbance anywhere in such an interconnected system will directly influence the power transfer capability of major transfer interfaces, as well as the transient stability of the system. Instead of the current practice of monitoring the power transfer limit on a given interface, this paper proposes a real-time synchrophasor method to monitor the stability margin using generator phase angle differences and alert operators of the potential risk to the system at the steady state operation. This is accomplished by developing an algorithm to directly correlate the phase angle separation of critical generator bus pairs to power transfer on major interfaces. These critical generator bus pairs are selected systematically through transient stability simulation. The Eastern North American power system is used as a platform to illustrate the utility of the proposed method.

Abstract: The subsynchronous resonance (SSR) problem may become more serious with the continuous evolvement of a series-compensated power system. Consequently, the existing SSR mitigation scheme might no longer keep the system stable. This issue has been encountered by Shangdu Power Plant, where the deployed supplementary excitation damping controllers (SEDCs) that well stabilized the system before cannot maintain torsional stability after the recent change occurred in the power system. Therefore, a combined mitigation scheme of SEDC and generator terminal subsynchronous damping controller (GTSDC) is proposed in this paper to regain system stability. SEDC provides electrical damping by modulating the excitation voltage at the rotor side. Meanwhile, GTSDC can damp SSR via injecting super-synchronous and subsynchronous currents into the generator stator. Field tests have proven the effectiveness of this combined scheme in addressing the deteriorated SSR issue. Eigen-value analysis indicates that the combined scheme can provide enough positive damping for the system under any operating condition. Thanks to the low investment of SEDC and the flexibility of GTSDC, this combined scheme provides an economical and scalable solution for SSR mitigation, especially when the target system changes constantly.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the procurement of load shifting service by optimally scheduling the charging and discharging of PEVs in a decentralized fashion. We assume that the energy flow between PEVs and the grid is bidirectional, i.e., PEVs can also release energy back into the grid as distributed generation, which is known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G). The optimal scheduling problem is then formulated as a mixed discrete programming (MDP) problem, which is NP-hard and extremely difficult to solve directly. To get over this difficulty, we propose a solvable approximation of the MDP problem by exploiting the shape feature of the base demand curve during the night, and develop a decentralized algorithm based on iterative water-filling. Our algorithm is decentralized in the sense that the PEVs compute locally and communicate with an aggregator. The advantages of our algorithm include reduction in computational burden and privacy preserving. Simulation results are given to show the performance of our algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a fully distributed bisection algorithm for the economic dispatch problem (EDP) in a smart grid scenario, with the goal to minimize the aggregated cost of a network of generators, which cooperatively furnish a given amount of power within their individual capacity constraints. Our distributed algorithm adopts the method of bisection, and is based on a consensus-like iterative method, with no need for a central decision maker or a leader node. Under strong connectivity conditions and allowance for local communications, we show that the iterative solution converges to the globally optimal solution. Furthermore, two stopping criteria are presented for the practical implementation of the proposed algorithm, for which sign consensus is defined. Finally, numerical simulations based on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems are given to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.

Abstract: Due to the uneven geographical distribution between load and wind power, currently it is difficult to integrate the large-scale wind power into the State Grid in China. There are significant wind curtailments for wind farms due to system restrictions. This paper proposes a new way of utilizing wind power, i.e., in-situ consumption, as an alternative to the costly development of long-distance transmission of large-scale wind power. Electrolytic aluminum load, which is one of the most typical high energy consuming loads, is employed to absorb the excess wind power in western China. An actual isolated industrial power system for aluminum production driven by wind power and coal-fired power is described. The penetration level of wind power in the isolated power system is up to 48.8%. The power imbalance between generation and load demand caused by wind power fluctuation or the tripping of coal-fired generators can dramatically impact the frequency stability of the isolated power system, which is of small inertia. An online identification method of power imbalance based on Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) is presented. According to the characteristics of the electrolytic aluminum load, a system frequency control method by regulating the bus voltages of aluminum loads to eliminate the power imbalance is introduced. The simulation is done in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the results verify the validity of the proposed frequency control method.

Abstract: Power systems can make use of electric vehicle (EV) charging to improve system reliability. EV charging can serve the grid with charging interruption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity-injecting energy back into the system during the outage. However, the contribution of EVs is uncertain because they serve both the power system and the transportation sector. Scheduled EV charging can be affected either by failures of components such as charging facilities, or by human errors such as punctuality, rounding of time and errors in forecast of energy consumption. Moreover, with the introduction of the aggregator, the realization of EVs' grid services also plays an important role. This paper examines uncertainties of EV charging that can affect the EVs' capability to improve the system reliability. Methods are proposed to incorporate these uncertainties into generating system well-being analysis. Results show that the uncertainties identified directly affect EVs' contribution in the system well-being enhancement.

Abstract: This paper extends evaluation of reliability of the distribution system to incorporate electric vehicles' (EVs') contribution in different modes of operation. For each load point, two topologies-centralized and dispersed EV charging-are considered. During the islanding mode of operation, household demands can be supported by vehicle-to-home (V2H) and/or local vehicle-to-grid (V2G), depending on the charging topologies applied. In grid connected mode of operation, energy not supplied can be further reduced by interregional V2G, which allows energy exchange among load points through healthy mains and laterals by sectionalizing the failure parts of the grid. Evaluation methods are proposed to determine the capacity contribution of EVs for each scenario. For the scenario of interregional V2G, optimal power flow is conducted to maximize the energy exchange. From the results of a case study, V2H and V2G, on both local and system levels, show great promise for the reliability enhancement.

Abstract: The rapid development of wind power has led to an increased demand for spinning reserve in power systems today. However, one of the most severe challenges to China's power systems is the mismatch between wind power installation capacity and the capability for supplying spinning reserve within each independently operated provincial power system. Coordinating the spinning reserve across multiple areas would providentially improve the accommodation of wind power. This paper proposes a game-theoretical model for spinning reserve trading between provincial systems that treat spinning reserve as a commodity. Based on the incomplete information, the trading price is calculated by satisfying the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and then the trading quantity is determined. This ensures that both the buyer and the seller are able to maximize their expected profit. Case studies are performed using a 2-bus interconnected system and a 3-area IEEE RTS system. The results show that the proposed model is valid and effective.

Abstract: Natural gas (NG) network and electric network are becoming tightly integrated by microturbines in the microgrid. Interactions between these two networks are not well captured by the traditional microturbine (MT) models. To address this issue, two improved models for single-shaft MT and split-shaft MT are proposed in this paper. In addition, dynamic models of the hybrid natural gas and electricity system (HGES) are developed for the analysis of their interactions. Dynamic behaviors of natural gas in pipes are described by partial differential equations (PDEs), while the electric network is described by differential algebraic equations (DAEs). So the overall network is a typical two-time scale dynamic system. Numerical studies indicate that the two-time scale algorithm is faster and can capture the interactions between the two networks. The results also show the HGES with a single-shaft MT is a weakly coupled system in which disturbances in the two networks mainly influence the dc link voltage of the MT, while the split-shaft MT is a strongly coupled system where the impact of an event will affect both networks.

Abstract: Traditional security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) considers only static security criteria, which may however not ensure the ability of the system to survive dynamic transition before reaching a viable operating equilibrium following a large disturbance, such as transient stability. This paper proposes a tractable mathematical model for transient stability-constrained unit commitment (TSCUC) and a practical solution approach. The problem is modeled without explicit differential-algebraic equations, reducing the problem size to one very similar to a conventional SCUC. The whole problem is decomposed into a master problem for UC and a range of subproblems for steady-state security evaluation and transient stability assessment (TSA). Additional constraints including Benders cut and so-named stabilization cut are generated for eliminating the security/stability violations. The extended equal-area criterion (EEAC) is used for fast TSA and analytically deriving the stabilization cut, wherein multiple contingencies having common instability mode can be simultaneously stabilized by one cut. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the New England 10-machine system and the IEEE 50-machine system, reporting very high computational efficiency and high-quality solutions.

Abstract: Variable wind power output introduces new challenges to power system frequency regulation and control, such as automatic generation control (AGC) which is very important to regulate power system frequency. The existing methods to design control gains for proportional-integral (PI) controllers in AGC are either time consuming or easily affected by the designer's experience. Further, the control gains are usually designed with fixed values for specific scenarios in the studied power system. The desired response may not be achieved when variable wind power is integrated into power systems. To address these challenges, a dynamic gain tuning control (DGTC) method for AGC is proposed in this paper. By the proposed control method, PI control gains can be dynamically adjusted to reach the desired performance. The proposed method is tested in a modified IEEE 39 bus system with actual wind data, and compared with conventional control approach with well-tuned fixed gains in the simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed control method provides better AGC response with less deviation of system frequency and tie-line flow under variable wind power.

Abstract: A smart distribution system should restore service to interrupted customers as quickly as possible after an outage. Upgrading manual switches to remote-controlled switches (RCSs) enhances restoration capability. The placement of RCSs should consider both functional and economic requirements. This paper presents a systematic method to determine the set of switches to be upgraded for an existing distribution system. The maximum restoration capability is achieved by upgrading a near-minimum number of manual switches to RCSs. The RCS placement problem is formulated as a weighed set cover (WSC) problem. A greedy algorithm with a polynomial-time computational efficiency is designed to generate a near-optimal solution for the WSC problem. A 3-feeder 9-node test system and a 4-feeder 1069-node unbalanced test system with microgrids are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We study the problem faced by an operator who aims to allocate a certain amount of load adjustment (either load reduction or increment) to multiple consumers so as to minimize the aggregate consumer disutility. We propose and analyze a simple uniform-price market mechanism where every consumer submits a single bid to choose a supply function from a group of parameterized ones. These parameterized supply functions are designed to ensure that every consumer's load adjustment is within an exogenous capacity limit that is determined by the current power system operating condition. We show that the proposed mechanism yields bounded efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium. In particular, the proposed mechanism is shown to achieve approximate social optimality at a Nash equilibrium, if the total capacity limit excluding the consumer with the largest one is much larger than the total amount of load to be adjusted. We complement our analysis through numerical case studies.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are a promising alternative to conventional fuel-based automobiles. However, a large number of PEVs connected to the grid simultaneously with poor charging coordination may impose severe stress on the power system. To allocate the available charging power, this paper proposes an optimal charging rate control of PEVs based on consensus algorithm, which aligns each PEV's interest with the system's benefit. The proposed strategy is implemented based on a multi-agent system framework, which only requires information exchanges among neighboring agents. The proposed distributed control solution enables the sharing of computational and communication burden among distributed agents, thus it is robust, scalable, and convenient for plug-and-play operation which allows PEVs to join and leave at arbitrary times. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulations.

Abstract: Real-time load composition knowledge will dramatically benefit demand-side management (DSM). Previous works disaggregate the load via either intrusive or nonintrusive load monitoring. However, due to the difficulty in accessing all houses via smart meters at all times and the unavailability of frequently measured high-resolution load signatures at bulk supply points, neither is suitable for frequent or widespread application. This paper employs the artificial intelligence (AI) tool to develop a load disaggregation approach for bulk supply points based on the substation rms measurement without relying on smart meter data, customer surveys, or high-resolution load signatures. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate the training and validation data. Load compositions obtained by the AI tool are compared with the validation data and used for load characteristics estimation and validation. Probabilistic distributions and confidence levels of different confidence intervals for errors of load compositions and load characteristics are also derived.

Abstract: Prediction and shaping of dynamic response of the demand will enable advanced control algorithms for active demand management as well as improved stability assessment of the power system. Based on previously developed demand disaggregation approach, this paper develops a methodology for day-ahead prediction and shaping of dynamic response of the demand at bulk supply points without having to perform field measurements. The methodology is broadly based on application of artificial neural network and Monte Carlo simulations and incorporates multiple approaches namely, load forecasting, load disaggregation and the component-based load modelling approach. The input data include standard rms measurements at bulk supply points and actual and day-ahead forecasted weather data and does not rely on having access to detailed customer surveys or high-resolution load signatures. Measured dynamic responses of the demand from the substations of the local utility are used for validation. Load shifting and shaping of dynamic response of the demand are also illustrated.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid converter configuration for conventional Line-Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDC technology aiming to eliminate commutation failures under serious faults. Dynamic series insertion of capacitors during commutation is utilized to increase the effective commutation voltage. The operating principles are presented followed by detailed mathematical analysis for both zero impedance single-phase and three-phase faults in order to select the required capacitor size and its voltage level. The performance of the proposed method is validated by simulation results in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the results show that the proposed converter configuration is able to eliminate commutation failures under both fault cases. Consequently partial power transferring capability during single-phase fault and fast fault recovery from three-phase fault can be achieved. Further simulation results show that the harmonic content of inverter AC voltage and current are not significantly increased and the voltage stress of the thyristor valve is comparable to that of the original benchmark system.

Abstract: In this paper, a method for designing coordinated power system stabilizer (PSS) is presented. The proposed method is based on the reference model controller design. To this end, a model that is called single-machine non-infinite bus is presented for studying low frequency oscillations. Then a reference model is proposed for designing PSS based on the single-machine non-infinite bus model. Transfer functions of the understudy machine augmented with stabilizer are equated by transfer functions of the proposed reference model to compute the PSS's parameters. The damping of the reference model and consequently the damping of the designed PSS do not depend on the frequency of oscillations. Hence, the proposed PSS damps all intra-and inter-area oscillations and no incoordination will happen among the system's stabilizers. Two PSSs are designed using the proposed method for a test power system. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, the performance of the proposed PSSs are compared with the performance of multi-band PSS4B, conventional PSS, conventional PSS, and PSS designed based on particle swarm optimization. Robustness of stabilizers against variation of oscillations' frequency, variation of operating point, and existence of harmonics are used to measure their performances.

Abstract: Two distinct methods of applying generalized averaging techniques appear in the literature. The first method involves a direct mathematical mapping of all system equations and inputs into the frequency domain to produce harmonic coefficients that precisely match those produced by a sliding window Fourier decomposition during transient events. Although this approach reproduces the same harmonic coefficients as a sliding window decomposition, it is shown that reconstruction of the time domain waveforms does not match the response of the underlying time domain system during transients. In contrast, a second method has recently been employed by some researchers that does not strictly map all system equations and inputs into the frequency domain, and yet it has been shown to precisely reproduce time domain results during transients. This paper shows that this matching of the time domain transients comes at the expense of introducing spurious dynamics into the associated harmonic domain model, which may not exist in the underlying time domain system. The limitations and implicit assumptions behind these two methods are identified and compared, thus allowing researchers to readily determine which compromises are to be made based on the application in question.

Abstract: When the modern electrical infrastructure is undergoing a migration to the Smart Grid, vulnerability and security concerns have also been raised regarding the cascading failure threats in this interconnected transmission system with complex communication and control challenge. The DC power flow-based model has been a popular model to study the cascading failure problem due to its efficiency, simplicity and scalability in simulations of such failures. However, due to the complex nature of the power system and cascading failures, the underlying assumptions in DC power flow-based cascading failure simulators (CFS) may fail to hold during the development of cascading failures. This paper compares the validity of a typical DC power flow-based CFS in cascading failure analysis with a new numerical metric defined as the critical moment (CM). The adopted CFS is first implemented to simulate system behavior after initial contingencies and to evaluate the utility of DC-CFS in cascading failure analysis. Then the DC-CFS is compared against another classic, more precise power system stability methodology, i.e., the transient stability analysis (TSA). The CM is introduced with a case study to assess the utilization of these two models for cascading failure analysis. Comparative simulations on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus benchmark reveal important consistency and discrepancy between these two approaches. Some suggestions are provided for using these two models in the power grid cascading failure analysis.

Abstract: In the distribution management system (DMS), an essential application for the energy efficiency improvement is loss reduction. Loss reduction often involves the control of reactive power (var) resources to optimize the var flow in the network. Traditionally, most available var resources in the distribution network have been switchable shunt capacitor banks. Today distributed energy resources (DER) are becoming another significant var resource due to their increasing penetration, which brings new opportunities as well as challenges for loss reduction. This paper proposes an advanced loss reduction approach to achieve the optimal control coordination among multiple capacitors and DERs. The proposed approach and solution are developed on the basis of the detailed multi-phase distribution network modeling and the state-of-the-art optimization technology. This work also investigates the impact of the DER var control on the loss reduction improvement and voltage violation correction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on practical utility distribution circuits with varying degree of unbalance and model complexity. The performance of the solution method proves the capability of online solution speed for large and complex distribution systems.

Abstract: Energy production of a wind farm is greatly affected by the wake-effect. In wind farm planning, it is essential to optimize the layout of wind turbine generators (WTGs) to alleviate the impact of wake-effect. This paper presents a new wind farm layout optimization model with an objective function to maximizing equivalent power of the wind farm. The proposed model incorporates the discrete joint probability distribution and characteristics of the wind, wind energy model, and the wake-effect. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. In the optimization process, geometric analysis is conducted to determine the upstream WTGs and to calculate the horizontal and deviating distances among WTGs along the wind direction. An effective look-up table is constructed to directly determine the upstream/downstream WTGs. Then the optimal layout of a wind farm can be obtained. The proposed technique is applied to the wind farm layout optimization and the modified Roy Billinton Test System and IEEE Reliability Test System for reliability analysis of a generating system containing a wind farm. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and flexibility of the proposed technique in the layout optimization of WTGs in a wind farm.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to solve the unit commitment (UC) problem by solving a sequence of increasingly tight continuous relaxations based on the techniques of reformulation and lift-and-project (L&P). After projecting the power output of unit onto [0, 1], the continuous relaxation of the UC problem can be tightened with the reformulation techniques. Then, a tighter model which is called L&P-TMIP is established by strengthening the continuous relaxation of the feasible region of the tight UC problem iteratively using L&P. High-quality suboptimal solutions can be obtained from the solutions of the relaxation for this tight model. The simulation results for realistic instances that range in size from 10 to 200 units over a scheduling period of 24 h show that the proposed tight relaxation method is competitive with general-purpose mixed integer programming solvers based methods for large-scale UC problems due to the excellent performance and the good quality of the solutions it generates.

Abstract: Charging load modeling for electric vehicles (EVs) is a challenge due to its complexity. However, it serves as a foundation for related studies such as the impact assessment of EV charging behaviors on power system and power demand side management for EVs. The decisive factors affecting charging load profile include the power curve, the duration, and the start time of each charging process. This paper introduces the charging traffic flow (CTF) as a discrete sequence to describe charging start events, where CTF contains both spatial and temporal properties of a charging load. A set of equations are proposed to build a probabilistic load model, followed by simulation iteration steps using a flow chart. The parameter identification method based on ant colony (AC) algorithms is then studied in depth, and the pheromone update and the state transition probability are used to implement route finding and city selection, respectively. Finally, an actual case of battery swapping station is applied to verify the proposed model in both identification and simulation. The results show that the model has satisfactory accuracy and applicability.

Abstract: The dynamic phasor (DP) concept has been widely used in modeling electrical power systems. So far, the DP concept has been restricted to modeling systems with one single electrical source at a fixed fundamental frequency, either one generator or an ideal three-phase AC source. This paper aims to extend the DP modeling methodology to a wider application area. Two major achievements have been introduced: 1) application of DPs for multi-source, multi-frequency systems; 2) modeling of systems with time-varying frequencies. These two techniques enable the use of DPs to study nearly all types of electrical power systems (EPS). The developed theory is validated using a twin-generator system from the More Open Electrical Technologies (MOET) project. The accuracy and effectiveness of the developed models is confirmed by comparing the simulation results of detailed switching models and DP models under both balanced and unbalanced conditions.

Abstract: With the expansion and enhancement of the power transmission network, short-circuit current (SCC) has become a major concern in grid operations. While transmission switching is one effective solution to reduce the SCC without investing in additional equipment, switching lines could threaten system N-1 security. To find an efficient, and secure, yet economic switching solution, this paper proposes an optimal transmission switching model with SCC limitation and N-1 reliability. As the relationship between SCC and integer variables associated with the line states is coupled, nonlinear and difficult to explicitly express, an effective linearization method is proposed. Theoretical analysis of the linearization error is performed using an illustrative example. Case studies have shown that the linearization error is generally small and decreases rapidly with the increase of electrical distance. Based on the linearized expression for SCC, a transmission switching model with SCC limitation and N-1 reliability constraints is proposed. Furthermore, to assure the calculation accuracy for the SCC, an iterative algorithm is designed to compensate for the linearization error. Case studies on the modified IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus and practically-sized 300-bus systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The solving efficiency of the model is investigated and discussed as well.

Abstract: In liberalized electricity markets, it is essential and of great importance to develop a fair transmission cost allocation scheme that is able to reflect the "extent of use" of the transmission facilities as much as possible. In this paper, the transmission capacity is divided into four components: capacity used in normal conditions (CN), capacity reserved for contingencies (CC), capacity reserved for future use (CF) and invalid capacity (IC). CN and CC are determined by the power flow in the normal and contingency conditions of the system operation snapshot, respectively. The CF is determined by the maximum power flow in contingency conditions over a certain period (say yearly). The cost corresponding to IC would not be allocated to network users. Based on capacity usage identification, differential cost allocation methods are designed according to the functions of the transmission capacity. The cost corresponding to the capacity usage of the transmission asset under normal and contingency conditions is allocated separately. Case studies in a 3-bus system and the IEEE 30-bus system validate the good performance of the proposed structural transmission cost allocation scheme.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint scheduling problem of large-scale smart appliances and batteries (e.g., in a smart building), to minimize electricity payment, user's dissatisfaction and battery loss under kinds of constraints. Due to the binary nature of charge and discharge states of battery, this problem is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. In order to solve it efficiently, a distributed mixed optimization approach is proposed. First, Lagrangian relaxation is applied to decompose the original problem into two sets of subproblems, each of which corresponds to scheduling on appliance/battery. Then, the battery scheduling subproblem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and tackled by Benders decomposition. The main advantages of the proposed approach are the distributed implementation and low computational complexity, as shown by simulations.

Abstract: Many blackouts in electric power grids throughout the world are caused by cascading outages, which often involve complex processes in various timescales. The multi-timescale nature of cascading outages makes conventional quasi-static simulation methods inaccurate in characterizing actual evolution of outages. This paper proposes a multi-timescale cascading outage model using a quasi-dynamic simulation method. The model establishes a framework for simulating interactions among dynamics in quite different timescales. It realizes simulation of cascading outages with representation of time evolution, so it overcomes ambiguity of time in conventional cascading outage models and hence has better practicality. Moreover, the model considers dynamics, e.g., load variation and generator excitation protection which affect voltage and reactive power profiles. Also, an improved re-dispatch model based on sensitivity is proposed. These improvements facilitate better simulation for a realistic power system. Also, dynamic simulation can be flexibly incorporated into the simulation of short-term processes in this model as needed. Case studies with the proposed multi-timescale model on the IEEE 30-bus system discuss the role of generator protection in cascading outage evolution, and analyze stage characteristics in outages. The multi-timescale model is also demonstrated on a reduced 410-bus US-Canada northeast power grid. Moreover, impacts from dispatchers' involvements are analyzed.

Abstract: Widespread utilization of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) would incur more uncertainties, and thus challenge the traditional planning strategies for distribution systems. In this paper, a scenario-based comprehensive expansion planning (SCEP) approach for distribution systems is presented to cope with future uncertainties. This approach can not only take into account the initial investment and operation costs but also consider the expected adaptation cost to other future scenarios, and in this way the flexibility of an initial planning scheme can be achieved. Future scenarios are identified in line with three uncertainties, namely the conventional load levels, penetration levels of PEVs and whether or not with successful implementation of a coordinated charging strategy. The charging profile for dump charging mode has been determined straightforwardly, while that for coordinated charging mode is obtained by solving the proposed day-ahead dispatching model (DDM). Furthermore, a priority-based real time dispatching strategy (PRTDS) is proposed to obtain direct charging instructions for PEVs, and thus to demonstrate the rationality of utilizing the charging profile acquired from DDM in distribution system expansion planning (DSEP). Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by numerical studies.

Abstract: Estimation of electromechanical modes of a power system has attracted attention in the past few decades because it can provide vital information about the stability of the system. In this paper, a new state-space model is proposed for online detection of parameters of a ringdown signal using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed model can estimate both constant and time-varying parameters. Furthermore, stability analysis of the proposed model is performed to demonstrate the convergence of the parameters. Simulation results confirm the desirable performance of the proposed method for ringdown parameter estimation.

Abstract: Stability is an important constraint in power system operation and the transient stability constrained optimal power flow (OPF) has always received considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, the defects of the existing models and algorithms around this topic are firstly analyzed, on the basis of which, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed. The basic idea of the proposed method is to model transient stability as an objective function rather than an inequality constraint and consider classic transient stability constrained OPF (TSCOPF) as a tradeoff procedure using Pareto ideology. Second, a master-slave parallel elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used to solve the proposed multi-objective optimization problem, the parallel algorithm shows an excellent acceleration effect and provides a set of Pareto optimal solutions for decision makers to select. An innovative weight assigning technique based on fuzzy membership variance is also introduced for a more scientific and objective optimal solution decision. Case study results demonstrate the proposed multi-objective method has many advantages, compared with traditional TSCOPF methods.

Abstract: In this letter, a set of general necessary conditions for line congestions are established during ramping delivery, i.e., the redispatch process for uncertainty accommodation. Mathematically, the consideration of all line flow constraints may cause the intractability of the max-min problem in robust security-constrained unit commitment and dispatch. Without solving time-consuming linear programming (LP) problems, the lines that will not be congested can be quickly identified based on the necessary conditions and corresponding line flow constraints can be removed from the max-min subproblem in robust approaches. A promising application of the conditions is presented via the preprocessed max-min problem with high computational performance.

Abstract: Time delays significantly compromise the performance of wide-area measurement and control system and thus may jeopardize the stability of cyber-physical power systems (CPPS). A delayed CPPS (DCPPS) has a transcendental characteristic equation, leading to an infinite number of eigenvalues basically unsolvable by traditional eigen-analysis methods. In this paper, an explicit infinitesimal generator discretization (EIGD) approach is presented to tackle the traditionally intractable problem. First, the delayed differential equation of DCPPS is transformed to an ordinary differential equation by using an operator called infinitesimal generator. The operator is then optimally discretized, resulting in a highly structured, sparse and explicit approximant matrix. By exploiting the sparsity of the matrix and that of system matrices, the rightmost eigenvalues of the original DCPPS can be accurately computed. The contributions of the EIGD approach lie in the following: 1) it forms a theoretical foundation for accurately obtaining the critical eigenvalues of a CPPS with multiple delays; 2) it constructs a highly structured approximant matrix that enables efficient eigen-analysis of a large DCPPS by making full use of sparsity techniques; and 3) it integrates the shift-invert transformation, Arnoldi algorithm, Newton correction and eigen-sensitivity to form a computational framework for the analysis of large DCPPS. The accuracy, efficiency and scalability of EIGD have been extensively studied and thoroughly validated on the two-area four-machine test system and a practical large transmission grid.

Abstract: Available inertia and variable droop responses from a wind farm to support the short-term frequency control in power systems are analytically evaluated. The novelty lies in the approach to formulating the inertia constant and primary power reserve for a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) that operates at derated conditions. The formulations are extended to evaluate the capability of providing inertia and primary frequency support from a wind farm using an aggregated wind speed. As a consequence, the capability as a function of VSWT operating characteristics and conditions is quantified to rationally adjust the frequency controller gains, thereby ensuring stable performance of the wind farms during frequency transients. A modified system frequency response (SFR) model considering available inertial and droop responses from wind farms is developed to well simulate the SFR following wind power fluctuations. The effectiveness of the analytical method is verified through comparisons of the results with those obtained from the empirical method.

Abstract: With increasing renewable energy resources, price-sensitive loads, and electric-vehicle charging stations in the power grid, uncertainties on both power generation and consumption sides become critical factors in the Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) problem. Recently, worst scenario based robust optimization approaches are employed to consider uncertainties. This paper proposes a non-conservative robust SCUC model and an effective solution approach. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, the commitment and dispatch solution obtained in this paper can be directly used in day-ahead market as it overcomes two issues, conservativeness and absence of robust dispatch, which are the two largest obstacles to applying robust SCUC in real markets. Secondly, a new concept recourse cost requirement, similar to reserve requirement, is proposed to define the upper bound of re-dispatch cost when uncertainties are revealed. Thirdly, a novel decomposition approach is proposed to effectively address the well-known computational challenge in robust approaches. Simulation results on the IEEE 118-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed novel model and solution approach.

Abstract: Uniform marginal pricing cannot generally support competitive equilibrium solutions in markets with non-convexities, yielding surplus sub-optimality effects. Previous work has identified non-convexities associated with the generation side of electricity markets and proposed different approaches to address surplus sub-optimality. This paper extends this concept to incorporate the demand side. Non-convexities of flexible demand (FD) are identified, including options to forgo demand activities as well as discrete and minimum power levels, and resulting surplus sub-optimality effects are demonstrated through simple examples and a larger case study. Generalized uplift and convex hull pricing approaches addressing these effects are extended to account for FD non-convexities. Concerning the former, generalized uplift functions for FD participants are proposed, and a new rule is introduced for equitable distribution of the total surplus loss compensation among market participants. Regarding the latter, it is demonstrated that convex hull prices are flattened at periods when FD is scheduled to eliminate surplus sub-optimality associated with the FD ability to redistribute energy requirements across time.

Abstract: Impact of increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation is expected in Japan in the near future; thus a new voltage control scheme is required in order to improve the operation of distribution networks. We propose a new voltage control scheme for distribution networks based on a multi-agent system. The large voltage fluctuations caused by PV generations are effectively regulated by adjusting the conventional types of tap-changing controllers. We achieved an optimal control performance by developing a new optimal control law applicable to decentralized autonomous control. The autonomy is accomplished by using a multi-agent system. The proposed method is applicable to general distribution network and highly efficient for popular radial networks under certain approximations. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations of radial 6.6-kV test system with successful results.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel cooperative charging strategy for a smart charging station in the dynamic electricity pricing environment, which helps electric vehicles (EVs) to economically accomplish the charging task by the given deadlines. This strategy allows EVs to share their battery-stored energy with each other under the coordination of an aggregator, so that more flexibility is given to the aggregator for better scheduling. Mathematically, the scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to capture the discrete nature of the battery states, i.e., charging, idle and discharging. Then, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the MILP by means of dual decomposition and Benders decomposition. At last, the algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion, which makes it scalable and thus suitable for large-scale scheduling problems. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: We propose a model of a battery switching station (BSS) for electric buses (EBs) that captures the predictability of bus operation. We schedule battery charging in the BSS so that every EB arrives to find a battery ready for switching. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal schedule. It uses dual decomposition to decouple the charging decisions at different charging boxes so that independent subproblems can be solved in parallel at individual charging boxes, making the algorithm inherently scalable as the size of the BSS grows. We propose a direct projection method that solves these subproblems rapidly. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed approach is far more efficient and scalable than generic algorithms and existing solvers.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal coordinated control methodology based on the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for the multi-area smart generation control (SGC) under the control performance standards (CPS). A new MARL algorithm called correlated Q(lambda) learning (CEQ(lambda)) is presented to form an optimal joint equilibrium strategy for the coordinated load frequency control of interconnected control areas, and a SGC framework is proposed to facilitate information sharing and strategic interaction among multi-areas so as to enhance the overall long-run performance of the control areas. Furthermore, a novel time-varying equilibrium factor is introduced into the equilibrium selection function to identify the optimum equilibrium policies in various power system operation scenarios. The performance of CEQ(lambda) based SGC strategy has been fully tested and benchmarked on a two-area power system and the China Southern Power Grid. Comparative studies have not only demonstrated the superior equilibrium optimization and dynamic performance of the proposed SGC strategy but also confirmed its fast convergence and high flexibility in designing the equilibrium factor for the desirable operating state of correlated equilibria.

Abstract: Low-frequency inter-area oscillation is a potentially dangerous phenomenon in power systems involving exchange of power among generators in different areas. In this paper, we study the characteristics of inter-area oscillation by analyzing the distribution of the oscillation energy. First, we introduce equations for the kinetic energy of generators and the potential energy of network branches, derived from the linearization of system dynamic equations. Then, we study the mode composition and the distribution of the generators' kinetic energy during low-frequency oscillations. A modal kinetic energy participation factor is proposed for evaluating the participation of each generator in the oscillation. The relationships among electromagnetic power oscillation distribution, rotor speed deviation, and generator kinetic energy are analyzed and compared to their modal parameter left eigenvectors, right eigenvectors, and linear participation factors, respectively. The bus voltage angle deviation, active power oscillation, and branch potential energy are calculated using the right eigenvector from modal analysis. The distribution characteristics of voltage angle oscillation and branch potential energy in inter-area oscillation is developed. The simulation results for a four-generator two-area system and the New England 10-machine 39-bus system illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed theory and method for analysis of inter-area oscillations.

Abstract: Wind power has had a significant impact on power system stability due to its stochastic nature. In this paper, the impact of stochastic excitation on power-system small-signal stability is investigated based on stochastic differential equation (SDE) theory. The mechanical power input of an asynchronous wind turbine is considered as a stochastic excitation to the system and the system state equation is formulated based on SDE. The mean stability and mean square stability of such a system are demonstrated, and the steady-state expectation and covariance of the system state variables are obtained by mathematical deduction. The numerical simulations are presented on a two-machine infinite bus system and the IEEE 145-bus test system.

Abstract: In this paper, a modified auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling procedure that can capture time correlation and probability distribution of observed wind-speed time-series data is presented. The procedure introduces frequency decomposition (splitting the wind-speed data into high frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components), shifting, and limiting in addition to differencing and power transformation which are used in the standard ARIMA modeling procedure. The modified modeling procedure is applied to model 10 minute average measured wind-speed data from three locations in the Baltic Sea area and the results show that the procedure can capture time correlation and probability distribution of the data. In addition, it is shown that, for 10-min average wind-speed data in the Baltic Sea area, it could be sufficient to use ARIMA(6,0,0) and ARIMA(0,1,6) to model the HF and LF components of the data, respectively. It is also shown that, in the Baltic Sea area, a model developed for an observed wind-speed data at one location could be used to simulate wind-speed data at a nearby location where only the average wind-speed is known.

Abstract: Time-domain simulation (TDS) is the most accurate and reliable method for solving transient stability problem. This approach relies on the solution of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) using numerical integration, wherein a system of nonlinear equations is solved at each integration time step. Very DisHonest Newton (VDHN) method is one of the fastest available approaches for solving the system of nonlinear equations in the TDS. However, VDHN does not guarantee convergence and its sequential nature makes it difficult to take advantage of available multicore processors. This paper presents a new multi-decomposition approach (MDA) to achieve fast TDS, wherein the nonlinear system of DAEs is decomposed into three linear subsystems. An adaptive scheme is developed for updating the linear subsystems to ensure that approximation remains sufficiently accurate. The linear subsystems can be solved in parallel using multi-processor architecture. The MDA is demonstrated using IEEE 145-bus test system, and the results are verified against a commercial transient stability problem, Powertech Labs' DSATools.

Abstract: The dynamic economic dispatch problem is a high-dimensional complex constrained optimization problem that determines the optimal generation from a number of generating units by minimizing the fuel cost. Over the last few decades, a number of solution approaches, including evolutionary algorithms, have been developed to solve this problem. However, the performance of evolutionary algorithms is highly dependent on a number of factors, such as the control parameters, diversity of the population, and constraint-handling procedure used. In this paper, a self-adaptive differential evolution and a real-coded genetic algorithm are proposed to solve the dynamic dispatch problem. In the algorithm design, a new heuristic technique is introduced to guide infeasible solutions towards the feasible space. Moreover, a constraint-handling mechanism, a dynamic relaxation for equality constraints, and a diversity mechanism are applied to improve the performance of the algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated on a number of dynamic economic dispatch problems for a cycle of 24 h. Their simulation results are compared with each other and state-of-the-art algorithms, which reveals that the proposed method has merit in terms of solution quality and reliability.

Abstract: Economic dispatch (ED) considering valve-point effect, multiple fuel options, prohibited operating zones of generation units is a more accurate model compared to a conventional ED model. It is non-smooth and thus evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are so far the only feasible approaches for the model. In Part II of the paper, a new method, the dimensional steepest decline method (DSD), is proposed for the ED with non-smooth objectives. The DSD is based on the local minimum analysis of the ED problem presented in Part I of the paper. The fuel cost's decline rate between each two adjacent singular points is utilized to find the optimal solutions in a serial sequence. The computational complexity of the DSD is analyzed. The DSD has been applied to solve different types of ED problems on different test systems, including large-scale systems. The simulation results show that DSD can obtain more accurate solutions and consume much less time and its advantage is more obvious on large-scale systems, in comparison with the state-of-art EAs.

Abstract: Economic dispatch with valve-point effect (EDVPE) considered is presented as a more accurate model of the real problem compared to the conventional economic dispatch model. It is basically a non-convex, non-differentiable, and multi-modal optimization model with many local minima. Part I of the paper focuses on the local minimum analysis of the EDVPE. The analysis indicates that a local minimum consists of the singular points, the small convex regions, and the output of a slack unit that is dispatched to balance the load demand. Two types of local minima are identified and the second type could be ignored. To verify the rationality of the analyses, a traverse search has been performed to solve the EDVPE with and without considering the transmission loss on different test systems. All the simulation results support the analysis given in the paper. To effectively solve the EDVPE on a large-scale power system, based on the analysis presented in this paper, a new method, dimensional steepest decline method, is proposed in Part II of the paper.

Abstract: We investigate group formations and strategic behaviors of renewable power producers in electricity markets. These producers currently bid into the day-ahead market in a conservative fashion because of the real-time risk associated with not meeting their bid amount. It has been suggested in the literature that producers would bid less conservatively if they can form large groups to take advantages of spatial diversity to reduce the uncertainty in their aggregate output. We show that large groups of renewable producers would act strategically to lower the aggregate output because of market power. To maximize renewable power production, we characterize the trade-off between market power and generation uncertainty as a function of the size of the groups. We show there is a sweet spot in the sense that there exists groups that are large enough to achieve the uncertainty reduction of the grand coalition, but are small enough such that they have no significant market power. We consider both independent and correlated forecast errors under a fixed real-time penalty. We also consider a real-time market where both selling and buying of energy are allowed. We validate our claims using PJM and NREL data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of voltage regulation in power distribution networks with deep-penetration of distributed energy resources, e.g., renewable-based generation, and storage-capable loads such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. We cast the problem as an optimization program, where the objective is to minimize the losses in the network subject to constraints on bus voltage magnitudes, limits on active and reactive power injections, transmission line thermal limits and losses. We provide sufficient conditions under which the optimization problem can be solved via its convex relaxation. Using data from existing networks, we show that these sufficient conditions are expected to be satisfied by most networks. We also provide an efficient distributed algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm adheres to a communication topology described by a graph that is the same as the graph that describes the electrical network topology. We illustrate the operation of the algorithm, including its robustness against communication link failures, through several case studies involving 5-, 34-, and 123-bus power distribution systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time data compression and adapted protocol technique for wide-area measurement systems (WAMS). The compression algorithm combines exception compression (EC) with swing door trending (SDT) compression. The compression logic is designed to perform this algorithm in real time. Selection of compression parameters and data reconstruction are presented. An adapted protocol is introduced by improving the format of data frames defined by IEEE standard C37.118 for compressed data packets. The proposed compression technique and protocol were applied to the phasor measurement units (PMUs) of a hydropower plant in Guizhou Power Grid in Southwest China. A low-frequency oscillation incident was recorded by this technique. The raw, compressed and reconstructed data were analyzed to verify the compression and determine the accuracy of the proposed technique. Also, the wavelet-based data compression, the standalone EC and SDT are compared with the proposed compression technique. Our results demonstrated that this compression can reach the compression ratios in the range of 6 to 11. Also, this compression and adapted protocol technique can reduce the size of data packets by approximately 75% with high accuracy in both dynamic and steady states.

Abstract: This paper aims to study the measurement and modeling methods for delays in wide-area closed-loop control systems (WACS). The delays are classified into communication delays and operational delays based on the information flow of WACS. For communication delays, an affine evaluation model is proposed based on previous studies, and this model is verified by the measured communication delays of the Guizhou Power Grid in Southwest China. For operational delays, a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) hardware-in-the-loop measurement method is developed, and the measured operational delays are obtained and analyzed. Finally, an estimation method for the closed-loop delay in actual WACS is proposed, in which the uplink and downlink communication delays are modeled as constants and the operational delay is modeled as a normal distribution. Consequently, the closed-loop delay follows a normal distribution with the calculated parameters by combining the communication delays and operational delay. The measurement results and analysis presented in this paper are important for the development and applications of WACS.

Abstract: High-quality wind power prediction intervals (PIs) are of utmost importance for system planning and operation. To improve the reliability and sharpness of PIs, this paper proposes a new approach in which the original wind power series is first decomposed and grouped into components of reduced order of complexity using ensemble empirical mode decomposition and sample entropy techniques. The methods for the prediction of these components with extreme learning machine technique and the formation of the overall optimal PIs are then described. The effectiveness of proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to real wind farms from Australia and National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Compared to the existing methods without wind power series decomposition, the proposed approach is found to be more effective for wind power interval forecasts with higher reliability and sharpness.

Abstract: Online disturbance location is of significant importance to wide-area response-based situational awareness, stability analysis and control of the power systems. This paper presents an adaptive online disturbance location method that considers the anisotropy of the frequency propagation speed (FPS). The method geographically partitions the studied power system into several different regions offline. It then extracts the FPS vector for events occurring in each region. The method uses one event simulation for each region. The online simulations take into account changes in the generation, load and power grid topology. The location of the disturbance in each region is estimated specifically based on the speed vector of the region. Parallel computing is used to accelerate the estimation procedure. A part of the North and Central China interconnected power grid, which covers 7 provinces, is selected as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed disturbance location method and to analyze the speedup properties of the parallel computing.

Abstract: In this study, a locally weighted linear regression (LWLR) method is proposed to predict damping ratio of a dominant mode online. The LWLR method, which is nonparametric and data-oriented, is essentially proposed for nonlinear data fitting; therefore, it can track the nonlinear power system operations and help damping ratio prediction in real power systems, which is hardly achieved by the conventional linear regression. To successfully implement this method, the measurement of weighting value and the choice of weighting function as well as its parameter setting, related to prediction accuracy and numerical conditions, are extensively discussed. Simulations are carried out in a two-area four-machine system and a large complex system, China Southern Grid. Both results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Usage of wide area PSSs (WAPSS) in actual power systems is limited because of their restricted adaptability to different operating conditions. Numerous adaptive control methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but they are limited due to strict prerequisites, such as the necessity of consistent excitations or large disturbances. This paper, therefore, presents a novel adaptive wide area PSS (AWAPSS), which has the ability of tracking system operating condition without the need for meeting the above prerequisites. The inherent dead-band structure of a WAPSS enables a steady system to perform like in an open loop, thus allowing the parameters of a WAPSS to be tuned adaptively through output-only modal analysis. The effectiveness of the novel AWAPSS has been validated in a two-area four-machine system as well as in a large complex system, China Southern Grid.

Abstract: Reactive power outputs of DGs are used along with capacitor banks to regulate distribution network voltage. However, reactive power capability of a DG is limited by the inverter ratings and real power outputs of the DG. In order to achieve optimal power flow, minimize power losses, and minimize switching of capacitor banks, a day-ahead coordinated dispatch method of reactive power is proposed. Forecast errors of DG real power in every period are used to estimate the probability distribution of DGs reactive power capacity. Considering different output characteristics and constraints of reactive power sources, a dynamic preliminary-coarse-fine adjustment method is designed to optimize DG and shunt compensator outputs, decrease the switching cost, and reduce loss. The preliminary optimization obtains initial values, and multiple iterations between the coarse and fine optimizations are used to achieve a coordinated result.

Abstract: This paper presents a short-term power regulation mechanism for post-segmentation power distribution systems in the presence of severe fault or large disturbance. Firstly, load priority is introduced into system separation and centroids of load clusters are allocated at nodes with distributed sources, respecting power balance and network connectedness. Secondly, fast power flow calculation is performed on the primarily formed islands to resolve load interruption for operational feasibility of partitions from power quality perspective. Then the effect of distributed generation fluctuations on durable operation of subsystems with various optimization objectives is examined. The load response is instructed by the proposed cost-based pricing scheme contemplating consumers' willingness. In addition, the influence of network congestion and load controllability on results of economic scheduling is investigated. Numerical results from the PG&E-69 distribution system are used to show the effectiveness of the developed model in radial structure load clusters. Illustration on the IEEE 118-bus case further proves its robustness and practicability for other distribution systems applications. This property is also useful for transmission switching and micro-grid applications.

Abstract: The integration of wind power requires the power system to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate its forecast errors. In the market clearing process, the scheduling of flexibility relies on the manner in which the wind power uncertainty is addressed in the unit commitment (UC) model. This paper presents a novel risk-based day-ahead unit commitment (RUC) model that considers the risks of the loss of load, wind curtailment and branch overflow caused by wind power uncertainty. These risks are formulated in detail using the probabilistic distributions of wind power probabilistic forecast and are considered in both the objective functions and the constraints. The RUC model is shown to be convex and is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem using relaxation and piecewise linearization. The proposed RUC model is tested using a three-bus system and an IEEE RTS79 system with wind power integration. The results show that the model can dynamically schedule the spinning reserves and hold the transmission capacity margins according to the uncertainty of the wind power. A comparison between the results of the RUC, a deterministic UC and two scenario-based UC models shows that the risk modeling facilitates a strategic market clearing procedure with a reasonable computational expense.

Abstract: The series compensation capacitor and HVDC are widely used in Chinese power grids to increase the transmission capability of long distance lines, which might cause subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) between the turbine generators and power systems. The torsional mechanical damping coefficient of a turbine generator reflects the inherent damping level of the shaft and, thus, is a critical factor in SSO analysis. However, the torsional mechanical damping coefficient under practical operating conditions is difficult to obtain from the design parameters. In this paper, a novel approach is developed for online torsional mechanical damping coefficient measurements. The torsional interaction mechanism of identical parallel connected turbine generators is investigated, and then the characteristics of in-phase mode (IPM) and anti-phase mode (APM) are described. From this analysis, an active stimulating method for APM is presented, and a practical scheme for online torsional mechanical damping coefficient measurement is designed. fThis approach takes advantage of the APM features and decouples the generators from the grid. Moreover, the proposed approach has been implemented in the Yimin power plant in Inner Mongolia to realize online measurement of the torsional mechanical damping coefficient. Field test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Displacement of conventional synchronous generators by non-inertial units such as wind or solar generators will result in reduced-system inertia affecting under-frequency response. Frequency control is important to avoid equipment damage, load shedding, and possible blackouts. Wind generators along with energy storage systems can be used to improve the frequency response of low-inertia power system. This paper proposes a fuzzy-logic based frequency controller (FFC) for wind farms augmented with energy storage systems (wind-storage system) to improve the primary frequency response in future low-inertia hybrid power system. The proposed controller provides bidirectional real power injection using system frequency deviations and rate of change of frequency (RoCoF). Moreover, FFC ensures optimal use of energy from wind farms and storage units by eliminating the inflexible de-loading of wind energy and minimizing the required storage capacity. The efficacy of the proposed FFC is verified on the low-inertia hybrid power system.

Abstract: In traditional power system, economic dispatch and generation control are separately applied. Online generation adjustment is necessary to regulate generation reference for real-time control to realize economic operation of power systems. Since most economic dispatch solutions are centralized, they are usually expensive to implement, susceptible to single-point-failures, and inflexible. To address the above-mentioned problems, this paper proposed a multi-agent system based distributed control solution that can realize optimal generation control. The solution is designed based upon an improved distributed gradient algorithm, which can address both equality and inequality constraints. To improve the reliability of multi-agent system, the N - 1 rule is introduced to design the communication network topology. Compared with centralized solutions, the distributed control solution not only can achieve comparable solutions but also can respond timely when the systemexperiences change of operating conditions. MAS based real-time simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Abstract: In order to ensure the reliable operation of the electric power grid, infrastructure with increasing levels of distributed generation deployment, various entities and subsystems (e.g., ISOs, distribution utilities, micro-grids) needs a higher level coordination. Such coordination requires a formal decentralized control and management architecture that creates mechanisms for the operation and planning of numerous entities. A key function in power system operations and planning is the determination of total transfer capability (TTC), or the maximum amount of power that can be transferred from a set of source points to a set of sink points. This paper develops an algorithm for the decentralized computation of TTC through the application of the domain decomposition method (DDM). DDM decouples the correlation among interconnected control areas by taking advantage of the Schur complement matrix to form the power transfer distribution factor matrix. The decentralized TTC evaluation requires sparse information exchange among control areas. It is efficient and fully parallelizable. We demonstrate the decentralized TTC evaluation method on the IEEE 118-bus test case.

Abstract: This paper studies the role of hourly economic demand response in the optimization of the stochastic day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems with natural gas transmission constraints. The proposed coordinated stochastic model (referred to as EGTran) considers random outages of generating units and transmission lines, and random errors in forecasting the day-ahead hourly loads. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to create multiple scenarios for representing the coordinated system uncertainties. The nonlinear natural gas network constraints are linearized and incorporated into the stochastic model. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of applying the hourly economic demand response for enhancing the scheduling coordination of natural gas and electricity networks. It is demonstrated that electricity demand response would offer a less volatile hourly load profile and locational marginal prices, and less dependence on natural gas constraints for the optimal operation of electric power systems. The proposed model for EGTran could be applied by grid operators for the hourly commitment and dispatch of power system units.

Abstract: This paper presents a co-optimization planning model that considers the long-term interdependency of natural gas and electricity infrastructures. The model incorporates the natural gas transportation planning objective in the co-optimization planning of power generation and transmission systems. The co-optimization planning model is decomposed into a least-cost master investment problem for natural gas and electricity systems which interacts with two operation subproblems representing the feasibility (security) and the optimality (economic) of the proposed co-optimization. In addition, the natural gas subproblem would check the feasibility of fuel supply transportation system as part of the proposed co-optimization planning. The co-optimization planning of electricity and natural gas infrastructures would satisfy the desired power system reliability criterion. The iterative process will continue between the co-optimization investment and the operation subproblems until an economic, secure, reliable, and fuel-supply feasible planning for the two interdependent infrastructures is obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization planning approach.

Abstract: Integrating renewable energy into the modern power grid requires risk-cognizant dispatch of resources to account for the stochastic availability of renewables. Toward this goal, day-ahead stochastic market clearing with high-penetration wind energy is pursued in this paper based on the DC optimal power flow (OPF). The objective is to minimize the social cost which consists of conventional generation costs, end-user disutility, as well as a risk measure of the system re-dispatching cost. Capitalizing on the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the novel model is able to mitigate the potentially high risk of the recourse actions to compensate wind forecast errors. The resulting convex optimization task is tackled via a distribution-free sample average based approximation to bypass the prohibitively complex high-dimensional integration. Furthermore, to cope with possibly large-scale dispatchable loads, a fast distributed solver is developed with guaranteed convergence using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Numerical results tested on a modified benchmark system are reported to corroborate the merits of the novel framework and proposed approaches.

Abstract: This paper studies the online dynamic security assessment (DSA) of future distribution systems in which multiple electrically coupled microgrids are operated as an interconnection. By leveraging the highly controllable power-electronics-based interfaces, we propose a novel interface control strategy for desirable load sharing among interconnected microgrids. Under such a control framework, theoretical results on system-wide stability criteria in the sense of Lyapunov are obtained. Potential application of these results for microgrid-based smart distribution system DSA is presented. Minimum information exchange is required among microgrid modules and the distribution system operator, which is a highly desirable feature in future distribution management systems. Numerical studies of a five-microgrid study system designed based on the IEEE 123-node test feeder show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and DSA framework.

Abstract: Considering recent development of deregulated energy markets and the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, it is important for power system operators to ensure cost effectiveness while maintaining the system reliability. To achieve this goal, significant research progress has recently been made to develop stochastic optimization models and solution methods to improve reliability unit commitment run practice, which is used in the day-ahead market for ISOs/RTOs to ensure sufficient generation capacity available in real time to accommodate uncertainties. Most stochastic optimization approaches assume the renewable energy generation amounts follow certain distributions. However, in practice, the distributions are unknown and instead, a certain amount of historical data are available. In this research, we propose a data-driven risk-averse stochastic unit commitment model, where risk aversion stems from the worst-case probability distribution of the renewable energy generation amount, and develop the corresponding solution methods to solve the problem. Given a set of historical data, our proposed approach first constructs a confidence set for the distributions of the uncertain parameters using statistical inference and solves the corresponding risk-averse stochastic unit commitment problem. Then, we show that the conservativeness of the proposed stochastic program vanishes as the number of historical data increases to infinity. Finally, the computational results numerically show how the risk-averse stochastic unit commitment problem converges to the risk-neutral one, which indicates the value of data.

Abstract: Due to the variability of renewable resources, the ISO tries to identify do-not-exceed (DNE) limits, which are the maximum renewable generation ranges that the power system can accommodate without sacrificing system reliability. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is to find the largest operating ranges of variable resources such that the system remains feasible under any generation realizations within the range. Computing the DNE limits can be conceptually translated into finding the largest uncertain set of a robust optimization problem. Depending on the assumptions on how the system responds to the uncertainty of renewable resources, three alternative approaches are developed to convert the nonstandard robust optimization problem into linear programming, bilinear programming and two-stage robust optimization problems, respectively. Although the linear programming problem is easier to solve as compared to the other two alternatives, its resulting DNE limits are the most conservative. Therefore, the trade-off needs to be considered when deciding which approach is the most appropriate in real-time operation. A 5-bus system and the ISO New England power system are used to test the proposed approaches.

Abstract: Flexibility is a widely used term in planning process and real-time operation. The existing research on flexibility uses different techniques to study flexibility property from different aspects. While studying a property from various viewpoints increases the understanding on the subject, we need a consistent theoretical framework to consolidate the ideas generated in the field, compare and contrast results, and build on for future analysis. Based on the insights of the nature of flexibility, this paper proposes a unified framework for defining and measuring flexibility in power system. Under the proposed framework, we propose a flexibility metric which evaluates the largest variation range of uncertainty that the system can accommodate. Such a metric takes into account transmission network and system operations constraints, which are critical to assessing flexibility, but are often ignored in literature. A robust optimization technique is used to calculate the proposed metrics. While the illustrative example presented in this paper focuses on the flexibility in real-time system operation in the presence of wind and load uncertainty, this framework can generally be applicable to long-term studies such as system planning.

Abstract: Voltage problems are challenging in modern power systems with a high penetration of renewables integrated via power electronics. This paper extends the transient time-scale classification to identify voltage dynamics in modern power systems. Voltage dynamics in the current control time-scale is firstly proposed and then the mechanism of terminal voltage change is elaborated. After that the significant influences of the voltage source converter (VSC), current control (CC) loop and voltage feed forward (VFF) on the voltage dynamics in the current control time-scale are discussed. The VSC current control loop provides positive damping on the terminal voltage, while the VFF scheme results in an additional loop that deteriorates terminal voltage dynamic performance and stability. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the influence of critical parameters on stability. Finally, simulation results of a current-controlled VSC attached to different strength of AC grids (including a weak grid) are presented to validate the phenomenon and the influencing factors of voltage dynamics in the current control time-scale.

Abstract: Aggregation of diverse wind power sources can effectively reduce their uncertainty, and hence the cost of wind energy integration. A risky power contract is proposed, by which wind power producers (WPPs) can trade uncertain future power for efficient wind aggregation. A two-settlement market with both the risky power contract and a conventional firm power contract is shown to have a unique competitive equilibrium (CE), characterized in closed form. The marginal contribution and diversity contribution of each WPP to the group of all WPPs are fairly reflected in the profit earned by this WPP at the CE. Moreover, the CE achieves the same total profit as achieved by a grand coalition of WPPs. In a coalitional game setting, the profit allocation induced by the CE is always in the core, and is achieved via a non-cooperative risky power market. The benefits of the risky power market are demonstrated using wind generation and locational marginal price data for ten WPPs in the PJM interconnection.

Abstract: Optimization models have been widely used in the power industry to aid the decision-making process of scheduling and dispatching electric power generation resources, a process known as unit commitment (UC). Since UC's birth, there have been two major waves of revolution on UC research and real life practice. The first wave has made mixed integer programming stand out from the early solution and modeling approaches for deterministic UC, such as priority list, dynamic programming, and Lagrangian relaxation. With the high penetration of renewable energy, increasing deregulation of the electricity industry, and growing demands on system reliability, the next wave is focused on transitioning from traditional deterministic approaches to stochastic optimization for unit commitment. Since the literature has grown rapidly in the past several years, this paper is to review the works that have contributed to the modeling and computational aspects of stochastic optimization (SO) based UC. Relevant lines of future research are also discussed to help transform research advances into real-world applications.

Abstract: In response to the computational challenges produced by the integrated dispatch of generation and load (IDGL), this paper proposes a novel and efficient decomposition method. The IDGL is formulated using the mixed-integer quadratic constrained programming (MIQCP) method. To efficiently solve this complex optimization problem, the nodal equivalent load shifting bidding curve (NELSBC) is proposed to represent the aggregated response characteristics of customers at a node. The IDGL is subsequently decomposed into a two-level optimization problem. At the upper level, grid operators optimize load shifting schedules based on the NELSBC of each node. Transmission losses are explicitly incorporated into the model to coordinate them with generating costs and load shifting costs. At the bottom level, customer load adjustments are optimized at individual nodes given the nodal load shifting requirement imposed by the grid operators. The key advantage of the proposed method is that the load shifting among different nodes can be coordinated via NELSBCs without iterations. The proposed decomposition method significantly improves the efficiency of the IDGL. Parallel computing techniques are utilized to accelerate the computations. Using numerical studies of IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus, and practically sized 300-bus systems, this study demonstrates that accurate and efficient IDGL scheduling results, which consider the nonlinear impact of transmission losses, can be achieved.

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit breaker (CB) aging failure model based on condition monitoring. This model is inserted into a basic CB Markov model and applied in substation reliability assessment. The proposed model can accurately incorporate the wearing status and aging process of CBs. The results from applying the proposed method to a utility substation configuration demonstrate that ignoring aging failures of CBs can lead to significant underestimation of substation unreliability.

Abstract: Load profile classification is very important in load forecast, planning and management. Although customers are generally grouped by utilities into residential, commercial classes and respective subclasses, there is a lack of systematic framework that can be used to characterize different classes with signatures that are both human-readable and machine-readable. The work presented in this paper attempts to formulate the theoretical framework for customer classification using the annual load profiles. This paper demonstrates how to extract characteristic attributes in frequency domain (CAFD) and use these CAFDs to formulate a hierarchy of load profiles that can be used as the systematic framework for customer load classification. As signatures for customer classes and subclasses, the CAFDs are obtained by using a data mining method called CART (classification and regression tree). The paper presents a load profile classification test to establish the efficacy of the proposed approach which is significant improvement over current practices that provide mostly qualitative labeling.

Abstract: A hierarchical unit commitment (HUC) model is presented with the objective of maintaining system security by scheduling reserves in power systems with high wind penetration. The reserves in the HUC model include generation reserve, ramping reserve, and transmission reserve. These three reserves are proposed to guarantee system security with uncertain wind power. Moreover, the simplifications for the transmission reserve are applied to reduce computational burden. The hierarchical scheduling strategy, which considers both conventional and emergency operations, divides the wind power output into two intervals based on confidence levels, and uses different scheduling strategies for different intervals of wind power output. Finally, case studies compare HUC with RUC and SUC, which shows the effectiveness in system safety enhancement and the effectiveness in practical systems of the proposed HUC model.

Abstract: Heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can be viewed as elastic load to provide demand response. Existing work usually used HVAC to do the load following or load shaping based on given control signals or objectives. However, optimal external control signals may not always be available. Without such control signals, how to make a tradeoff between the fluctuation of non-renewable power generation and the limited demand response potential of the elastic load, while still guaranteeing user comfort level, is still an open problem. To solve this problem, we first model the temperature evolution process of a room and propose an approach to estimate the key parameters of the model. Second, based on the model predictive control, a centralized and a distributed algorithm are proposed to minimize the fluctuation and maximize user comfort level. In addition, we propose a dynamic water level adjustment algorithm to make the demand response always available in two directions. Extensive simulations based on practical data sets show that the proposed algorithms can effectively reduce the load fluctuation.

Abstract: Oscillations threaten the stability of a power system. Timely detecting oscillations can improve operators' situational awareness of system stability and enable remedial reactions. To detect oscillations during their early stages, this paper proposes a cross-coherence method using multiple-channel phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Oscillations are related to the peaks in coherence spectra and can be detected by visual inspection and setting up a threshold. Using simulation data, it is shown that the proposed coherence method can detect oscillations even under low signal-to-noise ratios. Three algorithms for estimating coherence spectra are implemented and evaluated. Their performances are compared using Monte Carlo methods. Based on the comparison, this paper makes some recommendations for proper use of the algorithms.

Abstract: This paper develops a self-coherence method for detecting sustained oscillations using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Sustained oscillations decrease system performance and introduce potential reliability issues. Timely detection of the oscillations at an early stage provides the opportunity for taking remedial reaction. Using high-speed time-synchronized PMU data, this paper details a self-coherence method for detecting sustained oscillation, even when the oscillation amplitude is lower than ambient noise. Simulation and field measurement data are used to evaluate the proposed method's performance. It is shown that the proposed method can detect sustained oscillations and estimate oscillation frequencies with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Comparison with a power spectral density method also shows that the proposed self-coherence method performs better.

Abstract: High penetration of distributed energy resources presents several challenges and opportunities for voltage regulation in power distribution systems. A local reactive power (VAR) control framework will be developed that can fast respond to voltage mismatch and address the robustness issues of (de-)centralized approaches against communication delays and noises. Using local bus voltage measurements, the proposed gradient-projection based schemes explicitly account for the VAR limit of every bus, and are proven convergent to a surrogate centralized problem with proper parameter choices. This optimality result quantifies the capability of local VAR control without requiring any real-time communications. The proposed framework and analysis generalize earlier results on the droop VAR control design, which may suffer from under-utilization of VAR resources in order to ensure stability. Numerical tests have demonstrated the validity of our analytical results and the effectiveness of proposed approaches implemented on realistic three-phase systems.

Abstract: Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause half cycle saturation of transformers and consequently affect the power grid with harmonics and reactive power losses. To effectively mitigate the negative GIC impacts in large-scale power systems, the present paper considers the problem of placing blocking devices in transformer neutrals. The placement problem of multiple blocking devices is first considered by analytically quantifying the associated reactive power losses. A linear sensitivity analysis is further provided for the case of blocking a single transformer, and it has been observed that the effects of blocking transformer neutral currents to be mostly local. This motivates us to propose the scheme that selects multiple substations to block all high voltage level transformers therein, based on a linearized approximation model. The effectiveness of such scheme has been demonstrated using both a 20-bus GIC test case and a realistically sized larger power system.

Abstract: As advances in scientific and business data collection have exponentially created more data, electric utility companies are seeking new tools and techniques to turn the collected data into operational insights and assist with cost-saving decisions. The cost of building a specific business-driven big data application, however, can be tremendously high. This paper proposes developing a standard-based software framework to address key utility big data issues and foster development of big data analytical applications. Based on the support of this generic framework, new big data analytical solutions can be rapidly built and deployed to improve business practices in a utility organization. The proposed framework-based approach, as demonstrated in the conducted case studies, has proven to be promising for addressing the emerging big data challenges in the utility industry.

Abstract: This paper describes an online short-term voltage stability assessment scheme from an overall view of the load area in the power system. In this scheme, data acquisitions are completed by post-contingency phasor measurements and a time series shapelet classification method is employed for classification learning. Combined with decision trees, this novel approach can not only hold a high performance of classification but also offer an acceptable interpretation of classification results. An improved algorithm to speed up shapelet searching is proposed, which makes it more practical. Semi-supervised cluster learning is also adopted in this scheme to mitigate the unreliability of the previous practical criteria. The test results on the Nordic test system demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Existing population-based Stochastic Search Algorithms (SSAs) are too time-consuming to solve dynamic optimal power flow (OPF). The solution proposed in this paper is to accelerate SSAs with memory. Two memory schemes, the similarity retrieval scheme and the mean-based immigrants scheme, are proposed and applied together to the Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimizer, which are two representatives of SSAs. Experiments are conducted on modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems with changing load buses and the objective of minimizing real power transmission loss. The results show that the proposed schemes significantly improve the performance of the two existing algorithms, and that SSAs could be practical for tracking optima of dynamic OPF.

Abstract: Auctions with non-convexities, as considered in this paper, use a multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) model based on generators' offers to calculate efficient schedules. The standard locational marginal prices (LMPs) may not support these schedules and uplifts are needed to help the generators break even. This paper presents a direct minimum-uplift (DMU) pricing model, which is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem with uplift minimization objective. New DMU prices are major variables constrained with decomposition formula based on shift factors, similar to the actual practice of developing LMPs. The remaining constraints reflect the generators' profits and uplifts modeled as functions of the DMU prices. The main feature of the DMU model is individual rationality attained in pool-based auction, under prices properly reflecting network constraints, complemented with minimum uplifts. The model is validated on several cases, including the IEEE 24-node system.
