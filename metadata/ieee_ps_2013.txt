Abstract: This paper develops a two-stage stochastic program and solution procedure to optimize the selection of capacity enhancement strategies to increase the resilience of electric power systems to earthquakes. The model explicitly considers the range of earthquake events that are possible and, for each, an approximation of the distribution of damage to be experienced. This is important because electric power systems are spatially distributed; hence their performance is driven by the distribution of damage to the components. We test this solution procedure against the nonlinear integer solver in LINGO 13 and apply the formulation and solution strategy to the Eastern Interconnect where the seismic hazard primarily stems from the New Madrid Seismic Zone. We show the feasibility of optimized capacity expansion to improve the resilience of large-scale power systems with respect to large earthquakes.

Abstract: Simulation scheme constructed by transient models is widely used for interconnected power system studies. However, it has shortcomings when used in automatic generation control (AGC) and AGC relevant fields. In this paper, a novel simulation scheme designed for AGC and its relevant studies is presented. The scheme uses dynamic energy balancing equation and a single central frequency as core algorithm. Moreover, models described by algebraic equations are adopted instead of transient models described by differential equations. The simplified models reduce computational power requirement to about 3% of transient models and require fewer parameters. By ignoring transient dynamics and inter-area oscillations which are insignificant in AGC timescale, the presented scheme achieves high computational efficiency and acceptable accuracy making it acceptable for up to year-long simulation. At the end of the paper, comparative tests are performed to provide differences, validity and accuracy of proposed scheme.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique to evaluate the electric power losses in MVAC and HVAC three-core XLPE cables. The proposed formulation allows to evaluate these losses without power flow simulations by shaping it either in a spreadsheet or in algorithmic form. The formulation can be easily set out within wider methods such as those used to evaluate the energy yield of offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) in cost-benefit analyses, or those used to evaluate techno-economically the alternatives in power system new asset optioneering. The avoidance of power flow simulation requirements contributes to a significant decrease in the time needed to conduct the studies and to an increase in the number of engineers and researchers able to fulfil them. Finally, the proposed formulation has been checked thoroughly and the validation is carefully addressed in the text.

Abstract: Based on the decentralized sliding mode control, a load frequency controller is designed in this paper for multi-area interconnected power systems with matching and unmatched uncertainties. The proportional and integral switching surface is constructed for each area to improve system dynamic performance in reaching intervals. The robust controller is proposed by the reaching law method to assure that frequency fluctuation converges to zero after a load and operation point variation. A three-area interconnected power system is studied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized sliding mode control scheme.

Abstract: In a carbon-constrained world, CO2 emissions will become a new concern in power system dispatch. Meanwhile, carbon capture power plants (CCPPs), which are a critical low-carbon power generation option, will have a significant impact on power system operation and dispatch. This paper presents research on low-carbon power system dispatch (LCPSD) incorporating CCPPs. The operating mechanism of CCPPs is investigated first. Then, the operating characteristics of CCPPs in power system dispatch are analyzed, including feasible power output limits, ramping rates and relationships between the power outputs and the carbon emissions. A comprehensive LCPSD model is formulated, in which the carbon emissions of power plants are treated as a new set of decision variables, and low-carbon-related cost terms are considered. The dispatch features of CCPPs are elaborately formulated and incorporated into the LCPSD model. The effectiveness and the validity of the proposed LCPSD mode and model are demonstrated using numerical examples based on an IEEE 118-bus tested system.

Abstract: This paper proposes an enhanced optimization formulation to help determine the type of power generation mix that can meet a given carbon emission target at the minimum cost. Compared to the previous studies, the model proposed in this paper takes account of the emission cost at operational level and explores its impacts on the long-term emission target oriented generation planning innovatively. Meanwhile, the model is able to take account of the integer variables and nonlinearity of the operational cost together with network constraints and renewable generation expansion in one long-term generation planning model. The problem is solved by an innovative discrete gradient search method, and a new concept, emission reduction cost (ERC), is developed, which helps determine which generation technology is the most cost efficient in emission reduction during different stages of generation expansion. A case study on a modified IEEE 30-bus system is presented to demonstrate the application of this model and the value of considering short-term emission costs and the network constraints on the long-term generation expansion. The results and sensitivity analysis are provided to show that a higher short-term financial pressure can help realize the emission target at a lower total cost (investment and operational costs). Optimization without considering it may overestimate the total cost required for the generation mix restructuring. Additionally, a comparative study shows that optimization without considering network constraints may underestimate the total cost required for realizing the specified emission reduction target.

Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic framework for short-term operation of a distribution company (disco). The proposed framework optimizes disco's operational decisions in two hierarchical stages. The first stage, called day-ahead operation stage (DAOS), deals with the operational decisions on purchases from the day-ahead market and commitment of distributed generation (DG) units. The objective of this stage is to minimize the expected operating cost while the financial risk exposed by uncertain real-time prices and loads is restricted to a given level. The model associated with this stage is based on the mixed-integer programming (MIP) format. The second stage, named real-time operation stage (RTOS), deals with disco's activities in real-time. In RTOS, decisions are made on real-time market transactions, dispatch of online DGs, and invocation of load curtailments (LCs) such that the expected operating cost is minimized. This stage is formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. To investigate the effectiveness of the developed framework, it is applied to a typical Finnish 20-kV urban distribution network.

Abstract: The teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) is a population-based optimization algorithm suitable for solving complex problems. TLBO imitates the interaction between a teacher and her/his students. The global solution search process of this approach consists of two phases: the teacher- and the learner-phase. This paper proposes a multi-objective teaching learning algorithm based on decomposition (MOTLA/D) for solving a reactive power handling problem. The proposed method is validated on three test systems, and it is compared with respect to a state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D).

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of network parameter error detection and identification in power systems. Recently, a parameter error identification method which is based on Lagrange multipliers corresponding to a single measurement scan has been developed. This paper provides an improvement of this method via the use of multiple measurement scans which increases the local redundancy at no additional cost. This leads to identification of errors which could otherwise not be identified. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the limitations of the single scan method and also shows the relationship between the number of scans, the normalized Lagrange multipliers and the normalized residuals. The presented method is easy to implement since estimation of different scans can be executed independent of each other by using an existing state estimation program. Simulations on IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus systems are provided to illustrate the proposed approach of parameter error identification.

Abstract: Conventional power system graphic applications use absolute coordinates approach, in which the objects are positioned with respect to a common origin. This can result in problems of re-adjustment and re-alignment in the network and substation diagrams when editing or merging the graphics. This paper introduces the notion of layouts and proposes a graphics model to facilitate positioning of graphical elements relative to each other in a hierarchy of layouts, thereby making the network diagrams flexible, sharable and extensible. This proposed graphics model, expressed in unified modeling language (UML), is shown to be compatible with the existing common information model (CIM) graphics model IEC 61970-453. Consequently, the need for extension of CIM graphics model is justified and an extension is proposed. Another key feature of the proposed model is configurability. Since the necessary parameters are explicitly modeled, the user only needs to provide configuration information describing the hierarchical connectivity of the substation or the network. The absolute coordinates can be calculated from the configuration and the power system diagrams can be auto-generated. This paper demonstrates the above benefits highlighting the technologies for implementation. Case study on 400-kV 20-substation diagrams of Maharashtra system in India is presented.

Abstract: Electrothermal coordination (ETC) is introduced for cable based transmission grids. ETC is the term covering operation and planning of transmission systems based on temperature, instead of current. ETC consists of one part covering the load conditions of the system and one covering the thermal behavior of the components. The dynamic temperature calculations of power cables are suggested to be based on thermoelectric equivalents (TEEs). It is shown that the thermal behavior can be built into widely used load flow software, creating a strong ETC tool. ETC is, through two case scenarios, proven to be beneficial for both operator and system planner. It is shown how the thermal behavior can be monitored in real-time during normal dynamic load and during emergencies. In that way, ETC enables cables to be loaded above their normal rating, while maintaining high reliability of the system, which potentially can result in large economic benefits.

Abstract: Renewable energy integration and deregulation imply that the electric grid will be operated near its limits in the future, and that the variability of cross-border flows will increase. Therefore, it is becoming more and more crucial to study the impact of these changes on the risk of cascading failures leading to blackout. We propose in this paper to emphasize important factors leading to blackouts, to review methodologies which were developed to simulate cascading failure mechanisms and to study specifically the impact of thermal effects on the risk of blackout for several changes in generation (variations in cross-border flows, wind farms penetration, shut-down of power plants). This is studied by applying to a test system the first level of a dynamic probabilistic blackout risk assessment developed previously. We show that taking into account thermal effects in cascading failures is important not only to have a good estimation of the risk of blackout in different grid configurations, but also to determine if a specific change in generation has a positive or a negative impact on the blackout risk.

Abstract: This paper explores scenarios in which independent wind power producers form willing coalitions to exploit the reduction in aggregate power output variability obtainable through geographic diversity. In the setting of a two settlement electricity market, we examine the advantage gained through optimal coalitional contract offering strategies for quantity risk reduction. We show that a group of independent wind power producers can always improve their expected profit by cooperatively offering their aggregated power. Using coalitional game theory we identify sharing mechanisms to fairly allocate the profits to coalition members. We show that the resulting coalitional game is balanced, guaranteeing that the core of the game is necessarily nonempty. In addition, we propose a profit sharing mechanism that minimizes the worst-case dissatisfaction to recover an imputation in the core. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with empirical studies using data from five representative wind farms in upstate New York.

Abstract: A statistical analysis is performed in order to investigate the relationship between wind power production and cross-border power transmission in Europe. A dataset including physical hourly cross-border power exchanges between European countries as dependent variables is used. Principal component analysis is employed in order to reduce the problem dimension. Then, nonlinear relationships between forecast wind power production as well as spot price in Germany, by far the largest wind power producer in Europe, and power flows are modeled using local polynomial regression. We find that both forecast wind power production and spot price in Germany have substantial nonlinear effects on power transmission on a European scale.

Abstract: A new method for selection of the most effective controls to prevent voltage instability in electrical power systems is developed in this paper. The proposed method is fast and suitable for real time operation. It is based on a sensitivity analysis of both a maximum loadability estimate (which is obtained via Look-Ahead method) and the load flow solution with respect to the selected controls. These sensitivities are calculated without computing the maximum loadability points, which significantly speeds-up the analysis. The method was successfully tested in a reduced model of the south-southeast Brazilian system composed of 107 buses.

Abstract: Conventional supplementary controllers (CSCs) can still be widely observed in power system utilities. This work aims to develop a modular neural block (MNB) to improve control performance and stability of CSCs-aided power systems. The proposed MNB is actually a one-to-one offline trained self-recurrent wavelet neural network (SRWNN) which can be modularity added to the PI/PD/PID/Lag-Lead controllers to enhance their performance by adding an adaptive property to them. Independent of the plant model, the MNB is initially trained offline using virtual training-samples. As a prefabricated one-to-one neural block, it can then be copied to required numbers and added to the lag-lead controller or any/all branches of the PI/PD/PID controller in series connection. The employed MNB(s) is then re-trained online to increase control performance by minimizing a predefined cost-function. The online training is performed by back-propagation (BP) algorithm while the closed-loop stability is guaranteed by an efficient Lyapunov-based approach. The proposed approach is thus a model-free scheme which is simple enough for implementation. Ability of the MNB to enhance the performance of the CSCs and dynamic stability of power systems is demonstrated by the simulation results of two small power plants and an IEEE 10-machine 39-bus system.

Abstract: Short term voltage stability poses a significant threat to system stability and reliability. This paper applies dynamic VAr injection to ensure short term voltage stability following a large disturbance in a power system with high concentration of induction motor loads. Decelerating and stalling of induction motor loads is considered to be the major cause of fault induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) and short term voltage stability. If system dynamics are not taken into account properly, the proposed control solution may be an expensive over design or an under design that is not capable of eliminating FIDVR problems completely. In this work, the optimal amount and locations for installing dynamic reactive resources are found by control vector parameterization (CVP), a dynamic optimization approach. The efficiency and effectiveness of this approach is improved by utilizing results from trajectory sensitivity analysis, singular value decomposition and linear programming optimization. Dynamic optimization based on CVP approach is tested in an IEEE 162-bus system and a realistic large scale utility power system.

Abstract: The present paper investigates the effective application of phasor measurement units (PMUs) with different technologies and filtering dynamics to the design of wide-area power system stabilizer (WAPSS). Two frequency-adaptive PMU algorithms shown to exceed the C37.118 class-M requirements based on FIR-and Kalman-bandpass filtering are selected for study. Their sharp dynamic differences are characterized using accurate fourth-order transfer functions derived from step responses using system identification techniques. While FIR-based PMUs have no overshoot in their phase and amplitude step responses, the adaptive Kalman filter allows for better out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with overshoot and a higher computational burden. These PMUs are implemented in Simulink and then embedded in electro-magnetic transients (EMT) simulations to experiment the realistic WAPSS behavior with the discrete-time devices in the loop. It is shown that WAPSSs with optimized settings can improve the damping performance of EMT models of a test system and a simplified Hydro-Quebec network including PMU filtering dynamics and transmission delays. However, WAPSSs based on EKF-PMUs yielded better performances, thanks to their shorter group delay compared with FIR-PMUs. PMU devices and algorithms meeting standard C37-118 can thus behave quite differently under stressed dynamics.

Abstract: Identifying coherent sub-graphs in networks is important in many applications. In power systems, large systems are divided into areas and zones to aid in planning and control applications. But not every partitioning is equally good for all applications; different applications have different goals, or attributes, against which solutions should be evaluated. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines a conventional graph partitioning algorithm with an evolutionary algorithm to partition a power network to optimize a multi-attribute objective function based on electrical distances, cluster sizes, the number of clusters, and cluster connectedness. Results for the IEEE RTS-96 show that clusters produced by this method can be used to identify buses with dynamically coherent voltage angles, without the need for dynamic simulation. Application of the method to the IEEE 118-bus and a 2383-bus case indicates that when a network is well partitioned into zones, intra-zone transactions have less impact on power flows outside of the zone; i.e., good partitioning reduces loop flows. This property is particularly useful for power system applications where ensuring deliverability is important, such as transmission planning or determination of synchronous reserve zones.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method to allocate the costs of the transmission system among generators and loads. The allocation is calculated for each branch of the transmission system to identify and quantify the individual responsibility of generators and loads. A two-step method based on the perfect coupling of the circuit theory with the Aumann-Shapley method is proposed here. First: to determine the participation of the generators in the costs of the transmission network, the generators are modeled as current injections and the loads as impedances. Second: to determine the participation of the loads in the cost of the transmission network, the loads are modeled as current sources and the generators as impedances. The Aumann-Shapley method and the circuit theory are used to calculate the participation of each real and imaginary current component in the "Allocation of the costs of the transmission system" game by considering them as independent agents. The properties of the Aumann-Shapley method ensure equitable allocation and recovery of the total costs. Numerical results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

Abstract: Reactive power control is a fundamental issue in microgrids, especially during islanded mode operation with no support from the main grid. Lack of infinite bus, tightly coupled generation and consumption, and existence of nondispatchable intermittent renewable power sources reinforce the need for a new VVC scheme. This paper presents a new model predictive control (MPC)-based dynamic voltage and var control (VVC) scheme, which includes the dynamics of the microgrid in the VVC formulation. The MPC-based controller uses a simplified voltage prediction model to predict the voltage behavior of the system for a time horizon ahead. The advantage of this method is that it can avoid unstable voltage conditions in microgrids by prediction of the instability ahead of time. This method can also avoid voltage drops or swells in any of the phases of the system since the model can predict the voltage of each phase separately. Also, the presented method can be implemented online so it can efficiently use the time-variant reactive capabilities of the distributed generators to compensate for reactive power needs of the system. This controller is tested for different operating conditions of the microgrid and the simulation results confirm that the MPC controller successfully keeps the system stable and achieves a smooth voltage profile.

Abstract: In this paper, an extended particle filter (PF) is proposed to estimate the dynamic states of a synchronous machine using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. A PF propagates the mean and covariance of states via Monte Carlo simulation, is easy to implement, and can be directly applied to a nonlinear system with non-Gaussian noise. The proposed extended PF improves robustness of the basic PF through iterative sampling and inflation of particle dispersion. Using Monte Carlo simulations with practical noise and model uncertainty considerations, the extended PF's performance is evaluated and compared with the basic PF, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The extended PF results showed high accuracy and robustness against measurement and model noise.

Abstract: The paper presents a distributed algorithm that regulates the power outputs of multiple dispersed energy storage systems (DESS), which can be used to provide desirable services for power systems, such as renewable generation output smoothing and secondary control. The algorithm is based on the cooperative control principle of network control theory and it satisfies both the power balance requirement of power systems and the fair utilization among the DESS. The most distinct feature of the algorithm is that each DESS only requires the information from its neighbors through some local communication networks (CN), utilizing a virtual leader embedded in one or several DESS to receive a power command signal. In addition, to improve the robustness of the CN among DESS, two optimization models are formulated to design the so-called "N - 1" redundant network, while considering both economic issues and convergence rate. These features enable the DESS under the algorithm to have both self-organizing and adaptive coordination properties under some adverse conditions. Simulation on the IEEE 123-bus distribution system validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The high variability of renewable energy is a major obstacle toward its increased penetration. Energy storage can help reduce the power imbalance due to the mismatch between the available renewable power and the load. How much can storage reduce this power imbalance? How much storage is needed to achieve this reduction? This paper presents a simple analytic model that leads to some answers to these questions. Considering the multitimescale grid operation, we formulate the power imbalance problem for each timescale as an infinite horizon stochastic control problem and show that a greedy policy minimizes the average magnitude of the residual power imbalance. Observing from the wind power data that in shorter timescales the power imbalance can be modeled as an iid zero-mean Laplace distributed process, we obtain closed form expressions for the minimum cost and the stationary distribution of the stored power. We show that most of the reduction in the power imbalance can be achieved with relatively small storage capacity. In longer timescales, the correlation in the power imbalance cannot be ignored. As such, we relax the iid assumption to a weakly dependent stationary process and quantify the limit on the minimum cost for arbitrarily large storage capacity.

Abstract: We develop a model-free approach for the short-term voltage stability monitoring of a power system. Finite time Lyapunov exponents are used as the certificate of stability. The time-series voltage data from phasor measurement units (PMU) are used to compute the Lyapunov exponent to predict voltage stability in real time. Issues related to practical implementation of the proposed method, such as phasor measurement noise, communication delay, and the finite window size for prediction, are also discussed. Furthermore, the stability certificate in the form of Lyapunov exponents is also used to determine the stability/instability contributions of the individual buses to the overall system stability and for computation of critical clearing time. Simulation results are provided for the IEEE 162-bus system to demonstrate the application of the developed method.

Abstract: Current and future developments in the power system industry demand fast power flow solvers for larger power flow problems. The established methods are no longer viable for such problems, as they are not scalable in the problem size.
In this paper, the use of Newton-Krylov power flow methods is proposed, and a multitude of preconditioning techniques for such methods are discussed and compared. It is shown that incomplete factorizations can perform very well as preconditioner, resulting in a solver that scales in the problem size. It is further shown that using a preconditioned inner-outer Krylov method has no significant advantage over applying the preconditioner directly to the outer iterations. Finally, algebraic multigrid is demonstrated as a preconditioner for Newton-Krylov power flow and argued to be the method of choice in some scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method based on affine arithmetic (AA) for voltage stability assessment of power systems considering uncertainties associated with operating conditions, which may be attributed to intermittent generation sources, such as wind and solar. The proposed AA-based method reduces the computational burden as compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and also improves the accuracy as compared to some analytical approaches. The proposed method is tested using two study cases: first, a 5-bus test system is used to illustrate the proposed technique in detail, and thereafter a 2383-bus test system to demonstrate its practical application. The results are compared with those obtained using MC simulations to verify the accuracy and computational burden of the proposed AA-based method, and also with respect to a previously proposed technique to estimate parameter sensitivities in voltage stability assessment.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of harmonic state estimation (HSE) of a power system whose network parameters are known to be within certain tolerance bounds. The harmonic voltage and current phasors at harmonics of interest are measured by using adequate numbers of phasor measurement units. The HSE is formulated based on the weighted least squares (WLS) criterion as a parametric interval linear system of equations. The solutions are obtained as interval numbers representing the outer bound of state variables. A method for adjusting the weight used in WLS which takes uncertain network parameters into consideration is also proposed. The proposed HSE algorithm is applied to the three-phase power systems and the results from numerical experiments show that the bounds of state variables obtained by the proposed method agree with those estimated by performing Monte Carlo simulations but with much shorter computation time.

Abstract: Units within a control area, participating in the secondary frequency control, are usually spinning generating units already connected to the network and operating outside their range of optimal performance. This paper deals with an alternative method of providing secondary frequency control called rapid-start (RS). It consists in assigning a regulation band to several offline units (RS units) which are capable of being started and connected rapidly, therefore allowing the online units to function more closely to their nominal power. RS units have commonly been used for peaking generation and for tertiary control reserve, and have been rarely used for secondary control reserve. As RS operation may have economic benefits, since it allows for better dispatch of the other units in the control area, an appropriate algorithm to start up an RS unit needs to be developed. This paper proposes a machine learning based system (MLBS) to be employed in the decision to start up an RS unit while being used to provide secondary frequency control. The decision-making procedure is carried out by a decision tree. The building and implementation of the RS machine learning based system is illustrated for a secondary frequency control zone within the Spanish power system.

Abstract: The paper introduces a new flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) controller based on pulse width modulated series compensator (PWMSC) for damping inter-area oscillations in power systems. The PWMSC can modulate the impedance of a transmission line through the variation of the duty cycle of AC link. The main purpose of this work is to verify the capability of the PWMSC to mitigate low frequency oscillations. For this reason, a novel current injection model of PWMSC is proposed and incorporated in the system model. This study proposes a novel tuning strategy for robust PWMSC damping controller based on the augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimization (ALPSO) satisfying the multiple H-infinity performance criteria. Proposed method does not need any conservative assumption unlike the conventional techniques, and often enables us to find the desired parameters of controller just by solving the constrained optimization problem in a straightforward way. In the paper, a verification of the designed controller by means of digital simulations of single machine and four-machine power systems is presented. The net results show that the proposed controller improves the stability of both test systems significantly in a number of fault cases at different levels of power flow in tie-line.

Abstract: A hybrid optimization method for optimal allocation of wind turbines (WTs) that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and market-based optimal power flow (OPF) with security constraints is proposed in this paper. The method maximizes the net present value (NPV) associated with WTs investment in a distribution market environment. The PSO is used to choose the optimal size while the market-based OPF to determine the optimal number of WTs at each candidate bus. The stochastic nature of both load demand and wind power generation is modeled by hourly time series analysis considering different combinations of wind generation and load demand. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with an 84-bus 11.4-kV radial distribution system.

Abstract: This paper presents a generic strategy for short-term load forecasting (STLF) based on the support vector regression machines (SVR). Two important improvements to the SVR based load forecasting method are introduced, i.e., procedure for generation of model inputs and subsequent model input selection using feature selection algorithms. One of the objectives of the proposed strategy is to reduce the operator interaction in the model-building procedure. The proposed use of feature selection algorithms for automatic model input selection and the use of the particle swarm global optimization based technique for the optimization of SVR hyper-parameters reduces the operator interaction. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed modeling strategy, the model has been trained and tested on two publicly available and well-known load forecasting data sets and compared to the state-of-the-art STLF algorithms yielding improved accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed control approach to coordinate multiple energy storage units (ESUs) to avoid violation of voltage and thermal constraints, which are some of the main power quality challenges for future distribution networks. ESUs usually are connected to a network through voltage source converters. In this paper, both ESU converters active and reactive power are used to deal with the above mentioned power quality issues. ESUs' reactive power is proposed to be used for voltage support, while the active power is to be utilized in managing network loading. Two typical distribution networks are used to apply the proposed method, and the simulated results are illustrated in this paper to show the effectiveness of this approach.

Abstract: NERC requires considering the uncertainties in assessing the total transmission capability (TTC) by calculating a term called transmission reliability margin (TRM). As part of a new BC Hydro TTC calculator, an improved point estimation based method (PEM) was developed to estimate the standard deviation of TTC due to the uncertainties of system parameters including forecasted system load, generation patterns, inter-tie schedules and change in projected load and dispatch conditions as a result of system stress. The standard deviation of TTC is used to determine TRM. The developed method has now been accepted as part of new BC Hydro's TTC calculator for determining TRM in real-time and pre-scheduling timeframes. Typical results on BC Hydro's large scale system, which were obtained using the developed TRM method, are presented in this paper. The presented TRM method has already been filed as an attachment to a BC Hydro's report to NERC for meeting the mandatory reliability compliance.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that the uncertainty intervals of state variables and measurements can be estimated by solving mathematical programming problems corresponding to the maximization or minimization of a component of these variables. However, the results are not guaranteed since the optimal problems are non-convex and the global optimal solutions cannot always be obtained. This paper presents a new scheme for guaranteed state estimation. Firstly, a conic programming is formulated to model these optimal problems by redefining variables and loosing the feasible space. Secondly, interval constraints propagation with all constraints concerned is applied to contract the solutions further to eliminate the pessimism. Comparisons are carried out, and results show that the result intervals are guaranteed and small enough for the control system with control dead zone concerned.

Abstract: The islanding detection is one of the most important issues for grid-connection of the distributed generation (DG) systems. Several recent researches have developed two types of islanding detection methods (IDMs) with high-performance. One is the power and voltage (P-V) characteristic of load based IDM, and the other is the inverter's switching frequency based IDM. Although the above IDMs have no non-detection zone (NDZ) theoretically, their usefulness mainly depends on the control performance of the inverter in practice. In other words, the inverter must achieve the decoupled real and reactive control and successful operation of phase-locked loop (PLL). To deal with these problems, this paper describes the design of inverter controller to improve both system stability and islanding detection performance with the NDZ. The proposed controller uses the magnitude and phase of measured voltage directly instead of using the direct and quadrature axes voltages and currents. Additionally, it does not need an instant phase of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage, which is required in the conventional controller, and therefore makes it possible for the PLL independent control. Several case studies are carried out to verify that the proposed controller has better performance than the conventional controller.

Abstract: As the capacity of wind power installed in a radial distribution system (DS) increases, there is a concern that it may introduce more frequent tap change operations in substation transformers. The increase in the frequency of tap changes (FTC) can accelerate the wear and tear of the tap changers. As a result, the introduction of wind power to DSs may be hindered. Hence the aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of wind power integration on the FTC in a radial DS. A case study shows that the changes on the FTC in DSs connected to relatively strong external grid is negligible up to significant level of penetration. But in DSs connected to a relatively weak external grid, a significant increase in the FTC has been observed as wind power penetration increases. Hence a further investigation is carried out to limit the FTC by using reactive power from local wind turbines. The results have shown that the methodology is very effective.

Abstract: Strategic behavior by natural gas producers may influence the operation as well as the development of an electricity system. Within this paper a computational game theoretic investment model is presented which allows assessing market power by natural gas producers and its effects on the electricity market under consideration of emission markets. The model is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem. It uses typical time segments to represent both seasonal load fluctuations on the natural gas market and load fluctuations within a day on the electricity market. Investment is possible in natural gas production and LNG infrastructure as well as power plants. A test case is presented covering three regions and simultaneously optimizing power plant dispatch and utilization of transmission lines on the power market as well as supply, transport and storage on the natural gas market. We compute prices, production volumes and power plant utilization for two different market power specifications to show the impact of oligopolistic market behavior.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multiple group search optimizer (MGSO) to solve the highly constrained multiobjective power dispatch (MOPD) problem with conflicting and competing objectives. The algorithm employs a stochastic learning automata based synergistic learning to allow information interaction and credit assignment among multi-groups for cooperative search. An alternative constraint handling, which separates constraints and objectives with different searching strategies, has been adopted to produce a more uniformly-distributed Pareto-optimal front (PF). Moreover, two enhancements, namely space reduction and chaotic sequence dispersion, have also been incorporated to facilitate local exploitation and global exploration of Pareto-optimal solutions in the convergence process. Lastly, Nash equilibrium point is first introduced to identify the best compromise solution from the PF. The performance of MGSO has been fully evaluated and benchmarked on the IEEE 30-bus 6-generator system and 118-bus 54-generator system. Comparisons with previous Pareto heuristic techniques demonstrated the superiority of the proposed MGSO and confirm its capability to cope with practical multiobjective optimization problems with multiple high-dimensional objective functions.

Abstract: This paper presents a structural voltage stability analysis of a power system integrating induction generator wind turbines. The approach is based on restructuring the system load flow matrix with respect to bus types instead of the usual active-reactive power equations arrangement. The row sub-matrices of the modified are used to generate sub-matrices candidates representing associations of bus types. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the generated sub-matrices isused as a rank deficiency indicator. The approach is tested on a nine-bus system. The proximity to voltage collapse is monitored by tracking the smallest SVD and points of limit induced bifurcations are tracked. The interactions between the system buses are structurally analyzed for wind power increase and loading tests. Two-bus bifurcations are shown to be a precursor to system voltage collapse. The analysis is helpful for problem diagnosis and remediation planning in power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a second order cone programming (SOCP) formulation of the optimal power flow problem for AC-DC systems with voltage source converter (VSC) technology. Approximation techniques have been used to derive the SOCP formulation of the AC-DC OPF problem. Later, the SOCP formulation can be solved using the interior point method (IPM) by considering the limits on AC-DC grid. The accuracy of SOCP formulation of AC OPF has been proven with numerical examples using IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus, and IEEE 57-bus example systems. The results of the SOCP formulation are compared with available commercial software. Then a DC system with VSC technology is modeled in the IEEE 30-bus example system. The SOCP formulation of AC-DC OPF is applied to the modified IEEE 30-bus example system and the results are discussed. The limitations of derived SOCP formulation are also discussed.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the construction of an optimized financial transmission rights (FTR) or congestion revenue rights portfolio for an FTR market participant given his assessment of the frequency and economic impacts of binding constraints in the transmission network. We overcome the data handling and heavy computing demands of locational marginal price (LMP)-difference-based methods for FTR selection by recasting the problem into one that focuses on the underlying product of "binding constraints", which are physically observable phenomena, based on the mathematical insights into the structural characteristics of the model used for the clearing of the hourly day-ahead markets. Differentials in the LMPs are due to system congestion and so are merely manifestations of binding constraints in the transmission network. In addition, we exploit extensively the salient topological characteristics of large-scale interconnections. The market participant specifies the subset of "focus" constraints and the position he is willing to take on them. Our approach builds on the mathematical insights and topological characteristics with the effective deployment of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to construct the optimized FTR portfolio characterized by the minimum number of node pairs for the specification of the FTR elements. We apply the proposed approach to a test system based on the PJM ISO network and markets to illustrate its capabilities for solving the FTR market participant's problem in realistic large-scale systems.

Abstract: Regarding short-term reliability of composite power system, probability of critical event resulting in system failure within a short lead time is extremely low, which renders classical sequential Monte Carlo simulation method inefficient. In this paper, a cross-entropy-based three-stage sequential importance sampling (TSSIS) method is proposed to solve the low efficiency problem resulted from the low rate of component state transition during a fixed lead time. First, by assuming the system state transition process conforms to continuous time Markov chain, an analytical solution to optimal distorted component state transition rate to be used for sequential importance sampling is found by means of cross-entropy method. Second, TSSIS for a fixed lead time is constructed as follows: 1) acceleration of producing system state transitions; 2) enhanced learning to give optimal distorted transition rate; 3) compensation to the cost function. Case studies based on a reinforced Roy Billinton reliability test system and RTS-79 are carried out respectively for illustration of parameter settings of TSSIS as well as efficiency gain in comparison with the classical sequential Monte Carlo simulation method. The results demonstrate that given rational setting of parameters, TSSIS is of relatively high efficiency for sequential short-term reliability evaluation of composite power system.

Abstract: Increased deployment of wind-power generation is changing the landscape of power supply around the world. When integrated with electricity markets, wind power is also widely known to influence the prices cleared at the market. This paper examines the effect of wind-power generation on the day-ahead market prices in the PJM electricity market using robust econometric models and statistical inference. Results show that the quantified expected benefits to wholesale market participants may be substantial despite the relatively low wind-power penetration levels still observed within the PJM jurisdiction relative to other markets. The quantified unitary benefits outweigh, by a great margin, the renewable energy credits given to qualifying wind farms across the market. When benefits outweigh the costs incurred to generate them, welfare is accrued. To this end, benefit allocation mechanisms are proposed, which may contribute to the continued development of wind power on the roadmap to a cleaner power industry of the future.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate loss of load indices in composite generation and transmission systems. Themain idea is to combine aCross-Entropy (CE)-based optimization process and nonsequential Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to obtain an auxiliary sampling distribution, which can minimize the variance of the reliability index estimators. This auxiliary sampling distribution will properly modify the original unavailabilities of both generation and transmission equipment, so that important failure events are sampled more often. As a result, the MCS algorithm can reach convergence faster and with fewer samples, leading to significant gains in computational performance, especially when dealing with very reliable system configurations. The proposed method is tested using several composite power systems, including the IEEE RTS 79, IEEE RTS 96, and a configuration of the Brazilian system.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for analysis of frequency synchronization of lossless power networks whose sources are frequency-droop controlled inverters. Unlike most existing approaches, our method focuses on the interaction between inverters and the network to provide new physical insight into how those interactions create frequency synchronization. We introduce two structure-preserving models of such a network (one bus-oriented and one line-oriented), and show that frequency synchronization corresponds to convergence to an equilibrium of these models. We derive a necessary condition for existence of such equilibria, and determine a simple test for their local stability. Finally, we introduce a sufficient condition for frequency synchronization of such networks, and show that it consists of a set of local criteria which can each be determined from local measurements.

Abstract: Distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems are being rapidly deployed worldwide, causing technical problems such as reverse power flows and voltage rises in distribution feeders, and real and reactive power transients that affect the operation of the bulk transmission system. To fully understand and address these problems, extensive computer simulation studies are required. To this end, this paper sets forth a cloud shadow model that can be used to recreate the power generation of rooftop PV systems embedded in a distribution feeder, or that of a utility-scale PV power plant, during days with cumulus clouds. Realistically shaped cumulus cloud shadows are modeled as fractals. The variation of the irradiance incident on each PV system in an area of interest is then obtained by considering the movement of the cloud shadow over the area. The synthesized irradiance has satisfactory temporal and spatial characteristics. The proposed model is suitable for Monte Carlo simulations of power systems with high PV penetration.

Abstract: The cost and quality of regulation have been brought to the forefront of power system operations by renewable variability. We propose a regulation pricing methodology based on an idea of Berger and Schweppe: in the same manner that locational marginal prices are derived from the dual of economic dispatch, let regulation prices be the dual multipliers or costate of an optimal control problem. By specializing to the linear quadratic regulator, we formulate a regulation pricing policy, which in turn allows us to derive statistically correct payments such as imbalance fees. We then construct a Vickrey-Clarke-Grovesmechanismto induce selfish agents to honestly report their private valuations and costs of regulation. Semidefinite programming descriptions of the formulation can be embedded within standard convex economic dispatch constraint sets, enabling cooptimization of base load and regulation pricing. The approach mechanistically produces prices for any dynamic scenario, and can therefore be used to consolidate diverse regulation services. We demonstrate this feature by combining traditional frequency regulation, area control error, and the California Independent System Operator's Flexible Ramping Product in an example.

Abstract: Demand response has benefits in mitigating unit commitment and dispatch costs imposed on power systems by wind uncertainty and variability. We examine the effect of delays in consumers responding to price signals on the benefits of demand response in mitigating wind-uncertainty costs. Using a case study based on the ERCOT power system, we compare the cost of operating the system with forecasts of future wind availability to a best-case scenario with perfect foresight of wind. We demonstrate that wind uncertainty can impose substantive costs on the system and that demand response can eliminate more than 75% of these costs if loads respond to system conditions immediately. Otherwise, we find that with a 30-min lag in the response, nearly 72% of the value of demand response is lost.

Abstract: Hydropower units are known to be comparatively insensitive to subsynchronous power oscillations. During a startup test of an electrical island in the Nordic power system, a series capacitor tripped due to a subsynchronous oscillation within the normal frequency range of hydropower unit torsional modes. Since no thermal units were connected, it is motivated to question the traditional view. In this paper, the small-signal and transient torsional mode stability of hydropower units are assessed through time-do-main simulations. The model is based on the first IEEE benchmark model for subsynchronous resonance which has been tuned to fit one of the startup test system units for which detailed measurements are available. The stability conditions are investigated for several load conditions and machine configurations. It is found that the damping in the startup test system is sufficient to prevent growing oscillations. A fault however could expose the machines to high transient torques.

Abstract: Fast and accurate contingency selection and ranking method has become a key issue to ensure the secure operation of power systems. In this paper multi-layer feed forward artificial neural network (MLFFN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) are proposed to implement the online module for power system static security assessment. The security classification, contingency selection and ranking are done based on the composite security index which is capable of accurately differentiating the secure and non-secure cases. For each contingency case as well as for base case condition, the composite security index is computed using the full Newton Raphson load flow analysis. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) models take loading condition and the probable contingencies as the input and assess the system security by screening the credible contingencies and ranking them in the order of severity based on composite security index. The numerical results of applying the proposed approach to IEEE 118-bus test system demonstrate its effectiveness for online power system static security assessment. The comparison of the ANN models with the model based on Newton Raphson load flow analysis in terms of accuracy and computational speed indicate that the proposed model is effective and reliable in the fast evaluation of the security level of power systems. The proposed online static security assessment (OSSA) module realized using the ANN models are found to be suited for online application.

Abstract: Phasor measurement units (PMUs) have made it possible to observe and control wide-area power systems. In this paper, a new redundant observability method as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is presented for optimal PMU placement. Redundant observation of buses enhances measurement reliability. The proposed method improves observability redundancy by a new objective function while using the same number of PMUs as the existing methods. Because of using MILP, the global optimal integer solution is achieved with a zero optimality gap. In addition, a systematic novel approach is proposed to incorporate already installed branch flow measurements in the PMU placement problem leading to a reduced number of PMUs required for system observability. This approach is able to handle both single and multiple flow measurements incident to a bus. PMU placement in case of PMU failure or branch outage is also studied. The proposed method along with an existing method is tested on four IEEE and Polish 3375-bus test systems. Obtained results, discussed in detail, show the efficiency of the proposed method in both speed and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a load estimator for large scale asymmetric distribution networks. It is based on iterating between 1) a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator that attempts to adjust the forecasted load group values to the telemetered measurements and 2) a three-phase load flow employing the Fortescue transformation. The WLS estimation phase explicitly handles Y- and Delta-connected unbalanced loads and area losses; it can also identify bad measurements based on the estimated load scaling factors. Numerical results show that the proposed load estimator is superior to conventional load allocation based on current balancing, and that its performance is commensurate with the requirements of real-time applications on unsymmetrical radial distribution networks having up to one million nodes.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of the thermal unit commitment (UC) problem. The proposed formulation is simultaneously tight and compact. The tighter characteristic reduces the search space and the more compact characteristic increases the searching speed with which solvers explore that reduced space. Therefore, as a natural consequence, the proposed formulation significantly reduces the computational burden in comparison with analogous MILP-based UC formulations. We provide computational results comparing the proposed formulation with two others which have been recognized as computationally efficient in the literature. The experiments were carried out on 40 different power system mixes and sizes, running from 28 to 1870 generating units.

Abstract: Several pure binary integer optimization models are developed for clustering time periods by similarity for electricity utilities seeking assistance with pricing strategies. The models include alternative objectives for characterizing various notions of within-cluster distances, admit as feasible only clusters that are contiguous, and allow for circularity, where time periods at the beginning and end of the planning cycle may be in the same cluster. Restrictions upon cluster size may conveniently be included without the need of additional constraints. The models are populated with a real-world dataset of electricity usage for 93 buildings and solutions and run-times attained by conventional optimization software are compared with those by dynamic programming, or by a greedy algorithm applicable to one of the models, that run in polynomial time. The results provide time-of-use segments that an electricity utility may employ for selective pricing for peak and off-peak time periods to influence demand for the purpose of load leveling.

Abstract: The risk management and decision making for power systems have been evolving from the qualitative methods to the quantitative methods. The traditional decision-making model based on the system average risk and the average cost has commensurated events of low-probability/high-damage and events of high-probability/low-damage, which ignores the relative importance of these events as they are viewed by the decision makers. In this paper, we propose the concepts of conditional risk indices and conditional costs of power systems, and establish a novel risk decision-making model based on these indices. The conditional indices will be helpful for the risk decision makers to thoroughly tradeoff between different risk domains according to their preferences. Further, the system risk is monetarily represented as the reliability cost by the customer composite damage function, and the decision-making model is solved by sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the modified IEEE-RTS incorporating wind energy is investigated by the proposed model and method. The effects of decision preferences, the wind power capacity and cost on the system decision making are discussed.

Abstract: In a deregulated power system, the independent system operator (ISO) becomes the central entity which is responsible for the reliable system operation and the real-time balancing. ISO can provide necessary functions through the market mechanism. However, the possibility of a price-based operation is suggested as well, in which time-varying price coordinates non-cooperative players' actions. In the price-based operation, the main objectives of operation are also to keep the system frequency to the nominal value and to manage the line congestion. In terms of the frequency, the price-based operation should at least assist the frequency regulation functions by reducing the frequency deviation. For this purpose, this paper tries to present a method to reduce the frequency deviation and proposes the application of PID tuning rule to the design of price-based operation. In addition, a modified asymmetric control structure is proposed to obtain a further reduction of the frequency deviation. The performance and suitability of the designing rule are verified through simulations using the IEEE 39-bus network.

Abstract: This paper deals with the prediction of residual demand curves in electricity spot markets, as a tool for optimizing bidding strategies in the short-term. Two functional models are formulated and empirically compared with the nave method, which is the reference model in most of the practical applications found in industry. The first one is a functional nonparametric model that estimates the residual demand as a function of past residual demands, while the second one uses also electricity demand and wind power forecasts as explanatory variables. The proposed models have been tested using real data from the Spanish day-ahead market over a period of two years. The analysis of these results has motivated the development of a new forecasting strategy based on the selective combination of forecasts, taking advantage of the effect of wind fluctuations on the residual demand. This new forecasting approach outperforms the nave method in all circumstances.

Abstract: Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) have the potential to severely disrupt power grid operations, and hence their impact needs to be assessed through planning studies. This paper presents a methodology for determining the sensitivity of the GICs calculated for individual and/or groups of transformers to the assumed quasi-dc electric fields on the transmission lines that induce the GICs. Example calculations are provided for two small systems and for the North American Eastern Interconnect model. Results indicate that transformer GICs are mostly due to the electric fields on nearby transmission lines, implying localized electric field models may be appropriate for such studies.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of affine reserve policies for accommodating large, fluctuating renewable infeeds in power systems. The approach uses robust optimization with recourse to determine operating rules for power system entities such as generators and storage units. These rules, or policies, establish several hours in advance how these entities are to respond to errors in the prediction of loads and renewable infeeds once their values are discovered. Affine policies consist of a nominal power schedule plus a series of planned linear modifications that depend on the prediction errors that will become known at future times. We describe how to choose optimal affine policies that respect the power network constraints, namely matching supply and demand, respecting transmission line ratings, and the local operating limits of power system entities, for all realizations of the prediction errors. Crucially, these policies are time-coupled, exploiting the spatial and temporal correlation of these prediction errors. Affine policies are compared with existing reserve operation under standard modeling assumptions, and operating cost reductions are reported for a multi-day benchmark study featuring a poorly-predicted wind infeed. Efficient prices for such "policy-based reserves" are derived, and we propose new reserve products that could be traded on electricity markets.

Abstract: The development of the smart grid calls for enhanced power system application interoperability and knowledge management. The IEC Common Information Model (CIM) supports semantic interoperability but multiple identities attributed to common power system resources present challenges to unambiguous metadata model merging within a repository. This paper describes an original methodology for the building of a novel metadata model repository that concentrates our knowledge of enterprise power system resources. We leverage the value of model namespaces and resource description framework (RDF) technology in providing contexts for multiple identities referring to common power system resources. This novel approach aims to develop a more realistic understanding of network reality than repositories depending on a single CIM XML namespace and contributes to engineering an "enterprise ontology" supporting interoperability and business intelligence. We demonstrate this novel approach with reference to National Grid use cases for network operation and planning model management roles.

Abstract: In a multimarket environment, a GENCO produces electricity subject to a number of factors, including physical and environmental constraints, together with trading strategies in the electricity market (EM), fuel market (FM) and carbon market (CM). To assist a GENCO to maximize its profits from EM, FM and CM, this paper proposes a dynamic decision making model with two consecutive stages. Fuzzy differential evolution algorithm is used to solve this decision-making problem. Taking transactions in the three interactive markets into account, the proposed model has been tested for a GENCO consisting of seven thermal units and a wind farm. A rational tradeoff between the profit-making and emission reduction has been demonstrated by the GENCO using the proposed model, indicating a well alignment with the intended goal of the introducing emission trading scheme (ETS).

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm based on hybridization of pheromones derived from ant colony optimization with crossover operator and is applied to minimize real losses in distribution systems using reconfiguration. The algorithm maintains a population of candidate solutions and a table of pheromones to reinforce better edges during search process. Exploration for better solutions is performed by means of crossover operator directed by the information stored in the pheromone table. The hybrid approach has been successfully implemented on three test networks. The efficacy of the algorithm has been demonstrated by presenting a comparison between results obtained using uniform crossover operator and pheromone directed crossover and also by comparing with the results published in the literature for the test systems considered.

Abstract: As a result of subsidies and technological maturity, renewable electricity producers have grown in some jurisdictions to clearly dominant positions in the market. Under this context, we propose an offering strategy for a wind power producer with market power that participates in the day-ahead market as a price-maker, and in the balancing market as a deviator. Uncertainty pertaining to wind power production and balancing market price is represented through a set of correlated scenarios. The proposed model is a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) that can be recast as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is solvable using available optimization software. Results from an illustrative example and two case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: A non-revisiting genetic algorithm (NrGA) was used to determine distribution network configuration for loss reduction. By advocating binary space partitioning (BSP) to divide the search space and employing a novel BSP tree archive to store all the solutions that have been explored before, NrGA can quickly check for revisits by communicating with BSP tree archive when a new solution is generated by genetic algorithm (GA), and can mutate an alternative unvisited solution through a novel adaptive mutation mechanism that based on BSP tree while a revisit has occurred, which achieves no duplicates in the entire search. A method for getting independent loops of distribution network was realized using breadth-first search algorithm. Furthermore, the extended intermediate crossover mode, which requires no tuning parameter such as crossover rate and extends the crossover results, is employed for improving the performance of NrGA in solving distribution network configuration problem. The proposed approach has been successfully tested on three sample systems and three practical systems. Numerical studies have revealed its accuracy and efficient performance.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) appear to offer a promising option for mitigating greenhouse emission. However, uncoordinated PEV charging can weaken the reliability of power systems. The proper accommodation of PEVs in a power grid imposes many challenges on system planning and operations. This work aims to investigate optimal PEV coordination strategies with cost-benefit analysis. In Part I, we first present a new method to calculate the charging load of PEVs with a modified Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method for handling the stochastic property of PEVs. We then propose a new two-stage optimization model to discover the optimal charging states of PEVs in a given day. Using this model, the peak load with charging load of PEVs is minimized in the first stage and the load fluctuation is minimized in the second-stage with peak load being fixed as the value obtained in the first stage. An algorithm based on linear mixed-integer programming is provided as a suitable solution method with fast computation. Finally, we present a new method to calculate the benefit and cost for a PEV charging and discharging coordination strategy from a social welfare approach. These methods are useful for developing PEV coordination strategies in power system planning and supporting PEV-related policy making.

Abstract: In the "integrated strategy" for connecting offshore wind farms to onshore grids, an offshore AC grid is formed by interconnecting offshore wind farms and point-to-point VSC-HVDC links using an AC network. The advantage of this strategy is that in the case of a DC fault, AC circuit breakers are used to isolate the faulted HVDC link without the need for DC circuit breakers. This paper presents a control system that regulates power sharing between the HVDC links by varying the operating frequency of the offshore AC grid. Primary and secondary power regulation controllers are designed to achieve automatic power flow coordination between HVDC links. Increase in the offshore AC grid frequency during onshore AC grid fault or DC fault signals power flow imbalance. This signal is used to suppress the transient DC over-voltage through the coordination control between the wind farm side converters of HVDC links and the power reduction control of wind turbines. Importantly, because the inputs of the controllers are from local frequency signals only, fast communication is not required under the proposed control strategy. Simulation results are presented to verify the functioning of the proposed control strategy and illustrate variable frequency operation of an offshore four-node AC grid.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel optimization model to maximize the power system observability by placing phasor measurement units (PMUs) in a multistage manner. The problem is constrained by the financial budgets available at each installation stage. The budget may be spent on purchasing and installing new PMUs and relocating PMUs already installed in the power system. This problem is very difficult to solve when the problem size becomes big. Therefore, a newly developed meta-heuristic, called chemical reaction optimization (CRO), is used to solve this optimal multistage PMU placement problem (OMPP), and numerical studies are carried out on the IEEE 57-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an adjustable robust optimization approach to account for the uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RESs) in optimal power flow (OPF). It proposes an affinely adjustable robust OPF formulation where the base-point generation is calculated to serve the forecast load which is not balanced by RESs, and the generation control through participation factors ensures a feasible solution for all realizations of RES output within a prescribed uncertainty set. The adjustable robust OPF framework is solved using quadratic programming with successive constraint enforcement and can coordinate the computation of both the base-point generation and participation factors. Numerical results on standard test networks reveal a relatively small increase in the expected operational cost as the uncertainty level increases. In addition, solutions of networks that include both uncertain wind generation and Gaussian distributed demand are shown to have less cost and a higher level of robustness as compared to those from a recent robust scheduling method.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully analog demonstrator based on power system emulation for high-speed power system stability analysis. A benchmark using a fixed two-machine topology has been implemented. The characteristics of the emulated components (i.e., generators and transmission lines) are reprogrammable and short circuits can be emulated at different distances from the generator. This first realization is limited to transient stability analysis, as the main focus during design was put on computation speed. Indeed, the emulated phenomena are 10 000 times faster than real time. Moreover the authors aim to emphasize that such highly dedicated computation architectures are not only competitive in terms of speed, but also in terms of modularity.

Abstract: A consecutive DFT method for instantaneous oscillating phasor measurement is proposed in this paper. The proposed method is based on one cycle DFT and applies three consecutive DFT values for phasor measurement. First, an analysis of standard DFT based phasor measurement method under low frequency oscillations is given. Then a method to eliminate the phasor measurement errors is proposed based on the relation among three consecutive DFT values. Due to its high precision and low required processing effort, the proposed algorithm is a good candidate for online phasor measurement under low frequency oscillation transient conditions.

Abstract: Generation capacity expansion trends have clearly evolved in the last decades. In the present context, renewable generation technologies are expected to reach large penetration levels. Among other effects, these technologies are changing the scheduling regime (and thus the unit-commitment costs) of the rest of the generating facilities, increasing for instance the need of cycling conventional thermal generation. In this paper we further develop the traditional screening curves technique so as to incorporate a sound representation of the cycling operation of thermal units. The so-resulting approach provides a more comprehensive representation of thermal operation while keeping the screening curves well-known capability to provide valuable analytic insights on the capacity expansion problem.

Abstract: Continuing with a set of enabling techniques for the optimal coordination of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in Part I, we present a case study in this paper using techniques based on the data collected in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Region (BTTR) China to discover optimal PEV coordination strategies and assess the attractiveness of these strategies. In Part II, we first present the charging characteristics for different categories of PEVs in BTTR and predict the optimal seasonal daily loads with PEVs under different PEV penetration levels using a two-stage optimization model in both 2020 and 2030. The simulation results indicate that optimal PEV coordination effectively reduces the peak load and smooths the load curve. Finally, we present a cost-benefit analysis of optimal coordination strategies by taking a social welfare approach. The analysis shows that the optimal coordination strategies are beneficial in terms of the reduction in capital investment in power grid expansion and that the attractiveness of a coordination strategy is related to the coordination level. The results also show that the fully coordinated charging and vehicle to grid are not the most attractive strategies. This case study is useful for better understanding the costs and benefits of PEV coordination strategies and for supporting PEV-related decision and policy making from a power system planning perspective.

Abstract: In this paper, a seamless control methodology has been proposed for a photo voltaic (PV)- diesel generator (DG) microgrid to operate both in the grid connected and islanded mode. It does not require any islanding detection mechanism, to change the control philosophy from the grid connected mode to the islanded mode. A second order sliding mode control has been used to control the voltage source converter of the PV source whose set points have been generated by PI controllers. The maximum power point tracking algorithm for the PV system has been augmented with an auxiliary signal obtained using the electrical power output of the DG to reduce the output power of the PV system for economical operation of the DG unit. The DG unit is regulated with the frequency of the microgrid while the inverter used in the PV system regulates the voltage at the point of common coupling. Similarly, if the DG is uncontrollable due to any reason, the PV system is further added with an auxiliary signal based on the frequency deviation to maintain frequency stability. Simulation of the system has been carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK with different levels of insolation and load to verify the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: In the deregulated power systems setting, the realization of the significant demand flexibility potential should be coupled with its integration in electricity markets. Centralized market mechanisms raise communication, computational and privacy issues while existing dynamic pricing schemes fail to realize the actual value of demand flexibility. In this two-part paper, a novel day-ahead pool market mechanism is proposed, combining the solution optimality of centralized mechanisms with the decentralized demand participation structure of dynamic pricing schemes and based on Lagrangian relaxation (LR) principles. Part I presents the theoretical background, algorithmic approaches and suitable examples to address challenges associated with the application of the mechanism and provides an implementation framework. Non-convexities in reschedulable demand participants' price response and their impacts on the ability of the basic LR structure to reach feasible market clearing solutions are identified and a simple yet effective LR heuristic method is developed to produce both feasible and high quality solutions by limiting the concentrated shift of reschedulable demand to the same low-priced time periods.

Abstract: Voltage and reactive power control is a fundamental issue in all-electric shipboard power systems (SPS). However, coordination between generation and propulsion management to match reactive power is poor in current SPS designs. This paper presents a new model predictive control based dynamic Volt/Var control scheme to control the voltage in the system. This method uses a dynamic model of the sources and loads and finds the optimal reactive control inputs to the system to minimize the voltage deviations in the future. Since this method uses prediction of the reactive demand of pulsed loads, it is able to achieve a smooth voltage profile in the SPS in presence of pulsed power loads. This method is also able to control voltage of the system during propulsion motor startup. The controller is tested in presence of high power pulsed loads in the system. The results demonstrate that the dynamic reactive controller is able to keep the voltage profile of the system smooth and within system limits.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient parallel algorithm applied to the problem of large scale hydrothermal system operation planning. This problem is solved by stochastic dual dynamic programming. A plan of operation is determined for each stage of the planning period with the objective of minimizing the expected cost of operation over the planning horizon. For each state, the hydrothermal operation problem is modeled as a linear programming problem and the dual variables associated with the solution are used to construct the Benders cuts. The plan of operation is represented by the future cost function, which is approximated by a piecewise linear function, constructed iteratively by the Benders cuts. An optimized parallelization strategy is applied to both the forward and backward cycles of the dynamic programming convergence process with very high parallel efficiency. For a planning horizon of 5 years and 200 inflow scenarios for each reservoir, the sequential solution for the Brazilian system requires almost 15 hours of processing time. The parallel algorithm obtains exactly the same solution in less than 23 min on 64 cores and in less than 17 min on 128 cores.

Abstract: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based formulations and solution methods for short-term hydro generation scheduling (HGS) have been widely adopted by researchers, hydropower producers, and system operators in recent years. This approach calls for the nonlinear forebay level, tailrace level, penstock loss, and hydropower production functions to be replaced with their piecewise linear approximations. However, the effects of the linearization of the nonlinear functions and related constraints on solution feasibility have not been fully discussed in the literature. In this paper, the issues concerning solution feasibility are discussed in detail and a method is presented to ensure that the solution obtained based on the approximated MILP formulation remains feasible for the original nonlinear formulation. Furthermore, it is found that the real number water delay can be handled in the formulation without destroying the linear structure of the water balance constraints. Numerical testing results show that the method presented in this paper is effective.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved decomposition framework to accelerate the convergence of linear sensitivity factor (LSF) and Benders decomposition (BD) based methods for network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problems. Classical LSF and BD methods solve NCUC problems by an iterative procedure between a master UC problem and transmission network evaluation subproblems. Subproblems evaluate the transmission network security of a master UC solution, and feedback violated network constraints or Benders feasibility cuts to the UC problem for seeking a feasible UC solution that could mitigate transmission violations. However, classical methods often converge very slowly and introduce major computational bottlenecks. This paper presents an improved decomposition framework by embedding network evaluation subproblems into the branch-and-bound (BAB)/branch-and-cut (BAC) procedure of the master UC problem. Thus, instead of iteratively solving the UC master problem and network evaluation subproblems, the NCUC problem is solved in one single integrated procedure by performing network evaluations at each BAB/BAC node. The proposed methods reduce the number of BAB/BAC nodes to be solved in the UC problem at the cost of additional network evaluations. Numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed decomposition framework. The benefit of the proposed decomposition framework would be significant when a system is heavily congested and a large number of iterations is expected for the classical methods. The proposed decomposition strategy can be extended to other applications for solving large-scale optimization problems in power systems operation, maintenance, and planning.

Abstract: To accommodate large-scale integration of renewable generation, look-ahead power dispatch, which is essentially a type of dynamic economic dispatch (DED), is widely used in power system operation. DED can be reduced to a two-stage dual problem via Lagrangian relaxation. The major challenge to solving this dual problem robustly and efficiently is the multiplier updating strategy. To solve the dual problems of quadratic DEDs, this paper proposes multiplier updating based on a quasi-Newton method, together with an initialization strategy for the multipliers and the approximation matrix. Comparative numerical tests are carried out to verify the performance of this technique in terms of convergence, computational efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: With the rollout of smart metering infrastructure at scale, demand-response (DR) programs may now be tailored based on users' consumption patterns as mined from sensed data. For issuing DR events it is key to understand the inter-temporal consumption dynamics as to appropriately segment the user population. We propose to infer occupancy states from consumption time series data using a hidden Markov model framework. Occupancy is characterized in this model by 1) magnitude, 2) duration, and 3) variability. We show that users may be grouped according to their consumption patterns into groups that exhibit qualitatively different dynamics that may be exploited for program enrollment purposes. We investigate empirically the information that residential energy consumers' temporal energy demand patterns characterized by these three dimensions may convey about their demographic, household, and appliance stock characteristics. Our analysis shows that temporal patterns in the user's consumption data can predict with good accuracy certain user characteristics. We use this framework to argue that there is a large degree of individual predictability in user consumption at a population level.

Abstract: Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problems are essential tools to transmission system operators for long-term and operational planning and real-time operation. The general goal of SCOPF problems is to optimize electricity network operation while ensuring that operational and planning decisions are consistent with technical limits under both pre- and post-contingency states. The solution of SCOPF problems is challenging because of the inherent size and scope of modern grids. As empirical evidence and longstanding operator experience show, relatively few of the constraints of SCOPF problems actually serve to enclose their feasible region. Hence, all those constraints not contributing directly to set up the SCOPF feasible space are superfluous and could be discarded. In light of this observation, this paper proposes an optimization-based approach for identifying so-called umbrella constraints in SCOPF problems where the network operation is approximated by the dc power flow. Umbrella constraints are constraints which are necessary and sufficient to the description of the feasible set of an SCOPF problem. The resulting umbrella constraint discovery problem (UCD) is a convex optimization problem with a linear objective function. For SCOPF problems of practical importance, the UCD is also quite large and requires the use of a decomposition technique. In this paper, we concentrate on an SCOPF formulation for preventive security generation dispatch. We show that by removing superfluous constraints, the resulting sizes of SCOPF problems are much smaller and can be solved significantly faster.

Abstract: Demand response is playing an increasingly important role in the efficient and reliable operation of the electric grid. Modeling the dynamic behavior of a large population of responsive loads is especially important to evaluate the effectiveness of various demand response strategies. In this paper, a highly accurate aggregated model is developed for a population of air conditioning loads. The model effectively includes statistical information of the load population, systematically deals with load heterogeneity, and accounts for second-order dynamics necessary to accurately capture the transient dynamics in the collective response. Based on the model, a novel aggregated control strategy is designed for the load population under realistic conditions. The proposed controller is fully responsive and achieves the control objective without sacrificing end-use performance. The proposed aggregated modeling and control strategy is validated through realistic simulations using GridLAB-D. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively manage a large number of air conditioning systems to provide various demand response services, such as frequency regulation and peak load reduction.

Abstract: This paper presents coordinated secondary voltage control based on partitioned power network and decentralized controllers designed for each region. The elements of control are installed on pilot buses (critical point for voltage control in each region). The aim is coordination among elements of control in each region or between different regions to regulate voltage of buses and increase the security of the power network. The elements of control are considered as nodes of a graph and reactive power will be transferred through edges of this graph. This gives capability of transfer of reactive power between regions in case of voltage violations in a special region that cannot be regulated by controllers installed on that region. The control uses decentralized controllers to eliminate voltage violations resulting from load variations and disturbance in the power network. The methodology is applied to the IEEE 118-bus network. The results show and verify the performance of coordinated control scheme to regulate the voltage and to avoid propagation of contingency between regions.

Abstract: Further to results reported by Jiang et al., this paper investigates delay-dependent stability of load frequency control (LFC) emphasizing on multi-area and deregulated environment. Based on Lyapunov theory and the linear matrix inequality technique, a new stability criterion is proposed to improve calculation accuracy and to reduce computation time, which makes it be suitable for handling with multi-area LFC schemes. The interaction of delay margins between different control areas and the relationship between delay margins and control gains are investigated in details. Moreover, usage of delay margins as a new performance index to guide controller design is discussed, including tuning of the controller for a trade-off between delay tolerance and dynamic response, choosing the upper bound of the fault counter of communication channels and the upper bound of sampling period of a discrete realization of the controller. Case studies are carried out based on two-area traditional, two-area and three-area deregulated LFC schemes, all equipped with PID-type controllers, respectively. Simulation studies are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Transient stability of wind generation system is evaluated in terms of critical clearing time (CCT) of fault. CCT of a wind generation system connected to grid is calculated based on the maximum amount of time that the wind generation system remains connected to grid, without becoming unstable, when the grid is subjected to a fault. In the literature, the wind turbine model has been used for steady state analysis alone, that is, it is used for finding the initial operating mechanical torque output of the turbine. The turbine model is then completely neglected in case of transient stability analysis by assuming constant mechanical torque output for a particular wind speed. This may not be true, as the mechanical torque-speed characteristic of a wind turbine depends not only on the wind speed but also on the slip of the induction generator connected to the wind turbine. This paper explains the necessity of considering the wind turbine model for the transient stability and steady state analysis of grid connected induction generator based wind generation system. A detailed analysis has been done on the effect of various electrical and mechanical factors on CCT determination and the simulation results are presented.

Abstract: Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC), as one of key components in power system operation, is being widely applied in vertically integrated utilities and restructured power systems. The efficient solution framework is to implement iterations between a master problem (unit commitment) and subproblems (network security evaluations). In industrial applications, both Lagrangian relaxation and mixed-integer programming are commonly applied for the unit commitment problem, and both linear sensitivity factor and Benders cut methods are used to generate additional constraints in the phase of network security evaluations. This paper evaluates capabilities and performances of each algorithm through technical discussion and numerical testing. Special topics on the large-scale SCUC engine development are also discussed in this paper, such as input data screening, inactive constrains elimination, contingency management, infeasibility handling, parallel computing, and model simplification. This paper will benefit academic researchers, software developers, and system operators when they design, develop and assess effective models and algorithms for solving large-scale SCUC problems.

Abstract: Online dynamic security assessment (DSA) is examined in a data-mining framework by taking into account the operating condition (OC) variations and possible topology changes of power systems during the operating horizon. Specifically, a robust scheme is proposed based on adaptive ensemble decision tree (DT) learning. In offline training, a boosting algorithm is employed to build a classification model as a weighted voting of multiple unpruned small-height DTs. Then, the small-height DTs are periodically updated by incorporating new training cases that account for OC variations or the possible changes of system topology; the voting weights of the small-height DTs are also updated accordingly. In online DSA, the updated classification model is used to map the real-time measurements of the present OC to security classification decisions. The proposed scheme is first illustrated on the IEEE 39-bus test system, and then applied to a regional grid of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system. The results of case studies, using a variety of realized OCs, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in dealing with OC variation and system topology change.

worst-case analysis
Abstract: This paper deals with day-ahead security management with respect to a postulated set of contingencies, while taking into account uncertainties about the next day generation/load scenario. In order to help the system operator in decision making under uncertainty, we aim at ranking these contingencies into four clusters according to the type of control actions needed to cover the worst uncertainty pattern of each contingency with respect to branch overload. To this end we use a fixed point algorithm that loops over two main modules: a discrete bi-level program (BLV) that computes the worst-case scenario, and a special kind of security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) which computes optimal preventive/corrective actions to cover the worst-case. We rely on a DC grid model, as the large number of binary variables, the large size of the problem, and the stringent computational requirements preclude the use of existing mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solvers. Consequently we solve the SCOPF using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver while the BLV is decomposed into a series of MILPs. We provide numerical results with our approach on a very large European system model with 9241 buses and 5126 contingencies.

Abstract: The concept of adjustable combinatorial products within the scope of the day-ahead electricity market is introduced in this paper. These adjustable products comprise simple and linked profile block offers/bids, with a variable energy quantity profile during the block periods. In the proposed formulation, these blocks can be partially cleared, namely, the indivisibility of the classical profile blocks that are present in European markets is relaxed. This flexibility allows the elimination of paradoxically accepted and rejected blocks and, thus, the elimination of iterative heuristic procedures for their handling. Such modeling is not possible as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, due to the inherent indivisibility denoted by the use of binary variables. Additionally, advanced profile bids are formulated for demand entities, called "joint demand profile block bids" in this paper, which involve not only inter-temporal relations, but also spatial relations with each other. This two-dimensional relation between demand profile blocks is novel and is deemed feasible with the model presented here. These advanced profile orders are incorporated in a day-ahead market problem, formulating a mixed complementarity problem model, which is solved using commercial solvers. The model is validated using the IEEE RTS-96 system; nevertheless, its scalability to large real-world power systems is straightforward.

Abstract: Extant literature documents that wind generation can reduce wholesale electricity market prices by displacing conventional generation. But how large is the wholesale price effect of wind generation in an electricity market dominated by hydroelectric generation? We explore this question by analyzing the impact of wind generation on wholesale electricity prices in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. This hydro-rich system tends to be energy-limited, rather than capacity-constrained, with its marginal generation during the hydro runoff season often a hydro unit, instead of a natural-gas-fired unit. We find that increased wind generation reduces wholesale market prices by a small, but statistically-significant, amount. While a hydro-rich system can integrate wind generation at a lower cost than a thermal-dominated region, the direct economic benefits to end-users from greater investment in wind power may be negligible.

Abstract: Transmission system operators are increasingly demanding that wind power plants (WPPs) contribute to enhance stability of power systems. When WPPs act as power system stabilizers (PSSs), the control and measured signals used to damp the oscillations may be located far away from the point where the oscillations are originated, typically at the synchronous generators. The use of only local measurements would imply a more robust system not requiring fast communication systems. The output signal used by the PSS in a WPP can be active or reactive power. The optimal combination of input and output to improve the system performance requires a detailed analysis. In this paper, a novel criterion to select input-output signals used by a PSS based on WPPs is presented. Unlike previous results, the proposed criterion considers explicitly local and remote signals in the analysis. Using fundamental design limitations and controllability and observability concepts, the criterion is able to identify the most adequate pair of input-output local signals without designing the controller. The application of the proposed selection criterion is illustrated in a three-synchronous-machine system with a WPP connected.

Abstract: This paper presents the details of a new real-time stability assessment method. The method assesses a particular mechanism of stability: each generator's capability to generate sufficient steady state electromechanical torque. The lack of sufficient steady state torque causes aperiodic increase in rotor angle and a loss of synchronism, referred to as aperiodic small signal instability. The paper provides the theoretical background of the method and an analytical assessment criterion. Furthermore, a mathematical mapping of the generators' operating points that enables informative visualization of multiple operating points is derived in the paper. Finally, results from time-domain simulation of instability scenarios in the Nordic32 test system are presented and results used for testing the assessment method. The results illustrate the method's capability to efficiently identify the location of the emerging problem and to quantify margins to stability boundary.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust optimization approach for transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) under uncertainties of renewable generation and load. Unlike conventional stochastic programming, the proposed approach does not require knowledge of the probability distribution of the uncertain net injections; rather the uncertainties of the net injections are specified by a simple uncertainty set. The solution algorithm is exact and produces expansion plans that are robust against all possible realizations of the net injections defined in the uncertainty set; it is based on a Benders decomposition scheme that iterates between a master problem that minimizes the cost of the expansion plan and a slave problem that minimizes the maximum curtailment of load and renewable generation. The paper demonstrates that when adopting the dc load flow model, both the master and the dual slave can be formulated as mixed-integer linear programs for which commercial solvers exist. Numerical results on several networks with uncertainties in their loads and renewable generation show that the proposed approach produces solutions that are superior to those from two recent techniques for robust TNEP design.

Abstract: This paper proposes two methods to speed up the demanding time-domain simulations of large power system models. First, the sparse linear system to solve at each Newton iteration is decomposed according to its bordered block diagonal structure in order to solve only those parts that need to be solved and update only submatrices of the Jacobian that need to be updated. This brings computational savings without degradation of accuracy. Next, the Jacobian structure is further exploited to localize the system response, i.e., involve only the components identified as active, with an acceptable and controllable decrease in accuracy. The accuracy and computational savings are assessed on a large-scale test system.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of price multiplicity in network-constrained pool-based electricity markets under marginal pricing. This problem consists in the existence of multiple vectors of locational marginal prices for the same optimal market-clearing dispatch solution. As a consequence, delicate conflicts of interest may arise among market participants. Price multiplicity may take place even in auction designs based on convex formulations for the market-clearing procedure. An effective duality-based solution approach is proposed in this paper to handle the issue of price multiplicity. Once the optimal market-clearing dispatch is known, we propose the subsequent solution of a simple pricing problem in order to determine the vector of locational marginal prices. Unlike previously reported methodologies, the proposed approach presents two salient features: 1) it is based on sound mathematical programming, and 2) it is computationally inexpensive since it relies on the solution of a linear program. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed tool.

Abstract: This paper presents a new planning expansion model of an electricity and natural gas distribution system that has high penetration of distributed generation based on natural gas. The model entails lower investment costs as compared to traditional planning models that consider both systems (electricity and natural gas) as independent networks. This model is especially convenient for utilities that own both systems, as electricity and natural gas customers can derive benefits (via electricity or natural gas tariffs) if there are significant savings in investment costs. For fast-growing economies, the merging of electricity and natural gas distribution systems is seen as a promising business opportunity in which economies of scope can have lower investment costs, so there is a definite need for this type of approach.

Abstract: Wind power generation is significantly different from conventional thermal and hydro power generation in the sense that the wind power is governed by the atmosphere and cannot be dispatched like the conventional units in order to respond to the system requirements. The operational reliability of a conventional system depends on the failures of the committed units and the lead time of the next available unit. The reliability contribution of a wind turbine generator is mainly governed by the variability of wind speed at the wind site. A short-term wind model developed for the specific lead time should be suitably combined with the other committed units to evaluate the operational reliability of a power system with significant wind penetration. The area risk concept, previously developed to evaluate the reliability contribution of rapid start units and hot reserve units that are committed later in the lead time, is extended in this paper to incorporate wind power in evaluating the system reliability. The developed method is applied to the IEEE-RTS to evaluate the operational system well-being indices.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust alternative to the previously developed method to reliably locate power-system faults using simultaneously recorded data from multiple locations. Automatic removal of corrupted measurements resulting from various factors (e. g., sensor breakdowns and cyberattacks) will be accomplished via the use of a least-absolute-value (LAV) estimator for fault location. Furthermore, inherent limitations of the approach imposed by sensor configurations as well as the effect of quantization errors incurred by low-precision sensors on the accuracy of estimated fault locations will be described. The performance of the overall algorithm will be tested and verified by fault scenarios on the IEEE 118-bus transmission grid.

Abstract: The application of semidefinite programming to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem has recently attracted significant research interest. This paper provides advances in modeling and computation required for solving the OPF problem for large-scale, general power system models. Specifically, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the OPF problem is presented that incorporates multiple generators at the same bus and parallel lines. Recent research in matrix completion techniques that decompose a single large matrix constrained to be positive semidefinite into many smaller matrices has made solution of OPF problems using semidefinite programming computationally tractable for large system models. We provide three advances to existing decomposition techniques: a matrix combination algorithm that further decreases solver time, a modification to an existing decomposition technique that extends its applicability to general power system networks, and a method for obtaining the optimal voltage profile from the solution to a decomposed semidefinite program.

Abstract: This paper determines the optimal bidding strategy of an electric vehicle (EV) aggregator participating in day-ahead energy and regulation markets using stochastic optimization. Key sources of uncertainty affecting the bidding strategy are identified and incorporated in the stochastic optimization model. The aggregator portfolio optimization model should include inevitable deviations between day-ahead cleared bids and actual real-time energy purchases as well as uncertainty for the energy content of regulation signals in order to ensure profit maximization and reliable reserve provision. Energy deviations are characterized as "uninstructed" or "instructed" depending on whether or not the responsibility resides with the aggregator. Price deviations and statistical characteristics of regulation signals are also investigated. Finally, a new battery model is proposed for better approximation of the battery charging characteristic. Test results with an EV aggregator representing one thousand EVs are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Economic dispatch problem (EDP) is an important class of optimization problems in the smart grid, which aims at minimizing the total cost when generating certain amount of power. In this work, a novel consensus based algorithm is proposed to solve EDP in a distributed fashion. The quadratic convex cost functions are assumed in the problem formulation, and the strongly connected communication topology is sufficient for the information exchange. Unlike centralized approaches, the proposed algorithm enables generators to collectively learn the mismatch between demand and total amount of power generation. The estimated mismatch is then used as a feedback mechanism to adjust current power generation by each generator. With a tactical initial setup, eventually, all generators can automatically minimize the total cost in a collective sense.

Abstract: This paper extends to the load flow problem the factorized solution methodology recently developed for equality-constrained state estimation. This is done by considering a redundant set of initial conditions in order to transform the undetermined system arising in the first linear stage into an overdetermined one. The second nonlinear stage proceeds exactly like in the state estimation case. Experimental results are included showing that the factorized load flow is more robust than the standard NR method, while remaining computationally competitive.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel computing paradigm aimed at solving constrained optimization problems in electric power systems (a.k.a. optimal power flow analysis). The insight is to formulate the OPF problem by a proper set of ordinary differential equations, whose equilibrium points correspond to the optimization problem solutions. Starting from the Lyapunov theory, it will be shown that this artificial dynamic system could be designed to be stable with an exponential asymptotic convergence to equilibrium points. This important feature allows the analyst to overcome some of the inherent limitations of the traditional iterative minimization algorithms that can fail to converge due to the highly nonlinearities of the first-order conditions. Extensive simulation studies aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the proposed computing paradigm are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Network use-of-system (UoS) tariffs play an essential role in the deregulated power markets to recover network investment and maintenance costs from network users, and send economic signals to influence the users' behaviors in using systems. The tariffs are essential to the business operation of both network operators and users. They, however, could have great volatility due to the uncertainties from both external and internal factors. Such uncertain tariffs could bring severe adverse impacts to network users, which justifies that there is an urgent need to reduce the tariff volatility and improve its predictability. This paper for the first time investigates the variations in network tariffs that cause great risks to network users and then designs financial tools to reduce the volatility. The causing factors of the variations are categorized into global and local groups according to their different features. After introducing the process from network planning, charging to revenue reconciliation, the paper discusses the benefits of hedging for network users. In order to reduce tariff volatility, it proposes a novel risk management strategy to maintain the consistency of tariffs. It is achieved by designing long-term contracts using financial hedging. The value of hedge contracts is decided by three key factors: hedged load/generation percentage, hedged price, and risk premium. The hedged part is charged at hedged prices and the non-hedged part is charged at actual prices, on top of which customers needs to pay extra for the risk premium. The paper also designs an optimal decision-making tool to assist network users to manage long-term contracts in order to reduce total tariff costs. As demonstrated in the case study, the proposed long-term products can effectively reduce tariff volatility for network users and create a safe environment for their business operation.

Abstract: In most voltage stability indices, generators are normally modeled as either PV buses or ideal voltage sources. These assumptions cannot cover the entire process of systems losing voltage stability, especially when PV generators have converted to PQ nodes in case of reactive power shortage. In this paper, an alternative generator equivalent model (GEM) is proposed for voltage stability analysis. Based on their dynamic models and real-time measurements, generators are modeled by time-varying internal voltages and impedances to capture the dynamic behaviors of generators. Furthermore, the traditional L-index is extended to incorporate GEMs for system voltage stability analysis. Simulation studies have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new index and to show the impacts of GEM on voltage stability analysis. The simulation results of four test systems show that, in certain scenarios, incorporating GEM is necessary and can significantly improve the accuracy of voltage stability analysis.

Abstract: The existence of locally optimal solutions to the AC optimal power flow problem (OPF) has been a question of interest for decades. This paper presents examples of local optima on a variety of test networks including modified versions of common networks. We show that local optima can occur because the feasible region is disconnected and/or because of nonlinearities in the constraints. Standard local optimization techniques are shown to converge to these local optima. The voltage bounds of all the examples in this paper are between +/- 5% and +/- 10% off-nominal. The examples with local optima are available in an online archive (http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/optenergy/LocalOpt/) and can be used to test local or global optimization techniques for OPF. Finally we use our test examples to illustrate the behavior of a recent semi-definite programming approach that aims to find the global solution of OPF.

Abstract: In this paper, a new method has been proposed to calculate the probability density function of load flow results in electrical power systems. The proposed method has introduced an adaptive kernel density estimation based on smoothing properties of linear diffusion process. This method has been applied to the electrical power system including wind energy. In addition, the correlated bus loads have been considered in the power system. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been applied to the modified New England 39-bus power system including a wind farm. Simulation results show the accuracy of the proposed method in density function estimation of output random variables.

Abstract: In order to reduce the fuel cost of thermal units, a semidefinite programming (SDP) method is used to solve a hydrothermal coordination (HTC) optimization problem. By manipulating the structure of decision variable matrix, the original nonconvex problem is reformulated into a convex SDP relaxation model without sacrificing the nonlinear relation among hydropower generation, reservoir storage volume, and discharge water. A global minimum is therefore guaranteed and well-developed convex optimization theories can thus be employed to solve the problem. Both sparse matrix techniques and a simplified SDP model are discussed to reduce computational cost. One mostly used HTC case is employed to test the performance of the proposed method. Detailed comparisons between the proposed and other methods show that the final result of SDP model is by far the best result ever. In addition, a large-sized HTC case shows the potential of SDP in practical use. Finally, we prove that as a relaxation technique, the SDP solution, which satisfies all the constraints, is indeed the optimal solution of the original nonconvex problem.

Abstract: A novel functional time-series methodology for short-term load forecasting is introduced. The prediction is performed by means of a weighted average of past daily load segments, the shape of which is similar to the expected shape of the load segment to be predicted. The past load segments are identified from the available history of the observed load segments by means of their closeness to a so-called reference load segment. The latter is selected in a manner that captures the expected qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the load segment to be predicted. As an illustration, the suggested functional time-series forecasting methodology is applied to historical daily load data in Cyprus. Its performance is compared with some recently proposed alternative methodologies for short-term load forecasting.

Abstract: Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are time synchronized sensors primarily used for power system state estimation. Despite their increasing incorporation and the ongoing research on state estimation using measurements from these sensors, estimation with imperfect phase synchronization has not been sufficiently investigated. Inaccurate synchronization is an inevitable problem that large scale deployment of PMUs has to face. In this paper, we introduce a model for power system state estimation using PMUs with phase mismatch. We propose alternating minimization and parallel Kalman filtering for state estimation using static and dynamic models, respectively, under different assumptions. Numerical examples demonstrate the improved accuracy of our algorithms compared with traditional algorithms when imperfect synchronization is present. We conclude that when a sufficient number of PMUs with small delays are employed, the imperfect synchronization can be largely compensated in the estimation stage.

Abstract: In this paper it is shown that once the measurements with gross errors are detected and identified, the geometrical approach to recover gross errors in power system state estimation, as we have previously proposed, is a convergent process. For the purpose of correcting the measurement gross errors, the measurement residuals are computed, and then the measurement gross errors are composed. For the detection and identification of the measurements with gross errors, the composed measurement error in the normalized form is used. The measurement magnitude corrections otherwise are performed using the composed normalized error. To support the thesis that, after the detection and identification of the measurements containing gross errors, the measurement correction is a convergent procedure, the generalization of the largest normalized error test is also provided. A two-bus power network is used to show in a didactic way the behavior of the gross error correction. The IEEE 14-bus system and the 45-bus equivalent of Brazil south are used to perform the tests for the multiple measurement gross errors case. Many gross error scenarios with different redundancy levels, for multiple gross error situations, have been tested. The measurement correction is made one at a time.

Abstract: This paper presents a new conjectural-variation-based equilibrium model of a single-price electricity market. In the electricity market, firstly, the market clearing process is performed in the day-ahead market and after that, a counter-trading mechanism is used to clear the network congestion. The system may have any configuration, either radial or meshed, and there is not restriction on the size of the system. The main contribution of the model is that the market equilibrium equations incorporates the effect of congestion between multiple areas in the agents' strategic behavior. Furthermore, the market equilibrium equations are solved using an equivalent optimization problem. The optimization problem has two levels. The first level corresponds to the day-ahead market and the second level is a DC optimal power flow that solves the network congestion. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: One of the main interoperability issues in electric power systems concerns the interactions between IEC 61850 and CIM standards. The state of the art includes solutions to facilitate the exchange of configuration files between the two standards. Nevertheless, there are no contributions in the literature aimed at facilitating the run-time interactions between IEC 61850-based and CIM-based systems. Thus, at present, the signal mapping between these systems must be carried out manually. This paper presents a new methodology that helps to automate this process by utilizing ontology matching techniques. The proposed methodology was successfully evaluated with case studies based on four representative substation architectures.

Abstract: In conventional power flow, the system branch resistances are assumed to be constant despite the fact that they are sensitive to temperature, and therefore to branch loading and losses. When the accurate calculation of losses is important, temperature correction of branch resistance can improve the accuracy of the power flow calculation. This paper introduces a temperature-dependent power flow algorithm: a novel approach which integrates an estimate of branch temperatures and resistances with the conventional power flow equations. This methodology relies on the creation of a set of coupled temperature and power flow equations which are solved using the Newton-Raphson solution method for nonlinear equations. The core methodology is developed first, then extended via several decoupling techniques.

Abstract: In most existing reliability evaluation techniques, the stopping rules applied for contingency enumeration are either a given number of states with the highest probabilities or the states up to a specified failure order. However, the probability of a high order outage state may be larger than that of a low order outage state due to different reliabilities of the failed components. On the other hand, a low probability state with high outage capacity may have larger impact on system reliability than a high probability state with low outage capacity. These effects have not been considered in the existing techniques for contingency filtering or screening. A fast contingency screening technique (FCST) for generation system reliability evaluation is proposed in this paper. In this technique, contingency states are searched and ranked based on the severity coefficients determined by both state probabilities and outage capacities of the failed units. Several severity coefficients for a unit are defined and examined based on reliability and capacity factors. The replaceable neighboring states of a state and the minimum set of the neighboring states are defined to further reduce computation time. The merits of the proposed techniques and severity coefficients are validated by evaluating the East-China Power Grid.

Abstract: This paper proposes a systematic and general approach to model power systems as continuous stochastic differential-algebraic equations. With this aim, the paper provides a theoretical background on stochastic differential-algebraic equations and justifies the need for stochastic models in power system analysis. Then, the paper describes a general procedure to define stochastic dynamic models. Practical issues related to the numerical integration of the resulting power system model are also discussed. A case study illustrating the proposed approach is provided based on the IEEE 145-bus 50-machine system. The case study also illustrates and compares the reliability of the results obtained using stochastic and conventional probabilistic models.

The suggested method enjoys superior theoretical properties and it is very reliable. Implementation innovations, including the development of an efficient algorithm for computing the second order derivatives of eigenvalues, rescaling and eigenvalue tracking, are reported in detail. Simulation results of ten test systems including the East China power system with 465 machines and 3296 buses are described, showing that the suggested method is a reliable parameter tuning tool and it has the potential for solving real-world stabilizer parameter tuning problems.

Abstract: Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyals (PCBs) is hazardous to human health. The United Nations Environment Programme has decreed that nations, including Canada and USA, must eliminate PCB contaminated equipment such as transformers by 2025. To determine the PCB status of a transformer with absolute certainty, the oil mixture of the transformer must be sampled because transformers labeled as non-PCB could be cross-contaminated. Since sealed oil mixture sampling is costly, for the first time, we apply an iterative machine learning technique called active learning to classify PCB contaminated transformers while minimizing a cost metric that integrates the classification error cost and the sampling cost. We propose a dynamic sampling method to address two key issues in active learning: the sampling size per iteration and the stopping criterion of the sampling process. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the real-world datasets from BC Hydro in Canada.

Abstract: Previous work has shown that robust state estimator based on maximum normal measurement rate is accurate and reliable. However, in the existing algorithm, the optimal solutions cannot be obtained due to the approximation of evaluation function. Besides, there are no noise-filtering effects on normal measurements. To deal with these two problems, this letter presents an improved algorithm to get a more accurate solution with higher normal measurement rate. Numerical tests on different systems show the proposed algorithm is efficient.

Abstract: This paper presents an ultra-high speed hardware platform dedicated to power system dynamic (small signal) and transient (large signal) stability. It is based on an intrinsic parallel architecture which contains hybrid mixed-signal (analog and digital) circuits. For a given model, this architecture overcomes the speed of the numerical simulators by means of the so-called emulation approach. Indeed, the emulation speed does not depend on the power system size. This approach is nevertheless not competing against high-performance numerical simulators in term of accuracy and model complexity. It targets to complement the numerical simulators with the advantage of speed, portability, low cost and autonomous functioning. The proof of concept is a flexible and modular 96-node hardware platform. It is based on a reconfigurable array of power system buses called Field Programmable Power Network System (FPPNS). Details on this hardware are given. Two benchmark topologies with, respectively, 17 nodes and 57 nodes are provided. Comparisons with a digital simulator are done in terms of speed and accuracy. The calibration of the system is explained and different applications are proposed and discussed. The promising results of this hardware platform show that the design of a fully integrated solution containing hundreds of power system buses can be achieved in order to provide a low cost solution.

Abstract: This paper proposes a mathematical model for multistage transmission expansion planning (TEP) considering fixed series compensation (FSC) allocation and N-1 security constraints for both transmission lines and FSCs. FSCs can increase the transmission lines transfer capacity, but the importance of using them in TEP is to dispatch the power more efficiently, resulting in a different topology with less investment cost compared with planning without FSCs. This problem is modeled as a linear mixed binary programming problem and is solved by a commercial branch-and-cut solver to obtain the optimum solution. FSC is modeled as a fixed impedance located in the transmission lines in discrete steps and with an investment cost based on the prices of reinforcement lines. The results obtained using two known test systems show the economic benefits of using FSC in multistage TEP problems.

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-based method for coordinating generation rescheduling and load shedding to enhance overall transient stability of power systems. Firstly, a generation rescheduling model that can consider the risk-based dynamic security constraint is proposed, in which some acceptable risk level should be respected and can be adjusted by a risk coordination parameter. For the purpose of considering the potential corrective control costs at the stage of preventive control design, a bi-level coordination optimization model is developed, in which on the upper level the total coordination cost is minimized by the risk coordination parameter adjustment; and on the lower level the generation rescheduling and the load shedding are performed successively to enhance the risk-based dynamic security and the transient stability performance, respectively. Finally, a hybrid method that can combine the Golden Section Search and the Successive Linear Programming is developed to solve the bi-level optimization model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by using the New England test system and a real power system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for obtaining controlling unstable equilibrium point (CUEP) for transient stability analysis in electric power systems. A minimization problem is formulated to attain CUEP by applying the critical trajectory (CTrj) method to the boundary controlling unstable equilibrium point (BCU) method. CTrj method is a unique approach proposed by the authors to obtain critical condition for transient stability problem. The Proposed method simultaneously computes a trajectory on the stability boundary starting from the exit point reaching CUEP. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations for various systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic framework to enhance the reliability and operability of wind integration using energy storage systems. Agenetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization approach is used together with a probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) to optimally place and adequately size the energy storage. The optimization scheme minimizes the sum of operation and interrupted-load costs over a planning period. Historical wind speed, load and equipment failure data are used to stochastically model the wind generation, load wind and load samples are grouped into 40 clusters of days with similar sample points to account for seasonal variations. The IEEE 24-bus system (RTS) is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and realize the maximum achievable reliability level. A cost-benefit analysis compares storage technologies and conventional gas-fired alternatives to reliably and efficiently integrate different wind penetration levels and determine the most economical design. Storage distribution and its effect on performance enhancement of wind integration are examined for higher wind penetrations.

Abstract: Realizing the significant demand flexibility potential in deregulated power systems requires its suitable integration in electricity markets. Part I of this work has presented the theoretical, algorithmic and implementation aspects of a novel pool market mechanism achieving this goal by combining the advantages of centralized mechanisms and dynamic pricing schemes, based on Lagrangian relaxation (LR) principles. Part II demonstrates the applicability of the mechanism, considering two reschedulable demand technologies with significant potential, namely electric vehicles with flexible charging capability and electric heat pump systems accompanied by heat storage for space heating. The price response sub-problems of these technologies are formulated, including detailed models of their operational properties. Suitable case studies on a model of the U.K. system are examined in order to validate the properties of the proposed mechanism and illustrate and analyze the benefits associated with the market participation of the considered technologies.

Abstract: This paper presents a new problem formulation for allocation of high-temperature superconducting fault current limiter (HTS-FCL) in power systems for security and stability enhancement. A dynamic current-dependent model for HTS-FCL is developed using PSCAD/ETMDC. The proposed formulation includes three functions related to security, voltage stability, and rotor angle stability which represent key features of deploying the HTS-FCL. The three functions were combined into a multi-objective function, and the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and optimal FCL locations are determined using particle swarm optimization. The optimal FCL locations for the New-England 39-bus system are determined, and the system transient performance is validated using MATLAB and PSCAD. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach for achieving optimal performance of HTS-FCL in power system in terms of security and system stability.

Abstract: We propose a decentralized optimal load control scheme that provides contingency reserve in the presence of sudden generation drop. The scheme takes advantage of flexibility of frequency responsive loads and neighborhood area communication to solve an optimal load control problem that balances load and generation while minimizing end-use disutility of participating in load control. Local frequency measurements enable individual loads to estimate the total mismatch between load and generation. Neighborhood area communication helps mitigate effects of inconsistencies in the local estimates due to frequency measurement noise. Case studies show that the proposed scheme can balance load with generation and restore the frequency within seconds of time after a generation drop, even when the loads use a highly simplified power system model in their algorithms. We also investigate tradeoffs between the amount of communication and the performance of the proposed scheme through simulation-based experiments.

Abstract: A high penetration of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) resources into low-voltage (LV) distribution networks creates reverse power-flow and voltage-rise problems. This generally occurs when the generation from PV resources substantially exceeds the load demand during high insolation period. This paper has investigated the solar PV impacts and developed a mitigation strategy by an effective use of distributed energy storage systems integrated with solar PV units in LV networks. The storage is used to consume surplus solar PV power locally during PV peak, and the stored energy is utilized in the evening for the peak-load support. A charging/discharging control strategy is developed taking into account the current state of charge (SoC) of the storage and the intended length of charging/discharging period to effectively utilize the available capacity of the storage. The proposed strategy can also mitigate the impact of sudden changes in PV output, due to unstable weather conditions, by putting the storage into a short-term discharge mode. The charging rate is adjusted dynamically to recover the charge drained during the short-term discharge to ensure that the level of SoC is as close to the desired SoC as possible. A comprehensive battery model is used to capture the realistic behavior of the distributed energy storage units in a distribution feeder. The proposed PV impact mitigation strategy is tested on a practical distribution network in Australia and validated through simulations.

Abstract: Combined Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and market-based optimal power flow (OPF) considering different combinations of wind generation and load demand over a year are used to evaluate wind turbines (WTs) integration into distribution systems. MCS is used to model the uncertainties related to the stochastic variations of wind power generation and load demand while the social welfare is maximized by means of market-based OPF with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed probabilistic methodology allows evaluating the amount of wind power that can be injected into the grid as well as the impact of wind power penetration on the social welfare and on distribution-locational marginal prices. Market-based OPF is solved by using step-controlled primal dual interior point method considering network constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic-method in assessing the impact of wind generation penetration in terms of both technical and economic effects is demonstrated with an 84-bus 11.4-kV radial distribution system.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the growth in application of corrective actions to enhance network utilization will require a probabilistic treatment of network security for determining efficient levels of investment in network reinforcement. A Benders decomposition based two-stage probabilistic optimization model for the operational and investment problems is proposed. For selecting relevant contingencies (beyond N-1 criteria), a novel filtering technique for efficient elimination of redundant outages is presented and successfully tested. In 2 numerical examples we compare efficiency of network reinforcement propositions under both deterministic and probabilistic frameworks, while optimizing available preventive and corrective control actions, and in particular focusing on the application of generation reserve in combination with special protection schemes (SPS) for network congestion management purposes. We highlight the inadequacies of the deterministic approach with respect to its inherent inability to optimize accurately the portfolio of pre-fault post-fault actions since the impacts of corrective actions (in the form of SPS, demand response) and occurrence of "non-credible" events require explicit consideration of the likelihood of various outages. We conclude that deterministic approach drives less efficient and potentially more risky system operation that ultimately leads to inefficient network investment.

Abstract: This paper applies a reduced order, extended quasi-steady-state model of long-term dynamics to the analysis of low-frequency interarea oscillations in the South Eastern part of the European system. Emphasis is put on the contribution of hydro and steam-turbine governors on oscillation damping and in particular on the pronounced effect of steam-turbine governor dead-band. The incident of prolonged interarea oscillations on May 1, 2005 in South Eastern Europe is analyzed and explained with the developed reduced order model, while additional stabilizers in Hellenic System generators are designed that prove to be effective in damping out the low-frequency interarea oscillations.

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic framework to design an secure day-ahead dispatch and determine the minimum cost reserves for power systems with wind power generation. We also identify a reserve strategy according to which we deploy the reserves in real-time operation, which serves as a corrective control action. To achieve this, we formulate a stochastic optimization program with chance constraints, which encode the probability of satisfying the transmission capacity constraints of the lines and the generation limits. To incorporate a reserve decision scheme, we take into account the steady-state behavior of the secondary frequency controller and, hence, consider the deployed reserves to be a linear function of the total generation-load mismatch. The overall problem results in a chance constrained bilinear program. To achieve tractability, we propose a convex reformulation and a heuristic algorithm, whereas to deal with the chance constraint we use a scenario-based-approach and an approach that considers only the quantiles of the stationary distribution of the wind power error. To quantify the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies and compare them in terms of cost and performance, we use the IEEE 30-bus network and carry out Monte Carlo simulations, corresponding to different wind power realizations generated by a Markov chain-based model.

Abstract: The paper presents a methodology to identify generators at risk of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) in meshed AC/DC networks. Two risk indices are developed to rank generators based on the level of exposure to SSR. One of them measures the severity of subsynchronous torsional interactions, and the other indicates the gravity of transient torque problem. It is shown that proposed indices can be used to identify generators in the network that are at the risk of experiencing high mechanical torques due to SSR and to rank them based on severity of potential exposure to SSR. The methodology is demonstrated on meshed 16-machine, 68-bus IEEE test network with different series compensation levels of AC lines, asymmetrical compensation and voltage source converter (VSC) based HVDC lines. Finally, electromagnetic transient simulations are used to verify the ranking of generators obtained using developed indices.

Abstract: This paper addresses the global optimization of the short term scheduling for hydroelectric power generation. A tailored deterministic global optimization approach, denominated sHBB, is developed and its performance is analyzed. This approach is applied to the optimization of a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for cascades of hydro plants, each one with multiple turbines, and characterized by a detailed representation of the net head of water, and a nonlinear hydropower generation function. A simplified model is also considered where only the linear coefficients of the forebay and tailrace polynomial functions are retained. For comparison purposes, four case studies are addressed with the proposed global optimization strategy and with a commercial solver for global optimization. The results show that the proposed approach is more efficient than the commercial solver in terms of finding a better solution with a smaller optimality gap, using less CPU time. The proposed method can also find alternative and potentially more profitable power production schedules. Significant insights were also obtained regarding the effectiveness of the proposed relaxation strategies.

Abstract: An energy function for AC/DC power system represented by a structure-preserving model is proposed considering detailed DC dynamics. The generators are described by one-axis model with excitation control. The DC line is modeled in details as load dependent on converter bus voltage and DC line current. The effects of mode shift and voltage dependent current limiter (VDCOL) are taken into account. The proposed energy function is theoretically shown to meet the major requirements of being an energy function. A numerical algorithm for constructing the energy function is presented. The monotonic decreasing property of the proposed energy function is numerically demonstrated on two AC/DC systems. It is clarified that the proposed energy function can be viewed as a generalization of the existing energy functions with less assumption.

Abstract: This paper describes a probabilistic method based on a total risk index (probability times consequences) for assessing the number of spare breakers required for a group of similar high voltage breakers used in switching and transformer stations. The proposed method uses a Markov model for assessing the probability of failures and a bulk power system reliability program for evaluating failure consequences. The method considers a number of factors such as the group size, unit failure rate, unit repair time, transmission station layout, and other power system parameters that may impact the number of spare breakers. A cost/benefit analysis approach is used in determining the required number of spare breakers. The number of spare units is determined when the total cost (sum of spare unit costs, system operating costs and system outage costs due to breaker failures) is minimum. An example is given to illustrate the proposed method of assessment.

Abstract: Distribution system reconfiguration can be achieved by changing the statuses of switches. By altering the topology of a distribution system, the real power loss can be reduced. This paper proposes a novel charged system search (CSS) algorithm, the particle moving evaluation mechanism CSS (PMEM-CSS), for determining the switching strategy in order to solve the distribution system loss minimization problems. In CSS, the position of each charged particle is a solution that represents a specific topology of a distribution system. During the problem-solving process, new solutions are generated in CSS. In order to avoid generating illegal solutions, a novel decoding scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed decoding scheme can also improve the search performance when PMEM-CSS seeks the best solution. Three different distribution systems, a 33-bus, a 66-bus, and a TPC 248-bus system are carried out in this paper. The performance of different algorithms (GA, PSO, CSS, and PMEM-CSS) is compared. The simulation results show that not only the efficiency of the proposed method is the best among these algorithms bust also the quality of the solution is superior to other algorithms.

Abstract: This paper investigates the probabilistic small-signal rotor angle/voltage stability of an AC/DC power system to which offshore wind generation is connected through a multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) network. The paper applies an analytical method based on multi-point linearization to improve the accuracy of assessment of system probabilistic stability. It proposes to examine the probabilistic small-signal voltage stability of the AC/DC power system as the voltage stability is always a concern of HVDC network. The participation factor is then employed to further analyze this phenomenon and give effective remedial measures. In the paper, an example of 16-machine AC/DC power system to which three offshore wind farms is connected through aN MTDC network is presented. The proposed method in the paper is compared with the conventional Gram-Charlier expansion-based method and the nonlinear Monte Carlo simulation.

Abstract: Deploying shunt capacitor banks in distribution systems can effectively reduce the power loss and provide additional benefits for system operation. In practice, the power loss on distribution transformers can account for a considerable portion of the overall loss. This paper proposes a method for optimal placement of capacitor banks to the distribution transformers to reduce power loss. The capacitor bank locations are considered at the low-side of transformers. The net present value (NPV) criterion is adopted to evaluate the cost benefit of the capacitor installation project. First, an explicit formula for directly calculating the power loss of radial distribution systems is derived. Then, the optimal capacitor bank placement is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model maximizing the NPV of the project subject to certain constraints. The model is suitable for being solved by commercial MIP packages, and the operational control of the capacitor banks to maximize the power loss reduction can be simply achieved by local automatic switching according to VAR measurements. The proposed method has been practically applied in the Macau distribution system, and the simulation results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient, and a considerable positive NPV can be obtained from the optimal capacitor bank placement.

Abstract: Ramps events are a significant source of uncertainty in wind power generation. Developing statistical models from historical data for wind power ramps is important for designing intelligent distribution and market mechanisms for a future electric grid. This requires robust detection schemes for identifying wind ramps in data. In this paper, we propose an optimal detection technique for identifying wind ramps for large time series. The technique relies on defining a family of scoring functions associated with any rule for defining ramps on an interval of the time series. A dynamic programming recursion is then used to find all such ramp events. Identified wind ramps are used to propose a new stochastic framework to characterize wind ramps. Extensive statistical analysis is performed based on this framework, characterizing ramping duration and rates as well as other key features needed for evaluating the impact of wind ramps in the operation of the power system. In particular, evaluation of new ancillary services and wind ramp forecasting can benefit from the proposed approach.

Abstract: A centralized market-splitting algorithm is implemented in this paper in a Europe-wide level, comprising both power pools and Power Exchanges, with each local/national market respecting the standard constraints imposed by its own regulatory framework, including the full set of unit technical/commitment constraints and system operating constraints in power pools. In view of the forthcoming large-scale RES penetration, physical markets with unit-based offers (either pools or PXs) check the feasibility of the electricity market solution against their internal (intra-zonal) transmission network constraints, considering full network topology. This is accomplished through an iterative process, iterating between the overall optimization algorithm, and intra-zonal power flows of the countries/regions, which identify possible congestions and incorporate additional constraints in the central pan-European market-splitting problem. The iterative process terminates when all internal transmission constraints are satisfied. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) can be computed in the physical markets, whereas zonal/system marginal prices are computed in markets with portfolio-bidding schemes. The proposed algorithm is tested in terms of computational efficiency using the full UCTE network.

Abstract: The cross-border trading among electricity markets in an interconnected multi-area system (e.g., in central Europe) and the integration of renewable resources (e.g., wind energy) have remarkably increased in recent years. To efficiently operate such system, a proper coordination among different areas is required. Within this context, a decentralized algorithm for market clearing is proposed in this paper to dispatch simultaneously energy and reserve under wind generation uncertainty and equipment failures. The proposed technique does not require a central operator but just a moderate interchange of information among neighboring areas. Additionally, the benefit of cross-border trading is studied.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the influence of the converter droop settings and the dc grid network topology on the power sharing in a dc grid based on voltage source converter high voltage direct current technology. The paper presents an analytical tool to study the effect of the droop control settings on the steady-state voltage deviations and power sharing after a converter outage, thereby accounting for dc grid behavior. Furthermore, an optimization algorithm is developed, taking into account two conflicting optimization criteria. The simulation results show that, when selecting appropriate values for the converter gains, a tradeoff has to be made between the power sharing and the maximum allowable dc voltage deviation after an outage.

Abstract: Corrective transmission switching schemes are an essential part of grid operations and are used to improve the reliability of the grid as well as the operational efficiency. Today, the transmission switching schemes are established based on the operator's past knowledge of the system as well as other ad-hoc methods. In this paper, three topology control (corrective transmission switching) methodologies are presented along with the detailed formulation of robust corrective switching. By incorporating robust optimization into the corrective switching framework, the switching solution is guaranteed to be feasible for a range of system operating states. The robust model can be solved offline to suggest switching actions that can be used in a dynamic security assessment tool in real-time. The proposed robust topology control algorithm can also generate multiple corrective switching actions for a particular contingency. The robust topology control formulation is tested on an IEEE 118-bus test case with different uncertainty sets.

Abstract: Very short-term load forecasting predicts the loads in electric power system one hour into the future in 5-min steps in a moving window manner. To quantify forecasting accuracy in real-time, the prediction interval estimates should also be produced online. Effective predictions with good prediction intervals are important for resource dispatch and area generation control, and help power market participants make prudent decisions. We previously presented a two level wavelet neural network method based on back propagation without estimating prediction intervals. This paper extends the previous work by using hybrid Kalman filters to produce forecasting with prediction interval estimates online. Based on data analysis, a neural network trained by an extended Kalman filter is used for the low-low frequency component to capture the near-linear relationship between the input load component and the output measurement, while neural networks trained by unscented Kalman filters are used for low-high and high frequency components to capture their nonlinear relationships. The overall variance estimate is then derived and evaluated for prediction interval estimation. Testing results demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid Kalman filters for capturing different features of load components, and the accuracy of the overall variance estimate derived based on a data set from ISO New England.

Abstract: Self-healing is a major driving force in the smart grid vision. This paper proposes a comprehensive design and operational planning framework to generate optimum self-healing control actions in a distribution system. For this purpose, a distribution system with optimally allocated distributed generators (DGs) is divided into a set of microgrids with high self-adequacy through allocation of distributed energy storage resources (DESRs) and distributed reactive sources (DRSs). Afterwards, by using the predicted load and generation of renewable-based distributed generators for the next hour of the day and other important factors (self-adequacy in the unfaulted microgrids, total distribution system's energy losses and the total supplied loads according to their requested reliability), the optimum self-healing strategy is planned for the system for all possible future faults. The IEEE 123-bus distribution system is selected as the test system; optimum microgrids are designed and several case studies are presented to demonstrate the effects of optimization coefficients on the optimum self-healing control actions.

Abstract: Numerical methods play an important role in improving efficiency for power system time-domain simulation. Motivated by the need to perform high-speed extended-term time-domain simulation (HSET-TDS) for online purposes, this paper presents design principles for numerical solvers of differential algebraic systems associated with power system time-domain simulation, focusing on DAE construction strategies, integration methods, nonlinear solvers, and linear solvers. We have implemented a design appropriate for HSET-TDS, and we have compared the proposed integration method, Hammer-Hollingsworth 4 (HH4), with Trapezoidal rule in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, using the New England 39-bus system, an expanded 8775-bus system, and PJM 13 029-bus system.

Abstract: This paper describes an air-conditioner (A/C) compressor single phase induction motor (SPIM) model for use in an electro-magnetic transients (EMTs) simulation. The system of differential equations representing the SPIM model is developed and formulated. The angular position of the rotor shaft is retained in the electrical and mechanical equations of the model so that position dependence of the driven-load torque can be explicitly recognized. The equivalent circuit of the proposed model is represented as an interface to the external electric network in the EMTs simulator. Motor dynamic response to voltage dip at different points on the voltage waveform has been studied. The rationale of motor stalling is explored. Multiple aggregate units of the proposed model have been implemented on a distribution feeder to test and verify the motor dynamics in an EMTs simulation.

Abstract: The Newton method is a commonly used method to solve the AC power flow problems. However, it is too expensive to evaluate the Jacobian matrix explicitly for each Newton iteration. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient preconditioner construction strategy for the Newton-GMRES method without forming the Jacobian matrix explicitly to solve the AC power problems based on automatic differentiation. Compared to some other existing fast Newton-GMRES methods for power systems, our proposed method is much more efficient and robust.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that wide-area signals obtained using synchronized phasor measurements could be more effective than local signals in damping inter-area oscillations in large interconnected systems. To transmit wide-area signals for use in controls, communication systems are required. Communication systems are vulnerable to disruptions as a result of which the reliability of the power system could be jeopardized. In order to counteract communication failures, resiliency could be built in either the communication system or the physical system. In this paper an approach is developed to build resiliency in grid controls in the physical system. The resiliency is achieved by robustly designing a novel redundant two-input single-output (TISO) supplementary damping controller (SDC) associated with a static VAr compensator (SVC) that utilizes both a wide-area signal and a local signal to guarantee that the system is stabilized if the wide-area signal is lost. Numerical tests on the IEEE 50-generator test system have demonstrated that the proposed SDC is effective in stabilizing the system and improving grid control resiliency in response to communication failures.

Abstract: As power generation plants which use wind energy are increasingly integrated into existing electric power systems, it becomes important to evaluate how the wind power uncertainties affect the power system's operation as well as its interdependency with those infrastructures utilized to transport the various forms of primary energy that is converted into electric energy. This paper proposes a robust optimization model for analyzing the interdependency between natural gas, coal and electricity infrastructures considering their operation constraints and wind power uncertainties. The optimization model obtains an uncertainty-immunized solution in a unified framework based on the balance of nodal energy flows, which remains feasible and nearly optimal for all values of uncertain data. Case studies are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution for a multi-energy system composed by the IEEE-118 test system coupled to a 15-nodes natural gas network and a 4-nodes coal distribution system as well as for the real life Belgian natural gas and electricity infrastructures.

Abstract: Traditional state estimation methods employ large weights for zero injection pseudo-measurements, which may result in numerical instability. The normal equations with constraints will increase the order of the coefficient matrix, thus reducing the speed of the calculations. To improve computational performance, this paper presents a modified Newton method to deal with zero injection constraints. The decoupled form of the proposed technique-a modified fast decoupled state estimation method-is also given. The computational speed of the proposed modified Newton method is similar to that of conventional state estimations based on normal equations, since they use the same type of coefficient matrices. Furthermore, it offers the advantage that zero injection constraints can be strictly satisfied, and the numerical stability problem caused by large weights will no longer exist. Extensive numerical results from test systems and a real provincial system are included to verify the performance of the proposed procedure.

Abstract: In competitive environments, most equipment are operated closer to or at their limits and as a result, equipment's maintenance schedules may be affected by system conditions. In this paper, we propose a Markov decision process (MDP) that allows better flexibility in conducting maintenance. The proposed MDP model is based on a state transition diagram where inspection and maintenance (I&M) delay times are explicitly incorporated. The model can be solved efficiently to determine adaptive maintenance policies. This formulation successfully combines the long term aging process with more frequently observed short term changes in equipment's condition. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model using I&M data of local transformers.

Abstract: Traditionally, capacitor placement and conductor replacement have been considered as independent solutions for loss reduction in distribution networks. However, these two methods have an inherent coupling relationship, especially at harmonic frequencies. This paper presents a joint optimization algorithm for both conductor replacement of overhead lines and capacitor placement to minimize energy losses in the presence of harmonics throughout the distribution system, such that both individual and total harmonic distortion of bus voltages are kept within the acceptable levels. All actual conditions including time varying nature of loads, network extension over the planning horizon, annual load growth and different load patterns are taken into account based on the realistic data. By applying the proposed method, the economic cost and energy losses are remarkably reduced compared to that could be achieved by applying these two methods separately in the presence of harmonics. The proposed method is applied on a realistic distribution network of Sirjan city-center in Iran.

Abstract: A multi-objective power unit commitment problem is framed to consider simultaneously the objectives of minimizing the operation cost and minimizing the emissions from the generation units. To find the solution of the optimal schedule of the generation units, a memetic evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which combines the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and a local search algorithm. The power dispatch sub-problem is solved by the weighed-sum lambda-iteration approach. The proposed method has been tested on systems composed by 10 and 100 generation units for a 24-hour demand horizon. The Pareto-optimal front obtained contains solutions of different trade off with respect to the two objectives of cost and emission, which are superior to those contained in the Pareto-front obtained by the pure NSGA-II. The solutions of minimum cost are shown to compare well with recent published results obtained by single-objective cost optimization algorithms.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-option power flow approach for hybrid AC/DC grids. A unified AC-DC unit is introduced which can be used in two different cases: case a) AC grids with embedded VSC-based MTDC grids, and case b) asynchronous AC grids connected via a common VSC-based MTDC grid. In the proposed method for each MTDC grid (regardless of the number of converters), a new state variable is introduced to handle any kind of converter loss models. For the case (b), the AC-DC unit can be used in two different analyses, namely, a1) the separated analysis and a2) the integrated analysis. Both a1) and a2) can be used in the practical analysis of the real-size power systems. However, it is shown that the separated analysis not only offers a shorter computational time but it is also very suitable for the future connection between large existing AC systems and other AC systems or remote renewable energy sources through the DC grids. The proposed methodology is implemented in MATLAB software and verified using commercial software SIMPOW.

Abstract: Power system load modeling is a mature and generally well researched area which, as many other in electrical power engineering at the present time, is going through a period of renewed interest in both industry and academia. This interest is fueled by the appearance of new non-conventional types of loads (power electronic-based, or interfaced through power electronics) and requirements to operate modern electric power systems with increased penetration of non-conventional and mostly intermittent types of generation in a safe and secure manner. As a response to this renewed interest, in February 2010 CIGRE established working group C4.605: "Modelling and aggregation of loads in flexible power networks". One of the first tasks of the working group was to identify current international industry practice on load modeling for static and dynamic power system studies. For that purpose, a questionnaire was developed and distributed during the summer/autumn of 2010 to more than 160 utilities and system operators in over 50 countries on five continents. This paper summarizes some of the key findings from about 100 responses to the questionnaire received by September 2011 and identifies prevalent types of load models used as well as typical values of their parameters.

Abstract: The intermittent power output of a wind farm is the main challenge behind increasing wind power penetration of power systems. This paper proposes a battery energy storage system (BESS) dual-layer control strategy-consisting of a fluctuation mitigation control layer and a power allocation control layer-to mitigate wind farm power output fluctuations. The fluctuation mitigation control layer calculates the power instructions for the BESS so that the combined wind farm and BESS power output meets fluctuation mitigation requirement (FMR). The layer implements a flexible first-order low-pass filter (FLF), updating the time constant of the FLF through use of a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The power allocation control layer optimizes power instructions allocation among the battery energy storage units of the BESS. The layer's energy management of the BESS uses a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) model, which improves reliability. Moreover, the paper compares two types of charge/discharge switching constraints to reduce the number of charge/discharge cycles, which can prolong the operational lifetime of the BESS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed dual-layer control strategy is verified through case studies.

Abstract: The analytical ridge regression is applied for accommodating unscheduled flows in bulk interconnection by estimating "minor loop flows". Ridge regression uses a bias parameter to minimize the average squared error, instead of the ordinary least squares method, when numerically ill-conditioned system matrices are present. The analytical approach is used in cases with large number of regressors. An example using the IEEE 14-bus test system, with wind penetration, illustrates the application.

Abstract: With increasing wind penetration, it is likely that wind power plant will be expected to provide frequency response in support of the power system, in particular some form of inertial response. In these circumstances it is important to accurately quantify the type of inertial response available from wind plant (typically a wind farm) and how it is affected by varying wind conditions. Two different control schemes to provide this "synthetic" inertial response are investigated. The benefits of the non-standard control scheme are demonstrated by comparing the response with the conventional "ideal" inertial control scheme that exactly emulates synchronous generators in terms of their provision of inertial response. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic approach for estimation of the aggregate inertial response available from a wind farm by using a Gaussian probability distribution to model wind turbulence. The aggregate inertial response calculated in this way has been examined at various mean wind speed levels and has the advantage that it automatically takes into account wind speed variations during the transient event itself.

Abstract: A real-time stabilizing control method for responding to N-K contingencies, with large K, is developed utilizing network and machine time-synchronized measurements. The controls follow an optimality principle in driving rotor-angles to an acceptable equilibrium point, at minimum cost, by predicting state response trajectory to a collection of stepped structural changes, from an admissible set, according to a defined model. A cost metric suitable for mitigating rotor-angle instability is developed. Non-idealities in modeling, measurement latency, control availability, and actuation success are investigated. It is shown how control over system structure in a feedback formulation increases the capability to handle higher order contingencies. As an experimental example, a set of simultaneous N-3 transient stability related contingencies are stabilized for the IEEE 39-bus system. Furthermore, the response after control actuation failure is investigated and it is shown that the system remains driven to a valid stable equilibrium point.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal bidding strategy for independent power producers (IPPs) in the deregulated electricity market. The IPPs are assumed to be price takers, whose objectives are to maximize their profits considering price and wind power output uncertainties, while ensuring high wind power utilization. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic price-based unit commitment problem with chance constraints to ensure wind power utilization. In our model, the first stage decision includes unit commitment and quantity of electricity submitted to the day-ahead market. The second stage decision includes generation dispatch, actual usage of wind power, and amount of energy imbalance between the day-ahead and real-time markets. The chance constraint is applied to ensure a certain percentage of wind power utilization so as to comply with renewable energy utilization regulations. Finally, a sample average approximation (SAA) approach is applied to solve the problem, and the computational results are reported for the proposed SAA algorithm showing the sensitivity of the total profit as the requirement of wind power utilization changes.

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of wind power into the power grid, maintaining system reliability has been a challenging issue for ISOs/RTOs, due to the intermittent nature of wind power. In addition to the traditional reserves provided by thermal, hydro, and gas generators, demand response (DR) programs have gained much attention recently as another reserve resource to mitigate wind power output uncertainty. However, the price-elastic demand curve is not exactly known in advance, which provides another dimension of uncertainty. To accommodate the combined uncertainties from wind power and DR, we allow the wind power output to vary within a given interval with the price-elastic demand curve also varying in this paper. We develop a robust optimization approach to derive an optimal unit commitment decision for the reliability unit commitment runs by ISOs/RTOs, with the objective of maximizing total social welfare under the joint worst-case wind power output and demand response scenario. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage robust mixed-integer programming problem. An exact solution approach leveraging Benders' decomposition is developed to obtain the optimal robust unit commitment schedule for the problem. Additional variables are introduced to parameterize the conservatism of our model and avoid over-protection. Finally, we test the performance of the proposed approach using a case study based on the IEEE 118-bus system. The results verify that our proposed approach can accommodate both wind power and demand response uncertainties, and demand response can help accommodate wind power output uncertainty by lowering the unit load cost.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control has the potential to provide frequency regulation service for power system operation from electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, a decentralized V2G control (DVC) method is proposed for EVs to participate in primary frequency control considering charging demands from EV customers. When an EV customer wants to maintain the residual state of charge (SOC) of the EV battery, a V2G control strategy, called battery SOC holder (BSH), is performed to maintain the battery energy around the residual SOC along with adaptive frequency droop control. If the residual battery energy is not enough for next trip, the customer needs to charge the EV to higher SOC level. Then, a smart charging method, called charging with frequency regulation (CFR), is developed to achieve scheduled charging and provide frequency regulation at the same time. Simulations on a two-area interconnected power system with wind power integration have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Prices in electricity markets are given by the dual variables associated with the supply-demand constraint in the dispatch problem. However, in unit-commitment-based day-ahead markets, these variables are not easy to obtain. A common approach relies on re-solving the dispatch problem with the commitment decisions fixed, and utilizing the associated dual variables. This avenue may lead to inadequate revenues to generators, which has led to the introduction of uplift payments made by the market operator for further compensating the generators. An alternative pricing mechanism known as convex hull pricing has been proposed to reduce or eliminate uplift payments. Computation of these prices requires the global maximization of an associated Lagrangian dual problem. In this paper, we present an extreme-point-based procedure for obtaining a global maximizer. Unlike standard subgradient schemes where an arbitrary subgradient is used, we present an extreme-point subdifferential (EPSD) algorithm; this is a novel technique in which the steepest ascent direction is constructed by solving a continuous quadratic program. The EPSD algorithm initiates a move along this direction, employing an a priori constant steplength, with the intent of reaching the boundary of the face. A backtracking scheme selects a steplength that ensures descent with respect to a suitably defined merit function. As most electricity markets today co-optimize energy and reserves, an extension of the proposed convex hull pricing algorithm is provided for such integrated markets. Under suitable assumptions, we compare outcomes of energy-only and energy-reserve co-optimizedmarkets under different pricing and uplift rules. In these examples, pricing rules have a major impact on the total payment while the uplift payment only accounts for a small portion of it. We also observe that it remains unclear whether marginal-cost pricing or convex-hull pricing leads to higher total payment.

Abstract: This paper presents a solution formulti-objective economic dispatch problem with transmission losses semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation. The vector objective is reduced to an equivalent scalar objective through the weighted sum method. The resulting optimization problem is formulated as a convex optimization via SDP relaxation. The convex optimization problem was solved to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions. The diversity of the solution set was improved by a nonlinear selection of the weight factor. Simulations were performed on IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus test systems to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Solutions were compared to those from one of the well-known evolutionary methods. Results show that SDP has an inherently good convergence property and a lower but comparable diversity property.

Abstract: This paper proposes a localmodel network (LMN) for measurement-based modeling of the nonlinear aggregate power system loads. The proposed LMN approach requires no pre-defined standard load model and uses measurement data to identify load dynamics. Furthermore, due to the interesting characteristics of the proposed approach, the LMN is able to have separate and independent linear and nonlinear inputs, determined by the use of prior knowledge. Trained by the newly developed hierarchical binary tree (HBT) learning algorithm, the proposed LMN attains maximum generalizability with the best linear or nonlinear structure. The previous values of the power system voltage and active and reactive powers are considered as the inputs of the LMN. The proposed approach is applied to the artificially generated data and IEEE 39-bus test system. Work on the field measurement real data is also provided to verify the method. The results of modeling for artificial data, the test system and real data confirm the ability of the proposed approach in capturing the dynamics of the power system loads.

Abstract: This paper proposes a day-ahead scheduling model in which the hourly demand response (DR) is considered to reduce the system operation cost and incremental changes in generation dispatch when the ramping cost of thermal generating units is considered as penalty in day-ahead scheduling problem. The power output trajectory of a thermal generating unit is modeled as a piecewise linear function. The day-ahead scheduling is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) problem with quadratic energy balance constraint, ramping cost, and DR constraints. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) based method is applied to solve this problem. Numerical tests are conducted on a 6-bus system and the modified IEEE 118-bus system. The results demonstrate the merits of the proposed scheduling model as well as the impact of introducing ramping costs as penalty and DR as incentives in the day-ahead scheduling of power systems.

Abstract: In this paper a geometrical approach is described to detect, identify, and recover multiple gross errors in power system state estimation. Using the classical WLS estimator, the measurement residuals is computed, and then the error is composed. For the detection and identification of the measurements with gross errors, the composed measurement error in the normalized form (CMEN) is used. The measurement magnitude corrections otherwise are performed using the composed normalized measurement error (CNE). To give support to the detection and identification of the measurements containing gross errors, a generalization of the classical largest normalized residual test is provided.
The IEEE 14-bus system as well as the reduced 45-bus Power System of the Brazil South is used to test the multiple gross error detection, identification, and correction efficiency.

Abstract: High penetration of intermittent renewable energy imposes new challenges to the operation and control of power systems. Power system security needs to be ensured dynamically as the system operating condition continuously changes. The dynamic stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF) control algorithm using the Adaptive Critic Designs (ACDs) has shown promising dynamic power flow control capability and has been demonstrated in a small system. To further investigate the potential of the DSOPF control algorithm for large power systems, a 70-bus test power system with different generation resources, including large wind plants, is developed. A two-level DSOPF control scheme is proposed in this paper to scale up the DSOPF algorithm for this 70-bus system. The lower-level area DSOPF controllers control their own area power network. The top-level global DSOPF controller coordinates the area controllers by adjusting the inter-area tie-line flows. This two-level architecture distributes the control and computation burden to multiple area DSOPF controllers, and reduces the training difficulty for implementing the DSOPF control for a large power network. Simulation studies on the 70-bus power system with large wind variation are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-level DSOPF control scheme.

Abstract: The goal of a unit commitment optimization problem is to reduce the total generation cost as much as possible while satisfying future power demands. Thus, analysis must be performed based on correct predictions of future demands. However, various uncertain factors affect these loadsmaking an exact forecasting unsuccessful. This study mitigates this difficulty by applying fuzzy set theory to evaluate the future uncertain loads. The objective of this research is to build a two-stage multi-objective fuzzy programming model based on 24-hour uncertain load forecasting. The first stage is a decision-making process on the interval data of the imprecise power loads, whereas the second stage pursues the optimization of the unit commitment scheduling, which can help find both optima simultaneously by maximizing power supply reliability and minimizing total generation cost. To define the supply reliability under uncertain forecasting, we propose a new concept of maximal blackout time during successful operation, which is based on the fuzzy credibility theory. Furthermore, as a solution approach to this model, an improved two-stage multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed based on our previous studies. Finally, the performance of this algorithm is discussed in comparison with experimental results from several test systems.

Abstract: Major transmission projects are needed to integrate and to deliver renewable energy (RE) resources. Cost recovery is a serious impediment to transmission investment. A negotiation methodology is developed in this study to guide transmission investment for RE integration. Built on Nash bargaining theory, the methodology models a negotiation between an RE generation company and a transmission company for the cost sharing and recovery of a new transmission line permitting delivery of RE to the grid. Findings from a six-bus test case demonstrate the Pareto efficiency of the approach as well as its fairness, in that it is consistent with one commonly used definition of fairness in cooperative games, the Nash cooperative solution. Hence, the approach could potentially be used as a guideline for RE investors. The study also discusses the possibility of using RE subsidies to steer the negotiated solution towards a system-optimal transmission plan that maximizes total net benefits for all market participants. The findings suggest that RE subsidies can be effectively used to achieve system optimality when RE prices are fixed through bilateral contracts but have limited ability to achieve system optimality when RE prices are determined through locational marginal pricing. This limitation needs to be recognized in the design of RE subsidies.

Abstract: This letter presents a new method for optimal placement of phasor measurement units (PMU) for complete power system observability. The optimal PMU placement (OPP) problem is formulated as a quadratic minimization problem with continuous decision variables subject to nonlinear observability constraints. The optimal solution is obtained by an unconstrained nonlinear weighted least squares (WLS) approach. Simulations are conducted on different IEEE systems (14-bus, 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus) to prove the validity of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage robust optimization approach to solve the N -k contingency-constrained unit commitment (CCUC) problem. In our approach, both generator and transmission line contingencies are considered. Compared to the traditional approach using a given set of components as candidates for possible failures, our approach considers all possible component failure scenarios. We consider the objectives of minimizing the total generation cost under the worst-case contingency scenario and/or the total pre-contingency cost. We formulate CCUC as a two-stage robust optimization problem and develop a decomposition framework to enable tractable computation. In our framework, the master problem makes unit commitment decisions and the subproblem discovers the worst-case contingency scenarios. By using linearization techniques and duality theory, we transform the subproblem into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The most violated inequalities generated from the subproblem are fed back into the master problem during each iteration. Our approach guarantees a globally optimal solution in a finite number of iterations. In reported computational experiments, we test both primal and dual decomposition approaches. Our computational results verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel distributed hierarchical control architecture is proposed for large-scale power systems. The newly proposed architecture facilitates faster and more accurate frequency restoration during primary frequency control, by providing decentralized robust control to several selected pilot generators in each area. At the local level, these decentralized robust controllers are designed to quickly damp oscillations and restore frequency after large faults and disturbances in the system. Incorporating this supplementary governor control helps the system reach the nominal frequency without necessarily requiring secondary frequency control. Thus, at the area level, automatic generation control (AGC) actions are alleviated in terms of conducting frequency restoration. Moreover, at the area level, AGC coordinates with the decentralized robust controllers to successfully perform tie-line power balancing, while efficiently damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations. The interaction of local and area controllers is validated through detailed simulations.

Abstract: Reliability evaluation of composite systems involves extensive calculations. Current solutions to this computational burden have mainly focused on extracting failure states from the state space. Instead, the evaluation of failure states is accelerated by methods presented in this paper. The scale of optimizations required for generation redispatching and/or load shedding in failure states is reduced by eliminating redundant line flow constraints.
First, a sufficient and necessary condition for a line flow constraint to be redundant is established in the form of a linear programming problem, based on the concept of steady-state security region (SSR). Then, two redundancy elimination methods are proposed-a conservative one based on a heuristic, and a radical one based on an analytical condition. Numerical tests are conducted on IEEE-RTS79 and a real-life system. More than half of the line flow constraints are eliminated by the conservative method and nearly 90% by the radical method. The proposed methods can be used in conjunction with most of the existing acceleration techniques to further improve efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the evolution of the probability density function of the dynamic trajectories of a single machine infinite bus power system. The probability density function can be used to determine the impact of random (stochastic) load perturbations on system stability. The evolution of the state probability density function over time leads to several interesting observations regarding stability regions as a function of damping parameter. The Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is used to describe the evolution of the probability density of the states. The FPE is solved numerically using PDE solvers (such as finite difference method). Based on the results, the qualitative changes of the stationary density produce peak-like, ridge-like and other complicated shapes. Lastly, the numerical FPE solution combined with SMIB equivalent techniques lay the framework extended to the multimachine system.

Abstract: The first of this two-paper series proposes a methodology to characterize generation investment equilibria in a pool-based network-constrained electricity market, where the producers behave strategically. To this end, the investment problem of each strategic producer is represented using a bilevel model, whose upper-level problem determines the optimal investment and the supply offering curves to maximize its profit, and whose several lower-level problems represent different market clearing scenarios. This model is transformed into a mathematical program with equilibrium constraint (MPEC) through replacing the lower-level problems by their optimality conditions. The joint consideration of all producer MPECs, one per producer, constitutes an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). To identify the solutions of this EPEC, each MPEC problem is replaced by its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which are in turn linearized. The resulting mixed-integer linear system of equalities and inequalities allows determining the EPEC equilibria through an auxiliary MILP problem.

Abstract: To allow for high penetration of distributed generation and alternative energy units, it is critical to minimize the complexity of generator controls and the need for close coordination across regions. We propose that existing controls be replaced by a two-tier structure of local control operating within a global context of situational awareness. Flatness as an extension of controllability for nonlinear systems is a key to enable planning and optimization at various levels of the grid in this structure. In this study, flatness-based control for automatic generation control (AGC) of a multi-machine system with high penetration of wind energy is investigated. The local control tracks the reference phase which is obtained through economic dispatch at the global control level. As a result of applying the flatness-based method, the machine system is decoupled into linear controllable systems in canonical form. Therefore, the control strategy results in a distributed AGC formulation which is significantly easier to design and implement compared to conventional AGC. Practical constraints such as generator ramping rates can be considered in designing the local controllers. The proposed strategy demonstrates promising performance in mitigating frequency deviations and the overall structure could facilitate operation of other nontraditional generators.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to analyze the impact of dc transmission on self-organized criticality (SOC) of the East China power system (ECPS), which is a large-scale, ac-dc interconnected and classical receiving-end power system. To this end, a detailed ac-dc cascading failure analysis model is established to study the SOC of this system. In the proposed model, some important issues of dc transmission and several kinds of stochastic factors are considered. The corresponding algorithm realized on the platform of the PSS/E software is discussed as well. Simulation based on the 2010 East China ac-dc power system is performed and the following results are obtained: 1) the dc issues such as the operation modes and the control parameters have obvious effects on the SOC of the ac-dc system and 2) the risk of cascading failure and blackout can be decreased by deliberately choosing the dc operation modes and control parameters.

Abstract: Type 3 wind generators in series compensated networks could lead to subsynchronous resonances (SSR). Previous research focuses on balanced operation only. In this paper, impact of unbalance on Type 3 wind energy systems is investigated in two aspects: 1) impact on electric resonances and 2) impact on torsional resonances. In the first aspect, impedance models of the system in DQ domain and phase domain are developed. Particularly, negative sequence impedances are examined. Nyquist stability criterion is applied to detect possible resonances. In the second aspect, transfer functions of the electromagnetic torque versus the rotating speed due to negative sequence components are developed. The impact of negative sequence components on electromechanical damping is then analyzed. The analysis results are verified by time-domain simulation results.

Abstract: This paper proposes a secondary voltage control of microgrids based on the distributed cooperative control of multi-agent systems. The proposed secondary control is fully distributed; each distributed generator only requires its own information and the information of some neighbors. The distributed structure obviates the requirements for a central controller and complex communication network which, in turn, improves the system reliability. Input-output feedback linearization is used to convert the secondary voltage control to a linear second-order tracker synchronization problem. The control parameters can be tuned to obtain a desired response speed. The effectiveness of the proposed control methodology is verified by the simulation of a microgrid test system.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are increasingly popular in the global trend of energy saving and environmental protection. However, the uncoordinated charging of numerous PEVs can produce significant negative impacts on the secure and economic operation of the power system concerned. In this context, a hierarchical decomposition approach is presented to coordinate the charging/discharging behaviors of PEVs. The major objective of the upper-level model is to minimize the total cost of system operation by jointly dispatching generators and electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs). On the other hand, the lower-level model aims at strictly following the dispatching instructions from the upper-level decision-maker by designing appropriate charging/discharging strategies for each individual PEV in a specified dispatching period. Two highly efficient commercial solvers, namely AMPL/IPOPT and AMPL/CPLEX, respectively, are used to solve the developed hierarchical decomposition model. Finally, a modified IEEE 118-bus testing system including 6 EVAs is employed to demonstrate the performance of the developed model and method.

Abstract: Microgrids are able to provide a coordinated integration of the increasing share of distributed generation (DG) units in the network. The primary control of the DG units is generally performed by droop-based control algorithms that avoid communication. The voltage-based droop (VBD) control is developed for islanded low-voltage microgrids with a high share of renewable energy sources. With VBD control, both dispatchable and less-dispatchable units will contribute in the power sharing and balancing. The priority for power changes is automatically set dependent on the terminal voltages. In this way, the renewables change their output power in more extreme voltage conditions compared to the dispatchable units, hence, only when necessary for the reliability of the network. This facilitates the integration of renewable units and improves the reliability of the network. This paper focusses on modifying the VBD control strategy to enable a smooth transition between the islanded and the grid-connected mode of the microgrid. The VBD control can operate in both modes. Therefore, for islanding, no specific measures are required. To reconnect the microgrid to the utility network, the modified VBD control synchronizes the voltage of a specified DG unit with the utility voltage. It is shown that this synchronization procedure significantly limits the switching transient and enables a smooth mode transfer.

Abstract: In current electricity markets of the USA, locational marginal prices (LMPs) are obtained from the economic dispatch process and cannot capture costs associated with commitment decisions. The extended LMPs (ELMPs) were established as the optimal Lagrangian multiplier of the dual of the unit commitment and economic dispatch problem. Commitment related costs are included and uplift payments are minimized. To obtain ELMPs, the dual problem should be solved with multiplier optimality and computational efficiency. Subgradient methods suffer from the multiplier zigzagging difficulty. Cutting plane methods encounter computational complexity issues in calculating query points. In this paper, a subgradient simplex cutting plane method is developed to obtain ELMPs. Transmission is not considered for simplicity, while key features of ELMPs are still captured. By innovatively using subgradients and simplex tableaus, query points are efficiently obtained through an adaptive three-level scheme. A query point along the subgradient is easily calculated at Level 1. As needed, Level 2 obtains Kelley's query point and Level 3 obtains the Chebyshev center, both by pivoting simplex tableaus. Numerical results show that the optimal multiplier is efficiently obtained.

Abstract: Synchrophasor measurements at all the border buses of an area of a power system can be used to effectively decouple the area from the rest of the power system. Calculations combining models and synchrophasor measurements can then be applied using only models of the area and area measurements. We illustrate the decoupling for a line outage detection algorithm.

Abstract: Simulation of cascading blackouts poses many challenges, including fast simulation of long series of rare interactions in large grid models. The splitting method advances the simulation by stages, resampling from each stage to advance to the next stage. We apply the splitting method to the simulation of cascading blackouts to efficiently determine the probability distribution of blackout size. Testing on a blackout simulation shows that splitting can quickly compute large blackouts inaccessible to other methods.

Abstract: An updating study concerning the analysis and modeling of the European Energy Exchange power market in Germany is urgently called for due to the dramatic transformations of the market in recent years. Based on careful data research, this paper provides a consolidated and detailed view concerning the development of the market and its mechanisms. This paper proposes a new analytical model of the merit order curve of the market. The model is designed to capture the occurrences of negative prices. It considers fuel prices and CO2 prices, and by taking into account the structural changes of the market such as the increasing energy in-feed from renewable sources and the moratorium of nuclear power plants in Germany, the model is robust to these changes of market fundamentals. The proposed merit-order-curve model constitutes a critical component in realistic fundamental models for the European Energy Exchange power market.

Abstract: Conventional industrial microgrids (IMGs) consist of factories with distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric loads that rely on combined heat and power (CHP) systems while the developing IMGs are expected to also include renewable DERs and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with different vehicle ratings and charging characteristics. This paper presents an electricity and heat generation scheduling method coordinated with PEV charging in an IMG considering photovoltaic (PV) generation systems coupled with PV storages. The proposed method is based on dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) over a 24-hour period and includes security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF), IMG's factories constraints, PV storage constraints and PEVs dynamic charging constraints. It will utilize the generators waste heat to fulfill thermal requirements while considering the status of renewable DERs to decrease the overall cost of IMGs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, detailed simulation results are presented and analyzed for an 18-bus IMG consisting of 12 factories and 6 types of PEVs without/with PV generation systems operating in grid-connected and stand-alone modes. The main contribution is including PEVs with dynamic constraints that have changed the nature of scheduling formulation from a simple hourly OPF to a dynamic OPF.

Abstract: In addition to long-existing load uncertainty on power systems, continuously increasing renewable energy injections (such as wind and solar) have further made the power grid more volatile and uncertain. Stochastic and recently introduced robust optimization approaches have been studied to provide the day-ahead unit commitment decision with the consideration of real-time load and supply uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce an innovative minimax regret unit commitment model aiming to minimize the maximum regret of the day-ahead decision from the actual realization of the uncertain real-time wind power generation. Our approach will ensure the robustness of the unit commitment decision considering the inherent uncertainty in wind generation. Meanwhile, our approach will provide a system operator a clear picture in terms of the maximum regret value among all possible scenarios. A Benders' decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Finally, our extensive case studies compare the performances of three different approaches (robust optimization, minimax regret, and stochastic optimization) and verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Grid operational challenges are significant to increase securely the wind penetration level. New embedded control functions are therefore required in order to make participate wind generators in power system management. In this paper the implementation of inertial response and primary frequency control in a wind turbine controller are investigated. Main factors affecting the performances of the frequency regulation are identified and characterized. The influence of control parameters and the turbine operating point on the inertial response are analyzed through obtained performances in an islanded power system. The combined control scheme using both controllers is also developed and the potential of the obtained grid service at partial load is discussed.

Abstract: In response to the challenges brought on by the energy conservation based generation dispatch (ECGD) in China, a dynamic economic dispatch model that considers transmission losses (DED-TL) and a new solution framework are proposed to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of generation scheduling. Transmission losses are presented explicitly in the model so that the total energy consumption, consisting of both the generators' operation costs and also the transmission losses, can be well considered. The model is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem that can be solved by commercial solvers. A penalty-based algorithm is proposed to address the virtual transmission loss problem brought on by negative nodal marginal costs. Three cases-a 6-bus system, the IEEE 30-bus system, and a 2746-bus system based on the electric energy system of Poland-are employed in numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the better scheduling results in higher accuracy, and that good computational efficiency can be acquired via the proposed method.

Abstract: A major technical obstacle for rooftop photovoltaics (PV) integration into existing distribution systems is the voltage rise due to the reverse power flow from the distributed PV sources. This paper describes the implementation of a voltage control loop within PV inverters that maintains the voltage within acceptable bounds by absorbing or supplying reactive power. In principle, this can be considered to be a form of distributed Volt/VAr control, which is conventionally performed by coordinated control of capacitor banks and transformer tap changers. Comprehensive simulation studies on detailed feeder models are used to demonstrate that the proposed control scheme will mitigate voltage rises.

Abstract: Fast determination of the transient stability constrained interface power transfer limit is a critical problem in power system real time operation.
Conventional methods normally require repeated time domain simulations to determine this interface transfer limit; therefore, they are computationally burdensome and time consuming. This paper presents an application of the trajectory sensitivity method to determine the transient stability constrained interface transfer limit. For a specified contingency, the trajectory sensitivity method is used to determine the stability constrained maximum output of the key generators that affect the power flow of the interface. Then using the power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs) of those key generators on the tie-lines constituting the interface, the maximum interface transfer increment can be determined. The advantage of this method is that it requires much less computation compared to the conventional methods while having the same level of accuracy.
An application of the proposed method to the WECC test system is presented in detail. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes an investment cost recovery based efficient and reliable optimization approach to optimal allocation of thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) in double auction power market. The optimization technique has been used with an objective to maximizing the social welfare and minimizing the device investment cost by suitable location and rating of single TCSC in the system. The effectiveness of proposed approach for location of TCSC has been compared with some existing methods of single TCSC placement, in terms of its impact on social welfare, TCSC investment recovery and optimal generation as well as load patterns. The results have been obtained on 5-bus system, modified IEEE 14-bus system and 246-bus Indian practical Northern Regional Power Grid (NRPG) system.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient approach to transmission fixed cost allocation in a pool based electricity market that takes into consideration N-1 secure annual system operation. The optimal capacity of a transmission facility is defined as the maximum power flow the facility may face under a contingency situation for a certain system snapshot. In this pricing approach, for each time interval, the largest optimal capacity of a transmission facility is calculated for all N-1 conditions considering a security constrained optimal power flow. Charges for each facility are based on the facility usage of the largest optimal capacity for all time intervals during one or more years. Network usage is determined by generalized distribution factors and three variations of the MW-Mile method for pricing counter-flows are investigated for the proposed cost allocation method. The three proposed pricing methods are applied to the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system and compared with other pricing methods.

Abstract: Power systems around the world have set ambitious targets for renewable energy integration. Several jurisdictions incentivize renewables such as the Feed-in Tariff in Ontario, Canada. These incentives shall eventually run out and renewables would have to competitively sell energy into electricity markets, overcoming uncertainty and variability in their output.
This paper proposes a Wind Generators Cooperative (WGC) model for competitive integration of renewables into energy markets, in the future, overcoming challenges posed by their uncertain and variable nature. The proposed model minimizes the effect of uncertainty and maximizes returns for wind generators. In the proposed WGC model, uncertainty of the total wind power output is reduced by the smoothing effect and using pumped-hydro facilities. Using these pumped-hydro facilities, WGC stores wind energy produced during low marginal price hours and releases it during high marginal price hours.
In this paper, a case study with actual data from Ontario, Canada is presented with detailed sensitivity analyses. Analyses clearly demonstrate that the WGC increases returns to wind generators and reduces their exposure to uncertainty. The study and sensitivity analyses show that the WGC model is financially viable and minimizes output uncertainty.

Abstract: The usage of communication channels introduces time delays into load frequency control (LFC) schemes. Those delays may degrade dynamic performance, and even cause instability, of a closed-loop LFC scheme. In this paper, a delay-dependent robust method is proposed for analysis/synthesis of a PID-type LFC scheme considering time delays. The effect of the disturbance on the controlled output is defined as a robust performance index (RPI) of the closed-loop system. At first, for a preset delay upper bound, controller gains are determined by minimizing the RPI. Secondly, calculation of the RPIs of the closed-loop system under different delays provides a new way to assess robustness against delays and estimate delay margins. Case studies are based on three-area LFC schemes under traditional and deregulated environments, respectively. The results show that the PID-type controller obtained can guarantee the tolerance for delays less than the preset upper bound and provide a bigger delay margin than the existing controllers do. Moreover, its robustness against load variations and parameter uncertainties is verified via simulation studies.

Abstract: The price formation of the Iberian Energy Derivatives Market-the power futures market-starting in July 2006, is assessed until November 2011, through the evolution of the difference between forward and spot prices in the delivery period ("ex-post forward risk premium") and the comparison with the forward generation costs from natural gas ("clean spark spread"). The premium tends to be positive in all existing mechanisms (futures, Over-the-Counter and auctions for catering part of the last resort supplies). Since year 2011, the values are smaller due to regulatorily recognized prices for coal power plants. The power futures are strongly correlated with European gas prices. The spreads built with prompt contracts tend also to be positive. The biggest ones are for the month contract, followed by the quarter contract and then by the year contract. Therefore, gas fired generation companies can maximize profits trading with contracts of shorter maturity.

Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative formulation for the problem of dispatching generation units in a predominantly hydro system considering a medium-term horizon. Hydro-power dispatch is expressed as a equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) and its solutions are compared to the solutions of a classical optimal hydro dispatch problem. A stochastic formulation is used to represent uncertainties in water inflows. Results are presented for realistic test systems with interconnected reservoirs.

Abstract: Large-scale blackouts typically result from cascading failure in power systems operation. Their mitigation in power system planning calls for the development of methods and algorithms that assess the risk of cascading failure due to relay overtripping, short-circuits induced by overgrown vegetation, voltage sags, line and transformer overloading, transient instabilities, voltage collapse, to cite a few. This paper describes such a method based on composite power system reliability evaluation via sequential Monte Carlo simulation. One of the impediments of the study of these phenomena is the prohibitively large computational burden involved by the simulations. To overcome this difficulty, importance sampling technique utilizing the Weibull distribution is applied to power generator outages. Another method combing importance sampling and antithetic variates together is implemented as well. It is shown that both methods noticeably reduce the number of samples that need to be investigated while maintaining the accuracy at a given level. It is found that the combined method outperforms importance sampling to certain extent. To illustrate the developed techniques, two case studies are conducted and analyzed on the IEEE one-area and three-area reliability test system.

Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to design a security-constrained locational marginal pricing framework with specific emphasis on creating clear incentive for the demand side to make participation in serving the reserve option. Both the contingency forms, such as line outage and generator outage, are taken into account. The reserve services from the demand side are identified from the respective energy requests only, based upon a concept of load service security. Different prices are established for generating and load entities. Those are defined as generator and load locational marginal prices (LMPs), respectively. The load LMPs are further differentiated based upon the service security levels requested by different load entities. In the case of any system stress due to security constraints, the load prices go higher for a higher level of service security. Therefore, the necessary price signal is generated to control the service security requests. The prices that are established also resolve the overcharge and underpayment issues involved in the conventional security-constrained market optimizations. The price split that takes place is well characterized to provide clear price signals for future investments. The compatibility of financial transmission rights with the new pricing framework is also addressed.

Abstract: Observability means the aptitude for estimating the system state in its entirety from data currently available. As such, the problem of quantifying this aptitude assumes practical interest. Dealing with observable grids, this paper concentrates on proposing indicators capable of establishing unobservability risks. These indicators are based on measurement criticality analyses (with the aid of Venn diagrams) for a given network configuration. They are obtained in terms of the probability of unobservability, assuming that an event has occurred, such as the unavailability of: a single measurement; one pair of measurements; one k-tuple of measurements; a single metering unit; a single network branch; one pair of network branches. The potential/ practical application of the proposed indicators is illustrated by the introduction of metric patterns, capable of reducing the information on unobservability risks to a single quantity. Numerical results obtained with the IEEE 14- and 118-bus test systems exemplify the computation of the proposed indicators.

Abstract: Electric-vehicle grid integration has the potential to stress distribution network equipment and increase peak consumption, unless properly managed. In this paper, we use dynamic programming to develop a decision support algorithm and market participation policy for a load aggregator (LA) managing the charging of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) connecting at the same distribution network feeder. The LA submits inflexible and flexible bids to a liberalized hour-ahead power market, while monitoring localized feeder and PEV rate constraints. Flexible bids, which include a bid price or utility, can be cleared as regulation service, cleared as energy, or rejected by the market operator. These market events are probabilistically included within the modeling framework. A case study, based on New York independent system operator data, found that the market participation policy may reduce daily electricity costs for PEVs significantly more than is expected through forecasted electricity-price-based scheduling.

Abstract: This paper presents a model for breaker status identification and power system topology estimation based on a mosaic of local auto-associative neural networks. The approach extracts information from values of the analog electric variables and allows the recovery of missing sensor signals or the correction of erroneous data about breaker status. The results are confirmed by extensive tests conducted on an IEEE benchmark network.

Abstract: We propose a branch flow model for the analysis and optimization of mesh as well as radial networks. The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints. Part I introduces our branch flow model, explains the two relaxation steps, and proves the conditions for exact relaxation. Part II describes convexification of mesh networks, and presents simulation results.

Abstract: The paper considers the optimal power flow (OPF) of a meshed AC/DC power transmission network with voltage source converter based multi-terminal DC (VSC-MTDC) networks. The OPF problem is formulated to minimize the transmission loss of the whole AC/DC network with two different VSC control strategies considered, constant DC voltage control (master-slave control) and DC voltage droop control. In addition, Grid Code compliance of wind farms is also embedded in the OPF formulation. The presented OPF is evaluated and demonstrated in the paper by two example meshed AC/DC power systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-objective phasor measurement units (PMUs) placement method in electric transmission grids. Further consideration is devoted to the early PMU placement formulations, to simultaneously determine minimum number of PMUs, as well as maximum measurement redundancy. Moreover, a new methodology is presented for valuation of observability under contingencies, including line outages and loss of PMUs. Furthermore, a generalized observability function is introduced to allocate the PMUs in presence of conventional non-synchronous measurements. The resultant optimization problem is solved using Cellular Learning Automata (CLA), introducing new CLA local rules to improve the optimization process. The developed method is conducted on IEEE standard test systems as well as the Iranian 230- and 400-kV transmission grids, followed by a discussion on results.

Abstract: Voltage violation tends to be one of the dominant constraints or critical factors that limit the penetration of small wind turbines (SWTs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in distribution networks. To quantify the voltage violation, a statistical time series based approach is developed in this paper. The daily time varying characteristics of electric loads, wind speeds and BEV charging loads have been taken into consideration in a statistical manner. The method has been compared with the conventional time series approach. It is proven that the proposed methodology, while providing a global picture on voltage violations, can potentially be used for fast evaluation of the probability of a voltage violation occurring in a network. The methodology has been applied to an example distribution network. Results show that the proposed methodology can reduce the computational requirement by over 98%, while the difference between the results obtained using the proposed method and applying the conventional time series approach is within 12.5%.

Abstract: Fault current profile on a PV-dominated distribution feeder is rather different than a conventional feeder. To estimate the fault current profile on such a feeder, the paper proposes a new method which extends the capability of conventional short-circuit analysis method. The paper also shows that this time-varying fault current profile makes it also more difficult to estimate the time it will take for an overcurrent relay/device to interrupt such a fault current. The paper proposes a method for estimation of this operating time also. Performance of the proposed methods has been assessed by simulations on a sample distribution feeder.

Abstract: This paper presents a new quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) based probabilistic small signal stability analysis (PSSSA) method to assess the dynamic effects of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) in power systems. The detailed dynamic model of PEVs is first proposed for stability study. To account for the stochastic behavior of PEVs and WECSs in load flow studies, the randomized model and probability density function (PDF) representing their nodal power injections are first developed, and then their stochastic injections are sampled by Sobol sequences. Finally, the distribution of system eigenvalues can be obtained by the PSSSA. The proposed QMC-based PSSSA is tested on the modified 2-area 4-machine system and New England 10-generator 39-bus system. Results showed the necessity of modeling of PEVs and WECSs, and validated the efficiency of the proposed QMC.

Abstract: We consider the problem of a wind power producer trading energy in short-term electricity markets. The producer is a price-taker in the day-ahead market, but a price-maker in the balancing market, and aims at optimizing its expected revenues from these market floors. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and cast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved employing off-the-shelf optimization software. The optimal bid is shown to deliver significantly improved performance compared to traditional bids such as the conditional mean or median forecast of wind power distribution. Finally, sensitivity analyses are carried out to assess the impact on the offering strategy of the producer's penetration in the market, of the correlation between wind power production and residual system deviation, and of the shape of the forecast distribution of wind power production.

Abstract: For the nonlinear power flow problem specified with standard PQ, PV, and slack bus equality constraints, we present a sufficient condition under which the specified set of nonlinear algebraic equations has no solution. This sufficient condition is constructed in a framework of an associated feasible, convex optimization problem. The objective employed in this optimization problem yields a measure of distance (in a parameter set) to the power flow solution boundary. In practical terms, this distance is closely related to quantities that previous authors have proposed as voltage stability margins. A typical margin is expressed in terms of the parameters of system loading (injected powers); here we additionally introduce a new margin in terms of the parameters of regulated bus voltages.

Abstract: In this paper, a reliable and efficient methodology based on the recursive Bayesian approach (RBA) and its improved version (SRBA) is proposed for the transformer tap position (TTP) estimation. By recursively computing the posteriori probabilities of all the tap positions of the suspicious transformer, the proposed approach can find the correct TTP reliably. Furthermore, we remarkably improve the computational efficiency of SRBA from the following aspects: 1) reducing the number of transformers to be estimated by identifying suspicious tap positions; 2) proposing a fast prediction-correction algorithm to calculate the residuals; 3) reducing the set including the correct tap position by using a heuristic method during the recursive process; 4) reducing iteration numbers by proposing a stopping criterion with solid theoretical foundation. Simulations are carried on the IEEE 14-bus system and a real power grid of China, illustrating that our methodology is reliable with high efficiency.

Abstract: Vulnerability analysis of a power grid, especially in its static status, is often performed through solving a bi-level optimization problem, which, if solved to optimality, yields the most destructive interdiction plan with the worst loss. As one of the most effective operations to mitigate deliberate outages or attacks, transmission line switching recently has been included and modeled by a binary variable in the lower level decision model. Because this bi-level (or an equivalent min-max) problem is a challenging non-convex discrete optimization problem, no exact algorithm has been developed, and only a few recent heuristic procedures are available. In this paper, we present an equivalent single-level reformulation of this problem, and describe a column-and-constraint generation algorithm to derive the global optimal solution. Numerical study confirms the quality of solutions and the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Discussion and analysis of the mitigation effect of line switching are presented.

Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced model of the STATCOM suitable for steady-state and dynamic simulations of large-scale power systems. It allows for a comprehensive representation of the STATCOM's AC and DC circuits-this is in contrast to current practice where the STATCOM is represented using an equivalent variable voltage source which is not amenable to a proper representation of its DC circuit. The new STATCOM model comprises a voltage source converter (VSC) in series with an LTC transformer. The former is represented by a complex tap-changing transformer whose primary and secondary windings would correspond, in a notional sense, to the VSC's AC and DC buses, respectively. The magnitude and phase angle of the complex tap changer correspond to the amplitude modulation index and the phase shift that would exist in a PWM inverter to enable either reactive power generation or absorption purely by electronic processing of the voltage and current waveforms within the VSC. The numerical technique employed to solve the STATCOM model is the Newton-Raphson method for both operating regimes, the steady-state and the dynamic-state. The latter involves discretization of the STATCOMs and synchronous generators differential equations so that the nonlinear algebraic equations and the discretized differential equations are linearized around a base operating point and assembled together in a unified frame-of-reference for robust iterative solutions.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel approach to the load-frequency control (LFC) of interconnected power systems. Based on functional observers theory, quasi-decentralized functional observers (QDFOs) are designed to implement any given global PI state feedback controller. The designed functional observers are decoupled from each other and also of low-order; thus, they are cost effective and easy to implement. Although the proposed approach is applicable to area power systems, an example of a two-area interconnected power system with reheat thermal turbines is considered for simplicity.

Abstract: Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) is becoming an essential element of many distribution management systems (DMS), serving as the basis of numerous smart grid applications. In this paper, a new DSSE approach is proposed based on the modified augmented nodal analysis formulation, which is known to have advantageous numerical characteristics. Special consideration is given to the estimation of transformer and regulator tap positions, as they are seldom telemetered on the distribution level. The proposed approach can be easily derived from existing power flow and short-circuit calculation algorithms, thus unifying the major steady-state analysis tools for distribution systems. The proposed DSSE algorithm is tested on the IEEE 8500-Node Test Feeder, and is shown to have good accuracy and efficiency. The proposed DSSE approach is also compared to existing algorithms and shown to have better convergence while yielding a more accurate solution.

Abstract: This paper investigates some aspects of stability in microgrids. There are different types of microgrid applications. The system structure and the control topology vary depending on the application and so does the aspect of stability in a microgrid. This paper briefly encompasses the stability aspects of remote, utility connected and facility microgrids depending on the modes of operation, control topology, types of micro sources and network parameters. The small signal, transient and the voltage stability aspects in each type of the microgrid are discussed along with scope of improvements. With a brief review of the existing microgrid control methods in the literature and different industry solutions, this paper sets up an initial platform for different types of microgrids stability assessment. Various generalized stability improvement methods are demonstrated for different types of microgrids. The conventional stability study of microgrids presented in this paper facilitates an organized way to plan the micro source operation, microgrid controller design, islanding procedure, frequency control and the load shedding criteria. The stability investigations are presented with different control methods, eigen value analysis and time domain simulations to justify different claims.

Abstract: This paper explores the feasibility of using the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) in power-system studies in the presence of uncertainties. The application of the PCM is illustrated on small disturbance stability studies and voltage stability studies. First, the PCM is used to determine the effects of a supplementary power oscillation damping (POD) controller installed on a VSC-HVDC line in the presences of parameter and operational uncertainties. Second, it is used to calculate the probabilistic distance to voltage collapse in a distribution system based on measurement errors. The PCM is shown to produce accurate statistical results whilst drastically reducing the computational time of the studies in both cases. Additionally, a ranking process based on eigenvalue sensitivity is presented alongside the small disturbance analysis as an appropriate method for reduction of system complexity for extension to large power systems. This technique is validated through the application of the PCM on a large power-system model, yielding accurate probabilistic results.

Abstract: The deregulation of power systems allows customers to participate in power market operation. In deregulated power systems, nodal price and nodal reliability are adopted to represent locational operation cost and reliability performance. Since contingency reserve (CR) plays an important role in reliable operation, the CR commitment should be considered in operational reliability analysis. In this paper, a CR model based on customer reliability requirements has been formulated and integrated into power market settlement. A two-step market clearing process has been proposed to determine generation and CR allocation. Customers' nodal unit commitment risk and nodal energy interruption have been evaluated through contingency analysis. Customers' reliability cost including reserve service cost and energy interruption cost have also been evaluated.

Abstract: The reliability assessment of future distribution networks is an important subject due to the increasing demand for more reliable service with a lower frequency and duration of interruption. The connection of future distribution networks may not be simple radial circuits and analyzing the reliability of such a network is usually complicated and time consuming. In this paper, a technical approach for evaluating the reliability of a networked distribution system is described. The proposed algorithm is based on the identification of circuit minimal tie sets using the concept of Petri nets. Prime number encoding and unique prime factorization are then applied to classify the remaining combinations as tie sets, cut sets, or minimal cut sets. A Markov model is used to compute the availability and failure frequency of the network. A well-known test bed [the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS)] is used to illustrate the analysis and calculate different load and system reliability indices, including SAIFI and SAIDI. The method shown is algorithmic and appears suitable for offline comparisons of alternative secondary distribution system designs on the basis of their reliability.

Abstract: Paper presents an equivalent model of an active distribution network cell (ADNC) with distributed generation for transmission system stability studies. The equivalent model of ADNC comprises a converter-connected generator and a composite load model in parallel. The gray-box approach was chosen as it enables inclusion of prior knowledge about the ADNC structure into the model development, hence making the model more physically relevant and intuitive than a black-box or white-box model. The dynamic equivalent model is presented in a seventh-order nonlinear quasi state space format, developed from the algebraic and differential equations describing assumed typical components of the ADNC. The developed equivalent model of ADNC was validated through small and large disturbance studies using the modified IEEE nine-bus transmission system model.

Abstract: With the constant k(opt) model under the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategy, wind power fluctuation from the doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) increases the operational risk. With given wind speed, the constant k(opt) model with variable slip yields impractical power output. The power loss and the active output of DFIGs are dependent on power flow of the system. The reference power may be dissatisfied by low wind speed, thus effectiveness of power regulation is unknown before solving power flow equations of the system and the DFIGs. In this paper, power flow model for DFIGs under regulation is newly proposed. Constraints of the power system and DFIGs are solved together to quantify the maximum output and verify if the power settings are satisfied. The DFIGs under effective regulation are seen as PQ buses. Power flow analysis is executed again to find the stator voltages. With the power outputs and the stator voltage, the effectively regulated DFIGs are finally solved. Modified flat start is proposed to improve the convergence. The proposed model reduces efficiency of the DFIGs but shows prospect of dispatching the wind power.

Abstract: With wind penetration levels increasing in power systems, it will be necessary for system planners to have a better understanding of their systems and make best use of the mitigation tools that already present in the system. Particularly, in order to maintain rotor angle stability with high penetrations of wind generation, it will be critical for system planners to utilize the built-in reactive power controls of modern variable speed wind turbines. This paper develops a comprehensive system planning methodology that assesses the characteristics of a given system and identifies nodes that are critical to the rotor stability of the system. This is achieved by utilizing small-signal analysis to identify wind farm locations that participate significantly from an electro-mechanical perspective and implemented by using the built-in controls of the turbine to control voltage at these nodes. By controlling the voltage at these specific locations, the magnitude and damping of oscillatory modes that arise following a loss of a generator can be significantly improved. Furthermore, it will demonstrate that the selective implementation of reactive power control does not degrade the voltage stability of the system for a large system disturbance.

Abstract: This paper presents the analyzed results of an integrated offshore wind and seashore wave farm fed to an onshore power grid through a unified power flow controller (UPFC) to simultaneously achieve power-fluctuation mitigation and stability improvement. The performance of the studied offshore wind farm (OWF) is simulated by an equivalent aggregated 100-MW doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) while the characteristics of the studied seashore wave farm (SWF) are simulated by an equivalent aggregated 60-MW squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG). A damping controller of the proposed UPFC is designed by using modal control theory to render adequate damping characteristics to the studied system. A frequency-domain approach based on a linearized system model using eigenvalue analysis and a time-domain scheme based on a nonlinear system model subject to disturbance conditions are systematically carried out. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the proposed UPFC joined with the designed damping controller can effectively stabilize the studied integrated OWF and SWF under various disturbance conditions. The inherent power fluctuations injected to the power grid can also be effectively mitigated by the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: Dynamic modeling of a power system is fundamental to its safe operation and control. With the development of wide-area measurement system (WAMS) and low level probing tests, it is feasible to estimate a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model of a power system without large disturbances. In practice, outputs during the low level probing tests consist of measurement noise, system noise and probing responses. Before applying a field experiment of MIMO modeling, noise influence to the system modeling as well as applicability of existed identification methods should be examined. In this paper, four kinds of subspace methods are carefully compared for their applicability in power systems' MIMO modeling with low level probing test. Results with different noise conditions explore the noise influence and the suitable methods for field experiment. Monte Carlo method is used for statistic analysis in a small system and conclusions are validated in a large complex system, China Southern Grid.

Abstract: The charging flexibility of electric vehicles (EV) when aggregated by a market agent creates an opportunity for selling manual reserve in the electricity market. This paper describes a new optimization algorithm for optimizing manual reserve bids. Furthermore, two operational management algorithms covering alternative gate closures (i.e., day-ahead and hour-ahead) are also described. These operational algorithms coordinate EV charging for mitigating forecast errors. A case-study with data from the Iberian electricity market and synthetic EV time series is used for evaluating the algorithms.

Abstract: With high wind-power penetration, power-system operators require accurate wind-power output from wind farms for system operation. A more accurate four-dimension wind speed model is proposed in this paper to simulate the effects of terrain and time delay of wind speed. Two coordinate transformation matrices are proposed to easily incorporate wind direction in wind-speed simulation. The effects of random failures and wake of wind turbine generators on wind-speed distribution in a wind farm are also considered in the proposed model. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation technique is developed to evaluate adequacy of power systems with wind farms using the proposed model. The modified IEEE RTS is analyzed to illustrate the models and technique. The simulation results show that those factors have significant impact on power output of a wind farm and system reliability.

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated controller to regulate the terminal voltage of generators as well as to mitigate power system oscillations, instead of employing the combination of the conventional power system stabilizer and automatic voltage regulator. This intelligent controller is an online trained self-recurrent wavelet neural network controller (OTSRWNNC). To achieve the aforementioned objectives, two control errors are simultaneously minimized by updating the parameters of OTSRWNNC. In addition, the adaptive learning rates derived by the discrete Lyapunov theory are used to enhance the convergence speed of proposed controller. The proposed controller does not require any identifier to approximate the dynamic of controlled power system, because of its high learning ability. The performance of proposed controller is evaluated on a single-machine infinite-bus power system and two large power systems. Simulation results and comparative studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed controller in stabilizing power systems in a wide range of loading conditions and different disturbances.

Abstract: This paper presents three algorithms for identification of dominant inter-area oscillation paths: a series of interconnected corridors in which the highest content of the inter-area modes propagates through. The algorithms are developed to treat different sets of data: 1) known system model; 2) transient; and 3) ambient measurements from phasor measurement units (PMUs). These algorithms take feasibility into consideration by associating the network variables made available by PMUs, i.e., voltage and current phasors. All algorithms are demonstrated and implemented on a conceptualized Nordic Grid model. The results and comparison among three algorithms are provided. The applications of the algorithms not only facilitate in revealing critical corridors which are mostly stressed but also help in indicating relevant feedback input signals and inputs to mode meters which can be determined from the properties of dominant paths.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive and general nonlinear control/power management strategy for both converter- and synchronous-machine-based units in microgrids. The proposed controller offers the following advantages as compared to previously reported controllers: 1) It can fulfill requirements of both islanded and grid connected microgrids without a need for reconfiguration; 2) the controller-manager adopts cascaded angle, frequency and power control loops, which give enhanced power sharing accuracy and nominal-frequency operation at steady-state conditions (i.e., permanent frequency drop is eliminated); 3) the controller provides an emulated performance of synchronous machines with controllable damping and synchronization power components, which provide additional degrees of freedom to improve the dynamic performance of the system and easy integration in systems with multiple converters synchronous machines; 4) the controller is equipped with a nonlinear supplementary controller to mitigate large power angle swings associated with large-signal disturbances; 5) the controller can be easily adapted to conventional synchronous machines; and 6) the controller provides seamless operation under out-of-phase reclosing. The proposed controller can realize the concept of plug-and-play of DG units and micrgrids in smart power environment. The effectiveness of the controller to damp power oscillations and ensure system seamless performance in a wide range of operating conditions is validated by simulation results under various microgrid operating scenarios.

Abstract: Investment in distributed generation (DG) is an attractive distribution planning option for adding flexibility to an expansion plan, mainly by deferring network reinforcements. In this first part of a two-part paper, a risk-based optimization approach is proposed to model a multistage distribution expansion planning problem that takes DG into account as a flexible option to temporarily defer large network investments. Five features of the installation of DG related to location, size, type, operation and timing are all optimized. The evolutionary particle swarm optimization (EPSO) method is applied to solve this mixed integer nonlinear problem. A return-per-risk index is proposed to assess expansion investments. This index achieves an efficient synergy between the expected return and the risk of investments by performing Monte Carlo simulations. In turn, the flexibility of network investment deferral is assessed through a real option valuation. Finally, in order to quantify the investment deferral benefit, the expected return from a traditional expansion plan (without DG) is compared to the return obtained from a flexible expansion plan (with DG). In the companion paper, the proposed approach is tested on a typical Latin American distribution network; implementation aspects and analysis of numerical results are presented.

Abstract: Illegal use of electric energy is a widespread practice in many parts of the world. Smart metering enables the improvement of customer load model, theft and stressed asset detections. In this paper, a state estimation based approach for distribution transformer load estimation is exploited to detect meter malfunction/tampering and provide quantitative evidences of non-technical loss (NTL). A measure of overall fit of the estimated values to the pseudo feeder bus injection measurements based on customer metering data aggregated at the distribution transformers is used to localize the electricity usage irregularity. Following the state estimation results, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to create a suspect list of customers with metering problems and estimate the actual usage. Typical Taiwan Power Company (TPC) distribution feeder data are used in the tests. Results of NTL detection under meter defect and energy theft scenarios are presented. Experiences indicate that the proposed scheme can give a good trace of the actual usage at feeder buses and supplement the current meter data validation estimation and editing (VEE) process to improve meter data quality.

Abstract: In this paper a blackout model that considers the slow process at the beginning of blackouts is proposed based on the improved ORNL-PSerc-Alaska (OPA) model. It contains two layers of iteration. The inner iteration, which describes the fast dynamics of the system, simulates the power system cascading failure, including the tree contact and failure of lines caused by heating. The simulation of protective relays and the dispatching center is also improved to make it closer to practical conditions. The outer iteration, which describes the long-term slow dynamics of the system, adds the simulation of tree growth and utility vegetation management (UVM). Typical blackout process with slow process is simulated on the Northeast Power Grid of China and self-organized criticality (SOC) characteristic of this system is analyzed with the proposed model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by the simulation results.

Abstract: The paper presents a new control strategy to enhance the ability of reactive power support of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine during serious voltage dips. The proposed strategy is an advanced low voltage ride through (LVRT) control scheme, with which a part of the captured wind energy during grid faults is stored temporarily in the rotor's inertia energy and the remaining energy is available to the grid while the DC-link voltage and rotor current are kept below the dangerous levels. After grid fault clearance, the control strategy ensures smooth release of the rotor's excessive inertia energy into the grid. Based on these designs, the DFIG's reactive power capacity on the stator and the grid side converter is handled carefully to satisfy the new grid code requirements strictly. Simulation studies are presented and discussed.

Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of a spoofing attack on the GPS receiver of a phasor measurement unit (PMU). We formulate the attack as an optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the difference between the PMU's receiver clock offset (with respect to the GPS time measured by the onboard satellite clocks) before and after the attack. Since the PMU uses this clock offset to compute a synchronized time stamp for its measurements, an error in the receiver clock offset introduces a proportional phase error in the voltage or current phase measurements provided by the PMU. For the most general case, the decision variables in the optimization problem are the satellites' ephemerides, pseudoranges, and the receiver's Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates. The constraints are cast such that the decision variables and the satellite positions computed from the solution of the optimization problem are close to their pre-attack values, so as to avoid possible detection schemes that check for large jumps in the values of these variables. We show that the spoofing attack is feasible for any number of visible satellites. As an illustration of the impact of such spoofing attacks, we present simulation results in which the attack induces errors in a real-time voltage stability monitoring algorithm that relies on the phase information from measurements provided by PMUs.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of the dynamic equivalent model of an active distributed network (ADN) based on the grey-box approach. The equivalent model of an ADN comprises a converter-connected generator and a composite load model in parallel. The grey-box approach was chosen for model development as it incorporates prior knowledge about the ADN structure into the model, makes the model more physically relevant and intuitive than black-box or white-box models, and potentially improves the accuracy of the model. The dynamic equivalent model is presented in the seventh-order nonlinear state space format. It was initially loosely developed from the algebraic and differential equations describing assumed typical components of an ADN. Various static load models, dynamic load compositions, fault locations and a diverse range of distributed generation types and scenarios are considered in order to establish the generic range of model parameters for an ADN. The model is intended for the use in large power system stability studies.

Abstract: This paper proposes the use of two indicators of the predictability of the load series along with an accuracy value such as mean average percentage error as standard measures of load forecasting performance. Over the last 10 years, there has been a significant increase in load forecasting models proposed in engineering journals. Most of these models provide a description of the inner design of the model, the results from applying this model to a specific data base and the conclusions drawn from this application. However, a single accuracy value may not be sufficient to describe the performance of the model when applied to other data bases. The aim of this paper is to provide researchers with a tool that is able to assess the predictability of a load series and, therefore, contextualize the forecasting accuracy reported. Nine different data bases from the U. S. have been used; all of them include hourly load and temperature data.

Abstract: This paper introduces, formulates and evaluates an approach for damping inter-area oscillations of power systems based on supplementary current control of a line-commutated HVDC link. The proposed control is based on the model predictive control (MPC) strategy. The salient feature of the MPC as compared with other optimal control strategies, e. g., the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, is that it adjusts the control signal to achieve the objectives while explicitly respecting the plant constraints. This paper also compares the performance of the MPC with that of the LQG control. The two approaches are tested on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system and the IEEE 14-bus system. Small-signal disturbance and large-signal disturbance stability studies are performed to demonstrate and compare the performances of the LQG and MPC methodologies. The study results show the effective and superior performance of the MPC for damping poorly damped oscillatory modes of the test systems.

Abstract: The functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is a recent tool in multivariate statistics and it has been shown to be effective for electricity price forecasting. However, its online implementation is expensive, which requires the computation of eigen-decomposition at each update. To reduce the arithmetic complexity, we propose a recursive dynamic factor analysis (RDFA) algorithm where the PCs are recursively tracked using efficient subspace tracking algorithm while the PC scores are further tracked and predicted recursively using Kalman filter (KF). From the latter, the covariance and hence the interval of the forecasted electricity price can be estimated. Advantages of the proposed RDFA algorithm are the low online complexity, and the availability of the prediction interval thanks to the KF framework. Furthermore, a robust extension is proposed to tackle possible non-Gaussian variation. Finally, the RDFA algorithm can be extended to predict electricity price in a longer period using a multi-factor model by capturing trends in different time horizon. Experimental results on the New England and Australian datasets show that the proposed RDFA approach is able to achieve better prediction accuracy than other conventional approaches. It thus serves as an attractive alternative to other conventional approaches to forecast electricity price and other related applications because of its low complexity, efficient recursive implementation and good performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a transmission planning model for a system integrating a large amount of remote wind power. We consider uncertainties of wind availability and system load, which are represented by two dependent random variables in the optimization problem. A two-stage stochastic model and sequential approximation approach are applied to solve our total cost minimization problem, which involves a sequence of stochastic optimization problems repeatedly solved with an updated approximation of random parameters until the rate of increment of optimal cost becomes smaller than a positive target value. A wind energy integration goal is achieved by penalizing wind curtailment. As a case study, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) wind and load data, and a simplified model of its transmission system, is employed.

Abstract: We consider a strategic producer that trades its energy in a multi-period network-constrained electricity pool and, for strategic reasons, is interested in identifying its rival producers' offer prices. Considering industry practice, we assume that the strategic producer has knowledge of the daily market outcomes, i.e., energy quantities sold/bought and resulting locational marginal prices (LMPs) for each time period and all nodes of the network. Using this information we formulate an inverse optimization problem that allows estimating the rival producers' offer prices that have been marginal at any of the time periods under study. Such problem is well behaved, effectively identifies rival offer prices and can be efficiently solved. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is illustrated through a simple example and a realistic case study.

Abstract: There are two operation modes of microgrids: grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode. Normally, a microgrid will be connected to the main grid for the majority of time, i.e., operates in the grid-connected mode. In the stand-alone mode, a microgrid is isolated from the main grid; the highest priority for microgrids is to keep a reliable power supply to customers instead of economic benefits. So, the objectives and energy management strategies are different in two modes. In this paper, a novel double-layer coordinated control approach for microgrid energy management is proposed, which consists of two layers: the schedule layer and the dispatch layer. The schedule layer obtains an economic operation scheme based on forecasting data, while the dispatch layer provides power of controllable units based on real-time data. Errors between the forecasting and real-time data are resolved through coordination control of the two layers by reserving adequate active power in the schedule layer, then allocating that reserve in the dispatch layer to deal with the indeterminacy of uncontrollable units. A typical-structure microgrid is studied as an example, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed double-layer coordination control method in both grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode.

By coordinating individual decision-making of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the virtual power plant (VPP) via limited communication, the profit of VPP can be maximized. It can be proven that the proposed distributed algorithm has similar performance to the centralized dispatch.

Abstract: It is common for many induction motors to be connected to a load bus, and voltage can sometimes quickly collapse when an initial disturbance triggers a cascade of motors stalling. We analyze a single line power system supplying a bus with many induction motors. Variation and uncertainty in the motor load is modeled probabilistically. We describe an analytic method to estimate the parameters of a model of cascading failure from system parameters, and hence estimate the probabilities of the number of motors stalled. The analytic method gives insights into cascading stall and relates system parameters to the risk of cascading stall.

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to provide an analytical study on the statistical behaviors of the electricity price at various conditions of the load and the network. In order to achieve this goal, a novel two-step modeling is proposed for the electricity price. At the first step, it is proved that there is a linear relationship between the locational marginal prices (LMP) and the strategies of generating companies (GenCos). In this linear relationship, the LMP is decomposed to the weighted summation of the strategies of marginal units plus constant value. At the second step, the LMP is modeled by classic central limit theorem (CLT). Using this model an analytical relationship is derived between the price discovery mechanism and characteristics of its probability density function (pdf). As a result, this paper shows analytically that increasing system load causes the price pdf deviates from the normal distribution. On the other hand, by decreasing system load, the electricity price distribution tends toward the normal distribution. The statistical studies on the real power markets data confirm these analytical results. Furthermore, the simulation results of the IEEE 300-bus test system illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model.

Abstract: The marginal value of transmission lines in the dispatch is widely used in the literature and has relevant practical applications related to planning the expansion of the transmission grid and computing the remuneration of merchant lines. This paper presents a general formulation of the marginal value of a line in the dispatch that highlights the dependence of this value on the link between line admittance and capacity. We discuss the value of a line according to marginal principles following a general approach and prove that only if the admittance of a line can be expressed as a linear function of its capacity, or when admittance and capacity can be deemed independent, is this value equal to the product of the difference between marginal electricity prices at both ends of the line and the flow through this line. Afterwards, we show that under a set of stylized conditions the remuneration of efficient network investments according to their marginal value in the dispatch should result in an exact recovery of their cost. Finally, we compute the marginal value of lines in a stylized, though representative, system for several relationships between line capacities and admittances to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.

Abstract: In this paper, the simulation results of using a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) to achieve damping improvement of an offshore wind farm (OWF) fed to amulti-machine system is presented. The operating performance of the studied OWF is simulated by an equivalent aggregated doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) driven by an equivalent aggregated wind turbine (WT) through an equivalent gearbox. A PID damping controller and a hybrid PID plus fuzzy logic controller (FLC) of the proposed STATCOM are designed to contribute adequate damping characteristics to the dominant modes of the studied system under various operating conditions. A frequency-domain approach based on a linearized system model using root-loci technique and a time-domain scheme based on a nonlinear system model subject to a three-phase short-circuit fault at the connected bus are systematically performed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes. It can be concluded from the comparative simulated results that the proposed STATCOM joined with the designed hybrid PID plus FLC is shown to be superior for improving the stability of the studied system subject to a severe disturbance than the PID controller.

Abstract: We propose a branch flow model for the analysis and optimization of mesh as well as radial networks. The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints. Part I introduces our branch flow model, explains the two relaxation steps, and proves the conditions for exact relaxation. Part II describes convexification of mesh networks, and presents simulation results.

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed for forecasting load for normal days. Modeling of anomalous load, however, has often been ignored in the research literature. Occurring on special days, such as public holidays, anomalous load conditions pose considerable modeling challenges due to their infrequent occurrence and significant deviation from normal load. To overcome these limitations, we adopt a rule-based approach, which allows incorporation of prior expert knowledge of load profiles into the statistical model. We use triple seasonal Holt-Winters-Taylor (HWT) exponential smoothing, triple seasonal autoregressive moving average (ARMA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and triple seasonal intraweek singular value decomposition (SVD) based exponential smoothing. These methods have been shown to be competitive for modeling load for normal days. The methodological contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how these methods can be adapted to model load for special days, when used in conjunction with a rule-based approach. The proposed rule-based method is able to model normal and anomalous load in a unified framework. Using nine years of half-hourly load for Great Britain, we evaluate point forecasts, for lead times from one half-hour up to a day ahead. A combination of two rule-based methods generated the most accurate forecasts.

Abstract: Previous studies of distributed power and network focused only on the optimization of either the microgrid load dispatch or reconfiguration power loss. Micorgrid economic load dispatch approach normally does not support distribution network. Network reconfiguration usually does not take distributed generators into consideration. Thus, it is necessary to integrate these two sub-problems together in order to benefit the whole network. In this paper, an integrated solution that takes care of both microgrid load dispatch and network reconfiguration is proposed. The stochastic nature of wind, PV and load is taken into consideration. The forecasting of the wind, PV and load data are considered. The four bio-inspired optimization schemes are adopted to solve the problem. The results obtained have shown that the four optimization techniques are all capable of solving this problem. By using the integrated approach, microgrid can be incorporated into the network more effectively. The network can adjust itself more efficiently to allow utilization of the renewable energy resources.

Abstract: This paper models large pumped hydro energy storage in a future power system where variable generation, primarily in the form of wind generation, is the dominant source of power generation. The research question posed is how to formulate day-ahead and week-ahead reservoir targets for pumped hydro energy storage in the context of wind forecast uncertainty. The innovation in the work is the use of historical wind data series and wind forecasts to derive a management strategy for the operation of large PHES using stochastic optimization that outperforms current methods in power systems with significant wind generation. This approach derives intertemporal targets for large pumped hydro energy storage that reduce overall system costs when compared to targets derived using a conventional method.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of the optimal micro-siting of the wind turbines in large offshore wind power plants with the aim of maximizing the economic profitability of the project. To achieve this goal it is first necessary to estimate the required investment and, secondly, the yearly operation and maintenance costs as well as the yearly income resulting from the operation of the wind power plant over its life span. With this purpose, a complete and realistic model of economic behavior for offshore wind farms has been developed.
The optimal turbines layout of a wind farm is a challenge both from a mathematical and technological point of view. The size of the solution space (computational complexity) of the problem addressed in this work dramatically increases with an increase in size of the wind farm. In order to address this difficulty, a new and computationally efficient algorithm is proposed. The method is based in the division of available marine plot in smaller areas of suitable size, sequentially optimized by an improved genetic algorithm.

Abstract: The optimal reactive dispatch problem is a nonlinear programming problem containing continuous and discrete control variables. Owing to the difficulty caused by discrete variables, this problem is usually solved assuming all variables as continuous variables, therefore the original discrete variables are rounded off to the closest discrete value. This approach may provide solutions far from optimal or even unfeasible solutions. This paper presents an efficient handling of discrete variables by penalty function so that the problem becomes continuous and differentiable. Simulations with the IEEE test systems were performed showing the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: For a droop-controlledmicro-grid, it is essential to design the droop coefficients for the inverter controllers in a rational way since they have great influences on the operation characteristics of the system. In this paper, a novel approach based on matrix perturbation theory is proposed for the coordinated optimization of the droop coefficients in inverter controllers. Rigorous perturbation analysis is applied to the droop coefficients to identify their influence on the system state matrix. Furthermore, the increments of the eigensolutions are obtained based on the matrix perturbation theory and are then utilized in the iterative parameter-optimization process. An eigenvalue-based objective function is proposed, aimed at ensuring the stability of the system, enhancing the damping characteristics, and maintaining the stability margin for a wide range of operating conditions. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are tested via a low-voltage micro-grid prototype.

Abstract: Power generation through wind is expected to play a major role in the world's future energy portfolio. Nevertheless, wind power integration remains a challenging research area due to the special characteristics of wind power generation. Specifically, offshore wind has received significant attention worldwide due to the vast generation potential available. The electrical infrastructure of offshore wind farms is thus of significant importance. The multi-terminal HVDC solution represents a preferable solution and has shown promise in solving wind farm interconnection problems. Droop control techniques have been proposed as a means to regulate the DC voltage and facilitate the automatic coordination between different converters without the need for fast communication between units. Different methodologies have been developed to select the droop gains to satisfy the system performance specifications. In this work, a control design methodology is proposed for power sharing among the multi-terminal HVDC feeders providing that the power transmission efficiency is optimized. A simulation study on a 400-kV/1000-MW four-terminal HVDC transmission topology is conducted to ensure the validity of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model for residential electricity demand. Consumer load is modeled in two parts. A low frequency model uses a compact Fourier series to represent slowly changing diurnal loads. Cluster analysis is applied to identify particular load classes and a load classifier based upon quadratic discriminant functions is developed. Once the low frequency load components are removed a high frequency residual load remains. This component is modeled using a power spectrum representation. The load modeling approach was used to model consumption on high demand days for households within the Perth Solar City high photovoltaic penetration feeder trials. The load models were successfully validated against physical data sets with respect to load aggregation behaviors and load cumulative probability functions.

Abstract: Situation awareness is a key factor in preserving power system security, as it enables effective and timely decision-making and reactions by the operators to an incident. Insufficient situation awareness results in a delayed, incorrect or deficient response, endangering power system stability. This factor was actually identified as one of the main causes of several electrical disturbances in the last decade. This paper identifies numerous factors that govern the formation of situation awareness in a power system control center. A multi-state model based on Markov modeling is proposed for assessing the impact of insufficient situation awareness on the probability of power system blackouts. The proposed model considers the level of situation awareness and the state of the information infrastructure. The workings of this model are illustrated using the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System.

Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that analyzing the subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) damping effectiveness of an induction machine damping unit (IMDU) only based on its torque-slip characteristic curve is not adequate. A method to directly calculate the electrical damping of an IMDU according to its parameters, which is fast and accurate, is developed. This direct calculation method makes it possible to carry out parameter optimization of the IMDU by genetic algorithms. This paper also demonstrates that the electrical damping of IMDU in the subsynchronous frequency range can be significantly increased by raising its rated frequency. In addition, the voltage-source inverter used to drive the IMDU and raise the frequency can provide a constant magnitude terminal voltage for the IMDU during disturbances. The SSO damping effectiveness of the IMDU after parameter optimization and frequency raise is verified by eigenvalue analysis, electrical damping analysis and time-domain simulation.

Abstract: Branching processes can be applied to simulated cascading data to describe the statistics of the cascades and quickly predict the distribution of blackout sizes. We improve the procedures for discretizing load shed data so that a Galton-Watson branching process may be applied. The branching process parameters such as average propagation are estimated from simulated cascades and the branching process is then used to estimate the distribution of blackout size. We test the estimated distributions with line outage and load shed data generated by the improved OPA and AC OPA cascading simulations on the IEEE 118-bus system and the Northeast Power Grid of China.

Abstract: The paper presents a new model of the VSC-HVDC aimed at power flow solutions using the Newton-Raphson method. Each converter station is made up of the series connection of a voltage source converter (VSC) and its connecting transformer which is assumed to be a tap-changing (LTC) transformer. The new model represents a paradigm shift in the way the fundamental frequency, positive sequence modeling of VSC-HVDC links are represented, where the VSCs are not treated as idealized, controllable voltage sources but rather as compound transformer devices to which certain control properties of PWM-based inverters may be linked-just as DC-to-DC converters have been linked, conceptually speaking, to step-up and step-down transformers. The VSC model, and by extension that of the VSC-HVDC, takes into account, in aggregated form, the phase-shifting and scaling nature of the PWM control. It also takes into account the VSC inductive and capacitive reactive power design limits, switching losses and ohmic losses.

Abstract: Inter-zonal trading in multi-area power system (MAPS) improves the market efficiency and the system reliability by sharing the resources (energy and reserve services) across zonal boundaries. Actually, each area can operate with less reserve resources than would normally be required for isolated operation. The aim of this work is to propose a model that includes the problem of optimal spinning reserve (SR) provision into the security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) formulation based on the reliability criteria for a MAPS. The loss of load probability (LOLP) and the expected load not served (ELNS) are evaluated as probabilistic metrics in the case of a multi-control zone power system. Moreover, we demonstrate how these criteria can be explicitly incorporated into the market-clearing formulation. The non-coincidental nature of spinning reserve requirement across the zonal boundary is effectively modeled. Two system cases including a small-scale (six-bus) test system and the IEEE reliability test system (IEEE-RTS) are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented model.

Abstract: Power system damping in the transient condition generally depends on system parameters and modeling hypotheses. The dependence can be very nonlinear. In this paper, a polynomial approximation method is proposed to obtain a representation of the damping torque and damping torque coefficient of the original detailed stability model.
Investigation on the single-machine-infinite-bus system reveals that the damping torque coefficient is not a constant in transient condition. The generator parameters relative to transient loss have significant impact on transient damping. In addition, the impact from excitation system, load, transmission line and modeling hypotheses are also investigated. It is found that the influences of torque-speed characteristics and network transients on transient damping are very small. This work provides insight in identifying the main factors that affect power system transient behavior. These factors are useful to build appropriate models for transient stability analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a system, PSDiagnosis, designed to automate the analysis of Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data for the assessment of power system protection performance. The model-based system exploits the theory of diagnosis through use of the General Diagnostic Engine (GDE). Models of protection devices combined with the GDE provide the ability to diagnose the maloperation of protection equipment: including multiple faults, missing alarms and new or previously unknown faults. The base requirements were determined in conjunction with a transmission system operator within the U. K. with a major task identified in reducing software maintenance while maintaining an accurate diagnostic result. The novel approaches taken in this system include the provision of dynamically configurable protection device models for reuse on a multitude of different network connections and the modification of the GDE to identify the occurrence of missing alarms. The approach taken ensures that the system is easy to update as the network, equipment and data formats evolve. This paper discusses the requirements, development and application of PSDiagnosis to the transmission network and the experience and results gained from the implementation of an online prototype.

Abstract: One of the most important applications of phasor measurement units (PMUs) is dynamic stability assessment. PMUs should be placed on the buses which can provide the most effective information for assessing dynamic stability. Usually, PMU placement problem is solved such that the system becomes fully observable. This paper proposes a technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to define the role of each placement in dynamic stability assessment and find the best PMU places to achieve this goal. Since observability is still a very important factor, the integer linear programming method is used to solve the optimal PMU placement problem for full system observability. Then, two algorithms are suggested to rank the PMU places according to their effect on dynamic stability which is assessed by the Prony analysis. The SVD of the Prony matrix is an index for finding the role of each placement. The suggested method is tested on the New England 39-bus test system. The optimal PMU placement problem for full observability results in nine PMUs. The PMU places are ranked according to their effect on dynamic stability.

Abstract: The expansion plan obtained from a DC model based transmission expansion planning (TEP) model could be problematic in the AC network because the DC model is potentially inaccurate. However, solving TEP problems using the AC model is still extremely challenging. The motivation for this work is to develop a less relaxed network model, based on which more realistic TEP solutions are obtained. The proposed TEP model includes a linear representation of reactive power, off-nominal bus voltage magnitudes and network losses. Binary variables are added to avoid fictitious losses. Garver's 6-bus system is used to compare the proposed TEP model with the existing models. An iterative approach for considering the N - 1 criterion during the planning process is developed and demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed TEP model provides a better approximation to the AC network and is applicable to large power system planning problems.

Abstract: This paper introduces an accurate and computationally efficient reduced-order dynamic equivalent of a Type-4-based wind power plant (WPP) for the analysis of electromagnetic transients (EMTs) in the power system external to the WPP. The proposed model significantly reduces the computational resources and the simulation run time while preserving the WPP response fidelity in the desired frequency range, e. g., 0 to 50 kHz. The proposed WPP equivalent model is composed of two parts: 1) a frequency-dependent equivalent model which represents the WPP passive component in the entire frequency range and 2) a dynamic equivalent model that represents the WPP supervisory control and the aggregated low-frequency dynamics of wind-turbine generator (WTG) units. The latter can be constructed from the: 1) dynamic generic models; 2) vendor-specific models; or 3) user-defined models. The proposed model is incorporated as a software module in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment, and its efficiency and accuracy are verified based on comparing the results with those of a detailed model.

Abstract: Series compensation of transmission networks is being increasingly considered for integration of large wind farms to transfer bulk power. This paper presents the potential of subsynchronous resonance in large wind farms based on double-cage induction generators connected to a series-compensated line. A detailed linear state space model is presented for the wind plant and the transmission system. Eigenvalues are determined for a wide range of series compensation levels for various sizes of wind farms as well as a wind farm producing different power outputs. The potential of SSR involving both induction generator effect and torsional interaction is investigated in-depth. Eigen-value analysis results obtained through MATLAB simulations are validated by detailed electromagnetic transient simulation using PSCAD/EMTDC software. Studies are conducted for different commercially available double-cage induction generator-based wind turbines. SSR analysis in a realistic wind farm with identical wind turbine generators subjected to different wind speeds, and different sizes of wind turbine generators subjected to same wind speed are also carried out. It is shown that induction generator effect-based SSR can potentially occur for wind farms even at realistic levels of series compensation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed recharging rate control algorithm which combines the objectives of regulating frequency and improving the utilization of electric generators. An incentive policy is created that encourages electric vehicles (EVs) to demand energy when non-EV demand is low and electric generators are underutilized. EVs also act as frequency regulators which can control their participation role by modifying their respective payment rate. The proposed distributed recharging rate control algorithm can realize a Demand Management solution for EVs and does not require explicit real time communication from the electric generators or between the recharging sockets. A mechanism is presented that can trade off an ideal incentive policy with its approximation and enable the integration of the proposed controller with legacy protection system. Simulation is used to assess the algorithm and to highlight its embedded characteristics.

Abstract: Motivated by the poor local convergence behavior of existing computation schemes, we proposed an extreme-point subdifferential method (EPSD) to calculate convex-hull energy and reserve prices in Part I of this paper. In this part, the EPSD algorithm is shown to terminate in finite time where termination is said to occur when the subdifferential set contains the zero vector. Numerical experiments illustrate the finite-termination property and show that the performance of the scheme compares well with standard subgradient methods on the examples considered.

Abstract: In this work, a mathematical model to analyze the impact of the installation and operation of dispersed generation units in power distribution systems is proposed. The main focus is to determine the trade-off between the reliability and operational costs of distribution networks when the operation of isolated areas is allowed. In order to increase the system operator revenue, an optimal power flow makes use of the different energy prices offered by the dispersed generation connected to the grid. Simultaneously, the type and location of the protective devices initially installed on the protection system are reconfigured in order to minimize the interruption and expenditure of adjusting the protection system to conditions imposed by the operation of dispersed units. The interruption cost regards the unsupplied energy to customers in secure systems but affected by the normal tripping of protective devices. Therefore, the tripping of fuses, reclosers, and overcurrent relays aims to protect the system against both temporary and permanent fault types. Additionally, in order to reduce the average duration of the system interruption experienced by customers, the isolated operation of dispersed generation is allowed by installing directional overcurrent relays with synchronized reclose capabilities. A 135-bus real distribution system is used in order to show the advantages of using the mathematical model proposed.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for the joint energy and reserves scheduling and unit commitment with n - K reliability constraints for the day-ahead market. The proposed method includes a novel n - K criterion where demand must be met with a specified probability under any simultaneous loss of K generating units. A chance-constrained method is proposed with an alpha-quantile measure to determine the confidence level to meet the demand under K simultaneous contingencies. The chance-constrained optimization problem is recast as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem. Wind and demand uncertainty are included into the model. The methodology proposed is illustrated with several case studies where the effect of increasing wind power penetration is analyzed showing the performance of our model.

Abstract: The ever-increasing penetration of variable wind energy in power systems affects the hourly dispatch of thermal power generation in electricity markets. The variability of wind energy, which makes the wind energy non-dispatchable and difficult to control, could bring significant challenges to power system operators. The hourly coordination of wind power generation units with pumped-storage hydro (PS) generation could relieve the variability of wind energy and increase its dispatchability. The wind-PS coordination is based on the application of stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (stochastic SCUC). In this study, the coordinated hourly bus-level scheduling of wind-PS is compared with the coordinated system-level operation strategies in the day-ahead scheduling of power systems.

Abstract: Phasor based power system simulation software was originally conceived to study electromechanical interactions between rotating machinery and the network. Today, fast power electronic equipment is also commonly represented in phasor based power system software, although their dynamic behavior may violate some assumptions that lie at the basis of the phasor approximation. Modeling fast acting devices in phasor based power system software presents a number of challenges: due to the small time constants involved, time efficient simulation is a challenge. Furthermore, adverse interactions can occur between detailed models and state-of-the-art solution methods. The paper presents a robust implementation method on three levels: robustness of the tool, of the interface, and of the model itself, that leads to robust, accurate and efficient simulation of power systems with fast acting devices.

Abstract: The existence of wind power forecast errors is one of the most challenging issues for wind power system operation. It is difficult to find a reasonable method for the representation of forecast errors and apply it in scheduling. In this paper, a probability distribution model named "versatile distribution" is formulated and developed along with its properties and applications. The model can well represent forecast errors for all forecast timescales and magnitudes. The incorporation of the model in economic dispatch (ED) problems can simplify the wind-induced uncertainties via a few analytical terms in the problem formulation. The ED problem with wind power could hence be solved by the classical optimization methods, such as sequential linear programming which has been widely accepted by industry for solving ED problems. Discussions are also extended on the incorporation of the proposed versatile distribution into unit commitment problems. The results show that the new distribution is more effective than other commonly used distributions (i.e., Gaussian and Beta) with more accurate representation of forecast errors and better formulation and solution of ED problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the economic dispatch problem as a two-stage stochastic convex program for operational decision making under uncertainty. Post-contingency minimum frequency constraints are formulated as convex sets using a simplified model of frequency dynamics. The L-shaped method is used to decompose the large stochastic program into smaller sub-problems. Large-scale system examples are provided to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed model formulation. Numerical results show the value of the proposed model and indicate that the proposed model is especially useful under a higher level of wind penetration.

Abstract: The uncertainty assessment in reliability indices is usually performed by the propagation of uncertainties in input data reliability (failure rates and repair times) for the estimated reliability indices using mathematical models, such as fuzzy sets. This analysis cannot be directly applied in distribution networks when there are significant errors between historical and predicted indices. In this case, the propagation of uncertainty in power distribution network must take an opposite direction, that means: to use historical reliability indices to determine the uncertainties associated with reliability input data. The main aim of this paper is to determine the confidence intervals associated with reliability data of power distribution equipments based on available historical indices. These intervals are determined by combining the bootstrap technique with calibration models. The tests with a Brazilian distribution networks demonstrate that the proposed method can estimate the upper and lower bounds for the reliability data in a specified significance level.

Abstract: In low-voltage (LV) feeders with high penetration of photovoltaic (PV), a major issue to be solved is voltage rise due to the active power injection. If no measures are taken, this may lead to generation's interruptions and to the malfunctioning of domestic appliances due to non-standard voltage profiles. This paper proposes a storage strategy to alleviate voltage rise in feeders with PV, using coordinated electric vehicle (EV) load as the storage solution. The voltage support strategy is easy to implement practically and it is demonstrated on a test feeder emulating a household with roof-mounted PV and an EV. The results show the effectiveness of using coordinated EV load in feeders with PV to mitigate voltage rise problems.

Abstract: The importance of power quality issues, due to the significant losses for poor power quality, has resulted in research being focused on extending the concept of state estimation techniques into power quality issues. Under the umbrella of power quality state estimation (PQSE) as a smart algorithm, this paper focuses on one type, transient state estimation (TSE). The formulation of a new three-phase transient state estimator is given and its application to a realistic system demonstrated. The accuracy of the new transient state estimator is investigated by application to a test system to identify the cause of a voltage dip/sag in the presence of 5% measurement noise (normally distributed) in all the measurements.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer optimization approach for transmission system planning with an AC network model. The approach makes use of the conic programming relaxation of the optimal power flow problem to define a disjunctive program that takes into account both the network power flow and the voltage limits. The proposed mixed-integer optimization program has a convex relaxation and can be solved using a branch-and-cut algorithm. Planning results show that the method produces solutions that satisfy the AC network model constraints without further reinforcement and are at less cost as compared to solutions reported in the literature.

Abstract: This second part of a two-part paper presents the implementation and simulations of a risk-based optimization approach for distribution expansion planning with distributed generation (DG), as described in Part I. The proposed approach is first applied to a test system in order to test convergence of the optimization algorithm and then comparing its numerical results with the ones from the exhaustive method. Later, the expansion planning of a typical Latin American distribution network is assessed and analyzed. For this, two expansion optimizations are performed: one, taking into account traditional expansion alternatives (without DG) and, the other, considering DG as flexible expansion options. Finally, the computational effort is analyzed. Results show that the greatest contribution of DG lies in the flexibility it gives to expansion planning, mainly by deferring network reinforcements.

Abstract: This paper presents a decision tree based method for out-of-step prediction of synchronous generators. For distinguishing between stable and out-of-step conditions, a series of measurements are taken under various fault scenarios including operational and topological disturbances. The data of input features and output target classes are used as the input-output pairs for decision tree induction and deduction. The merit of decision tree based detection of transient instability lies in robust classification of new unseen samples. The performance of the proposed method is verified on two test cases including a 9-bus dynamic network and the practical 1696-bus Iran national grid. The simulation results are presented for various input features and learning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a methodology to approximate closed loop capacity equilibria using only open loop capacity equilibrium models. In the closed loop model, generation companies choose capacities that maximize their individual profit in the first stage while the second stage represents the conjectured-price-response market equilibrium. In the open loop model, firms simultaneously choose capacities and quantities to maximize their individual profit, while each firm conjectures a price response to its output decisions. The closed loop equilibrium model is an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints, which belongs to a class of problems that is very hard to solve. The open loop equilibrium model is much easier to solve; however, it is also less realistic. With the approximation scheme proposed in this paper, we are able to solve the closed loop model reasonably well when market behavior is closer to oligopoly than to perfect competition by smartly employing open loop models which reduces the computational time by two orders of magnitude. We achieve this by transforming the open loop equilibrium problem into an equivalent convex quadratic optimization problem which can be solved efficiently. Finally, a case study is presented in order to validate the proposed approximation scheme.

Abstract: Due to increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy and introduction of demand response programs, uncertainties occur in both supply and demand sides in real time for the current power grid system. To address these uncertainties, most ISOs/RTOs perform reliability unit commitment runs after the day-ahead financial market to ensure sufficient generation capacity available in real time to accommodate uncertainties. Two-stage stochastic unit commitment and robust unit commitment formulations have been introduced and studied recently to provide day-ahead unit commitment decisions. However, both approaches have limitations: 1) computational challenges due to the large scenario size for the stochastic optimization approach and 2) conservativeness for the robust optimization approach. In this paper, we propose a novel unified stochastic and robust unit commitment model that takes advantage of both stochastic and robust optimization approaches, that is, this innovative model can achieve a low expected total cost while ensuring the system robustness. By introducing weights for the components for the stochastic and robust parts in the objective function, system operators can adjust the weights based on their preferences. Finally, a Benders' decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. The computational results indicate that this approach provides a more robust and computationally trackable framework as compared with the stochastic optimization approach and amore cost-effective unit commitment decision as compared with the robust optimization approach.

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to develop methodologies for simultaneous generation and transmission expansion planning problem of power networks while investigating interactions between these two important sections. In the proposed methodologies, a transmission operator (TO) operating under different incentives decides about investment in transmission network while anticipating the outcome of a purely competitive electricity market where several rival generation firms complete with each other to determine operating level of their generators, amount of their sales and amount of their investment in generation capacity. The proposed methodologies rely on bi-level programming models whose upper level model represent the problem of investment in transmission by TO and the lower level problems represent market outcomes obtained from clearing the market. These bi-level models are reduced to mixed-integer linear and nonlinear programming using the duality theory and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. The results of the proposed models are analyzed and compared using two illustrative examples.

Abstract: This paper addresses a new approach for predicting the generator rotor angle using an adaptive artificial neural network (AANN) for power system stability. The aim of this work is to predict the stability status for each generator when the system is under a contingency. This is based on the initial condition of an operating point, which is represented by the generator rotor angle at a certain load level. An automatic data generation algorithm is developed for the training and testing process. The proposed method has been successfully tested on the IEEE 9-bus test system and the 87-bus system for Peninsular Malaysia.

Abstract: There is a concern over large, fluctuating wind power injected into a power system, which could affect stability, frequency and power quality of the power system. A method of using three-terminal HVDC system to bundle large scale wind farms with conventional power plants is proposed to overcome this problem. The wind power fluctuation is canceled by regulating the power from the conventional power plants. Topology of the scheme is described. A control strategy particularly suitable to cope with wind power fluctuation is designed. Novel fault ride through mechanisms are designed to enable safe operation of the system. Simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC verify the successful operation of the system during starting-up, steady state, wind power variations and faults. The proposed scheme provides a novel way to deal with the integration of large scale wind power.

Abstract: Adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is an adaptation and robustness method since it combines the advantages of artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic controller (FLC). Besides, ANFIS is also a nonlinear controller that can be used to improve stability of the studied system under different operating points. This paper presents the stability-improvement results of an offshore wind farm (OWF) fed to a multi-machine system through a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link based on line-commutated converter (LCC). An effective control scheme using a designed ANFIS damping controller at the inverter station of the HVDC link to achieve damping improvement of the studied system is proposed. A frequency-domain scheme based on eigenvalue and root-loci technique is carried out to compare the effectiveness of the proposed ANFIS control scheme and a modal-control designed PID damping controller. A time-domain scheme based on a nonlinear system model subject to a three-phase short-circuit fault is also utilized to examine the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Comparative simulation results show that the two damping controllers can contribute adequate damping characteristics to the dominant modes of the studied system while the designed ANFIS damping controller is shown to be superior for improving the stability of the studied system subject to a severe disturbance.

Abstract: Black start is the primary procedure deployed for rapid recovery from a complete blackout. For isolated power systems such as the Taiwan power system (TPS), a reliable and efficient black start procedure is more important than interconnected power systems. In this paper, a black start decision-supporting system (BSS) with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed. BSS can rapidly generate optimal black start strategies according to the updated system data configuration and objective function; furthermore, BSS can automatically simulate the strategies and visualize the results. By applying the BSS to evaluate the black start strategies for TPS, the effectiveness of BSS has been demonstrated. The BSS has been utilized by Taiwan Power Company (TPC) for black start planning with comparison to traditional manual planning. With the aid of BSS, the dispatchers are equipped with more support and the restoration risk can be much alleviated.

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation model based on the diagonalization algorithm for the study of the short-term operation of a pool-based oligopolistic electricity market with multi-period auctions. A detailed producer's profit maximization model as well as a detailed non-convex independent system operator (ISO) market clearing algorithm are used. A multi-period auction is assumed, where generators, under conditions of perfect information (regarding system load and competitor offers), submit stepwise energy and reserves offer curves and, subsequently, the ISO clears the market. An innovative correction of the residual demand curve (RDC) is introduced to account for the effect of some of the non-convexities of the ISO market clearing. Convergence of the diagonalization algorithm is enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL), through which the knowledge on the success of the producers' past behavior is used to adjust the supply offers.

Abstract: The IEEE Standard 1366-2003-2.5 Beta Methodology was developed to provide a methodology to define a Major Event Day (MED) with respect to distribution reliability performance. The method applies to utilities experiencing interruptions every day or just some days of the year.
According to the methodology, days without interruptions are eliminated from the threshold calculation. This letter endeavors to illustrate that actual data variations in the number of "Zero SAIDI" days has a significant impact on the threshold for data sets of 24 utility units and may also apply to other utilities. The issue that arises is that there is a large variation in the thresholds and number of MEDs, depending on the number of "non-zero" days a utility may encounter from year to year as a result of slightly deteriorating daily performance. This condition can cause significant shifts of the MED thresholds and the resulting number of defined MEDs.

A risk-based security-constrained optimal power flow (RB-SCOPF), considering "N-1" criteria and risk together, is compared with the traditional SCOPF. The IEEE 30-bus system is tested to illustrate the coordination between risk and "N-1" criteria in RB-SCOPF.

Abstract: Phasor measurement units (PMUs) equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers are the first devices capable of efficiently performing real-time monitoring of remote electrical power systems. Reliability of the monitoring system that exclusively uses PMUs is directly related to the reliability of each unit allocated on the system. As the failure of measurement channels is more common than PMU's failure, a probabilistic evaluation method of the PMUs measurement channels availability for electrical network observability analysis is proposed. In this method, the Markov process is adopted for estimating the measurement channels availability, as well as for determining an equivalent of the state space diagram of all possible operation states of channels for each unit. With the objective to assess the impact of the failure of measurement channels in the observability and reliability of the system, an algorithm that determines the optimal placement of PMUs using a modified binary search, the measurement channels availability for each unit, the global measurement availability, and the critical measurement channels for power system observability analysis was developed. Numerical results using the IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus, New England 39-bus, and IEEE 118-bus test systems are presented and discussed.

Abstract: This paper proposes observability and measurement criticality analysis methods for any type of current phasor measurement configurations. Measurement Jacobian cannot be decoupled when using current phasor measurements and thus conventional methods of network observability analysis can no longer be used. Current phasor measurements may be classified into two types based on their configuration. Depending on whether there is a voltage phasor measurement at the sending end of the measured line or not, a current phasor measurement configuration may be referred to as of type-1 or type-2, respectively. Two methods which can handle conventional as well as phasor measurements, one being a modified version of the conventional method for type-1, and the other being a new method for type-2 phasor measurements, are developed and presented. Moreover, due to the fully coupled model used in the analysis, a method to handle voltage magnitude measurements is also developed.

Abstract: This paper proposes strategies to reduce the number of variables and the combinatorial search space of the multistage transmission expansion planning problem (TEP). The concept of the binary numeral system (BNS) is used to reduce the number of binary and continuous variables related to the candidate transmission lines and network constraints that are connected with them. The construction phase of greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP-CP) and additional constraints, obtained from power flow equilibrium in an electric power system are employed for more reduction in search space. The multistage TEP problem is modeled like a mixed binary linear programming problem and solved using a commercial solver with a low computational time. The results of one test system and two real systems are presented in order to show the efficiency of the proposed solution technique.

Abstract: To describe the impact of uncertainties, such as fluctuation of bus loads and intermittent behavior of renewable generations, on the available load supply capability (ALSC) of distribution system accurately and comprehensively, this paper defines a series of meaningful indices for the probabilistic evaluation of ALSC. An efficient simulation method, Latin hypercube sampling-based Monte Carlo simulation (LHS-MCS), combined with step-varied repeated power flow method is proposed to compute the defined indices. Compared with simple random sampling-based Monte Carlo simulation (SRS-MCS), LHS-MCS is found to be more suitable for the probabilistic evaluation of ALSC. It can achieve more accurate and stable ALSC indices under relatively small sample sizes. The calculation speed of LHS-MCS is comparable with that of SRS-MCS under the same sample sizes, and the required CPU time of LHS-MCS is far less than SRS-MCS under the same calculation accuracy. Case studies carried out on the modified Baran & Wu 33-bus and the modified IEEE 123-bus distribution systems verify the feasibility of the defined indices and high performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: The paper presents a new model of the STATCOM aimed at power flow solutions using the Newton-Raphson method. The STATCOM is made up of the series connection of a voltage-source converter (VSC) and its connecting transformer. The VSC is represented in this paper by a complex tap-changing transformer whose primary and secondary windings correspond, notionally speaking, to the VSC's ac and dc buses, respectively. The magnitude and phase angle of the complex tap changer are said to be the amplitude modulation index and the phase shift that would exist in a PWM inverter to enable either reactive power generation or absorption purely by electronic processing of the voltage and current waveforms within the VSC. The new STATCOM model allows for a comprehensive representation of its ac and dc circuits-this is in contrast to current practice where the STATCOM is represented by an equivalent variable voltage source, which is not amenable to a proper representation of the STATCOM's dc circuit. One key characteristic of the new VSC model is that no special provisions within a conventional ac power flow solution algorithm is required to represent the dc circuit, since the complex tap-changing transformer of the VSC gives rise to the customary ac circuit and a notional dc circuit. The latter includes the dc capacitor, which in steady-state draws no current, and a current-dependent conductance to represent switching losses. The ensuing STATCOM model possesses unparalleled control capabilities in the operational parameters of both the ac and dc sides of the converter. The prowess of the new STATCOM power flow model is demonstrated by numerical examples where the quadratic convergence characteristics of the Newton-Raphson method are preserved.

Abstract: Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have received an increased interest lately since they provide an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the PHEV introduction level in the car park, the charging behaviors in an area will induce changes in the load profiles of the power system. Hence, it becomes important to investigate what impact a given PHEV introduction level has on load profiles due to expected charging behavior of residents.
This paper proposes a new model for generating PHEV home-charging patterns by combining PHEV usage with synthetic activity generation of residents' electricity-dependent activities. The synthetic activity data are simulated based on time-use data collected in time diaries, and define the basis for calculations of the PHEV home-charging behavior as well as the resident's electricity consumption.
The proposed model is generic and can be used where similar residential time-use data are available. Based on the underlying activities, the model estimates the total load profile due to residential load as well as the variation in the load profile. The resulting load profiles can be used in load shaving studies in order to investigate what type of activities, PHEV usage or other, may be moved to hours with lower demand.

Abstract: This paper proposes a series of new metrics for the reliability and economic assessment of microgrids in distribution system. These metrics include reliability parameters for a microgrid in the islanded mode, indices indicating distributed generation (DG) and load characteristics in the microgrid, microgrid economic indices, and customer based microgrid reliability indices. A two-step Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is proposed to assess the reliability and economics of a microgrid with intermittent DGs as well as the reliability of distribution system with microgrids. An application in IEEE-RBTS shows the effectiveness of the reliability and economic assessment technique with the proposed metrics, which can provide scientific and comparative information for the design and operation of microgrids.

Abstract: Active-reactive optimal power flow (A-R-OPF) in distribution networks (DNs) with embedded wind generation and battery storage systems (BSSs) was proposed recently. The solution was based on a fixed length in the charge and discharge cycle for daily operations of BSSs. This can lead to a low profit when the profiles of renewable generators, demand and prices vary from day to day. In this paper, we extend the A-R-OPF method by developing a flexible battery management system (FBMS). This is accomplished by optimizing the lengths (hours) of charge and discharge periods of BSSs for each day, leading to a complex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). An iterative two-stage framework is proposed to address this problem. In the upper stage, the integer variables (i.e., hours of charge and discharge periods) are optimized and delivered to the lower stage. In the lower stage the A-R-OPF problem is solved by a NLP solver and the resulting objective function value is brought to the upper stage for the next iteration. It can be shown through a case study that a flexible operation strategy will achieve a considerably higher profit than by a fixed operation strategy of BSSs.

Abstract: Decision tree based machine learning methods find a great deal of application in power system reliability assessment studies, wherein essential knowledge in the form of operating rules or guidelines are produced that help operators maneuver the system away from insecurity. Independent test sets are generally used to validate these rules, with the motivation of estimating their classification accuracy and error rates, apart from checking their performance against some interesting situations. This paper proposes an importance sampling based method to generate intelligent test set for validating operating rules. The method is applied for testing decision tree rules derived against voltage collapse problems in western regions of the French power system, and is seen to produce test sets at lesser computation that estimates the rule's classification errors with good accuracy. For a given computation, it also provides richer information on critical operating conditions for which the rule is vulnerable, which helps in further improving the rules.

Abstract: Energy storage may improve power management in microgrids that include renewable energy sources. The storage devices match energy generation to consumption, facilitating a smooth and robust energy balance within the microgrid. This paper addresses the optimal control of the microgrid's energy storage devices. Stored energy is controlled to balance power generation of renewable sources to optimize overall power consumption at the microgrid point of common coupling. Recent works emphasize constraints imposed by the storage device itself, such as limited capacity and internal losses. However, these works assume flat, highly simplified network models, which overlook the physical connectivity. This work proposes an optimal power flow solution that considers the entire system: the storage device limits, voltages limits, currents limits, and power limits. The power network may be arbitrarily complex, and the proposed solver obtains a globally optimal solution.

Abstract: The large-scale power systems are liable to performance deterioration due to the presence of sudden small load perturbations, parameter uncertainties, structural variations, etc. Due to this, modern control aspects are extremely important in load frequency control (LFC) design of power systems. In this paper, the LFC problem is illustrated as a typical disturbance rejection as well as large-scale system control problem. For this purpose, simple approach to LFC design for the power systems having parameter uncertainty and load disturbance is proposed. The approach is based on two-degree-of-freedom, internal model control (IMC) scheme, which unifies the concept of model-order reduction like Routh and Pade approximations, and modified IMC filter design, recently developed by Liu and Gao [ 24]. The beauty of this paper is that in place of taking the full-order system for internal-model of IMC, a lower-order, i.e., second-order reduced system model, has been considered. This scheme achieves improved closed-loop system performance to counteract load disturbances. The proposed approach is simulated in MATLAB environment for a single-area power system consisting of single generating unit with a non-reheated turbine to highlight the efficiency and efficacy in terms of robustness and optimality.

Abstract: In this paper, an ultra-fast algorithm for the computation of multiphase short-circuit currents at all buses is proposed by addressing the concept of selected inversion. The short circuit summary is achieved through the computation of multiphase Thevenin equivalent at each bus by using the augmented nodal matrix. This typically requires the sequential solution of linear system of equations, i.e., direct inversion which can be demanding in terms of CPU time. In this paper, it is shown that dramatic gains in computational time can be obtained when the selected inversion (SelInv) technique is performed where only a subset of entries of the inverse of augmented nodal matrix is computed. These entries include the phase domain Thevenin impedances seen from network buses which are used in the computation of short-circuit currents with the predefined boundary conditions specific to the fault type. The performance of the method is demonstrated with very large scale and realistic distribution systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic time simulation model for long-term generation capacity investment decisions in the presence of either perfect or imperfect electricity market. The model is based on system dynamics concept in which the dynamics of capacity construction is traced using the forecast of electricity price cleared in the short-term electricity market. Both the perfect and oligopolistic competitions are considered and a market power index is defined to evaluate the competition level of the electricity market. The short-term and long-term dynamic analysis are used to represent the generation firms' behavior in bidding strategy and capacity investment, respectively. Both possibilities of using forward bilateral contracts and application of wind power generation have been assessed individually in the proposed model in order to mitigate the market power. The time simulation results derived from a case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in illustrating the oligopoly in electricity marketplace and also the alternative decisions to attenuate it. Such a decision tool enables both the generation firms and the regulators to gain perfect insight into the oligopoly and its consequences in the long-term capacity investment in the electricity market.

Abstract: Existing power system planning software is not capable of simulating large numbers of contingencies that involve bus mergers and bus splits without cumbersome modifications to planning models either manually or through scripting. This means that some of the events that can occur in a bulk power system are not studied in detail prior to real-time operation. This paper proposes the use of a unified network applications framework for planning contingency analysis capable of incorporating contingencies that involve arbitrary configurations of switching devices. The method handles any type of bus split or bus merger events automatically without requiring case conversion or modification. This drastically simplifies the tabulation of results of complex contingencies and makes potential unsecure system conditions visible during the planning stage. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated in large-scale ISO models that incorporate full-topology switching modeling, and it is shown to be at least ten times faster than scripting. The proposed method hence supports direct comparison of planning and real-time grid security assessment evaluation, providing full temporal interoperability between offline contingency analysis and real-time security assessment.

Abstract: The linear supply function equilibrium (SFE) model can be used to investigate bid-based electricity pool markets. Several studies assume that the market players construct optimal strategic bids by parameterizing the linear marginal cost function of their generating units. Four different types of parameterization are possible, for which the slope and/or the intercept of the marginal cost functions are varied. This paper reviews the existing literature and proposes a primal-dual nonlinear interior point algorithm to solve a bi-level market problem with AC network representation, using any of the parameterization methods. Part II of this paper uses the proposed algorithm to examine the effects of the different parameterizations on the resulting SFE solutions, the role of network complexity and the nature of the equilibrium points.

Abstract: In this paper, a new agent-based electricity market model is presented in which participants correspond to generation plants as well as storage power plants. In contrast to agent-based models where agents use learning heuristics and trial-and-error approaches to maximize their profits, the proposed model predictive bidding uses multi-step optimization to find bidding curves which maximize the expected discounted profit over a time horizon in the future. The profit is calculated based on an hourly price forward curve (HPFC), whereby the HPFC is constructed taking several factors into account. In addition, a price adjuster is used in these calculations which allows the participant to take into account his market power. The resulting optimization problem for each agent is solved using dynamic programming.
A case study is carried out in which the proposed agent-based market model is applied to the four countries Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and France to study the effects of constrained cross-border capacities. The simulations show that the transmission system operators as well as the power generating units have no incentive to build additional cross-border capacity, since it lowers their profits.

Abstract: We formulate mixed-integer conic approximations to AC transmission system planning. The first applies lift-and-project relaxations to a nonconvex model built around a semidefinite power flow relaxation. We then employ a quadratically constrained approximation to the DistFlow equations in constructing a second-order cone model that is convex without relaxation. We solve mixed integer linear and second-order cone programs using commercial software and assess their performance on two benchmark problems. As with DC power flow models and linear AC relaxations, the new models usually produce solutions which are infeasible under the original constraints. However, they are nearer to feasibility, and therefore represent stronger alternatives.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for the early detection and optimal corrective measures of power system insecurity in an enhanced look-ahead dispatch framework. By introducing short-term dispatchable capacity (STDC) into the proposed look-ahead security management (LSM) scheme, the algorithm is capable of predicting and identifying future infeasibilities that pose security risks to the system under both normal conditions and assumed contingency conditions. An optimal recovery plan can be computed to prevent system insecurity at a minimal cost. Early awareness of such information is of vital importance to system operators for taking timely actions with more flexible and cost-effective measures. This, in addition to the economic benefits studied in the literature, demonstrates the advantage of security improvement of the look-ahead dispatch framework. The performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated in a revised 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System as well as in a practical 5889-bus system.

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for the microgrid planning as an alternative to the co-optimization of generation and transmission expansion planning in electric power systems. The integration of microgrids in distribution systems will offer a decentralized control of local resources for satisfying the network reliability and the power quality required by local loads. The objective in this paper is to minimize the total system planning cost comprising investment and operation costs of local microgrids, the co-optimized planning of large generating units and transmission lines, and the expected cost of unserved energy. The cost of unserved energy reflects the cost of load shedding which is added to the objective function for reliability considerations. The microgrid-based co-optimization planning problem is decomposed into a planning problem and annual reliability subproblem. The optimal integer planning decisions calculated in the planning problem will be examined against the system reliability limits in the subproblem and the planning decisions will be revised using proper feasibility cuts if the annual reliability limits are violated. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed microgrid-based co-optimization planning in power systems and explore the economic and reliability merits of microgrid planning as compared to grid-based generation and transmission upgrades.

Abstract: Large-scale electricity storage can enable arbitrage between periods when electricity is abundant, and cheap, and periods when it is scarce. In principle, this could enable greater use of baseload generation, and encourage investments in intermittent capacity such as wind and solar. If storage is to penetrate the system, the marginal value of storage capacity must be high enough to enable investments in storage. To have a significant impact on investments in intermittent technologies, it must be large enough to affect the prices on the system. This research develops a theoretical framework to evaluate the marginal values of the components of a storage system, and to characterize the impact of storage on the price patterns in the system. The theoretical approach is applied to an example system to illustrate the changes in marginal values as storage penetrates the system, and the impact on system prices.

Abstract: Stability and cost optimality of power generation and supply systems must not be considered independently from one another. Simple examples show that optimizing cost without considering stability may result in modes of operation that, while economically optimal, are unstable. We demonstrate that stability, robustness, and optimality can be considered systematically and simultaneously by combining bifurcation theory and nonlinear optimization. Essentially, the proposed method enforces a backoff distance between the optimal point of operation and operational or stability boundaries in the space of the optimization variables, where bifurcation theory is used to describe nonlinear stability boundaries.
We optimize a simple grid to demonstrate the features of the proposed approach. Our results show that the method can be applied to problems with both continuous and Boolean optimization variables, where the latter represent grid breakers in the example. The constraints for robust stability turn out to be crucial in that economically optimal but unstable modes of operation exist despite the small size of the illustrative example. Our results demonstrate that the robustness constraints can affect the optimal value of the Boolean variables. We show that the method provides a measure for the cost of stability and robustness.

Abstract: With the emerging use of voltage source converter high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) links, the hybrid multi-infeed HVDC (HMIDC) system that includes the line commutated converter (LCC) HVDC and the VSC-HVDC links is becoming a promising power transmission structure in the modern power systems. To evaluate the contribution of the VSC-HVDC link on the voltage stability of HMIDC system, this paper proposes an effective short circuit ratio (ESCR) calculation method. Through the calculation, the voltage support capability of the VSC-HVDC link can be quantitatively represented by the ESCR. Furthermore, based on the calculation results, a flexible power control strategy for the VSC-HVDC link is developed to provide maximum reactive power support under grid faults. The theoretical analysis of the HMIDC system is based on the Danish transmission grid, evaluated through PSCAD simulations under different grid fault conditions. Simulation results are presented to validate the expected performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents the formulation and critical assessment of a novel type of demand response (DR) program targeting retail customers (such as small/medium size commercial, industrial, and residential customers) who are equipped with smart meters yet still face a flat rate. Enabled by pervasive mobile communication capabilities and smart grid technologies, load serving entities (LSEs) could offer retail customers coupon incentives via near-real-time information networks to induce demand response for a future period of time in anticipation of intermittent generation ramping and/or price spikes. This scheme is referred to as coupon incentive-based demand response (CIDR). In contrast to the real-time pricing or peak load pricing DR programs, CIDR continues to offer a flat rate to retail customers and also provides them with voluntary incentives to induce demand response. Theoretical analysis shows the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of social welfare, consumer surplus, LSE profit, the robustness of the retail electricity rate, and readiness for implementation. The pros and cons are discussed in comparison with existing DR programs. Numerical illustration is performed based on realistic supply and demand data obtained from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

Abstract: This paper addresses day-ahead thermal generation scheduling as a realistic multi-objective optimization problem in an uncertain environment considering system operation cost, emission cost and reliability as the multiple objectives. The uncertainties occurring due to unit outage and load forecast error are incorporated using loss of load probability (LOLP) and expected unserved energy (EUE) reliability indices. For solving the above-mentioned scheduling problem, a multi-objective generation scheduling algorithm (MOGSA) is proposed in this paper. Three case studies are performed on large scale test systems considering two different bi-objective optimization models and a three-objective optimization model that may be chosen by the system operator according to his/her own preference. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of solving the thermal generation scheduling problem as a realistic multi-objective optimization problem in an uncertain environment. Finally the authors suggest a systematic procedure for the system operators to choose a single solution for the thermal generation scheduling problem.

Abstract: In this paper, an evolutionary programming (EP) based technique has been presented for the optimal placement of distributed generation (DG) units energized by renewable energy resources (wind and solar) in a radial distribution system. The correlation between load and renewable resources has been nullified by dividing the study period into several segments and treating each segment independently. To handle the uncertainties associated with load and renewable resources, probabilistic techniques have been used. Two operation strategies, namely "turning off wind turbine generator" and "clipping wind turbine generator output", have also been adopted to restrict the wind power dispatch to a specified fraction of system load for system stability consideration. To reduce the search space and thereby to minimize the computational burden, a sensitivity analysis technique has been employed which gives a set of locations suitable for DG placement. For the proposed EP based approach, an index based scheme has also been developed to generate the population ensuring the feasibility of each individual and thus considerably reducing the computational time. The developed technique has been applied to a 12.66-kV, 69-bus distribution test system. The solutions result in significant loss reduction and voltage profile improvement.

Abstract: In this paper, a new comprehensive planning methodology is proposed for implementing distribution network reinforcement. The load growth, voltage profile, distribution line loss, and reliability are considered in this procedure. A time-segmentation technique is employed to reduce the computational load. Options considered range from supporting the load growth using the traditional approach of upgrading the conventional equipment in the distribution network, through to the use of dispatchable distributed generators (DDG). The objective function is composed of the construction cost, loss cost and reliability cost. As constraints, the bus voltages and the feeder currents should be maintained within the standard level. The DDG output power should not be less than a ratio of its rated power because of efficiency. A hybrid optimization method, called modified discrete particle swarm optimization, is employed to solve this nonlinear and discrete optimization problem. A comparison is performed between the optimized solution based on planning of capacitors along with tap-changing transformer and line upgrading and when DDGs are included in the optimization.

Abstract: We propose a decentralized algorithm to optimally schedule electric vehicle (EV) charging. The algorithm exploits the elasticity of electric vehicle loads to fill the valleys in electric load profiles. We first formulate the EV charging scheduling problem as an optimal control problem, whose objective is to impose a generalized notion of valley-filling, and study properties of optimal charging profiles. We then give a decentralized algorithm to iteratively solve the optimal control problem. In each iteration, EVs update their charging profiles according to the control signal broadcast by the utility company, and the utility company alters the control signal to guide their updates. The algorithm converges to optimal charging profiles (that are as "flat" as they can possibly be) irrespective of the specifications (e.g., maximum charging rate and deadline) of EVs, even if EVs do not necessarily update their charging profiles in every iteration, and use potentially outdated control signal when they update. Moreover, the algorithm only requires each EV solving its local problem, hence its implementation requires low computation capability. We also extend the algorithm to track a given load profile and to real-time implementation.

Abstract: Stochastic optimal power flow can provide the system operator with adequate strategies for controlling the power flow to maintain secure operation under stochastic parameter variations. One limitation of stochastic optimal power flow has been that only limits on line flows have been used as stability constraints. In many systems voltage stability and small-signal stability also play an important role in constraining the operation.
In this paper we aim to extend the stochastic optimal power flow problem to include constraints for voltage stability as well as small-signal stability. This is done by approximating the voltage stability and small-signal stability constraint surfaces with second-order approximations in parameter space. Then we refine methods from mathematical finance to be able to estimate the probability of violating the constraints.
In this, the second part of the paper, we look at how Cornish-Fisher expansion combined with a method of excluding sets that are counted twice, can be used to estimate the probability of violating the stability constraints. We then show in a numerical example how this leads to an efficient solution method for the stochastic optimal power flow problem.

Abstract: Society's increased concern over green house gas emission and the reduced cost of electric vehicle technologies has increased the number of electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road. Previous studies into the effects of electric vehicles on the electric system have focused on transmission, generation, and the loss of life of distribution transformers. This paper focuses specifically on identifying distribution transformers that are most susceptible to excessive loading due to the implementation of electric vehicles. The authors use a binomial probability model to calculate the probability that a specific distribution transformer will experience excessive loading. Variables to the function include the existing peak transformer demand, number of customers connected to the transformer, and the most common EV charger demand. Also included in the paper is an optimization approach that utilizes the results from the binomial function to determine the optimal replacement strategy to minimize replacement costs. An extension of the approach is also utilized to explore the effectiveness of EV targeted demand side management programs. The authors apply the described algorithms to 75 000 distributions transformers within a distribution system located in Denver, Colorado.

Abstract: For the first time, IEEE Std. C37.118.1-2011 now provides metrics for PMU dynamic performance in terms of classes P and M filter designs. This paper attempts to determine whether fulfilling these requirements makes the PMU inherently well suited for stability control applications such as wide-area power system stabilizers (PSSs). In this aim, we considered two different frequency-adaptive approaches for class-P and -M compliance to ensure operation over a wide frequency range. The first is based on a finite-impulse response (FIR) with no overshoot in either the phase or the amplitude step responses, while the second is Kalman filter-based (EKF), which allows for a more refined out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with overshoot. These two approaches are benchmarked against Hydro-Quebec's existing PSS requirements and the conclusion is that the total vector error-based response time is not indicative of the phase lag within the frequency band of interest, nor of the 3-dB bandwidth under sinusoidal amplitude/frequency modulation phenomena, which are key criteria when specifying PSS PMUs. Using simulated and field-recorded network fault responses, we also show that a class-M PMU is unsatisfactory for wide-area stabilizing control, unless its performance is improved during the fault period, which is not covered by Std. C37.118.1-2011.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of start-up (SU) and shut-down (SD) power trajectories of thermal units. Multiple SU power-trajectories and costs are modeled according to how long the unit has been offline. The proposed formulation significantly reduces the computational burden in comparison with others commonly found in the literature. This is because the formulation is 1) tighter, i.e., the relaxed solution is nearer to the optimal integer solution; and 2) more compact, i.e., it needs fewer constraints, variables and nonzero elements in the constraint matrix. For illustration, the self-unit commitment problem faced by a thermal unit is employed. We provide computational results comparing the proposed formulation with others found in the literature.

Abstract: This paper proposes a plug-and-play control method to coordinate multiple distributed energy resources (DER or DE) to regulate voltages in future distribution systems with a high DE penetration. Theoretical analysis shows that there exists a corresponding formulation of the dynamic control parameters with multiple DEs to give the desired responses. Therefore, the proposed control method has a solid theoretical basis. The method is based on dynamically and adaptively adjusting DE control parameters to ensure that actual voltage responses follow the desired outputs. Also, it is based on local and the other DEs' voltages without the need of the full system data and extensive studies to tune the control parameters. Hence, the method is autonomous and adaptive for variable operational situations, and has the plug-and-play feature with a high tolerance to unavailable or inaccurate system data. Thus, it is suitable for broad utility application. Simulation results from various conditions, such as asynchronous start of multiple DEs, disappearance of the original disturbance in the middle of the control process, and operation in looped distribution systems, confirm the performance, validity, and flexibility of the proposed control method. The possible impact of communication latency on the performance of the proposed method is also discussed.

Abstract: Load pattern clustering based on the shape of the electricity consumption is a key tool to provide enhanced knowledge on the nature of the consumption and assist meaningful customer partitioning. This paper presents new developments to group the load patterns using an initial set of centroids specified according to a user-defined centroid model. The original Electrical Pattern Ant Colony Clustering (EPACC) algorithm is illustrated, highlighting its characteristics and parameters, with centroids evolution during the iterative process until stabilization. The EPACC results are compared with those obtained from the classical k-means algorithm to group the representative load patterns taken from a set of non-residential customers in typical weekdays.

Abstract: A regression tree-based approach to predicting the power system stability margin and detecting impending system event is proposed. The input features of the regression tree (RT) include the synchronized voltage and current phasors. Modal analysis and continuation power flow are the tools used to build the knowledge base for offline RT training. Corresponding metrics include the damping ratio of the critical oscillation mode and MW-distance to the voltage collapse point. The robustness of the proposed predictor to measurement errors and system topology variation is analyzed. The optimal placement for the phasor measurement units (PMUs) based on the importance of RT variables is suggested.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new coordinated voltage control scheme to ensure voltage security of power systems. The scheme schedules reactive power injection from VAR sources, including synchronous generators and condensers, capacitor banks, switchable reactors and FACTS devices, to ensure desired loading margin of power systems for a given horizon of time. The problem is treated as voltage security constrained multi-period optimal reactive power flow (VSC-MPORPF). To incorporate scheduling of both continuous and discrete VAR sources, the VSC-MPORPF is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, and is solved using generalized Benders decomposition (GBD). Multi-period formulation ensures both optimal switching pattern of discrete voltage controllers and voltage security for a given future horizon. Also, to make the proposed method applicable for large-scale power systems, optimality condition decomposition approach is utilized, along with the GBD. The proposed methodology is examined through case studies conducted on a simple 6-bus, the IEEE 118-bus, and a 1180-bus test systems. The results demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework in real-time operation of power systems.

Abstract: Increased fault current level may exceed the rating of the existing network's equipment and disrupt coordination of overcurrent relays (OCRs). Introduction of new dispersed generation (DG) units in a grid connected microgrid is the main reason for increasing the fault current level. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, fault current limiters (FCLs) can be utilized between the microgrid (downstream) and main grid (upstream). Most FCLs have a bidirectional current limiting function. Whereas in the case of a fault in downstream, it is advised to disable the FCL in order to prevent some problems occurring in the microgrid. Power quality (PQ) and reliability of the microgrid as well as coordination between the upstream and downstream OCRs are affected by the bidirectional FCL in case of fault in downstream. In this paper a unidirectional fault current limiter (UFCL) is proposed to achieve a proper interaction between the upstream and downstream. During the fault condition in the main network, the UFCL acts normally; however, in case of fault occurrence or heavy load startup in downstream, the UFCL is disabled to avoid the aforementioned problems in the microgrid. Several simulations and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the UFCL.

Abstract: In distribution power systems line transposition is not a common practice and phase loading levels are always changing. Therefore, perfect balance is never achieved at a distribution level. Non-transposed lines can cause unequal voltage drops between phases and this may be further exacerbated by uneven loads in each phase. Consequently, the voltage magnitude of a certain phase may suffer a severe decrease, breaching the lower voltage limit or unbalanced three-phase voltages at a remote bus may violate the percentage voltage imbalance accepted in the standards. This paper examines the mechanism of causing uneven voltage drops and investigates the impacts of unbalanced line configurations with different phase loading levels on network voltage imbalance. Methodologies are proposed to analyze voltage drops affected by line and load imbalance. Based on these methods, general guidelines are recommended to mitigate the voltage problems, which are useful for network analysis, planning and reconfiguration.

Abstract: A high impedance fault (HIF) is characterized by a small, nonlinear, random, unstable, and widely varying fault current in a power distribution system. HIFs draw very low fault currents, and hence are not always effectively cleared by conventional overcurrent relays. Various schemes are proposed to detect such faults. This paper presents a method to detect HIFs using a tool based on mathematical morphology (MM). The method is implemented alongside the conventional overcurrent relay at the substation to improve the performance of this relay in detecting HIFs. It is rigorously tested on standard test systems using PSCAD/EMTDC (R) to generate test waveforms, and Matlab (R) to implement the method. Simulation results show that the proposed method is fast, secure, and dependable.

Abstract: A two-stage framework for transformer maintenance management is introduced and formulated in Part I of this two-part paper in the context of transmission asset management strategies (TAMS). The proposed model optimizes maintenance outage schedule over a predefined period of time by taking into account the actual and expected transformer assets' condition dynamics in terms of failure rate and resource limitations in midterm horizons, as well as operating constraints, economic considerations and N-1 reliability in the shorter term. In Part II, a small six-bus system is first used to demonstrate how the two-stage maintenance framework works using a step-by-step procedure. Then, IEEE-RTS is used to investigate the performance of the proposed model in more detail. In addition, the impacts of varying the characteristics of the proposed midterm and short-term maintenance schedulers, such as flexibility in time horizon selection, on maintenance scheduling results and computational efficiency are investigated on IEEE-RTS. The numerical studies indicate that the proposed framework gives appropriate results in terms of economics and technical constraints at a reasonable computational cost.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel probabilistic power flow (PPF) algorithm considering generation dispatch. The intent is to examine the influence of uncertainty due to photovoltaic (PV) generation resources and loads. PV generation uncertainty may have a significant impact on transmission systems since this resource is easily influenced by changing environmental conditions. However, it is prudent to include generation dispatch in the PPF algorithm since the dispatching strategy compensates for PV generation injections and influences the uncertainty in the results. The proposed PPF algorithm is based on the cumulant method. The Gram-Charlier expansion is applied to approximate the distribution of probabilistic variables. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a probabilistic optimal power dispatching strategy which considers uncertainty problems in the economic dispatch and optimizes the expected value of the total cost with the overload probability as a constraint. The Arizona area of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system is used to test the proposed PPF algorithm and compare results with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS).

In this paper, a power flow algorithm for three-phase four-wire distribution networks with protective multiple earthing (PME), during an open neutral condition, is presented. This algorithm is based on a modified backwards-forwards technique. Additionally, the return current flow is explicitly modeled. Results from three different distribution feeders with different load un-balance and topology are presented and discussed. Furthermore, the effects of the grounding resistances, the load model (constant admittance or constant power), and the neutral breakage point (abruption point) on the voltage levels, are investigated.

Abstract: The PV penetration level of a distribution system is often limited by the violation of voltage variation caused by large intermittent power generation. This study investigates the use of a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) in reactive power compensation for system voltage control, during peak solar irradiation, in order to increase the PV installation capacity of a distribution feeder and avoid the voltage violation problem. PV power generation is simulated using hourly solar irradiation and temperature data provided by the weather bureau. The voltage variation at the point of common coupling (PCC) is also derived by executing the 3-phi load flow analysis to determine the maximum PV power injection without causing voltage violation. By applying the proposed voltage control scheme of DSTATCOM during high solar irradiation periods, the total power generation and the total energy delivered by the PV system over one year are determined according to the annual duration of solar irradiation. The annual sales of PV power, the system O & M cost, the cost of DSTATCOM installation and the initial capital investment for a PV system are then used to calculate the cash flow over the system life-cycle and the final net present value (NPV) of the PV project. With the proposed DSTATCOM voltage control to perform reactive power compensation, the optimal installation capacity of PV systems can be determined by maximizing the net present value of the system to ensure the best cost-effectiveness of the PV project and to better utilize solar energy.

Abstract: A method of estimating the electromechanical modes and mode shapes from multiple synchrophasors is presented in this paper. The approach is based upon identifying the transfer function representation of the state space model of the linearized power system through the estimation of a multichannel AutoRegressive Moving Average eXogenous (ARMAX) model. The relationship between the transfer function and the ARMAX model, which is fully derived here, is shown to be general enough that virtually any multichannel ARMAX estimation algorithm may be applied to this approach. The two-stage least squares (2SLS) algorithm is used here for illustrative purposes. The proposed method is validated with the Monte Carlo procedure using simulated data from a reduced-order model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system. The performance of the new method is compared with existing multichannel mode and mode shape estimation techniques and is seen to provide increased estimation accuracy with a decrease in computation time. The proposed method is further validated with measured data from the WECC system.

Abstract: A closed-loop robust distribution state estimator was investigated. An approach that is suitable for medium voltage distribution networks which are either under-determined with limited real-time measurements or over-determined but with delayed information from smart meters was developed. The state estimator was designed to be robust against the effect of measurement errors, the type, location and accuracy of measurements, as well as temporary failure of the smart metering communication system. A machine learning function provides reliable input information to a robust state estimation algorithm. The output of the state estimator is then fed back to the machine learning function creating a closed-loop information flow which improves the performance of the state estimator. Test results and analysis on a 33-node system are provided.

Abstract: The availability of reliable energy sources for all people, especially electricity, indicates an imbalance in the living conditions of a society. Therefore, new systems must be implemented to couple energy storage and renewable energy generation for the grid reliability improvement and increase access to electricity. This paper proposes a methodology to establish a general index focused on the insertion of distributed photovoltaic generation and energy storage using batteries. This methodology was applied in the IEEE 14-bus electric power system with load variation from different energy providers for the period of one year. The simulation results allow of the best performance evaluation to add distributed photovoltaic generation and/or energy storage in a real electric power system in different buses. The proposed methodology will allow planners to at the same time visualize different aspects by means of a single index that includes technical, economic and environmental aspects.

Abstract: The share of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to increase significantly in the vehicle market sales in the forthcoming years. Uncontrolled charging of EVs can affect adversely the normal operation of the power system, especially at the distribution level. This paper proposes a distributed, multi-agent EV charging control method based on the Nash Certainty Equivalence Principle that considers network impacts. Convergence of the method when the EVs control agents are uncoupled and weakly-coupled is discussed. The efficiency of the proposed management system is evaluated through simulation of a realistic, urban distribution network.

Abstract: Although wind power as a renewable energy is assumed to be an advantageous source of energy, its intermittent nature causes difficulties especially in the islanding mode of operation. Conventional synchronous generators can help to compensate for wind fluctuations, but the slow behavior of such systems may result in stability concerns. Here, the virtual inertia method, which imitates the kinetic inertia of synchronous generator, is used to improve the system dynamic behavior. Since the proposed method focuses on short-term oscillations and incorporates no long-term power regulation, it needs no mass storage device. Thus, the method is economical. To prevent any additional cost, the rotating mass connected to the DFIG shaft or a super-capacitor connected to the DC-link of a back-to-back inverter of a wind power generator could be used. The concept and the proposed control methods are discussed in detail. Eigen-value analysis is used to study how the proposed method improves system stability. The advantages and disadvantages of using DFIG rotating mass or super-capacitor as the virtual inertia source are compared. The proposed approach also shows that while virtual inertia is not incorporated directly in long-term frequency and power regulation, it may enhance the system steady-state behavior indirectly. A time domain simulation is used to verify the results of the analytical studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a new methodology for allocating transmission system costs in single or interconnected energy markets. Initially, the proposed method allows the decomposition of the total transmission cost into two components: the first corresponds to the utilized network capacity, estimated at a specified operating condition, and the second refers to the transmission capacity available but not used in the system. A technique for decomposing nodal tariffs per subsystem guarantees the applicability of the method to interconnected markets. From the proposed procedure, it is possible to determine the responsibility of each participant (or group of participants) in the use of any specified set of transmission elements. The flexibility of this method allows the establishment of criteria based on economic and technical aspects for cost allocation of internal circuits of each subsystem, as well as of the tie elements between the subsystems. Important characteristics of the proposed methodology, such as transparency, impartiality, and flexibility, are analyzed and illustrated based on numerical applications with the IEEE Reliability Test System. Experience with the Brazilian transmission network is also discussed.

Abstract: Robust design methods for power systems must deal with the fixed-structure of controllers and the system large dimension. This limits the applicability of the available design methods. In this paper, the power system stabilizer (PSS) design is posed as a multiobjective optimization problem combining performance and robustness requirements. Robustness is dealt with using concepts of pseudospectra. Evolutionary algorithms are used to solve the multiobjective optimization problem. The method is applied to a small test system, in order to clarify its characteristics and to the New England New York test system, selected for comparison purposes since it is a widely used test system.

Abstract: A traditional distribution network carries electricity from a central power resource to consumers, and the power dispatch is controlled centrally. Distributed generators (DGs) emerge as an alternative power resource to distribution networks at a smaller and distributed scale, which will bring benefits such as reduced voltage drop and loss. However, because most of high penetration DGs are not utility owned and characterized by high degree of uncertainty such as solar and wind, the distribution network may perform differently from the conventionally expected behaviors. How to dynamically and efficiently manage the power dispatch in a distribution network to balance the supply and demand by considering the variability of DGs and loads becomes a significant research issue. In this paper, a multi-agent system (MAS) was proposed to solve this problem through introducing five types of autonomous agents, the electricity management mechanisms, the agent communication ontology, and the agent cooperation strategy. The simulation of the MAS by using InterPSS, JADE and JUNE well demonstrates the performance of the system on dynamic supply and demand balance by considering both efficiency and economy.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of line outage detection in an area external to the operating area boundaries. The so-called "internal system" is assumed to be fully observable and the base case topology of the external system is assumed to be known. A limited number of phasor measurements are also assumed to be available from the external system. The paper takes advantage of the equivalent representation of a line outage by a pair of injections at the line's terminal buses and formulates the outage detection problem as an integer programming problem. Results are verified by simulating various external line outage scenarios using the IEEE 118-bus test system.

Abstract: A fast islanding detection tool can help power dispatchers monitor and control power system operations. Frequency monitoring network (FNET) is a low cost and quickly deployable wide-area phasor measurement system at the distribution system level. The frequency disturbance recorder (FDR) in FNET is actually a single-phase phasor measurement unit (PMU) installed at ordinary 120 V outlets in the sense that it measures the voltage phase angle, amplitude, and frequency from a single-phase voltage source. Based on the data collected by the FDRs deployed in the North American power grid, two islanding detection methods, the frequency difference method and the change of angle difference method, are proposed. The nine real cases recorded, including islanding cases, generation trip cases, load shedding cases and oscillation cases, are presented to verify the proposed methods of islanding detection. Sensitivity analysis on the thresholds of the frequency deviation and angle deviation is done based on the real-measurement data for obtaining the insensitive interval of two thresholds. The results show that the proposed methods can correctly detect power system islanding, and will not be falsely triggered by generation trips, load shedding and system oscillations.

Abstract: This paper describes a computational technique for the phase shaping of the power system stabilizer in a power plant that will improve its contribution to the satisfactory damping of the generator rotor oscillations over the entire electromechanical frequency range: from the intraplant to the interarea modes. To this end, the method utilizes a synthetic system as test bench, in which the external system characteristic seen from the generator terminals is automatically changed, with a wide and coordinated variation in its parameters, to produce a sequence of electromechanical modes similar to those experienced by the generator and associated controllers when connected to a large multimachine power system.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an architecture for voltage regulation in distribution networks that relies on controlling reactive power injections provided by distributed energy resources (DERs). A local controller on each bus of the network monitors the bus voltage and, whenever there is a voltage violation, it uses locally available information to estimate the amount of reactive power that needs to be injected into the bus in order to correct the violation. If the DERs connected to the bus can collectively provide the reactive power estimated by the local controller, they are instructed to do so. Otherwise, the local controller initiates a request for additional reactive power support from other controllers at neighboring buses through a distributed algorithm that relies on a local exchange of information among neighboring controllers. We show that the proposed architecture helps prevent voltage violations and shapes the voltage profile in radial distribution networks, even in the presence of considerable penetration of variable generation and loads. We present several case studies involving 8-, 13-, and 123-bus distribution systems to illustrate the operation of the architecture.

Abstract: A large fraction of new distributed generation will use renewable sources, and cannot be treated as conventional generators due to high variability. Energy storage is a natural mechanism for absorbing variability, and hence minimizing costly reliance on generator reserves. We consider a simple scenario in which energy imbalances are allocated to energy storage, representing either cooperation with a renewable producer or competitive operation in markets. The optimal storage scheduling strategy is shown to be an inventory control-like policy, which through mild approximation yields affine relationships with the state variables. We develop and numerically evaluate suboptimal policies that approximately incorporate the effects of correlation. Further approximation enables us to characterize the Nash equilibria arising between generation and storage, which we use to analyze strategic effects. Specifically, we find that inefficient storage can lead to non-socially optimal behavior.

Abstract: It is difficult to estimate how much distributed generation (DG) capacity will be connected to distribution systems in the coming years; however, it is certain that increasing penetration levels require robust tools that help assess the capabilities and requirements of the networks in order to produce the best planning and control strategies. The work of this Task Force is focused on the numerous strategies and methods that have been developed in recent years to address DG integration and planning. This paper contains a critical review of the work in this field. Although there have been numerous publications in this area, widespread implementation of the methods has not taken place. The barriers to implementation of the advanced techniques are outlined, highlighting why network operators have been slow to pick up on the research to date. Furthermore, key challenges ahead which remain to be tackled are also described, many of which have come into clear focus with the current drive towards smarter distribution networks.

Abstract: Wind generator (WG) output is a function of wind speed and three-phase terminal voltage. Distribution systems are predominantly unbalanced. A WG model that is purely a function of wind speed is simple to use with unbalanced three-phase power flow analysis but the solution is inaccurate. These errors add up and become pronounced when a single three-phase feeder connects several WGs. Complete nonlinear three-phase WG models are accurate but are slow and unsuitable for power flow applications. This paper proposes artificial neural network (ANN) models to represent type-3 doubly-fed induction generator and type-4 permanent magnet synchronous generator. The proposed approach can be readily applied to any other type of WGs. The main advantages of these ANN models are their mathematical simplicity, high accuracy with unbalanced systems and computational speed. These models were tested with the IEEE 37-bus test system. The results show that the ANN WG models are computationally ten times faster than nonlinear accurate models. In addition, simplicity of the proposed ANN WG models allow easy integration into commercial software packages such as PSS (R) E and PSS (R) SINCAL and implementations are also shown in this paper.

Abstract: For application of a large number of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to system frequency regulation, a distributed acquisition approach based on consensus filtering is proposed, where frequency-measuring function is performed only at distribution substations. Limited communication between neighboring PEVs/distribution substations can facilitate consistent and accurate acquisition of frequency deviation signals for all PEVs. Considering the battery charging/discharging characteristics, a dynamic PEV model with feedback control is further proposed and integrated with frequency regulation based on distributed acquisition. Asymptotical stabilities of distributed acquisition and system frequency regulation are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide consistent and accurate control signals for a large number of PEVs and obtain better regulation than general decentralized control in terms of eliminating noise, improving robustness and reducing device costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel probabilistic distribution load flow (PDLF) algorithm to study the effect of connecting a wind turbine (WT) to a distribution system. This probabilistic approach is used to capture the stochastic behavior of the generation of WTs. Three different models of WTs are developed to be embedded in the PDLF. Consequently, a probabilistic approach to evaluate the impact of wind penetration into distribution systems is developed. Futhermore, the effect of WT penetration on feeder losses, voltage profile and substation powers is presented.

Abstract: The paper presents a supplementary VSC-HVDC Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller based on wide area measurement signals (WAMS). The controller is designed as Multi Input Single Output (MISO) using a Modal Linear Quadratic Gaussian (MLQG) methodology in order to target critical inter-area electromechanical modes. The approach has been tested on a large (16 machine, 68 bus) test network incorporating parallel HVDC/AC transmission and has shown improved damping compared to a traditional Power System Stabilizer (PSS) based controller structure utilizing local signals. The design process has incorporated the effects of wide area signal transmission delays. Variation in these signal delays and the complete loss of signals has been also investigated to establish the robustness of the WAMS based controller and its sensitivity to loss of signals. Extension of the controller to incorporate reactive power modulation has been investigated, as has variation in available active power modulation capacity. The proposed controller performance has been assessed through small and large disturbance analysis.

Abstract: The emergence of smart grid technologies in terms of advanced communication infrastructure, embedded intelligence, diagnostics and monitoring capabilities offers new opportunities for improved transmission asset management strategies (TAMS). Accordingly, power system operators are currently looking for analytics that can make use of transmission asset condition monitors and data already available to make better-informed decisions. This two-part paper introduces a two-stage maintenance scheduler for power transmission assets. Part I begins with the motivation for TAMS and then continues with a two-stage maintenance management model that incorporates joint midterm and short-term maintenance. The first stage involves a midterm asset maintenance scheduler that explicitly considers the asset condition dynamics in terms of failure rate. The second stage introduces a short-term maintenance scheduler with N-1 reliability that schedules the output of the midterm maintenance scheduler in the short run. The midterm and short-term stages are completely decoupled schemes to make the problem computationally tractable. For the sake of exposition here, we focus on the maintenance of grid transformers. The proposed methodology is general, however, and can be extended to other network equipments as well. The characteristics of the proposed model and its benefits are investigated in Part II through several case studies.

Abstract: Stochastic optimal power flow can provide the system operator with adequate strategies for controlling the power flow to maintain secure operation under stochastic parameter variations. One limitation of stochastic optimal power flow has been that only line flows have been used as security constraints. In many systems voltage stability and small-signal stability also play an important role in constraining the operation.
In this paper we aim to extend the stochastic optimal power flow problem to include constraints for voltage stability as well as small-signal stability. This is done by approximating the voltage stability and small-signal stability constraint boundaries with second-order approximations in parameter space. Then we refine methods from mathematical finance to be able to estimate the probability of violating the constraints.
In this first part of the paper, we derive second-order approximations of stability boundaries in parameter space. In the second part, the approximations will be used to solve a stochastic optimal power flow problem.

Abstract: A method is proposed to reconstruct and track network state from a limited number of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. To deal with the resulting unobservability, the state with bus powers and generator voltages closest to previously estimated values is computed. Those values, treated as pseudo-measurements, are obtained from the last reconstructed state, in a recursive manner. The method involves solving an optimization problem with linear constraints. It is scalable insofar as it accommodates from a few PMUs up to configurations ensuring full network observability. Reconstruction of only a region is possible. These and other features are demonstrated on the Nordic32 test system, with synchronized phasors obtained from detailed time simulation of a situation evolving towards instability. Suitable choices of PMU location and pseudo-measurements are also discussed.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multistage state estimation architecture aimed at including synchronized phasor measurements into power system state estimation. The proposed architecture keeps unchanged the internal structure of existing SCADA-based estimators, so that phasor measurements are separately processed by a distinct estimation module. An additional stage makes use of principles from estimation fusion theory in order to combine SCADA- and PMU-based estimates. The proposed multistage scheme improves the quality of the estimates provided by the SCADA-based estimator and, under certain observability and correlation conditions, provides the same optimal results given by a hybrid simultaneous estimator (that is, an estimator that simultaneously processes both SCADA and PMU measurements). The separate processing of conventional and phasor measurements circumvents the technical challenge of conciliating, within the same estimation structure, data obtained from different measuring channels and gathered at very distinct sampling rates. In addition, the execution times tend to be significantly less than those required by hybrid simultaneous schemes. The paper describes in detail the multistage structure of the proposed state estimator and also addresses the benefits brought about by phasor measurement processing to state estimation accuracy. Results of several case studies conducted on the IEEE 57-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus benchmark systems are used to illustrate the features of the proposed strategy.

Abstract: Significant synergy exists between plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and wind energy: PEVs can be the demand response to mitigate the intermittent wind power outputs, and wind energy can provide low-carbon electricity to PEVs. This paper presents a hierarchical control algorithm to realize this synergy by integrating the PEV charging and wind power scheduling. The control algorithm consists of three levels: the top-level controller optimizes the scheduling for the conventional power plants and wind power; the middle-level controller plans PEV charging to achieve load following based on the battery state of charge and plug-off time of each vehicle; the bottom-level controller uses grid electricity frequency as the feedback cue to control PEV charging and serves as the ancillary service to the grid. Numerical simulations show that the integrated controller can improve the grid frequency regulation and overall electricity generation cost without sacrificing the PEVs charging completion.

Abstract: This paper presents two hybrid heuristic methods for reconfiguration of the radial electrical distribution system. The first stage of the proposed techniques is a circular minimum-branch-current updating mechanism to bypass the local optimum points. Then, by a circular neighbor-chain updating technique, the best known configuration is obtained. The proposed approaches have been tested on the six well-known electrical distribution networks. The results show that the proposed methods have remarkably achieved the best-known optimum solution with more reliability, accuracy and efficiency than many other published methods.

Abstract: Restoring a large-scale power system has always been a complicated and important issue. A lot of research work has been done on different aspects of the whole power system restoration procedure. However, more time will be required to complete the power system restoration process in an actual situation if accurate and real-time system data cannot be obtained. With the development of the wide area monitoring system (WAMS), power system operators are capable of accessing to more accurate data in the restoration stage after a major outage. The ultimate goal of the system restoration is to restore as much load as possible while in the shortest period of time after a blackout, and the restorable load can be estimated by employing WAMS. Moreover, discrete restorable loads are employed considering the limited number of circuit-breaker operations and the practical topology of distribution systems. In this work, a restorable load estimation method is proposed employing WAMS data after the network frame has been reenergized, and WAMS is also employed to monitor the system parameters in case the newly recovered system becomes unstable again. The proposed method has been validated with the New England 39-Bus system and an actual power system in Guangzhou, China.

Abstract: This paper generalizes the recently introduced bilinear formulation of the WLS state estimation problem to those cases in which equality constraints must be explicitly considered. This leads to augmented equation systems in which both state variables and Lagrange multipliers get updated throughout the three stages arising in the bilinear approach (two linear filters with a nonlinear transformation in between). The proposed formulation prevents the ill-conditioning typically arising when exact-injection constraints are handled as virtual measurements with huge weights, while the excellent convergence speed of the bilinear scheme, which for practical purposes reaches the optimal solution in a single iteration, is fully preserved.

Abstract: In centralized day-ahead electricity markets with marginal pricing, unit commitment costs and capacity constraints give rise to non-convexities which may result in losses to some of the participating generating units. To compensate them for these losses, a recovery mechanism is required. In Part I of this two-part paper, we present certain recovery mechanisms that result in recovery payments after the market is cleared. We also propose a methodology for evaluating the bidding strategy behavior of the participating units for each mechanism. In this paper (Part II), we apply this methodology to evaluate the performance and incentive compatibility properties of each recovery mechanism on a test case model representing the Greek joint energy/reserve day-ahead electricity market. Lastly, we perform sensitivity analysis with respect to key parameters and assumptions and we provide directions for further research.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-objective algorithm to solve stochastic distribution feeder reconfiguration (SDFR) problem for systems with distributed wind power generation (WPG) and fuel cells (FC). The four objective functions investigated are 1) the total electrical energy losses, 2) the cost of electrical energy generated, 3) the total emissions produced, and 4) the bus voltage deviation. A probabilistic power flow based on the point estimate method (PEM) is employed to include uncertainty in the WPG output and load demand, concurrently. Different wind penetration strategies are examined to capture all economical, operational and environmental aspects of the problem. An interactive fuzzy satisfying optimization algorithm based on adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) is employed to determine the optimal plan under different conditions. The proposed method is applied to Taiwan Power system and the results are validated in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the coherency identification technique in interconnected power system using independent component analysis (ICA). The ICA is applied to the generator speed and bus angle data to identify the coherent areas of the system. The results of the application of ICA using simulated data from 16-machine 68-bus system model and on data gathered through U. K. University-based Wide-Area Measurement System are presented. The approach is able to identify the cluster of generators and buses following a disturbance in the system. It is also demonstrated that the approach is robust in the presence of noise in measured signal, which is an important factor to be considered for assessing the effectiveness of any measurement-based technique.

Abstract: A data mining approach using ensemble decision trees (DTs) learning is proposed for online dynamic security assessment (DSA), with the objective of mitigating the impact of possibly missing PMU data. Specifically, multiple small DTs are first trained offline using a random subspace method. In particular, the developed random subspace method exploits the hierarchy of wide-area monitoring system (WAMS), the locational information of attributes, and the availability of PMU measurements, so as to improve the overall robustness of the ensemble to missing data. Then, the performance of the trained small DTs is re-checked by using new cases in near real-time. In online DSA, viable small DTs are identified in case of missing PMU data, and a boosting algorithm is employed to quantify the voting weights of viable small DTs. The security classification decision for online DSA is obtained via a weighted voting of viable small DTs. A case study using the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This study utilizes the primal-dual nonlinear interior point algorithm formulated in Part I of this two-series paper, to obtain electricity market supply function equilibrium solutions for the bi-level market problem of nonlinear power systems with AC meshed networks. The strategic offers of the market players are modeled by parameterizing the generation marginal cost functions using any of the four available parameterization methods to obtain profit-maximizing linear supply function bids. The analysis takes into account a variety of test systems and examines the relation between the equilibrium solutions obtained from the different parameterization methods and the role of network complexity. An analysis of multiple equilibria in AC network constrained systems is also provided.

Abstract: This paper presents the comparative results on stability improvement of an offshore wind farm (OWF) fed to a synchronous generator (SG)-based power system using a series static synchronous compensator (SSSC) and a series vectorial compensator (SVeC). The studied OWF with capacity of 80 MW is based on permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) with power converters. To clearly compare the damping contributed by the control devices, the damping controllers of the proposed SSSC and SVeC are properly designed by assigning the mechanical mode and exciter mode of the studied SG-based power system on the same locations of the complex plane using modal control theory. Frequency-domain approach based on eigenvalue analysis and time-domain approach based on nonlinear model simulations are systematically performed. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the SVeC can offer better damping characteristics to both mechanical mode and exciter mode of the studied SG-based power system under various operating conditions and different disturbance conditions than the SSSC.

Abstract: The purpose of unit commitment (UC) for electric utilities is to determine the optimal thermal unit on/off statuses and their MW generations over the scheduled time horizon. The UC problem is formulated to minimize the total generation cost, while the load demand, reserve requirements, and unit constraints are satisfied. Among the UC constraints, an adequate provision of reserve is important to ensure the security of the power system and the frequency-regulating reserve is essential to bring the system frequency back to acceptable level following the loss of a sizable online unit within seconds. In this paper, the authors present and solve a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based UC problem including the frequency-regulating reserve (FRR) constraints to determine the optimal FRR requirements and unit MW schedules for an isolated power system. Simulation results are then compared with those obtained by Lagrangian relaxation-based approach and by the current Taipower operation practice. It is observed that favorable reserve and unit MW schedules are obtained by the proposed method while the system security is maintained.

Abstract: This paper provides a distributed frequency domain algorithm for real-time modal estimation of large power systems using ambient synchrophasor data. By dividing the computation between a supervisory central computer and local optimizations at the substation level, the algorithm efficiently estimates multiple dominant mode frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes from wide-area power system measurements. The algorithm, called distributed frequency domain optimization, is tested on known test systems and archived real power system data from eastern and western power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a model for long-term reactive power planning where a deterministic nonlinear model is expanded into a multi-stage stochastic model under load uncertainty and an N-k contingency analysis. Reactive load shedding is introduced in the objective function to measure the reactive power deficit after the planning process. The objective is to minimize the sum of investment costs (IC), expected operation costs (EOC) and reactive load shedding costs optimizing the sizes and locations of new reactive compensation equipment to ensure power system security in each stage along the planning horizon. An efficient scenario generation and reduction methodology is used for modeling uncertainty. Expected benefits are calculated to establish the performance of the expected value with perfect information (EVPI) and the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) methodologies. The efficacy of the proposed model is tested and justified by the simulation results using the Ward-Hale 6-bus and the IEEE 14-bus systems.

Abstract: This paper deals with an alternative proposition for the steady state modeling of unified power flow controller (UPFC). Since current limitations are determinant to FACTS apparatus design, the proposed current based model (CBM) assumes the current as variable, allowing easy manipulation of current restrictions in optimal power flow evaluations. The performance of the proposed model and of the power injection model (PIM) are compared through a Quasi-Newton optimization approach. Two operating situations of a medium size network with 39 busbars were studied from the point of view of optimization and current limits, observing the performance of the UPFC modeling.

Abstract: In response to the need for the decarbonization of the transport sector, it is expected that large fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) will constitute an important share of the electricity demand. This evolution is likely to be accompanied by a parallel evolution of the electricity supply business with the deployment of smart grid technologies. As a consequence, it is expected that demand will feature higher potential for communication and control, which will enable its active participation in the daily operational planning of power systems. In particular, EVs being equipped with a battery can both defer their demand or inject electricity back into the system. However, to achieve volumes that can have an impact on the system, these demands need to be aggregated and operated as an ensemble. This paper proposes the necessary adaptations to include the input of EV aggregation to electricity markets. This permits the scheduling of EV charging and services in coordination with the system operator thus enhancing the power system's efficiency and security while reducing its environmental impact. Results show that the EVs penetration levels that the system would be able to absorb without requiring expansion of the supply side, are significantly increased when coordination over their charging schedule is performed.

Abstract: Most current regulations allow small-scale electric generation facilities to participate in distributed generation (DG) with few requirements on power-purchase agreements. However, in this paper, it is shown that distribution companies can alternatively encourage DG investors into DG contracts that can significantly benefit the utility network. In this regard, a new algorithm is proposed to determine the best sites, sizes, and optimal payment incentives under such special contracts for committed-type DG projects to offset distribution network investment costs. On one hand, the aim is to allocate DGs such that the present value profit gained by the distribution company is maximized via procuring power from DGs and the market at a minimum expense. On the other hand, each DG unit's individual profit is taken into account to assure that private DG investment remains economical. The algorithm is verified in various cases and the impacts of different factors are accordingly studied.

Abstract: State estimation is applied to process a set of measurements which are assumed to be taken at the same snapshot in time to obtain a best estimate of the states of electric power systems. The beneficial impacts of incorporating phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements into the state estimator have been studied by many researchers. However, the availability of PMU measurements and many practical implementation issues still need to be resolved. This paper addresses one specific and important issue when integrating PMU measurements into the state estimator, namely, determining the optimal buffer length for PMU data. Due to different reporting rates of the conventional measurements and PMU measurements, a memory buffer of PMU measurements is recommended to be processed ahead of the state estimation. The impact of PMU measurement buffer length on state estimation is discussed. A procedure to determine the optimal buffer length of PMU measurements is presented. Processing a buffer of PMU measurements is also helpful for determining the corresponding weights in state estimation.

Abstract: A novel approach for the automatic reconfiguration of shipboard power systems (SPS) based on Q-learning has been investigated. Using this approach it is possible to obtain an optimal set of switches to open/close, in order to restore power to the loads, such that the weighted sum of the power delivered to the loads is maximized. This approach differs significantly from other methods previously studied for reconfiguration as it is a dynamic technique that produces not only the final reconfiguration, but also the correct order in which the switches are to be changed. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

Abstract: Restructuring of the electric power industry along with mandates to integrate renewable energy sources is introducing new challenges for the electric power system. Intermittent power sources, in particular, require mitigation strategies in order to maintain consistent power on the electric grid. We investigate distributed energy storage as one such strategy. Our model for optimal power flow with storage augments the usual formulation by adding simple charge/discharge dynamics for energy storage collocated with load and/or generation buses cast as a finite-time optimal control problem. We first propose a solution strategy that uses a convex optimization based relaxation to solve the optimal control problem. We then use this framework to illustrate the effects of various levels of energy storage using the topology of IEEE benchmark systems along with both time-invariant and demand-based cost functions. The addition of energy storage and demand-based cost functions significantly reduces the generation costs and flattens the generation profiles.

Abstract: With growing numbers of distributed generators (DGs) getting connected to the network, new protection schemes are required. These schemes are aimed at responding to the changing fault current values, bi-directional current flow and distributed generation (DG) at all levels of the grid. For this purpose these schemes utilize comprehensive protection systems with extensive communication and coordination between DGs and protection devices such as relays. This paper details the assignment of two parameters which are critical for proper operation of a microgrid protection system. The first parameter, the fault current coefficient, represents the fault current supplied by any DG to any point inside the network whereas the second parameter is the adjustment of relay hierarchy for selective operation of relays. The automated assignment of these parameters serves the notion of self-operating microgrid protection system. Furthermore, elimination of manual design and calculation facilitates deployment of new DG units and thus makes it possible to design plug-and-play DGs and protection devices.

Abstract: Present renewable portfolio standards are changing power systems by replacing conventional generation with alternate energy resources such as photovoltaic (PV) systems. With the increase in penetration of PV resources, power systems are expected to experience a change in dynamic and operational characteristics. This paper studies the impact of increased penetration of PV systems on static performance as well as transient stability of a large power system, in particular the transmission system. Utility scale and residential rooftop PVs are added to the aforementioned system to replace a portion of conventional generation resources. While steady state voltages are observed under various PV penetration levels, the impact of reduced inertia on transient stability performance is also examined. The studied system is a large test system representing a portion of the Western U.S. interconnection. The simulation results obtained effectively identify both detrimental and beneficial impacts of increased PV penetration both for steady state stability and transient stability performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework based on range arithmetic for solving power flow problems whose input data are specified within real compact intervals. Reliable interval bounds are computed for the power flow problem, which is represented as an optimization model with complementary constraints to properly represent generator bus voltage controls, including reactive power limits and voltage recovery processes. It is demonstrated that the lower and upper bounds of the power flow solutions can be obtained by solving two determinate optimization problems. Several numerical results are presented and discussed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and comparing it to a previously proposed affine arithmetic based solution approach.

Abstract: The application of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements and adaptive wide-area damping control based on federated Kalman filters are investigated. The Kalman filters used for estimating the operating conditions are federated using chisquare variables and a confidence interval. When the power system is operating precisely at a preselected operating point, only the corresponding controller is active. When the power system is not exactly at the operating point, a combined controller is formed. A 68-bus, 16-generator system is used as a test system. Three DC lines, three ESDs, and remote PMU frequencies as added inputs are used as the example control. The simulation results demonstrated the good performances for adaptive damping the inter-area oscillation modes.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient approach for probabilistic transmission expansion planning (TEP) that considers load and wind power generation uncertainties. The Benders decomposition algorithm in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation is used to tackle the proposed probabilistic TEP. An upper bound on total load shedding is introduced in order to obtain network solutions that have an acceptable probability of load curtailment. The proposed approach is applied on Garver six-bus test system and on IEEE 24-bus reliability test system. The effect of contingency analysis, load and mainly wind production uncertainties on network expansion configurations and costs is investigated. It is shown that the method presented can be used effectively to study the effect of increasing wind power integration on TEP of systems with high wind generation uncertainties.

Abstract: Recent technological developments in the wide-area measurement system (WAMS) are realizing centralized controls for improving the power systems stability. The most challenging barrier against these advances relates to communication delays, which are not constant and depend on information system loading. Neglecting this latency could deteriorate the damping performance of closed loop control or even degrade the system stability. This paper designs a fuzzy logic wide-area damping controller (FLWADC) to damp the inter-area oscillations compensating for the continuous latency. The controller is based on the fuzzy logic due to its proven robustness against input signal variations. The proposed controller has three input signals consisting of angular difference, its derivative, and the time latency, which is precisely determined through measured data time tags and the accurate time signal at the controller location. Rule bases of FLWADC are developed such that membership functions of the output variable are accordingly shifted to compensate for the time delay. A standard test bed for dynamic simulations and its expanded version are examined, and numerical evidences are discussed. To generalize the conclusions drawn in the case study, various sets of sensitivity studies are conducted, covering controller parameter changes, power system reconfigurations, and shifting the system operating point.

Abstract: Utilizing battery storage systems (BSSs) can reduce the intermittent output of PV generation systems (PVGSs) and make them dispatchable. The aim of this paper is to design an optimal charging/discharging scheduling for BSSs such that the line loss of distribution systems interconnected with sizeable PVGSs can be minimized. A mathematical model for BSSs which can be used to simulate the charging procedures such as the commonly-used constant current to constant voltage (CC-CV) charging method, the discharging procedures and the state of charge (SOC) is proposed first. The minimum line loss problem considering the intermittent output of PVGSs and the scheduling of BSSs is then formulated based on the BSS mathematical model. The optimal charging/discharging scheduling of BSSs can then be obtained by a genetic algorithm (GA) based method. Test results demonstrate the validity of the proposed mathematical model and optimal charging/discharging scheduling for BSSs.

Abstract: In a competitive electricity market, a generation company (GenCo) optimizes its operation schedules, referred to as self-scheduling, in order to maximize its profit. However, various sources of uncertainty, such as market price fluctuations or forced outage of generating units, may impact the GenCo's profit. In this paper, a non-probabilistic information-gap model is proposed to model the uncertainties in short-term scheduling of a GenCo. The self-scheduling problem is formulated for risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-seeker GenCos. Robustness of the decisions against low market prices are evaluated using a robustness model. Furthermore, windfall higher profit due to unpredicted higher market prices is modeled using an opportunity function. The proposed models are applied to a 54-unit thermal GenCo.

Abstract: Electricity grids are critical infrastructures. They are credible targets of active (e. g., terrorist) attacks since their disruption may lead to sizable losses economically and in human lives. It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective control scheme to simultaneously perform power-fluctuation mitigation and damping improvement of a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based offshore wind farm (OWF) fed to a one-machine infinite-bus (OMIB) system using a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link based on line-commutated converter (LCC). The rectifier current regulator (RCR) and the inverter current regulator (ICR) of the HVDC link are individually designed using modal control theory to render adequate damping to the dominant modes of the synchronous generator (SG) of the studied OMIB system under different operating conditions. A frequency-domain scheme based on eigenvalue analysis and a time-domain method based on nonlinear model simulations are both carried out to compare the damping characteristics of the two damping controllers. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the proposed LCC-HVDC link combined with the designed ICR can render better damping performance to the qualities of the LCC-HVDC and the OWF than the designed RCR.

Abstract: We investigate the constraints on power flow in networks and its implications to the optimal power flow problem. The constraints are described by the injection region of a network; this is the set of all vectors of power injections, one at each bus, that can be achieved while satisfying the network and operation constraints. If there are no operation constraints, we show the injection region of a network is the set of all injections satisfying the conservation of energy. If the network has a tree topology, e. g., a distribution network, we show that under voltage magnitude, line loss constraints, line flow constraints and certain bus real and reactive power constraints, the injection region and its convex hull have the same Pareto-front. The Pareto-front is of interest since these are the optimal solutions to the minimization of increasing functions over the injection region. For non-tree networks, we obtain a weaker result by characterizing the convex hull of the voltage constraint injection region for lossless cycles and certain combinations of cycles and trees.

Abstract: We estimate the capacity value of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with thermal energy storage (TES) in the southwestern U. S. Our results show that incorporating TES in CSP plants significantly increases their capacity value. While CSP plants without TES have capacity values ranging between 60% and 86% of maximum capacity, plants with TES can have capacity values between 79% and 92%. We demonstrate the effect of location and configuration on the operation and capacity value of CSP plants. We also show that using a capacity payment mechanism can increase the capacity value of CSP, since the capacity value of CSP is highly sensitive to operational decisions and energy prices are not a perfect indicator of scarcity of supply.

Abstract: The increased penetration of renewable resources, such as wind and solar, into existing power systems introduces significant uncertainties in the generation side. We propose a method to assess whether power system static state variables, i.e., bus voltage magnitudes and angles, remain within acceptable ranges (with some confidence level), as dictated by system operational requirements, while the system is subject to variations in electricity generation arising from the uncertain nature of renewable resources. These variations are assumed to be unknown but constrained to lie (with some confidence level) within some bounded set. Through set operations, we propagate this set through the power flow model, and the result is another set that contains the possible values that (with some confidence level) the state variables (voltage magnitudes and angles) may take. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus benchmark distribution systems.

Abstract: An energy-based method to locate oscillation sources in power systems is proposed. The energy is identical to the transient energy. The amount of energy is consistent with the oscillation amplitude, and then the component producing energy has negative contribution to the damping and is considered as the oscillation source. The consistency of energy dissipation with damping torque of a generator is proved. A method to compute energy flow in the network based on wide area measurement system data and independent of energy functions is proposed. The energy dissipation or production of a component in the system can be obtained from the net energy flow. The components producing energy are oscillation sources and emergency control actions should be taken on them. The method is validated by simulations and actual oscillation incidents analyses.

Abstract: This paper investigates a secondary voltage control based on a graph partitioning method. The method divides the power system into regions to eventually prevent the propagation of disturbances and to minimize the interaction between these regions. The optimized number of regions is found based on the bus voltage sensitivity to disturbances being applied to loads in each region. Then, a number of representative buses are labelled as pilot buses displaying the critical point for voltage control in each region. The control uses decentralized controllers to eliminate voltage violations resulting from load variations and disturbances in the system. The decentralized controllers are implemented by fuzzy logic which is trained via offline simulations; they inject required reactive power into the regions to correct voltage violations. The methodology is applied to the IEEE 118-bus network. The results show the performance and ability of graph partitioning and fuzzy secondary voltage control to regulate the voltage and to avoid propagation of disturbances between regions.

Abstract: Under frequency load shedding (UFLS) and under voltage load shedding (UVLS) are attracting more attention, as large disturbances occur more frequently than in the past. Usually, these two schemes work independently from each other, and are not designed in an integrated way to exploit their combined effect on load shedding. Besides, reactive power is seldom considered in the load shedding process. To fill this gap, we propose in this paper a new centralized, adaptive load shedding algorithm, which uses both voltage and frequency information provided by phasor measurement units (PMUs). The main contribution of the new method is the consideration of reactive power together with active power in the load shedding strategy. Therefore, this method addresses the combined voltage and frequency stability issues better than the independent approaches. The new method is tested on the IEEE 39-Bus system, in order to compare it with other methods. Simulation results show that, after large disturbance, this method can bring the system back to a new stable steady state that is better from the point of view of frequency and voltage stability, and loadability.

Abstract: Electrical layout design is a key element in offshore wind farm planning, with a critical impact on both plant cost and reliability. Offshore Windfarm Layout optimizer (OWL) has been developed to efficiently find optimal electrical layouts in affordable computation times. The tool includes the possibility of HVDC connection and incorporates an approximation of losses, as well as stochasticity in wind inputs and component failures.
OWL has been applied to several case studies including Barrow Offshore Wind Farm. OWL produces a significant cost reduction over the actually implemented design, with total realizable savings of EUR 800 k. The optimal layout includes redundant elements and deviates from a symmetrical pattern, therefore showing that a full optimization of the layout, rather than the selection of a pre-defined configuration, is necessary in order to fully capture efficiencies.
The model relies on MIP and exploits the structure of the problem via decomposition strategies. Two different approaches have been developed, both resulting in substantial time savings. Benders' decomposition has been further improved by the addition of partially relaxed cuts and the application of scenario aggregation techniques. In addition, the Progressive Contingency Incorporation algorithm proposed by the authors is applied. Computation time savings reach two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a novel mathematical model to describe the localized economic impact of load recovery by electricity consumers following demand response (DR) event participation. In this model-termed "securitization"-cost and benefit associated with an amount of load recovery change exponentially with time-varying stochastic discount rates. These volatile rates, which can be estimated using the principle of Brownian motion, are further examined via case studies on the Roy Billinton test system. A formal application of the proposed recovery model to the crucial task of global DR scheduling is then studied. The study indicates that it is possible to optimize a DR schedule to cater for uncertainty in the subsequent load recovery.

Abstract: This paper presents commissioning details of a coordinated reactive power-voltage controller (CQVC) installed in a multimachine steam power plant (SPP). The CQVC regulates reactive power and voltage of a 1992MVA multimachine SPP. After briefly introducing basic control principles and relevant details about the CQVC's implementation, CQVC parameterization and tuning are thoroughly discussed. Once commissioned, the CQVC performance under various operating conditions is assessed. It is shown that the CQVC successfully maintains an HV busbar voltage and allocates reactive power to participating generators in accordance to their capability. Numerous CQVC responses recorded at the site are presented to demonstrate controller's performance under normal and extreme plant and network operating conditions.

Abstract: Increasing power system security is crucial to the future of the electric power grid. In this paper, we define a new class of cyberattacks to power systems-malicious modification of network data stored in an accessible database. Grounded in multivariate statistical process control, our approach to intrusion detection ensures data integrity in power system operations. We develop an algorithm that monitors power flow results and detects anomalies in the input values that could have been modified by cyberattacks. Our algorithm uses principal component analysis to separate power flow variability into regular and irregular subspaces. Analysis of the information in the irregular subspace determines whether the power system data has been compromised. We verify the efficacy of the algorithm using both the IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus reliability test systems. The results show that the developed algorithm is a promising enhancement to data security procedures in a control center.

Abstract: This paper presents the methodological basis for the computation of the capacity factor (CF) of the power delivered by an off-grid droop-regulated microgrid when the power is injected by distributed stochastic generation. More particularly, the paper is focused on wind generation and its modeling particularities. It shows how the availability of power can be efficiently sampled by a low variation Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method, supplemented with a restricted pairing technique to account for correlation among generating units. The paper also presents a minimization problem that, combined with a Fischer-Burmeister-based formulation, permits obtaining the maximum deliverable power at each sample. This paper additionally shows a first numerical analysis of a 14-node microgrid supplied by five Enercon E40. The analysis includes an investigation into the best model that represents the CF of the microgrid, and highlights the effects of correlation and maximum loadability.

Abstract: Frequency response and residue are the two popular methods of designing damping controller. However, due to practical limitations, the former is limited to local controller design, which is not preferable for damping inter-area modes. Although the latter benefits wide area control, it strongly relies on the open loop dynamic model of power system which, for large systems, is hard to obtain. This paper, therefore, combines the two methods to design a wide area damping controller which obviates the need for identifying the open loop dynamic model. The method includes feedback loop selection, residue phase calculation and power system stabilizer (PSS) tuning using modal decomposition control (MDC). The core issue, residue phase calculation, has been validated in a two-area four-machine system and the whole procedure for wide area damping controller design was performed in a real power system, China Southern Grid. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and effective in real power systems.

Abstract: In this paper, a new optimization problem is proposed to determine the maximum distributed generation (DG) penetration level by optimally selecting types, locations and sizes of utility owned DG units. The DG penetration level could be limited by harmonic distortion because of the nonlinear current injected by inverter-based DG units and also protection coordination constraints because of the variation in fault current caused by synchronous-based DG units. Hence the objective of the proposed problem is to maximize DG penetration level from both types of DG units, taking into account power balance constraints, bus voltage limits, total and individual harmonic distortion limits specified by the IEEE-519 standard, over-current relay operating time limits, and protection coordination constraints. The DG penetration study is formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem and tested on the IEEE-30 bus looped distribution network with ten load and DG scenarios. Similarly, feasibility assessment of customer owned DG unit installations considering power quality and protection coordination is also studied. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can serve as an efficient planning tool for utility operators.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel model to estimate the electric energy consumption of light duty fleet of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). This model can be used to evaluate the impacts of plugging such loads in distribution networks. Both vehicles users' habits and diversity of usage are considered in the presented model, as well as different electric ranges and ambient temperature effect. Moreover, the paper proposes a method to optimally allocate distributed generation (DG) units in the distribution network to mitigate the impacts of high penetration of PEVs. The proposed model shall help the local distribution companies (LDC) to better assess the expected effects of PEVs on their networks and evaluate the required upgrades. Furthermore, the proposed DG allocation methodology helps to identify the optimal buses on which to connect these DG units in the presence of high PEVs penetration. A genetic based approach is utilized for the planning problem of determining the optimal locations and sizes of DG units, which is defined as a multi-objective mixed integer programming.

Abstract: The lifetime of transmission and distribution power systems is long and thus, long-term plans are needed for their successful development. In generating long-term scenarios, the starting point is the analysis of the present electricity consumption. The data of electricity consumption will become more exact by the end of 2013, when hourly based automated meter reading (AMR) consumption data will be received from each customer in Finland. The amount of data is huge and powerful analysis methods are needed. This paper presents a method for clustering the electricity consumptions using principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. AMR data of 18 098 customers from two city districts of Helsinki, Finland is applied for a case study reported in this paper. A multiple regression analysis is also carried out on the two largest clusters to find the most important explanatory factors for the load modeling. The interpretations of the clusters and the plausibility of the regression coefficients are considered very important. Five distinct and meaningful clusters are found. The regression models give interesting insights into the explanatory factors behind electricity consumption. The models of the main customer groups assist the distribution system operator (DSO) in the long-term development of the power system.

Abstract: This paper deals with day-ahead static security assessment with respect to a postulated set of contingencies while taking into account uncertainties about the next day system conditions. We propose a heuristic approach to compute the worst-case under operation uncertainty for a contingency with respect to overloads. We formulate this problem as a non-convex nonlinear bilevel program that we solve approximately by a heuristic approach which relies on the solution of successive optimal power flow (OPF) and security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problems of a special type. The method aims at revealing those combinations of uncertainties and contingencies for which the best combination of preventive and corrective actions would not suffice to ensure security. Extensive numerical results on a small, a medium, and a very large system prove the interest of the approach.

Abstract: This paper describes a power management method in a feeder with distributed generations (DGs) and energy storage devices. To ensure stability, reliability, and safety of the system, the proposed power management method deals with the DGs in two groups, which are utility and independent power producer (IPP). When the feeder is islanded from grid, the utility-owned DG receives fault signal from the protection relay. Thereafter, it is allowed to operate itself when the feeder is islanded because it is directly controlled by the utility. In contrast, the IPP-owned DG should be stopped to avoid several problems, which can be caused by the islanding operation. Then, the proposed power management method operates the above DGs to maximize the efficiency with no serious impact to grid. To do so, the inverter controller of DG is designed to implement it in a part of practical distribution system, which is located at the Do-gok area in Seoul, Korea. Several case studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of proposed method.

Abstract: Power system model quality is key to safe and reliable electricity delivery. In this paper, a novel method using disturbance data recorded by phasor measurement units (PMUs) is proposed to improve the integrity of dynamic models, which consists of both model validation and model parameter identification. In the model validation step, event playback is applied to simulate the model's response for a rigorous comparison with measured response captured by PMUs. A large mismatch indicates model deficiency. In the parameter identification step, an automatic calibration method using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) techniques and trajectory sensitivity analysis is formulated to save significant effort and time from manual tuning. Case studies are presented to demonstrate that the proposed method has adequate performance for model validation and parameter calibration in terms of accuracy, good convergence speed and robustness with respect to measurement noises. The proposed method is cost-effective and complements traditional equipment testing for improving dynamic model quality.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel way to model the generation capacity expansion problem in a liberalized framework via a multi-year bilevel equilibrium model. In the upper level the competing generation companies maximize their individual profits, while the lower level represents the market using a conjectured-price response approach, which allows us to vary the strategic spot market behavior, to see how much the reigning competitive behavior impacts investment decisions. The bilevel equilibrium model is formulated as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints, transformed into a mixed integer linear program and solved as such using diagonalization in order to verify equilibria. We present a case study to apply this new modeling approach and to demonstrate that the proposed equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints can have multiple solutions whose respective investments can vary.

Abstract: Reliability is a key objective in many optimal design problems. Very often this criterion is incorporated into stochastic optimization problems by introducing contingency evaluation scenarios. This results in a special problem structure where the stochastic scenarios used to describe reliability are linked to the failure of specific individual elements. This paper presents a progressive contingency incorporation (PCI) approach that takes advantage of this structure to increase efficiency. The algorithm is applied to the design of an offshore wind farm, where the electrical layout is decided, as representative of the possible advantages of PCI within power systems. The problem must determine the placement and type of cables in a collector system. Results show that time savings achieved by the PCI approach can be remarkable, reaching two orders of magnitude for the case study.

Abstract: The medium-term planning for a company participating in a pure pool market can be considered under different behavioral principles: cartel, endogenous cartel with respect to hydro generation, and equilibrium. One of the important aspects of the model is the medium-term load matching, where load is represented by the load duration curves of each period into which the medium-term horizon is subdivided.
The probabilistically exact Bloom and Gallant formulation of load matching could be employed, but its exponential number of load-matching inequality constraints limits its use to small cases. A heuristic has been proposed where only a small subset of the load-matching constraints, hopefully containing the active ones at the optimizer, is employed. This heuristic does not perform totally well with the more complex models, as those of endogenous cartel and equilibrium behavior, and a more comprehensive heuristic procedure is presented here. A well-known alternative method of medium-term load matching is the multi-block approximation to the load duration curve.
The three load-matching techniques mentioned above are here described and are compared, and computational results for realistic systems are analyzed for the different behavioral models, showing the advantages of each procedure.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to determine the optimal location of a resistive superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) for enhancing the transient stability of an electric power grid (EPG). To select the optimal location of the SFCL, the sensitivity analysis of the angular separation of the rotors of synchronous machines present in the power system is introduced. The optimal location of the SFCL in EPG is coordinated with the corresponding optimal resistive value to improve transient stability and low-frequency oscillation damping performance of the system. It is shown that the SFCL can have different impacts (positive and negative) in function of its location in the EPG when a fault occurs. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the IEEE benchmarked four-machine two-area test system is used to carry out several case studies. The results show that the optimal location of SFCL combined with its optimal resistive value reduces the angular separation of the rotors that improves effectively the system stability during a fault.

Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm to estimate the optimal importance sampling (IS) probability distribution in generating capacity reliability (GCR) problems. The proposed approach results from a combination of the cross-entropy (CE) concepts with the standard analytical GCR assessment. A mathematical analysis of the CE equations is carried out to demonstrate that the optimal change of measure or distortion can be obtained by simply dividing the annualized GCR indices for two different configurations of the generating system. Under these hypotheses, a straightforward algorithm based on fast Fourier transform is proposed to systematically obtain the optimal distorted unavailabilities for all generating units in the system. The accuracy and computational performance of the proposed approach are compared with the standard CE optimization process using different generating systems. The IEEE-RTS 79, IEEE-RTS 96, and two configurations of the Brazilian South-Southeastern system are all used for this purpose.

Abstract: Flexible AC transmission systems, so-called FACTS devices, can help reduce power flow on overloaded lines, which would result in an increased loadability of the power system, fewer transmission line losses, improved stability and security and, ultimately, a more energy-efficient transmission system. In order to find suitable FACTS locations more easily and with more flexibility, this paper presents a graphical user interface (GUI) based on a genetic algorithm (GA) which is shown able to find the optimal locations and sizing parameters of multi-type FACTS devices in large power systems. This user-friendly tool, called the FACTS Placement Toolbox, allows the user to pick a power system network, determine the GA settings and select the number and types of FACTS devices to be allocated in the network. The GA-based optimization process is then applied to obtain optimal locations and ratings of the selected FACTS to maximize the system static loadability. Five different FACTS devices are implemented: SVC, TCSC, TCVR, TCPST and UPFC. The simulation results on IEEE test networks with up to 300 buses show that the FACTS placement toolbox is effective and flexible enough for analyzing a large number of scenarios with mixed types of FACTS to be optimally sited at multiple locations simultaneously.

Abstract: There is concern that the levels of inertia in power systems may decrease in the future, due to increased levels of energy being provided from renewable sources, which typically have little or no inertia. Voltage source converters (VSC) used in high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission applications are often deliberately controlled in order to de-couple transients to prevent propagation of instability between interconnected systems. However, this can deny much needed support during transients that would otherwise be available from system inertia provided by rotating plant.
This paper proposes a novel VSC-HVDC control system termed "INEC" (INertia Emulation Control) which enables a VSC-HVDC system to provide support that emulates the inertia of a synchronous generator (SG). The energy to do so comes from the capacitance of the HVDC connection, which may be augmented by the installation of additional capacitance. This paper indicates that the proposed INEC system allows a VSC-HVDC system with a fixed capacitance to emulate a wide range of inertia constants (H) by specifying the amount of permissible DC voltage variation. The proposed INEC scheme has been demonstrated through simulations, and its performance is evaluated for transients that include faults and also changes in load.

Abstract: Although wind generation is emissions- and cost-free, real-time output can be highly variable and uncertain. This can require additional conventional generating capacity to be committed. Since the efficiency of emissions controls can depend on generator loading, this additional capacity can increase generator emissions rates. Another method of accommodating wind is using demand response, which has system loads that more closely follow supply. Using a case study based on the Texas power system, we examine the emissions and cost impacts of using these two strategies to accommodate wind. While we find that wind decreases loading and increases emissions rates of generators, it has a positive net emissions benefit overall. We also find that while demand response reduces some of the emissions benefits of wind, combining wind and demand response provides more cost-effective emissions abatement than wind alone.

Abstract: Long-term investment for large-scale low voltage (LV) (0.4 kV in the U. K.) networks is one of the key issues concerned by distribution network operators (DNOs). The major difficulties in carrying out long-term LV distribution network investment at the system level are the extensiveness of these networks and the very limited network information, such as utilizations of transformers and circuits.
To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes a novel statistical method for quantifying the reinforcement costs in LV distribution networks driven by demand growth. The triangular probability distribution is used to represent the distribution of utilization levels of circuits and transformers in LV networks, allowing the assessment of the scale of network assets to be reinforced based on probabilities. The demand driven reinforcement for a given period is evaluated in terms of thermal violation and voltage violation. Total reinforcement costs are determined based on the evaluated proportions of assets to be reinforced, their unit costs and total amount. The proposed statistical method is implemented into a practical distribution system in Great Britain (GB).

Abstract: In this paper, a novel cooperative protocol has been proposed to provide a proper voltage control for multiple feeders having a transformer tap-changer (LTC), unbalanced load diversity (station with different feeder loads) and multiple distributed generation (DG) units in each feeder. The proposed cooperative protocol has been defined according to the distributed control technology, where LTC and DG units are considered as control agents. Two conflicting objectives have been defined for each control agent. The first objective aims to achieve the system requirements by minimizing the voltage deviation and the second objective aims to achieve the device requirements by reducing the tap operation and maximizing the energy capture for LTC and DG units, respectively. The interior structures of the control agents and the communication acts between them have been designed to achieve the best compromise between the two objectives of each control agent. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative scheme has been verified via different case studies.

Abstract: Demand for electricity varies throughout the day, increasing the average cost of power supply. Time-of-use (TOU) pricing has been proposed as a demand-side management (DSM) method to influence user demands. In this paper, we describe a game-theoretic approach to optimize TOU pricing strategies (GT-TOU). We propose models of costs to utility companies arising from user demand fluctuations, and models of user satisfaction with the difference between the nominal demand and the actual consumption. We design utility functions for the company and the users, and obtain a Nash equilibrium using backward induction. In addition to a single-user-type scenario, we also consider a scenario with multiple types of users, each of whom responds differently to time-dependent prices. Numerical examples show that our method is effective in leveling the user demand by setting optimal TOU prices, potentially decreasing costs for the utility companies, and increasing user benefits. An increase in social welfare measure indicates improved market efficiency through TOU pricing.

Abstract: Analysis of power systems is typically made using the method of either phase coordinates or symmetrical components depending on the type of network (un/symmetrical). The use of the symmetrical components method, a three-phase specific application of the Fortescue transformation, has been limited to pure three-phase symmetrical networks. Therefore phase coordinates has been the method used most for the analysis of distribution networks. This paper is extending the use of the symmetrical components method to distribution networks combining one-phase, two-phase, and three-phase symmetrical network parts. This paper derives a new integrated approach for the description of such networks based on Fortescue transformation. This approach is demonstrated using the forward-backward sweeping algorithm (FBS).

Abstract: This paper details the use of classification trees to predict mode damping using powerflow data from power system models. Power systems are complex with vast amounts of data being collected from measurements made via wide-area measurement (WAMS) and SCADA systems. Classification trees are introduced as a means to handle vast quantities of powerflow data which can be used to classify mode damping and amplitude. In reality, the classification trees would be trained on real power system data from SCADA and WAMS. A case study based on real field data from the Ecuadorian power system is presented where interconnectors to Colombia tripped in response to a poorly damped mode of oscillation. Testing of this methodology shows the feasibility of this approach with accurate classification of mode damping and amplitude on training and testing data sets. By highlighting significant variables affecting mode damping and amplitude, a decision tool for system operators can be developed that will suggest the optimal course of action to remedy any near instability or unstable electromechanical oscillations in transmission networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-stage fuel consumption minimization method in an autonomous voltage source converter (VSC)-based microgrids considering microgrid small signal stability (SSS) margin, frequency and voltage regulation, and the minimum and maximum allowable range of active and reactive output power of VSCs. In VSC-based microgrid, the parameters of each VSC power sharing controller have significant influence on microgrid SSS margin, frequency and voltage regulation, and the ratio of active and reactive power shared between VSCs. Considering all of these effects in fuel consumption minimization method with straightforward technique leads to having a complicated constrained optimization problem, which cannot be solved in a short time. The computation time of solving this optimization problem is very important in practical applications. In order to eliminate this problem, a multi-stage method is developed in this paper. This method can optimize the fuel consumption and consider the output active and reactive power limit, SSS margin, and frequency and voltage regulation in different stages without significant interactions on each other. Hence, the computation time is strongly reduced. The simulation results in a microgrid, which has a wind turbine, two gas turbines, and a micro-turbine with heat load, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper provides a comparative review of five existing ambient electromechanical mode shape estimation algorithms, i.e., the Transfer Function (TF), Spectral, Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD), Channel Matching, and Subspace Methods. It is also shown that the TF Method is a general approach to estimating mode shape and that the Spectral, FDD, and Channel Matching Methods are actually special cases of it. Additionally, some of the variations of the Subspace Method are reviewed and the Numerical algorithm for Subspace State Space System IDentification (N4SID) is implemented. The five algorithms are then compared using data simulated from a 17-machine model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) under ambient conditions with both low and high damping, as well as during the case where ambient data is disrupted by an oscillatory ringdown. The performance of the algorithms is compared using the statistics from Monte Carlo simulations and results from measured WECC data, and a discussion of the practical issues surrounding their implementation, including cases where power system probing is an option, is provided. The paper concludes with some recommendations as to the appropriate use of the various techniques.

Abstract: With increasing level of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) penetration into low voltage (LV) distribution networks, analysis with realistic network models is necessary for adequate capturing of network behavior. Traditional three-phase 3-wire power flow approach lacks the capability of exact analysis of 4-wire multigrounded LV networks due to the approximation of merging the neutral wire admittance into the phase wire admittances. Such an approximation may not be desirable when neutral wire and grounding effects need to be assessed, especially in the presence of single-phase solar power injection that may cause a significant level of network unbalance. This paper proposes a three-phase power flow approach for distribution networks while preserving the original 3-wire and 4-wire configurations for more accurate estimation of rooftop PV impacts on different phases and neutrals. A three-phase transformer model is developed to interface between the 3-wire medium voltage (MV) and the 4-wire LV networks. Also an integrated network model is developed for an explicit representation of different phases, neutral wires and groundings of a distribution system. A series of power flow calculations have been performed using the proposed approach to investigate the impacts of single-phase variable PV generation on an Australian distribution system and results are presented.

Abstract: Stochastically fluctuating wind power has a negative impact on power grid operations. This paper presents a wind power filtering approach to mitigate short- and long-term fluctuations using a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), and a novel wavelet-based capacity configuration algorithm to properly size the HESS. A frequency distribution allocates wind power fluctuations to the different HESS components to more easily satisfy 1-min and 30-min fluctuation mitigation requirements (FMR). An ultra-capacitor bank (UC) mitigates short-term fluctuations. In the HESS, and a lithium-ion battery bank (LB) minimizes long-term fluctuations. This paper also proposes a novel online-wavelet based coordination control scheme for the HESS, consisting of primary filtering (PF) and secondary filtering (SF) stages. The PF stage obtains a combined power output that fully satisfies the FMRs, while the SF stage provides additional smoothing of the wind power output fluctuations after the PF stage. A remaining energy level (REL) feedback control maintains the REL of the battery bank within its proper range. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed wavelet-based algorithm is more efficient than other published algorithms, and needs a lower energy storage capacity to satisfy 1-min and 30-min FMRs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic technique to evaluate the success of islanded microgrids taking into consideration the impacts of voltage and reactive power constraints and the special features and operational characteristics of both dispatchable and wind distributed generators in islanded microgrids. New adequacy and reliability indices are proposed to account for the effect of voltage and reactive power constraints. To facilitate these studies, the proposed technique employs a microgrid model that reflects the special characteristics of microgrid operation. Simulation studies have been carried out to validate the proposed technique. The simulation results show that voltage and reactive power constraints have considerable effects on the microgrids successful operation.

Abstract: In centralized day-ahead electricity markets with marginal pricing, unit commitment costs and capacity constraints give rise to non-convexities which may result in losses to some of the participating generating units. Therefore, a recovery mechanism is required to compensate them. In this paper, we present and analyze several recovery mechanisms that result in recovery payments after the market is cleared. Each of these mechanisms results in a different type and/or amount of payments for each participating unit that exhibits losses. We also propose a methodology for evaluating the bidding strategy behavior of the participating units for each mechanism. This methodology is based on the execution of a numerical procedure aimed at finding joint optimal bidding strategies of the profit-maximizing units. In a companion follow-up paper (Part II), we apply this methodology to evaluate the performance and incentive compatibility of the suggested recovery mechanisms on a simplified test case model of the Greek electricity market.

Abstract: The smart grid initiative leads to growing interests in demand responses and the load models, especially the frequency-sensitive loads such as motors. The reason is that high-penetration controllable load may have substantial impact on system frequency response (SFR). However, the effect of the frequency-related load-damping coefficient is still not completely understood. This paper investigates the effect of frequency-sensitive load on system frequency using typical SFR model. Theoretic analyses based on transfer functions show that the frequency deviation under a different load-damping coefficient is relatively small and bounded when the power system is essentially stable; while the frequency deviation can be accelerated when a power system is unstable after disturbance. For the stable case, the largest frequency dip under a perturbation and the corresponding critical time can be derived by inverse Laplace transformation using a full model considering load-damping coefficient. Further, the error in evaluating the load-frequency coefficient gives the largest impact to frequency deviation right at the time when the largest frequency dip occurs. Multiple-machine cases and automatic generation control (AGC) are also included in the analyses with verifications by simulation studies. The conclusion can be useful for system operators for decision-making of load control or interruption.

Abstract: This paper presents a new optimization algorithm, named modified teaching-learning algorithm, to solve a more practical formulation of the reserve constrained dynamic economic dispatch of thermal units considering the network losses and operating limitations of the generating units (i.e., the valve loading effect and ramp rate limits). Unlike the previous approaches, three types of the system spinning reserve requirements are explicitly modeled in the problem and a new constraint-handling is proposed to satisfy them. The proposed teaching-learning optimization algorithm is a new population-based optimization method features between the teacher and learners (students). Therefore, this algorithm searches for the global optimal solution through two main phases: 1) the "teacher phase" and 2) the "learner phase". Nevertheless, these two phases are not adequate for learning interaction between the teacher and the learners in the entire search space. Thus, in this paper a new phase named "modified phase" based on a self-adaptive learning mechanism is added to the algorithm to improve the process of knowledge learning among the learners and accordingly generate promising candidate solutions. The proposed framework is applied to 5-, 10-, 30-, 40-, and 140-unit test systems in order to evaluate its efficiency and feasibility.

Abstract: Around the world, electricity market regulators and competition authorities are struggling to find ways to reliably assess the likely market impact of mergers of generators. Conventional indicators of market power fail to capture key aspects of the exercise of market power in wholesale electricity markets. On the other hand, full-scale computation of Nash equilibria has historically been time consuming, non-transparent, and typically results in multiple Nash equilibria. In this paper we propose two methodological advances: an efficient approach to computing extremal-Nash equilibria in a wholesale power market with market power and the application of this approach in the assessment of wholesale market mergers. The extremal-Nash equilibria are those equilibria which have the highest or the lowest social cost to the society. The resulting formulation is a Mixed Integer Linear Program which efficiently finds the full set of extremal-Nash equilibria. The continuum of these extremal-Nash equilibria over a range of demand conditions describes the upper and lower envelopes of the Equilibria Band. To illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach, two case studies are explored, involving the New South Wales region of the Australian National Electricity Market, on the one hand, and the IEEE 14-Bus Test System, on the other.

Abstract: This paper describes two wide-area protection schemes for controlled islanding of the Uruguayan electrical power system. The first scheme relies only on local signals available for distance protection relays, whereas the second scheme is based both on local and remote synchrophasor measurements. The paper compares results in terms of load shedding amount necessary to maintain system integrity, with and without the proposed protection schemes. The investigation is based on comprehensive transient stability studies using actual dynamical models. Past occurrences that led the system to widespread blackouts have motivated the investigations presented in this paper.

Abstract: This study proposes a man-in-loop control method to boost reactive power reserves (RPRs) while maintaining a minimum amount of voltage stability margin (VSM) bus voltage limits. The objective is to determine the most effective control actions in order to reestablish critical RPRs across the system. Initially, the concept of reactive power reserve sensitivity with respect to control actions is introduced. In the sequel, a control approach based on convex quadratic optimization is used to find the minimal amount of control necessary to increase RPRs above their pre-specified (offline) levels. Voltage stability margin constraints are incorporated using a linear approximation of critical RPRs.
Simulation results show that system operators can optimally determine the right amount and location of control actions in order to restore critical RPRs and enhance VSM by using reactive power reserve sensitivities. Moreover, the optimization problem size can be made small if only the most effective control actions are selected, a desirable advantage for real time implementations of man-in-loop control.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method to improve the primary frequency contribution of grid connected variable speed wind turbine generators (WTGs). Using their energy reserve margins, deloaded WTGs are controlled to provide relief to the grid during depressed frequency conditions. The frequency support from individual WTGs is regulated based on the available reserve, which depends on the prevailing wind velocities. By continuously adjusting the droop of the WTG in response to wind velocities, its primary frequency response is significantly improved in terms of reduced stresses on WTGs during low wind speeds. The impact of variable droop operation on two aspects of WTG operation is investigated-primary frequency contribution and smoothening power fluctuations caused due to changes in wind speed. Also highlighted is the usefulness of this control when adopted by wind farms.

Abstract: This paper presents a transient stability constrained unit commitment (TSCUC) model which achieves the objective of maintaining both transient stability and economical operation. In the TSCUC model, transient stability constraints are incorporated into the framework of unit commitment. In order to solve TSCUC problem, augmented Lagrangian relaxation (ALR) combined with variable duplication techniques and the auxiliary problem principle (APP) is used to decompose the TSCUC problem into two sub-problems: one sub-problem is a traditional unit commitment (UC) problem with prevailing constraints; another sub-problem is modeled as a transient stability constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) problem. The first sub-problem is solved by dynamic programming, while the second sub-problem is solved using a reduced-space interior point method. In ALR, an efficient hybrid sub-gradient method is developed to update all Lagrangian multipliers. The iterative process continues until the duality gap is sufficiently small. Finally, case studies show that the proposed methodology is very efficient for solving TSCUC problems within a parallel computing framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (SMILP) approach to maximize total expected profit of one price-maker hydro producer in a pool-based electricity market. Head dependence, commitment decisions, discharge ramping, startup costs and forbidden zones are all effectively handled in our approach. Uncertainty about the competitors' offers is adequately represented by residual demand curves (RDCs) scenarios. The management of risk is suitably addressed by conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to provide the efficient frontier, i.e., the solutions set for which the expected profit may not be augmented without enlarging the variance of profit. Appropriate offering strategies to the pool are also developed, consisting of supply functions built for different risk levels. A representative cascaded hydro system with 7 reservoirs is considered to analyze and compare risk-neutral versus risk-averse results.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm utilizing a data filtering technique based on wavelet transform (WT), an optimization technique based on firefly (FF) algorithm, and a soft computing model based on fuzzy ARTMAP (FA) network in order to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in the Ontario market. A comprehensive comparative analysis with other soft computing and hybrid models shows a significant improvement in forecast error by more than 40% for daily and weekly price forecasts, through the application of a proposed hybrid WT + FF + FA model. Furthermore, low values obtained for the forecast mean square error (FMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) indicate high degree of accuracy of the proposed model. Robustness of the proposed hybrid intelligent model is measured by using the statistical index (error variance). In addition, the good forecast performance and the rapid adaptability of the proposed hybrid WT + FF + FA model are also evaluated using the PJM market data.

Abstract: This paper considers the yearly maintenance scheduling of generating units within a market environment. Each producer schedules its units' maintenance periods to maximize its revenue using a bilevel approach. The upper-level problem of this bilevel model seeks maximum revenue and contains unit scheduling constraints, while the lower-level problems represent the market clearing process under different operating conditions. This single producer maintenance problem can be recast as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Since the MPECs of all producers have to be considered simultaneously and the market clearing process is common to all of them, the proposed formulation for maintenance scheduling is an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) corresponding to a multiple-leader-common-follower game. The solution of this EPEC is a set of equilibria, in which none of the producers is able to increase its revenue unilaterally by changing the maintenance periods of its generating units.

Abstract: The benefit of risk-based (RB) security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model lies in its ability to improve the economic performance of a power system while enhancing the system's overall security level. However, the RB-SCOPF model is difficult to solve due to the following two characteristics: 1) the overload severity of a circuit changes with the loading condition on it, thus is hard to express with a deterministic function, and 2) the risk index is a function of the state variables in both normal and contingency states, which greatly increases the scale of optimization. To handle the first issue, a new expression of severity function is proposed so that it is possible to decompose the model into a SCOPF subproblem and a risk subproblem. To deal with the second issue, a nested Benders decomposition with multi-layer linear programming method is proposed. Illustrations use the ISO New England bulk system is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Analysis is presented to demonstrate the merits of the RB-SCOPF over the traditional SCOPF model.

Abstract: In 2020 electricity production from wind power should constitute nearly 50% of electricity demand in Denmark. In this paper we look at optimal expansion of the transmission network in order to integrate 50% wind power in the system, while minimizing total fixed investment cost and expected cost of power generation. We allow for active switching of transmission elements to reduce congestion effects caused by Kirchhoff's voltage law. Results show that actively switching transmission lines may yield a better utilization of transmission networks with large-scale wind power and increase wind power penetration. Furthermore, it is shown that transmission switching is likely to affect the optimal line capacity expansion plan.

Abstract: The power industry in China has grown significantly over the past decade, spurring the adoption of system-wide automatic voltage control (AVC) technology to meet stricter requirements for security and economical power system operation. To cope with the rapidly developing and frequently changing Chinese power grid, an AVC scheme based on adaptive zone division is introduced in this paper. Logically, this type of system has a three-level hierarchical structure, but, here, both secondary voltage control (SVC) and tertiary voltage control (TVC) are implemented via software at the same control center. The control zones are no longer fixed but are reconfigured online and updated in accordance with variations in the grid structure. The technical details of these procedures are presented here. The implementation of TVC (which is based on an online reactive optimal power flow) and SVC are also discussed, together with some technical details on improvements to their reliability and robustness. Some results obtained from field-site applications based on similar-days testing rather than simulations are employed to evaluate the performance and improvements of the AVC system. This system has been installed at over 20 control centers in China.

Abstract: This study aims at resolving a specific problem in the area of renewable energy, energy storage systems, variable-speed drives, and flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices used in the electric power systems. The use of power conversion system (PCS) is very common in the aforementioned areas. A cascaded control scheme based on four proportional-integral (PI) controllers is widely used in the control of the PCS unit. Setting the parameters of the four cascaded PI controllers simultaneously is cumbersome, especially when the application is in the area of electrical power system which is difficult to express using a mathematical model or transfer function due to its nonlinear properties. This paper presents an optimum design procedure for the cascaded controller of the PCS unit using Taguchi method. To apply the design parameters obtained from Taguchi method, a renewable energy application is chosen where a variable-speed wind turbine generator system is connected to the power grid through two back-to-back PCS units. The effectiveness of the designed parameters using Taguchi method is then compared with that obtained using response surface methodology and genetic algorithm (RSM-GA) method under the grid fault condition.

Abstract: Distribution network expansion planning (DNEP) aims at minimizing the capital and operational cost of the expansion plan; the plan entails choosing conductor types and line construction routes together with substation installation and reinforcement that allow serving the demand while satisfying the physical and technical constraints of the expanded network. Two findings are reported in this paper. First, DNEP can be exactly formulated as a disjunctive conic program, in two equivalent formulations; both formulations admit a tight polyhedral approximation and can be solved for the globally optimal solution using software for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Second, the DNEP solution can be computed more efficiently when the linear relaxations of the MILP formulations are strengthened using loop elimination constraints. Numerical results on practical DNEP problems reveal that combining the parallel equivalent-circuit polyhedral formulation with the spanning tree loop elimination constraints yields MILP planning solutions with a tight relative optimality gap and within reasonable computing time. In addition, the results are at least of the same quality if not better than those reported in the recent literature.

Abstract: Deregulation of energy markets, penetration of renewables, advanced metering capabilities, and the urge for situational awareness, all call for system-wide power system state estimation (PSSE). Implementing a centralized estimator though is practically infeasible due to the complexity scale of an interconnection, the communication bottleneck in real-time monitoring, regional disclosure policies, and reliability issues. In this context, distributed PSSE methods are treated here under a unified and systematic framework. A novel algorithm is developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It leverages existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies, exhibits low communication load, and its convergence to the centralized estimates is guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond the conventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodates a robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressive sampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the state and identifies corrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are numerically evaluated using the IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4200-bus benchmarks. Simulations demonstrate that the attainable accuracy can be reached within a few inter-area exchanges, while largest residual tests are outperformed.

Abstract: Wind and solar PV are the most mature forms of renewable energy and are integral to our clean energy strategy. Their intermittency poses technical and economic challenges. Technical challenges are load balancing, frequency regulation, etc. Economic challenges include providing least costing load balancing (reserves) services to these intermittent generators.
This paper considers a future electricity market situation wherein wind generators are required to forecast and bid to supply energy. The future electricity market treats wind generators similar to conventional generators penalizing for underproduction and pays poorly for overproduction.
An intra-day (<24 h) secondary market is proposed in this paper where a wind generator and a reserve provider can bilaterally trade in reserves. Reserves are traded in the market by purchasing options to buy reserves at predetermined strike prices by paying premiums. These reserves include call and put options to address underproduction and overproduction. A binomial tree approach for estimating possible deviation from the forecast value is used. A new optimization formulation is proposed that uses binomial tree option pricing technique to determine optimal values of strike prices and premiums for call and put options. Two examples illustrate the benefits of the proposed idea.

Abstract: Wind and hydro technologies represent an important part of the electricity generation sector. However, there have been few detailed studies that have investigated the synergies resulting from their combined operation. To address that, we formulate three optimization models where wind and reversible hydro technologies bid in a day-ahead market. The bidding strategies are divided into three categories: 1) separate wind and reversible hydro offers without a physical connection between them, 2) separate wind and reversible hydro offers with a physical connection to store by pumping the wind energy surplus, and 3) single wind and reversible hydro offers with a physical connection. Risk is considered in the models by means of the conditional value at risk (CVaR). A comparison of the models and relevant conclusions are drawn from an illustrative case study of the Iberian day-ahead electricity market.

Abstract: This paper presents a general methodology for analysis of sub-synchronous interaction in wind power plants. These include appropriate frequency scanning method for the assessment of the sub-synchronous control interaction, and calculation of the electrical damping provided by the wind turbine generator for investigation of the sub-synchronous torsional interaction. A general formulation of both methods applicable to any given wind turbine and network is presented. A dynamic frequency scanning method for the turbine side is developed which takes account of the turbine nonlinearities and its active behavior. Various aspects that need to be considered when injecting a voltage or current signal into the system for dynamic frequency scanning are discussed in detail. The veracity of these methods is confirmed against electromagnetic transient analyses. The application of these tools and techniques is demonstrated on a practical power system comprising type 3 wind turbines and series compensated lines.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to evaluate the worth of installing renewable distributed generation (DG) in distribution networks. Moreover, the work optimally allocates these DG units in the distribution network to maximize the worth of the connection to the local distribution company (LDC), as well as the customers connected to the system. The proposed methodology helps the LDC to better assess the benefits of the renewable DG units' proposed connections and to identify the optimal buses on which to connect these DG units. The benefits considered in this paper are deferral of upgrade investments, reduction of the cost of energy losses, and reliability improvement, which is represented by the interruption cost reduction. The proposed methodology takes into consideration the uncertainty and variability associated with the output power of renewable DG as well as the load variability. The planning problem of determining the optimal location and sizes of DG units is defined as multi-objective mixed integer programming.

Abstract: The phasor measurement unit (PMU), with its ability to directly calculate synchronized positive sequence voltages and currents (magnitude and phase), offers a more current and accurate view of the power system compared to that provided by traditional measurements and state estimation (SE). However, the high-resolution data, provided at rates of 50 Hz and 60 Hz (dependant on nominal frequency), capture any transient or dynamic events occurring on the network, potentially distorting the intended steady-state view at various points of the power system. In this paper we propose the use of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to detect and isolate such events for alternative investigation. Comparisons are made between the state estimator and installed PMUs on the high-voltage transmission system of Great Britain.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for designing low order robust controllers for stabilizing power system oscillations. The method uses polynomial control techniques. For single-input/single-output systems (SISO), the variability in operating conditions is captured using an interval polynomial. Kharitonov's theorem is then used to characterize a fixed order robust controller guaranteeing specified damping. This gives bi-linear matrix inequality (BMI) stability conditions which are solved using the BMI solver PENBMI. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by designing power oscillation damping (POD) controllers for single-, four-, and 16-machine power system models.

Abstract: In order to support the growing interest in demand response (DR) modeling and analysis, there is a need for physical-based residential load models. The objective of this paper is to present the development of such load models at the appliance level. These include conventional controllable loads, i.e., space cooling/space heating, water heater, clothes dryer and electric vehicle. Validation of the appliance-level load models is carried out by comparing the models' output with the real electricity consumption data for the associated appliances. The appliance-level load models are aggregated to generate load profiles for a distribution circuit, which are validated against the load profiles of an actual distribution circuit. The DR-sensitive load models can be used to study changes in electricity consumption both at the household and the distribution circuit levels, given a set of customer behaviors and/or signals from a utility.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) with uncertain wind power generation. The goal is to solve the problem considering multiple stochastic wind power scenarios but while significantly reducing the computational burden associated with the calculation of the reserve deployment for each scenario. The method is called reduced SCUC or R-SCUC and is based on the notion of loadability set, that is, the set of residual demand scenarios that can be met by the transmission and reserve capability of a given power system at any specific hour. The key is to project all feasible generation and demand vectors onto the demand space and reformulate the SCUC within this loadability set rather than on the larger set of generation and demand. The accuracy and performance of R-SCUC were gauged and compared to SCUC via a three-region multi-unit system and by the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system with multiple units. Simulations support the accuracy and superior computational performance of R-SCUC.

Abstract: A novel algorithm (TSA-SPA) that combines the Two-Sided Arnoldi method (TSA) and the Sensitive Pole Algorithm (SPA) is proposed in this paper for calculation of the most sensitive eigenvalues to control parameters in large power systems. In the proposed method, first, with the shift-invert transformation precondition, TSA builds two Krylov subspaces and obtains a reduced matrix of a much smaller scale, which contains eigenvalues close to the chosen shift point. Second, SPA is adopted to realize the most sensitive eigenvalue computation. TSA-SPA can find the most sensitive eigenvalues of interest, with satisfactory reliability and convergence, in a specified frequency domain. With proper selection of sizes of Krylov subspace and the reduced matrix, the convergence to good eigenvalue approximations is practically guaranteed. Moreover, with the deflation technique, the algorithm is also capable of finding several other dominant eigentriplets which may relate to inter-area and/or local control modes. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been validated on small and large-scale power systems. It has been found that compared to other available sensitive pole algorithms, the proposed algorithm has more robust and reliable performance. The proposed algorithm is suitable for practical applications in large-scale power systems.

Abstract: Power restoration following a large outage or widespread blackout is time critical and complex. A new method is presented for determining the timing and chance of electric power recovery and restoration. The present advance over previous work is explicitly integrating human, component and system reliability, which unifies the topic of power system restoration with the general theory for errors, accidents and outcomes for other technological systems.
Learning trends are demonstrated for power restoration of: large national grids; urban distribution during multiple and simultaneous local line repairs; and the main interconnected grid supply to nuclear generating units, including the latest data from the Fukushima nuclear plant event.
A new holistic curve and method is proposed for estimating the probability of restoration or recovery timing for electric power systems as a function of the measurable and reported accumulated learning experience.

Abstract: Different regulatory frameworks have implemented competitive mechanisms to increase efficiency in transmission, a natural monopoly. Conflicts of interest and hidden costs make necessary to define methods to obtain an appropriate valuation of new transmission assets.
This paper is the first one of a two-paper series and presents the fundamentals of transmission project valuation and cost allocation. We show the fundamentals of non-cooperative game theory, different concepts of game equilibria (Nash, Stackelberg, and Berge), and solutions to the bilateral negotiation problem (Nash bargaining solution, Kalai-Smorodinsky, and Rubinstein). In addition, the design of mechanisms, the information revelation principles, and incentive compatibility issues are described.
We propose a model composed of three elements: valuation of a transmission project based on a linear contract, a principal-agent model to determine the optimal effort of an agent developing the transmission project, and the optimal bilateral negotiation of right-of-way costs. We define a method to evaluate the offers to build a transmission line project as a function of the number of agents bidding for it. The value of the project is a function of both the incentives and the valuation of the right-of-way costs.
In part two of this series, we present two case studies: the IEEE 24-bus RTS and the Sistema Interconectado Central (SIC) in Chile, where we apply the methodology to a real network.

Abstract: Traditionally, ancillary services are supplied by large conventional generators. However, with the huge penetration of distributed generators (DGs) as a result of the growing interest in satisfying energy requirements, and considering the benefits that they can bring along to the electrical system and to the environment, it appears reasonable to assume that ancillary services could also be provided by DGs in an economical and efficient way. In this paper, a settlement procedure for a reactive power market for DGs in distribution systems is proposed. Attention is directed to wind turbines connected to the network through synchronous generators with permanent magnets and doubly-fed induction generators. The generation uncertainty of this kind of DG is reduced by running a multi-objective optimization algorithm in multiple probabilistic scenarios through the Monte Carlo method and by representing the active power generated by the DGs through Markov models. The objectives to be minimized are the payments of the distribution system operator to the DGs for reactive power, the curtailment of transactions committed in an active power market previously settled, the losses in the lines of the network, and a voltage profile index. The proposed methodology was tested using a modified IEEE 37-bus distribution test system.

Abstract: This paper explores methods to coordinate aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs; including air conditioners and refrigerators) to manage frequency and energy imbalances in power systems. We focus on opportunities to centrally control loads with high accuracy but low requirements for sensing and communications infrastructure. We compare cases when measured load state information (e. g., power consumption and temperature) is 1) available in real time; 2) available, but not in real time; and 3) not available. We use Markov chain models to describe the temperature state evolution of populations of TCLs, and Kalman filtering for both state and joint parameter/state estimation. A look-ahead proportional controller broadcasts control signals to all TCLs, which always remain in their temperature dead-band. Simulations indicate that it is possible to achieve power tracking RMS errors in the range of 0.26%-9.3% of steady state aggregated power consumption. We also report results in terms of the generator compliance threshold which is commonly used in industry. Results depend upon the information available for system identification, state estimation, and control. Depending upon the performance required, TCLs may not need to provide state information to the central controller in real time or at all.

Abstract: This paper proposes an evolutionary fuzzy lead-lag control approach for coordinated control of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices in a multi-machine power system. The FACTS devices used are a thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and a static var compensator (SVC), both of which are equipped with a fuzzy lead-lag controller to improve power system dynamic stability. The fuzzy lead-lag controller uses a fuzzy controller (FC) to adaptively determine the parameters of two lead-lag controllers at each control step according to the deviations of generator rotor speeds. This paper proposes an Advanced Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (ACACO) algorithm to optimize all of the free parameters in the FC, which avoids the time-consuming task of parameter selection by human experts. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed evolutionary fuzzy lead-lag controller for oscillation damping control is verified through control of a multi-machine power system and comparisons with other lead-lag controllers and various population-based optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Existing literature claims that an algorithm based on continuation is capable of finding all solutions to the power flow equations for all power systems. This claim is demonstrated to be incorrect through the use of a five-bus system counterexample. Existing literature also claims that a similar algorithm is capable of finding all Type-1 solutions (i.e., solutions where the power flow Jacobian has a single eigenvalue with positive real part) to the power flow equations for all systems. This claim is also shown to be incorrect using the five-bus system counterexample.

Abstract: In power system operation, transmission congestion can drastically limit more economical generation units from being dispatched. In this paper, optimal transmission switching as a congestion management tool is utilized to change network topology which, in turn, would lead to higher electricity market efficiency. Transmission switching (TS) is formulated as an optimization problem to determine the most influential lines as candidates for disconnection. In order to relieve congestion without violating voltage security, TS is embedded in an optimal power flow (OPF) problem with AC constraints and binary variables, i.e., a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, solved using Benders decomposition. Also, a methodology is presented which provides a guideline to the system operator showing the order of switching manoeuvres that have to be followed in order to relieve congestion. It is also shown that TS based on DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) formulation as used in the literature may jeopardize system security and in some cases result in voltage collapse due to the shortcomings in its simplified models. In order to evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method, the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 300-bus test systems are used.

Abstract: Although wave power installations are currently limited in number, the capacity value of wave power is of interest in power system planning. The capacity value of wind power has been studied in previous work, but the value for wave power is not known. Continuous time series characterizing the wave energy resource at multiple sites are generated from raw wave data. These time series are analyzed with a forced outage rate imposed for individual devices, as may be encountered by real wave energy farms. The capacity value of wave power at various sites is evaluated with reference to 500 MW of installed capacity. Portfolios are created, allocating wave power capacity to individual sites, with the impact of geographical aggregation being examined. The inter-annual variation for each portfolio is then determined in order to examine the robustness of the results. Comparison is also made between sites off the west coasts of Ireland and Portugal. The implications for the power system resulting from an increase in generation adequacy are discussed.

Abstract: This paper applies two experimental economics methods (i.e., agent-based modeling and laboratory experiment) to a market test suite that is based on a fictional European wholesale electricity market. Quantitative results of generators' strategic behavior in this market context are separated between generators played by human subjects (i.e., master students) in a laboratory experiment and generators represented by computational agents in an agent-based model. The behavior is measured through offers that students or agents make when participating in the electricity trading auction and the market outcomes under both methods are discussed in order to illustrate the difference between the behavior of human and computational agents. The paper also identifies the improvements that would need to be made to the market test suite to allow for a more conclusive comparison in future experiments.

Abstract: Energy storage is a natural option toward adding the much-needed flexibility for integrating higher amounts of wind generation into the existing power system. This paper presents field results and analyses quantifying the ability and the value of Sodium Sulfur (NAS) battery energy storage toward shifting wind generation from off-peak to on-peak, limiting the ramp rate of wind farm output, and a strategy to integrate the aforementioned goals. The battery can also be considered on a system level independent of wind. It is argued that even in its capacity as a system resource independent of wind, the battery can aid integration of wind generation. Analyses quantifying the value of the battery in the energy and operating reserve markets are presented. Financially optimal locations to site the battery have also been identified. The presented research is a part of the "Wind to Battery" project led by Xcel Energy, a major U.S. utility.

Abstract: Recently, integration of distributed generation (DG) in distribution systems has increased to high penetration levels. The impact of DG units on the voltage stability margins has become significant. Optimization techniques are tools which can be used to locate and size the DG units in the system, so as to utilize these units optimally within certain limits and constraints. Thus, the impacts of DG units issues, such as voltage stability and voltage profile, can be analyzed effectively. The ultimate goal of this paper is to propose a method of locating and sizing DG units so as to improve the voltage stability margin. The load and renewable DG generation probabilistic nature are considered in this study. The proposed method starts by selecting candidate buses into which to install the DG units on the system, prioritizing buses which are sensitive to voltage profile and thus improve the voltage stability margin. The DG units' placement and sizing is formulated using mixed-integer nonlinear programming, with an objective function of improving the stability margin; the constraints are the system voltage limits, feeders' capacity, and the DG penetration level.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to suggest a robust optimal power flow (OPF) framework to perform locational marginal pricing under the scarcity of reactive power. The classical OPF models employed for market clearing either assume infinite reactive power support or make a fully independent representation of the reactive power load. In contrast, a potentially more accurate power flow model is adopted in this paper recognizing the dependence of the level of reactive power consumption on the level of active power consumption. The relationship is primarily modeled by employing the concept of power factor. In addition, there can be load requests with different power factors from the same location. The corresponding locational marginal prices (LMPs) are found to vary not only spatially but also according to power factors. Thus, a two-dimensional LMP variation is finally obtained. A consistent definition of financial transmission rights is also provided and the associated LMP decomposition scheme is described. The model proposed is studied on the IEEE 30-bus system and its distinctive features are noted down and discussed.

Abstract: Restructuring of power system stresses the need for economic and reliable generation of power. Therefore generating units should be committed considering fuel cost and reliability level of the system. This necessitates the need for multi-objectives to be met in a unit commitment problem (UCP). Since the above objectives are conflicting in nature, a novel methodology employing optimal deviation based firefly algorithm tuned fuzzy membership function is applied to multi-objective unit commitment problem (MOUCP). The ON/OFF status of the generating units is obtained by binary coded FF whereas the sub-problem economic dispatch (ED) is obtained by real coded FF. Here the conflicting functions are formulated as a single objective function using fuzzy weighted optimal deviation. The fuzzy membership design variables are tuned using real coded FF; thereby the requirement of expertise for setting these variables are eliminated. The proposed methodology is validated on 100-unit system, IEEE RTS 24-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system and a practical Taiwan Power (Taipower) 38-unit system over a 24-h period. Effective strategy on scheduling spinning reserve is demonstrated by comparing its performance with other methods reported in the literature.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming model to solve the conductor size selection and reconductoring problem in radial distribution systems. In the proposed model, the steady-state operation of the radial distribution system is modeled through linear expressions. The use of a mixed-integer linear model guarantees convergence to optimality using existing optimization software. The proposed model and a heuristic are used to obtain the Pareto front of the conductor size selection and reconductoring problem considering two different objective functions. The results of one test system and two real distribution systems are presented in order to show the accuracy as well as the efficiency of the proposed solution technique.

Abstract: This paper presents a conjectural-variation-based equilibrium model of a single-price electricity market. The distinctive modeling feature introduced in this paper is the formalization of the equilibrium equations taking into account the effect of congestion between areas on generators' behavior. The results show that, when there is a congestion between two areas, generators valued differently the production of each area, giving more importance to the importing area.

Abstract: Accurate and near real-time estimates of electromechanical modes are of great importance since the modal damping is a key indicator of the stability of the power system. If the estimates of the electromechanical modes are to be useful, knowing the variability in the estimates is critically important. This paper presents a method of directly estimating the variance of each mode estimate in addition to estimating the frequency and damping of each mode in an online setting using a recursive maximum likelihood (RML) estimator. The variance estimates are achieved using two closed-form multidimensional Taylor series approximations, the details of which are fully derived here. The proposed method is validated using a Monte Carlo simulation with a low order model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system under both ambient and probing conditions, with multiple modes closely spaced in frequency, and is compared to the regularized robust recursive least squares (R3LS) method. It is also successfully applied to phasor measurement unit (PMU) data collected from the actual WECC system, also under both ambient and probing conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new breed of high-voltage dc (HVDC) transmission systems based on a hybrid multilevel voltage source converter (VSC) with ac-side cascaded H-bridge cells. The proposed HVDC system offers the operational flexibility of VSC-based systems in terms of active and reactive power control, black-start capability, in addition to improved ac fault ride-through capability and the unique feature of current-limiting capability during dc side faults. Additionally, it offers features such as smaller footprint and a larger active and reactive power capability curve than existing VSC-based HVDC systems, including those using modular multilevel converters. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed HVDC system, this paper assesses its dynamic performance during steady-state and network alterations, including its response to ac and dc side faults.

Abstract: This paper proposes a coordination paradigm for properly coordinating local control actions, taken by many communicating control agents (CAs), in order to maintain multi-area power system voltages within acceptable bounds. The proposed control scheme is inspired by distributed model predictive control (DMPC), and relies on the communication of planned local control actions among neighboring CAs, each possibly operated by an independent transmission system operator (TSO). Each CA, knowing a local model of its own area, as well as reduced-order QSS models of its immediate neighboring areas, and assuming a simpler equivalent PV models for its remote neighbors, performs a greedy local optimization over a finite window in time, communicating its planned control input sequence to its immediate neighbors only. The good performance of the proposed real-time model-based feedback coordinating controller, following major disturbances, is illustrated using time-domain simulation of the well-known realistic Nordic32 test system, assuming worst-case conditions.

Abstract: It has been observed that a gas turbine will have an obvious low generation efficiency if the inlet air temperature is high. To address this issue, many gas generators in warm areas are equipped with cooling systems to lower the inlet air temperature and to increase generation efficiency. However, neither the impact of air temperature nor the operation of cooling systems has been analytically investigated in existing unit commitment models, which may produce generator schedules that are infeasible or cause unavoidable costly market purchase. In this paper, we first build mathematical forms to capture the operations and costs of running cooling systems. Then we develop a stochastic unit commitment model, including operations and costs from cooling systems, for uncertain demand and temperature. Finally, a set of computation results based on a real power system are presented to show the value of cooling systems as well as the effectiveness of the optimization approach.

Abstract: Previous studies on long-run network charges assume that network reinforcement would be required when the loading level of a circuit reaches its designed capacity. Such assumption works well for a passive distribution network but is not valid for transmission networks as they have active congestion management capabilities. Transmission network operators normally can only justify for network investment when congestion costs exceed network expansion costs. This trade-off between operational cost and investment cost is not considered in any of the existing long-run marginal or incremental cost pricing (LRIC or LRMC).
This letter proposes a new approach for calculating transmission use of system charges based on LRIC charging model, taking into consideration of the short-run operational cost. In this letter, the short-run operational cost considered is congestion management cost. The proposed LRIC pricing model aims to reflect: 1) how short-run operation costs influence the time horizon to reinforce a transmission network component; 2) how short-run operation costs influence the transmission use of system charges. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been illustrated by a comparison with the traditional LRIC pricing model.

Abstract: This letter proposes an analytic framework for achieving an optimal solution for phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem. The proposed technique is on the basis of the cost/benefit analysis while long-term economic aspects and existing technical issues are simultaneously accounted for. More deployment of PMU devices would result in more reliable and secure electricity services. The reduction of system risk cost is hence recognized as the benefit associated with the development of wide-area measurement system (WAMS). The optimal number and location of PMUs are determined such that adding more PMUs is no longer beneficial. Two systems are examined to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: A new formulation is required to provide a proper power flow analysis in islanded microgrids taking into consideration their special philosophy of operation. In this paper, a novel and generic three-phase power flow algorithm is formulated for islanded microgrids. The algorithm is novel since it adapts the real characteristics of the islanded microgrid operation; i.e., 1) some of the distributed generation (DG) units are controlled using the droop control methods and their generated active and reactive power are dependent on the power flow variables; 2) the steady-state system frequency is considered as one of the power flow variables. The proposed algorithm is generic, where the features of distribution systems, i.e., three-phase feeder models, unbalanced loads and load models have been taken in consideration. Further, all possible operation modes of DG units (droop, PV, or PQ) have been considered. The problem has been formulated as a set of nonlinear equations. A globally convergent Newton-trust region method has been proposed to solve this set of nonlinear equations. The proposed algorithm is a helpful tool to perform accurate steady state studies of the islanded microgrid. Different case studies have been carried out to test the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Very short-term load forecasting predicts the loads 1 h into the future in 5-min steps in a moving window manner based on real-time data collected. Effective forecasting is important in area generation control and resource dispatch. It is however difficult in view of the noisy data collection process and complicated load features. This paper presents a method of wavelet neural networks with data pre-filtering. The key idea is to use a spike filtering technique to detect spikes in load data and correct them. Wavelet decomposition is then used to decompose the filtered loads into multiple components at different frequencies, separate neural networks are applied to capture the features of individual components, and results of neural networks are then combined to form the final forecasts. To perform moving forecasts, 12 dedicated wavelet neural networks are used based on test results. Numerical testing demonstrates the effects of data pre-filtering and the accuracy of wavelet neural networks based on a data set from ISO New England.

Abstract: This paper presents a method of estimating the electromechanical damping and frequency coefficients of interconnected power systems. The method combines AESOPS approach and eigenvalue analysis. Computation time is reduced by applying an approximation based on an eigenvalue sensitivity formula, which evaluates eigenvectors of the 2n(g) X 2n(g) [A(omega(K))] and [A(omega(K))](T) matrix and thereafter use them to obtain improved estimates of the eigenvalues. Numerical results from a 16-generator system demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Abstract: Within the framework of a successive quadratic programming method for problems involving discrete variables on power systems, this work formulates the distributed optimal power flow with continuous and discrete variables problems (Distributed OPFCDP) and distributed state estimation with continuous and discrete variables problems (Distributed SECDP) as categories of the distributed quadratic programming with continuous and discrete variables problems (Distributed QCDP). A three-level algorithm combined with the ordinal optimization (OO) theory and the distributed asynchronous dual-type (DADT) method is also developed to solve the Distributed QCDP of power systems. Additionally, the efficiency of the proposed three-level algorithm is demonstrated, along with a comparison made with four competing methods (i.e., Tabu search, genetic algorithm, ant colony system, and simulated annealing) for solving the Distributed SECDP and Distributed OPFCDP on the IEEE 118-bus and 244-bus systems in a deregulated environment. Test results further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly promising for the Distributed QCDP.

Abstract: Although demand response (DR) encourages customers to voluntarily schedule electricity consumption based on price signals, the response from the consumer side could be uncertain due to a variety of reasons. In this letter, we study the stochastic unit commitment problem with uncertain demand response to enhance the reliability unit commitment process for independent system operators (ISOs). We use a stochastic representation of DR by scenario, and each scenario corresponds to a price-elastic demand curve. Contingency constraints are considered and in addition, a chance constraint is applied to ensure the loss of load probability (LOLP) lower than a pre-defined risk level. Finally, a sample average approximation (SAA) method is applied to solve the problem.

Abstract: Hybrid series compensation using static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) and passive series capacitor can improve the stability of the system, increases the power transfer capability and is useful for the fast control of power flow. This paper analyzes the subsynchronous resonance (SSR) characteristics of the hybrid series compensated power system in detail and proposes a simple method for the extraction of subsynchronous components of line current using filter. The extracted subsynchronous frequency component of line current is used to inject a proportional subsynchronous voltage in series with the transmission line which suppresses subsynchronous current in the transmission network. This novel technique is termed as subsynchronous current suppressor. The design of subsynchronous current suppressor is based on damping torque analysis and using genetic algorithm. A novel graphical representation of series resonance condition when SSSC is incorporated in the system is presented. The detailed study of SSR is carried out based on eigenvalue analysis, transient simulation and damping torque analysis. The results of the case study on a system adapted from IEEE First Benchmark Model demonstrates the effectiveness and robust performance of subsynchronous current suppressor in damping of SSR under various system operating conditions.
Linear analysis is performed on D-Q model of the system with SSSC and the results are tested by executing transient simulation based on detailed nonlinear three-phase model.

Abstract: The paper proposes an innovative probabilistic clustering concept for aggregate modeling of wind farms (WFs). The proposed technique determines the number of equivalent turbines that can be used to represent large WF during the year in system studies. Support vector clustering (SVC) technique is used to cluster wind turbines (WTs) based on WF layout and incoming wind. These clusters are then arranged into groups, and finally through analysis of wind at the site, equivalent number ofWTs for WF representation is determined. The method is demonstrated on a WF consisting of 49 WTs connected to the grid through two transmission lines. Dynamic responses of the aggregate model of the WF are compared against responses of the full WF model for various wind scenarios.

The proposed solution is based on a fault-location method which was developed and documented in an earlier paper by the authors. Hence, it is intended as an extension of the previous work to facilitate its efficient implementation via optimal sensor placement. The paper will first provide a brief review of the fault-location method and will then describe the optimal deployment scheme for placing synchronized voltage sensors in the transmission system. Simulated fault transients by an electromagnetic transients simulation program will be used to illustrate the performance of the developed technique.

Abstract: The evolving complexity of distribution networks with higher levels of uncertainties is a new challenge faced by system operators. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian mixtures models as input variables in stochastic power flow studies and state estimation of distribution networks. These studies are relevant for the efficient exploitation of renewable energy sources and the secure operation of network assets.
The proposed formulation is valid for both power flow and state estimation problems. The method uses a combination of the Gaussian components used to model the input variables in the weighted least square formulation. In order to reduce computational demands, this paper includes an efficient optimization algorithm to reduce the number of Gaussian combinations. The proposed method was tested in a 69-bus radial test system and the results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: The large-scale integration of wind power into electrical power systems is likely to require significant improvements to transmission infrastructure over coming years. Planning for these developments may involve modeling of power systems using estimates of the time-varying power output of proposed wind farms. Such estimates may be derived from wind measurements, although it is rarely the case that measurements are available simultaneously for all sites of interest. In the present work, a method is developed to produce synthetic time-series of wind power at several locations based on a measured time-series of wind speed from a reference site. The stochastic properties of the modeled time-series are shown to be comparable with those of measured data from south-eastern Australia. It is anticipated that with appropriate tuning for local conditions, the method could be applied in other geographical regions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to fault diagnosis in electrical power systems, which presents an aspect little explored in the literature that is the protective device failure detection together with the fault section estimation, since the majority of the methodologies so far proposed to fault diagnosis are limited to the fault section estimation alone. The proposed methodology makes use of operation states of protective devices as well as information related to the protection philosophy. Initially, these data undergo a preprocessing step to convert the format of 0 and 1 to percentage values. The conversion to percentage values allows the use of artificial neural networks, whose numbers of inputs do not depend on the number of alarms of the protection philosophy, or the type of bus arrangement or the number of circuit breakers. This allows the same set of neural networks to be trained and applied in different power systems with different protection schemes and bus arrangements. The proposed system has five neural networks, each containing few neurons and requiring 30 mu s to perform fault diagnosis. The proposed system was trained considering the IEEE 57-bus system, containing different selective protection schemes, and subsequently tested in the IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus systems, and Eletronorte 230-kV real power system.

Abstract: Following a converter outage in a Multi-Terminal DC (MTDC) grid, it is critical that the healthy converter stations share the power mismatch/burden in a desirable way. A fixed value of power-voltage droop in the DC link voltage control loops can ensure proper distribution according to the converter ratings. Here a scheme for adapting the droop coefficients to share the burden according to the available headroom of each converter station is proposed. Advantage of this adaptive (variable) droop scheme for autonomous power sharing is established through transient simulations on an MTDC grid with four bipolar converters and DC cable network with metallic return. Results for both rectifier and inverter outages under two different scenarios are presented. Post-contingency steady-state operating points obtained from transient simulation are shown to be consistent with those derived analytically. Impact of varying droop coefficients on the stability of the MTDC grid is established. An averaged model in Matlab/SIMULINK which has been validated against detailed switched model in EMTDC/PSCAD is used for the stability and modal analysis.

Abstract: Control of the converter stations in a multi-terminal DC (MTDC) grid to provide frequency support for the surrounding AC systems is the subject matter of this paper. The standard autonomous power sharing control loop for each converter is modified with a frequency droop control loop. The objective is to minimize the deviation from nominal AC system frequency and share the burden of frequency support among the converter stations of the MTDC grid. The effectiveness of the frequency support is demonstrated through nonlinear simulation of a test system consisting of three isolated AC systems interconnected through an MTDC grid with four converter stations. An averaged model of the MTDC grids is developed to carry out modal analysis of combined multi-machine AC-MTDC systems. Modal analysis is used to characterize and substantiate the time domain behavior in presence of frequency droop control. It is established that appropriate droop control loop for the MTDC grid converters could be effective in reducing the deviation from nominal AC system frequency provided the sensitivity of the system eigen-values to changes in control parameters (e. g., droop coefficients) is accounted for a priori through modal analysis.

Abstract: When deciding on wind power investments, three major issues arise: the production variability and uncertainty of wind facilities, the eventual future decline in wind power investment costs, and the significant financial risk involved in such investment decisions. Recognizing the above important issues, this paper proposes a risk-constrained multi-stage stochastic programming model to make optimal investment decisions on wind power facilities along a multi-stage horizon. The proposed model is illustrated using a clarifying example and a case study.

Abstract: Stepwise power tariff (SPT), which has been put into practice, is a crucial way for energy saving and environment protecting. In this paper, a new optimal model of SPT based on residential demand response model is presented. The optimal decision is proposed to restrain high electricity consumption as well as safeguard benefits of both supply and demand sides. As a result, the objective is designed to minimize electricity consumption and constraints are taken into consideration thoroughly, including acceptable index of consumers, average price, sales profit of power providers and basic electricity demand, which serves as a foundation for smooth implement of SPT. To solve the constrained optimal problem, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed. The effectiveness of the model and algorithm is investigated and demonstrated based on real data of 300 residents by a numerical example. The study shows that the method can reduce power consumption obviously with little sacrifice of the benefits of consumers and power providers.

Abstract: Probabilistic load flow (PLF) modeling is gaining renewed popularity as power grid complexity increases due to growth in intermittent renewable energy generation and unpredictable probabilistic loads such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PEVs). In PLF analysis of grid design, operation and optimization, mathematically correct and accurate predictions of probability tail regions are required.
In this paper, probability theory is used to solve electrical grid power load flow. The method applies two Maximum Entropy (ME) methods and a Gram-Charlier (GC) expansion to generate voltage magnitude, voltage angle and power flow probability density functions (PDFs) based on cumulant arithmetic treatment of linearized power flow equations.
Systematic ME and GC parameter tuning effects on solution accuracy and performance is reported relative to converged deterministic MonteCarlo (MC) results. Comparing ME and GC results versus MC techniques demonstrates that ME methods are superior to the GC methods used in historical literature, and tens of thousands of MC iterations are required to reconstitute statistically accurate PDF tail regions.
Direct probabilistic solution methods with ME PDF reconstructions are therefore proposed as mathematically correct, statistically accurate and computationally efficient methods that could be applied in the load flow analysis of large-scale networks.

Abstract: This paper develops a decision making framework for mid-term scheduling problems of the large industrial consumers. The proposed approach is based upon the recently introduced class of stochastic programming problems, established by the concept of second-order stochastic dominance (SSD). In this paper, it is assumed that the electricity price and the rate of availability (unavailability) of the generating unit (forced outage rate) are the sources of uncertainty in the decision-making problem. In the developed SSD-constrained stochastic programming problem, the consumer risk is managed by minimization of the pool procurement, as the objective function, and economic issues (e. g., cost minimization) are considered in the SD constraint. Furthermore, while most approaches optimize the cost subject to an assumed demand profile, our method enforces the electricity consumption to follow an optimum profile for mid-term time scheduling, i.e., three months (12 weeks), so that the total production will remain constant. Simulation results for a typical cement factory (as an industrial consumer) and comparison to a mean-risk approach with CVaR risk measure, revealed the interesting results and benefits of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Blocking filters (BFs) were designed to solve subsynchronous resonance (SSR) problems induced by fixed series capacitors (FSCs) of the Tuoketuo transmission system. However, during the commission of BF, unstable self excitation (SE) occurred unexpectedly, resulting in suspension of the project. This paper first analyzes the mechanism of how BF causes SE. Then, the parameters' sensitivity is investigated and the quality factor (Q) of BF reactors is discovered to have opposite impact on SE and torsional interaction (TI). Thus, by appropriately lowering Q of BF reactors with supplemental resistors, an improved BF scheme is put forward to simultaneously mitigate the different types of SSR problems. As a key issue, the determination of supplemental resistors is formulated into a multi-objective optimization problem, which is then effectively solved with our proposed searching method. Finally, the effectiveness of improved BFs is verified with field tests. For the first time, actual measurements of filed tests on BFs are offered. What is more, their comparison with model studies demonstrates a good agreement. This work paves the way for putting both BFs and FSCs into service, thereby ensuring safe operation and transfer-capability enhancement of the system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel objective function and algorithm to obtain a set of optimal power system stabilizer (PSS) parameters that include a feedback signal of a remote machine and local and remote input signal ratios for each machine in a multi-machine power system under various operating conditions. A novel function called the damping scale is proposed and formulated as an objective function to increase system damping after the system undergoes a disturbance. Three existing objective functions of the damping factor, damping ratio, and a combination of the damping factor and damping ratio were analyzed and compared with the proposed objective function. A novel algorithm called gradual self-tuning hybrid differential evolution (GSTHDE) was developed for rapid and efficient searching of an optimal set of PSS parameters. GSTHDE uses the gradual search concept on STHDE to enhance the probability of searching for an optimal solution. Eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time domain simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed objective function and algorithm.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of sub-synchronous interactions in a wind integrated power system to understand and mitigate them. The proposed procedure has two steps. In the first step, a frequency scan is performed to determine the presence of resonant frequencies in the sub-synchronous range. In the second step, a detailed small signal analysis is performed. Participation factors are used to identify the state variables that are involved in the interaction, and the controllability indices are used to determine the mitigation method. It is shown that the sub-synchronous interaction present in Type 3 wind turbine-generators connected to the grid through series compensated lines is an electrical resonance between the generator and the series compensated line which is highly sensitive to the rotor side converter current controller gains.

Abstract: The paper presents the potential use of supplemental control of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms for damping subsynchronous resonance (SSR) oscillations in nearby turbine-generators connected to series capacitive compensated transmission systems. SSR mitigation is achieved by introducing a supplemental signal into the control loops of the DFIG voltage-sourced converter-based back-to-back. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed supplemental control are demonstrated on a modified version of the IEEE second benchmark model for computer simulation of subsynchronous resonance by means of time domain simulation analysis using the EMTP-RV program.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method to solve the network reconfiguration problem in the presence of distributed generation (DG) with an objective of minimizing real power loss and improving voltage profile in distribution system. A meta heuristic Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) is used to simultaneously reconfigure and identify the optimal locations for installation of DG units in a distribution network. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify optimal locations for installation of DG units. Different scenarios of DG placement and reconfiguration of network are considered to study the performance of the proposed method. The constraints of voltage and branch current carrying capacity are included in the evaluation of the objective function. The method has been tested on 33-bus and 69-bus radial distribution systems at three different load levels to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results obtained are encouraging.

Abstract: This paper presents a field-test verified method for continuous tracking of voltage-dependent load model parameters. The basic idea is to use the natural or automatic movement of the under load tap changer (ULTC) as the source of voltage disturbance. Load parameters are estimated from each taping activity. While the idea of using manual ULTC tapping disturbances for load parameter estimation is not new, this paper has demonstrated, through laboratory tests and field measurements, that load parameters can be estimated from the automatic ULTC movements. Since a ULTC often has many movements in any given day, the load parameters can be collected in a consistent, frequent, and predictable manner and, consequently, online estimation and tracking of load parameters becomes feasible. The paper presents the implementation of the proposed method and its field measurement experiences, especially the characteristics of tap movements and the associated load responses. Experiments and a large number of field measurements presented in this paper have shown that the proposed method is a practical and effective method for determining load parameters online.

Abstract: This paper presents a new control method, in which a distributed generator (DG) actively participates in steady-state voltage control, together with an under-load tap changer (ULTC) and shunt capacitors (Sh.Cs). In the conventional DG control method, the integration of DGs into a distribution power system increases the number of switching operations of the ULTC and the Sh.Cs. To solve this problem, this paper proposes that the DG output voltage be dispatched cooperatively with the operation of the ULTC and the Sh.Cs, based on load forecasts for one day in advance. The objective of the proposed method is to decrease the number of switching device operations, as well as to reduce the power loss in the distribution lines, while maintaining the grid voltage within the allowed range. The proposed method is designed and implemented with MATLAB, using two different dynamic programming algorithms for a dispatchable and a nondispatchable DG, respectively. Simulation studies demonstrate that the objective can be achieved under various grid conditions, determined by factors such as the DG output power characteristics, the location of the DG-connected bus on the feeder, and the load profile of the feeder containing the DG.

Abstract: This paper considers the use of hybrid simulation combining electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulation and transient stability (TSA) simulation to model large networks. By comparing with a full detailed EMT simulation, the paper shows that the hybrid approach gives more accurate results than TSA simulation alone, when power electronic equipment is included in the EMT part of the model. The paper also considers line switching and faults in the TSA part of the model which were ignored in earlier approaches, and shows that the accuracy is a function of the electrical distance of the fault to the interface bus bars. A new method to improve this accuracy with the use of switchable frequency dependent network equivalents (FDNE) is also introduced.

Abstract: Unit commitment, one of the most critical tasks in electric power system operations, faces new challenges as the supply and demand uncertainty increases dramatically due to the integration of variable generation resources such as wind power and price responsive demand. To meet these challenges, we propose a two-stage adaptive robust unit commitment model for the security constrained unit commitment problem in the presence of nodal net injection uncertainty. Compared to the conventional stochastic programming approach, the proposed model is more practical in that it only requires a deterministic uncertainty set, rather than a hard-to-obtain probability distribution on the uncertain data. The unit commitment solutions of the proposed model are robust against all possible realizations of the modeled uncertainty. We develop a practical solution methodology based on a combination of Benders decomposition type algorithm and the outer approximation technique. We present an extensive numerical study on the real-world large scale power system operated by the ISO New England. Computational results demonstrate the economic and operational advantages of our model over the traditional reserve adjustment approach.

Abstract: This paper utilizes a class of modern machine learning methods for estimating a transient stability boundary that is viewed as a function of power system variables. The simultaneous variable selection and estimation approach is employed yielding a substantially reduced complexity transient stability boundary model. The model is easily interpretable and yet possesses a stronger prediction power than techniques known in the power engineering literature so far. The accuracy of our methods is demonstrated using a 470-bus system.

Abstract: This paper presents a Monte Carlo based generation system reliability evaluation method that can accurately model correlations between multiple wind speeds following different probability distributions. The assumption of normal distribution in the traditional correlation matrix method is eliminated. Applications to the Weibull, Burr, lognormal and gamma distributions which are popular for wind speed representation are analyzed in detail. The reliability evaluation procedure considering correlations of wind speeds following different distributions is developed. The IEEE-RTS with four additional wind farms whose wind speeds follow different types of distributions is used to demonstrate the application of the presented method in generation system reliability evaluation.

Abstract: This paper introduces the High Temperature Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (HTS-FCL) as a novel technology for mitigating the high fault currents and enhancing the security of Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA) power system. The transient model of ADWEA power system is developed using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation program. The transient model is validated in steady state and short circuit analysis with the PSS/E model of ADWEA power system. The proposed model is used to facilitate performing the electromagnetic transient studies for installing the HTS-FCL. The detailed time domain model of the HTS-FCL considering its major components, operation control algorithm, sequence of events and fault detection techniques are developed. The implementation of the HTS-FCLs in the 132-kV network of ADWEA power system is studied. Furthermore, the short-circuit currents levels to utilize all potential system equipments and remove the limitations on the available generation are analyzed. The reduction of the fault currents are evaluated at the buses of suspected high fault currents with installing the HTS-FCL to demonstrate its effectiveness for improving the system performance, reliability and security.

Abstract: Controlled islanding is an active and effective way of avoiding catastrophic wide area blackouts. It is usually considered as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem. However, the combinatorial explosion of the solution space that occurs for large power systems increases the complexity of solving it. This paper proposes a two-step controlled islanding algorithm that uses spectral clustering to find a suitable islanding solution for preventing the initiation of wide area blackouts by un-damped electromechanical oscillations. The objective function used in this controlled islanding algorithm is the minimal power-flow disruption. The sole constraint applied to this solution is related to generator coherency. In the first step of the algorithm, the generator nodes are grouped using normalized spectral clustering, based on their dynamic models, to produce groups of coherent generators. In the second step of the algorithm, the islanding solution that provides the minimum power-flow disruption while satisfying the constraint of coherent generator groups is determined by grouping all nodes using constrained spectral clustering. Simulation results, obtained using the IEEE 9-, 39-, and 118-bus test systems, show that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient when solving the controlled islanding problem, particularly in the case of a large power system.

Abstract: The reconfiguration of distribution networks is an important combinatorial problem. This work addresses the particular case of reconfiguration after an outage caused by the loss of a single branch of the network. The reconfiguration is carried out over two domains simultaneously: re-switching strategies and transformer tap-changer adjustments. The approach was tested using a real large-scale network within the concession area of Energy Australia. The model considers four operational elements: an AC power flow model, the network's radial topology when operating, voltage limits and load limits. Two evolutionary algorithms were implemented and tested. The first was a genetic algorithm, applied over the space of possible re-switching strategies, and for both re-switching and tap-changer adjustments, simultaneously. The second was a memetic algorithm, applied over the same two variations of the reconfiguration problem. Computational tests consider the evaluation of the loss of every branch, reporting the number of buses affected, and the number of overloaded branches after the reconfiguration.

Abstract: The widespread installation of distributed generation systems is crucial for making optimal use of renewable energy. However, local distribution networks face voltage fluctuation problems if numerous photovoltaic (PV) systems are connected. Recently, energy storage systems that can be installed at commercial customers have been developed. This paper proposes a concept that solves the voltage fluctuation problem in distribution networks with high penetration of PV systems by using customer-side energy storage systems. The distribution network operator (DNO) is allowed to control the output of the energy storage systems of customers during a specific time period in exchange for a subsidy covering a portion of the initial cost of the storage system. The cost effectiveness of the cooperative operation for both customer and DNO is discussed by numerical simulations based on minute-by-minute solar irradiation data. Our results have clarified the possibilities of making voltage management more economical in distribution networks.

Abstract: We present a three-level equilibrium model for the expansion of an electric network. The lower-level model represents the equilibrium of a pool-based market; the intermediate level represents the Nash equilibrium in generation capacity expansion, taking into account the outcomes on the spot market; and the upper-level model represents the anticipation of transmission expansion planning to the investment in generation capacity and the pool-based market equilibrium. The demand has been considered as exogenous and locational marginal prices are obtained as endogenous variables of the model. The three-level model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The model is applied to a realistic power system in Chile to illustrate the methodology and proper conclusions are reached.

Abstract: In a real-time electricity pricing context where consumers are sensitive to varying prices, having the ability to anticipate their response to a price change is valuable. This paper proposes models for the dynamics of such price-response, and shows how these dynamics can be used to control electricity consumption using a one-way price signal. Estimation of the price-response is based on data measurable at grid level, removing the need to install sensors and communication devices between each individual consumer and the price-generating entity. An application for price-responsive heating systems is studied based on real data, before conducting a control by price experiment using a mixture of real and synthetic data. With the control objective of following a constant consumption reference, peak heating consumption is reduced by nearly 5%, and 11% of the mean daily heating consumption is shifted.

Abstract: The paper presents a robust probabilistic methodology for assessing the performance of power system controllers. In this study, the proposed probabilistic technique is applied to a novel power oscillation damping (POD) controller structure implemented through active power modulation of multiple voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) links within a large heavily meshed network exhibiting multiple inter-area modes. The modal linear quadratic Gaussian (MLQG) controller, as an example of advanced POD, is implemented in both a centralized and a decentralized form for comparison. Following the development and demonstration of the effectiveness of the controller designs, the robust probabilistic performance evaluation is carried out incorporating outage contingencies for generators, lines, and VSC-HVDC lines. The results obtained demonstrate that both controller structures are largely robust to wide ranging operating conditions. For those conditions where controller performance is unsatisfactory, various mitigation techniques are discussed, including the use of classification tools to guide operational limits. A contingency specific controller design is shown to significantly improve performance when robustness cannot be achieved.

Abstract: Previous work on parameter error identification based on normalized Lagrange multipliers has shown that the errors in parameters of branches constituting single-or double-edge cutsets could not be detected or identified without incorporating phasor measurements. In order to address this deficiency, a computationally efficient algorithm has been developed to identify all such cutsets and documented in a recent paper. This paper builds on that work and formulates a strategic phasor measurement placement problem whose objective is to ensure detectability and identifiability of all network parameters in a given system. A practical solution is developed for this problem and simulation results for IEEE 14-, 30- and 57-bus test systems are provided to illustrate its implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal power flow function for aiding restoration studies of subsystems having long transmission segments. The method simultaneously computes an optimal set of variables which are critical for the subsystem restoration: the generation power plant high-side voltage, the minimum shunt reactor configuration and the maximum load to be safely energized. A set of overvoltage restoration scenarios following load rejection is constructed in such a way that the computed shunt reactor compensation becomes distributed along the transmission corridor. The whole problem is formulated as a single optimization problem whose solution is obtained by an optimal power flow, based on the Primal-Dual Interior Point Method. The described results for a restoration study on a system from practice confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper is the second of a two-paper series and presents a model to assess and promote investment projects defined in a plan of expansion of the transmission. We propose a model that consists of three main elements: valuation of a project based on the design of a linear contract, a principal-agent model to assess the optimal effort of an agent, and the right-of-way negotiating cost. We also define a model to evaluate bids by the agents. The value of the project depends on the number of competitors, the incentives to invest, and the right-of-way costs. The right-of-way cost is approached from the perspective of a bilateral bargaining problem.
We analyze two case studies. The first is a plan to expand the IEEE 24-RTS system. The second is based on the expansion plan of the Central Interconnected System (SIC) of Chile. The results show that the principal-agent model obtains the real costs of the bidders and creates incentives for disclosure of information. This creates optimal offers that depend on the incentive generated by the social planner.

Abstract: This paper studies day-ahead unit commitment in wind-coal intensive power systems. Due to their long start up time, high start up cost, and high minimum stable output, coal-fired generators do not provide a favorable environment for accommodating variable wind generation. The reduced efficiencies resulting from the coal-fired generation side as measured in increased fuel consumption and CO2 emissions can greatly undermine the wind power benefits to the system if wind generation and coal-fired generation are not properly coordinated. Special attention in the study is given to the wind power benefits to the system in fuel savings and in reduction of CO2 emissions. Based on the wind power forecast, the stochastic nature of wind power is treated in two parts, i.e., wind power variability and wind power uncertainty. Unit commitment is studied using wind power variability and uncertainty separately in different wind power dispatch modes and using respectively different spinning reserve procurement strategies. System performance indices are then applied to determine the optimal wind power dispatch mode and optimal spinning reserve procurement strategy to capture optimal wind power benefits for the system. A simulation system characterized by typical wind-coal features is constructed to model and to conduct the studies. The results show that taking wind power curtailment as a control option and using wind as a reserve provider improve the wind power benefits to the system.

Abstract: Many of the most commonly used generation planning models have been formulated in a way that neglects the chronological sequence of demand and the mixed-integer nature of generating units. The generator schedules assumed by these models are inaccurate and become increasingly divorced from real schedules with increasing variability. This paper seeks to characterize and quantify the limitations of these models over a broad set of input parameters. For an illustrative set of test systems, wind capacities and generator types, annual system costs are determined for all combinations of generating units using a unit-commitment model, which captures the chronological behavior of units and a dispatch model which does not. It is seen that the relative performance of the dispatch model is highly system specific but generally degrades with increasing variability. The difference in cost estimates between the models is decomposed into start costs, starts avoidance and average cost estimation error. The impact on least-cost portfolios is shown and finally sensitivities are performed with the addition of hydro and nuclear power to assess their impact.
