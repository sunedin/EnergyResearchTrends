Abstract: This paper presents the evolution and design of the Swiss reserve market and describes its two-stage stochastic market-clearing model. In Switzerland, the reserve market comprises weekly and daily auctions. The decision-making problem is to determine the amount of reserves that should be procured in each market stage. The stochasticity stems from daily offers which are not available at the beginning of the week, when the first-stage decisions are made. The new market-clearing model minimizes expected procurement costs of reserves, while taking reserve dimensioning criteria and market properties into consideration. Since the last week of January 2014, this model has been clearing the reserve market in Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world implementation of a stochastic market-clearing model in electricity markets.

Abstract: This letter investigates the impacts of distributed generation (DG) units' reactive power limits on the power flow solution of droop-controlled islanded microgrids (DCIMGs). It is demonstrated that the simplifications adopted in existing literature for modeling such limits are not accurate and can lead to crucial deviations in the answer, especially for heavily loaded islands. A detailed model is presented for the incorporation of the DG units' reactive power limits in the power flow formulation of DCIMGs and the impacts of such limits on the steady-state solution are demonstrated and analyzed.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new formulation for the optimum reconfiguration of islanded microgrid (IMG) systems. The reconfiguration problem is casted as a multi-objective optimization problem, in order to: 1) minimize the IMG fuel consumption in the operational planning horizon for which islanded operation is planned; 2) ensure the IMG capability to feed the maximum possible demand by enhancing its voltage instability proximity index taken over all the states at which the islanded system may reside; and 3) minimize the relevant switching operation costs. The proposed problem formulation takes into consideration the system's operational constraints in all operating conditions based on the consideration of the uncertainty associated with renewable resources output power and load variability. Moreover, the proposed formulation accounts for droop controlled IMG special operational characteristics as well as the availability/unavailability of a supervisory microgrid central controller (MGCC). The formulated problem is solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). MATLAB environment has been used to test and validate the proposed problem formulation. The results show that the implementation of appropriate IMG reconfiguration problem formulations will enhance the performance of IMG systems and facilitate a successful integration of the microgrid concept in distribution networks.

Abstract: Converting existing ac transmission lines to an extended multiterminal three-wire bipolar HVDC system can be considered a cost-effective way to interconnect dispersed offshore wind farms to onshore ac grids instead of building new bipolar HVDC systems. To automatically coordinate between different converters in a multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) system, droop control techniques have been adopted as an effective means without the need for fast communications between units. The droop control design is mainly dependent on the line resistances. This paper shows that the equivalent resistance of a three-wire bipolar system changes based on the operational mode. The modification to droop control design of an MTDC equipped with a three-wire bipolar system is then presented to tackle this resistance variation with the operating condition. Two types of MTDC systems are considered in this work, namely, radial parallel and meshed parallel systems. Different simulation studies have been conducted to validate the results of the presented analysis.

Abstract: There are few systematic methodologies capable of predicting and leveraging the reserve capacity potential of large populations of thermostatically-controlled loads (TCLs). For such reserves to have economic and technical value, it is essential that demand-side flexibility aggregators and system operators be able to do so quickly and robustly. In addition, aggregators need to ensure TCL users' comfort and end use satisfaction. Part I of this two-part paper introduces an analytical approach to characterize and control the statistical bounds on the potential aggregated response of a population of TCLs, while ensuring users' comfort satisfaction. First, the uncertainty associated with the instantaneous power consumption of a typical TCL is described by a set of random variables and their statistics. TCL statistics are then employed to characterize the exploitable flexibility from a large population of similar devices. From this, a control strategy and parameters are introduced for sporadic (i.e., contingency-type) reserve provision by the population. In Part II, the proposed analytical approach and control strategy are validated for the special case of electric water heaters (EWHs). Further, the trade-off between demand response capacity and EWH users' comfort satisfaction is investigated through several case studies.

Abstract: An analytical approach and a control strategy are proposed in Part I of this two-part paper for leveraging the aggregate demand of a population of thermostatically-controlled loads (TCLs) to deliver contingency-type reserve capacity. Further, a metric is introduced to quantify the TCL users' comfort satisfaction in response to a control signal. In Part II, we address the validation of the concepts put forth in the first part of the paper. To do so, we develop an extensive set of case studies based upon a population of 10 000 electric water heaters (EWH). Here, a physically-based model is first derived for the calculation of EWHs on-time statistics. The model is then extended to calculate the probability of EWH users' comfort satisfaction. The analytical approach and control strategy presented in Part I are validated using the EWH model against Monte Carlo simulations. Further, the trade-off between demand response capacity and EWH users' comfort satisfaction is investigated.

Abstract: The paper proposes a framework for the selection of optimal configuration of line compensation devices, thyristor controlled series capacitors (TCSC) and conventional fixed series capacitors, for reducing the risk of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) in the network while maintaining required power transfer. The methodology developed in the paper is based on the robust risk evaluation of SSR that takes into consideration the severity of subsynchronous resonance and probability of its occurrence. The subsynchronous resonance risk index developed previously is used to assess the severity of subsynchronous resonance. The line outage model is employed to determine the probability of contingencies potentially leading to subsynchronous resonance. It is demonstrated that with relatively small participation of TCSC, even with the most basic control, in series compensation of lines, the risk of SSR can be successfully managed.

Abstract: Reliable and economic deployment of a generation fleet to satisfy demand is a complex problem. Independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission operators (RTOs) solve complex unit commitment and economic dispatch models to determine appropriate resources to deploy at various time stages. Due to the complexity of power systems, several approximations are made within optimization models, including approximations of the transmission network with a linearized formulation known as the direct current optimal power flow (DCOPF) instead of the more realistic formulation known as the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF). Furthermore, approximations occur in these models by relaxing specific constraints in the model, i.e., the constraint is allowed to be violated based on a predetermined penalty price. By doing so, the ISO/RTO receives several benefits, including the ability to manage prices, clear the market, as well as the potential to obtain gains in social welfare (market surplus). This paper describes the constraint relaxation practices of ISOs in their unit commitment models and analyzes the corresponding market implications based on these practices.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) will play an essential role in smart grids by contributing to the operational flexibility requirement arising from the increased penetration of intermittent renewable generation. However, DR activation could be hampered in the absence of intelligent network management. Real-time thermal rating (RTTR) functions as a smart network management tool for unlocking the network capacities by allowing the network to safely operate during overload states. This paper offers an optimal residential DR approach integrated with RTTR to balance the hourly wind power production. The proposed framework is modeled from the perspective of an electrical aggregator that manages the population of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads for wind power balancing considering the RTTR of a distribution network. The model schedules the HVAC loads without deterioration of the customers' temperature preferences. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, simulations are performed on a typical Finnish distribution network plan. The results demonstrate the considerable benefits that can be realized by coordinating the DR and RTTR in a distribution network for wind generation balancing.

Abstract: This paper presents a planning framework to find the minimum storage sizes (power and energy) at multiple locations in distribution networks to reduce curtailment from renewable distributed generation (DG), specifically wind farms, while managing congestion and voltages. A two-stage iterative process is adopted in this framework. The first stage uses a multi-period AC optimal power flow (OPF) across the studied horizon to obtain initial storage sizes considering hourly wind and load profiles. The second stage adopts a high granularity minute-by-minute control driven by a mono-period bi-level AC OPF to tune the first-stage storage sizes according to the actual curtailment. Congestion and voltages are managed through the optimal control of storage (active and reactive power), on-load tap changers (OLTCs), DG power factor, and DG curtailment as last resort. The proposed storage planning framework is applied to a real 33-kV network from the North West of England over one week. The results highlight that by embedding high granularity control aspects into planning, it is possible to more accurately size storage facilities. Moreover, intelligent management of further flexibility (i.e., OLTCs, storage, and DG power factor control) can lead to much smaller storage capacities. This, however, depends on the required level of curtailment.

Abstract: It is generally believed that following a fault, the system remains stable as long as the fault is cleared within a "critical clearing time" or CCT. This letter shows that when there is a high impedance resistive fault, there are later intervals such that if the fault is cleared within these intervals of time, the system is still stable notwithstanding that the clearing time is now larger than the conventionally calculated CCT. The results are obtained precisely using digital simulation and explained qualitatively using the equal area criterion.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the overexcitation limiters (OELs) on the stability margin of a power system which is operating under stressed conditions. Several OEL modeling approaches are presented and the effect of their action has been examined in model power systems. It is realized that, more often than not, OEL operating status goes undetected by existing dynamic security assessment tools commonly used in the industry. It is found that the identification and accurate representation of OELs lead to significantly different transient stability margins. Unscented Kalman filtering is used to detect the OEL activation events. In the context of stressed system operation, such quantitative assessment is very useful for system control. This understanding is further reinforced through detailed studies in two model power systems.

Abstract: Reduced external networks supplied with real-time data are employed in this paper to solve the state estimation problem in interconnected systems. We propose a method to obtain a composed single system state of different monitored areas with local estimations and external equivalent models, which neither require the use of a coordination agent nor requires extensive data interchange. Phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements taken from system boundaries are used to provide updated equivalent networks as well as an inter-area synchronism. The approach allows testing erroneous external models directly in the state estimation framework. The detectability of bad data in interconnection measurements are also preserved. Tests with the IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems show robustness and accuracy of the model under different area decomposition schemes with low computational requirements compared to similar conventional approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a screening method to determine the potential risk of interactions between a dynamic device and a generator with torsional oscillations. The proposed method introduces a factor called the radiality factor (RF) which is an indicator of the radialness of the network between the device and the generator. The RF is calculated in the sub-synchronous frequency range and plotted against the frequency (RF curves). The RF curves can then be used for screening of torsional interactions between the generator and other dynamic devices. The critical value for the RF is determined through a large number of sensitivity studies on a test system. This method surpasses the available screening method: unit interaction factor (UIF) calculations which is only applicable for inductive networks without series compensated lines.

Abstract: This paper presents a new control strategy for high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission based on the synchronverter concept: the sending-end rectifier controls emulate a synchronous motor (SM), and the receiving end inverter emulates a synchronous generator (SG). The two converters connected with a DC line provide what is called a synchronverter HVDC (SHVDC). The structure of the SHVDC is firstly analyzed. It is shown that the droop and voltage regulations included in the SHVDC structure are necessary and sufficient to well define the behavior of SHVDC. The standard parameters of the SG cannot be directly used for this structure. A specific tuning method of these parameters is proposed in order to satisfy the usual HVDC control requirements. The new tuning method is compared with the standard vector control in terms of local performances and fault critical clearing time (CCT) in the neighboring zone of the link. The test network is a 4-machine power system with parallel HVDC/AC transmission. The results indicate the contribution of the proposed controller to enhance the stability margin of the neighbor AC zone of the link.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework to quantify the impact of uncertainty that arises from load variations, renewable-based generation, and noise in communication channels on the automatic generation control (AGC) system. To this end, we rely on a model of the power system that includes the synchronous generator dynamics, the network, and the AGC system dynamics, as well as the effect of various sources of uncertainty. Then, we develop a method to analytically propagate the uncertainty from the aforementioned sources to the system frequency and area control error (ACE), and obtain expressions that approximate their probability distribution functions. We make use of this framework to obtain probabilistic expressions for the frequency performance criteria developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC); such expressions may be used to determine the limiting values of uncertainty that the system may withstand. The proposed ideas are illustrated through the Western Electricity Coordination Council (WECC) 9-bus 3-machine system and a 140-bus 48-machine system.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a reduced-order model for synchronous generator dynamics via selective modal analysis. Then, we use this reduced-order model to formulate a balancing authority (BA) area dynamic model. Next, we use the BA area model to design an adaptive automatic generation control (AGC) scheme, with self-tuning gain, that decreases the amount of regulation needed and potentially reduces the associated costs. In particular, we use the BA area model to derive a relationship between the actual frequency response characteristic (AFRC) of the BA area, the area control error, the system frequency, and the total generation. We make use of this relationship to estimate the AFRC online, and set the frequency bias factor equal to the online estimation. As a result, the AGC system is driven by the exact number of MW needed to restore the system frequency and the real power interchange to the desired values. We demonstrate the proposed ideas with a single machine infinite bus, the 9-bus 3-machine Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), and a 140-bus 48-machine systems.

Abstract: In this paper, a new procedure based on a backward/forward sweep (BFS) algorithm for solving power flows in weakly meshed dc traction networks is presented. The proposed technique is able to consider the trains as nonlinear and non-smooth (nondifferentiable) voltage-dependent loads or generators. This feature permits the inclusion of the trains' overcurrent protection and the squeeze control. With the use of the mentioned controls, the conventional power flow problem becomes a voltage constrained power flow problem, and the interaction between the trains and the network can be accurately modeled. However, the train control induces a highly non-smooth voltage-dependent load characteristic, causing convergence problems in most of the derivative-based algorithms. The proposed algorithm is faster, more robust, and more stable than the derivative-based ones. In addition, the authors present all of the formulation in a compact matrix-based form by means of the graph theory application and the node incidence matrix.

Abstract: As the need for faster power system dynamic simulations increases, it is essential to develop new algorithms that exploit parallel computing to accelerate those simulations. This paper proposes a parallel algorithm based on a two-level, Schur-complement-based, domain decomposition method. The two-level partitioning provides high parallelization potential (coarse- and fine-grained). In addition, due to the Schur-complement approach used to update the sub-domain interface variables, the algorithm exhibits high global convergence rate. Finally, it provides significant numerical and computational acceleration. The algorithm is implemented using the shared-memory parallel programming model, targeting inexpensive multi-core machines. Its performance is reported on a real system as well as on a large test system combining transmission and distribution networks.

Abstract: Distributed power electronic reactive power sources-such as smart PV inverters-may play an important role in regulating customer voltages and reducing system losses in future distribution systems. Though it is natural to consider model-based optimal control algorithms to coordinate these resources, those strategies typically require relatively large communications capabilities and accurate models. In this paper we present an alternative way to implement the optimization problem that circumvents these communications and modeling challenges. We present an Extremum Seeking (ES) control algorithm to modulate the reactive power output of VAR resources to minimize total real power delivery at the feeder substation subject to voltage magnitude constraints, without an explicit feeder model. We present results that guarantee a variety of distribution feeder objective functions are convex over a broad range of power flows and perform an analysis showing the convergence of the ES approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the method is equivalent to recently developed convex relaxations used to solve distribution optimal power flow problems.

Abstract: Power system components have a relatively long life span and hence there is not enough data to derive an accurate end-of-life failure model. This contributes to the uncertainty in system reliability assessment. This paper discusses the quantification of the effect of uncertainty in end-of-life failure models on system reliability indices. This paper characterizes the uncertainty by a mixed aleatory-epistemic uncertainty model, where the aleatory uncertainty originated from the variability of failure events and the epistemic uncertainty originated from a lack of data. The mixed aleatory-epistemic uncertainty was propagated using two methods: Second Order Probability and Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DSET). Power transformers were chosen as the case study equipment and the methods were applied on a realistic transmission network.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized wide-area coordinated supplementary control of multiple line-commutated converter (LCC)-HVDC links to 1) prevent interactions among the HVDC links and 2) enhance the damping of the inter-area oscillatory modes. The proposed approach is based on the sparsity-promoting optimal control. The main features of the proposed approach are 1) it requires minimal communication infrastructure to achieve the control objectives and thus reduces the impacts of communication delays and noise, 2) it entails in an optimal gain which preserves the closed-loop stability and 3) it does not require the estimates of the system states. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated based on eigen analysis and time-domain simulation of an interconnected AC system that includes five LCC-HVDC links. Performance of the proposed controller is also compared with those of fully centralized and conventional local supplementary controllers and its merits are highlighted. The studies indicate the proposed controller, based on 13 remotely communicated signals, provides similar performance as that of a fully centralized optimal controller using 2050 communicated signals and is far superior to the conventional local supplementary controllers.

Abstract: Increasing wind capacity integration results in displacement of active power from conventional generators and a reduction in reactive power sources available. As such, voltage stability may become a concern in certain periods for power system operation particularly in weaker areas of the network. Thus, it is of importance to consider the AC constraints for optimal wind generation planning (long term) in order to decrease the possibility of a wind capacity allocation that requires costly remedies from the power system operation perspective (short term). In this work, a procedure is proposed for wind capacity allocation with the aim of benefiting from the potential of an optimal wind capacity allocation for enhancing the voltage stability margin. The procedure is based on a multi operating conditions voltage stability constrained optimal power flow. The wind capacity target is set and the loadability margin is tracked. The results will show the applicability of the proposed procedure and will emphasize the effects of the pattern of wind capacity allocation on the loadability margin. This will result in a wind capacity allocation that enhances the minimum loadability margin among the possible future operating conditions considered for planning. The procedure uses the Maximin concept for this purpose.

Abstract: Given the significant amount of installed generation-capacity based on wind power, and also due to current economic downturn, the subsidies and incentives that have been widely used by wind-power producers to recover their investment costs have decreased and are even expected to disappear in the near future. In these conditions, wind-power producers need to develop offering strategies to make their investments profitable counting solely on the market. This paper proposes a multi-stage risk-constrained stochastic complementarity model to derive the optimal offering strategy of a wind-power producer that participates in both the day-ahead and the balancing markets. Uncertainties concerning wind-power productions, market prices, demands' bids, and rivals' offers are efficiently modeled using a set of scenarios. The conditional-value-at-risk metric is used to model the profit risk associated with the offering decisions. The proposed model is recast as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming program solvable using available branch-and-cut algorithms. Results of a case study are reported and discussed to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand response (DR) for voltage and frequency support of islanded microgrids. The proposed method basically relies on extracting information from real and reactive power sensitivities at different buses for minimizing the voltage and frequency deviations of the islanded microgrid. To this aim, a new power flow procedure is adopted in which the frequency deviation appears as an additional state variable. This helps to calculate the required setpoints for the DERs as well as the amount of the demanded power curtailed through the controllable loads to meet the overall goal. The loads are classified based on their a-priori known controllability degree. To minimize the manipulated load, the most effective buses are selected based on their associated sensitivity values. In the grid-connected mode, the total operation cost is minimized, while the microgrid bus voltages are maintained within the pre-specified acceptable range. In both modes, the whole process is formulated as a multiobjective problem solved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO). The control procedure involves a series of commands for which the incident command system (ICS) is used as a secure communication structure. The performance of the proposed control framework is evaluated for the case of a typical MV microgrid in both grid-connected and islanded modes.

Abstract: We present a combined look-ahead dispatch and reserve optimization formulation, which extends our recent work on time-coupled reserve policies and employs the recent notion of generalized decision rules from the robust optimization literature. This aims to improve the performance of traditional linear decision rules when applied to short-term electrical reserve operation. We derive a primal problem whose solution is a time-coupled rule for up-and down-regulating the power injections of each controllable device, such as a generator or energy storage unit, in response to discovered values of prediction errors. This rule depends on the "bin" into which measured prediction errors fall, so that, for example, up-regulation follows a different rule to down-regulation. We also derive an associated dual problem, whose solution provides a lower-bound on the best possible primal cost. This allows the suboptimality of a candidate solution based on a particular decision rule parameterization to be bounded. The primal and dual solutions are also compared to the so-called prescient case, in which the values of the uncertainty are known in advance. We demonstrate the method using numerical case studies, including the standard IEEE-118 bus network, in which a minimum possible reserve cost is identified using the dual lower-bounding approach.

Abstract: A number of methods have been proposed and implemented to improve system damping against low-frequency electromechanical oscillations in the power system. Among these, flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) can be used to provide power oscillation damping (POD) function to the power system. The design of the POD algorithms in these devices requires estimation of the power oscillation frequency components and this is mostly achieved through the use of various filter combinations. However, these filter-based solutions are characterized by low bandwidth to extract the required signal components accurately, and this limits the dynamic performance of the FACTS controllers. Moreover, the filters are designed for specific frequencies, and a change in the system would reduce the performance of the methods. Thus, there is a need for a better estimation algorithm with fast and selective estimation of the required signal that is robust against system parameter uncertainties. In this paper, this is achieved by the use of a recursive least square algorithm that uses variable forgetting factor and a frequency adaptation mechanism. The investigated method has fast estimation in transient conditions without compromising its selectivity in steady state. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proven through simulation as well as experimental verification.

Abstract: The use of interruptible load (IL) resources to improve the primary frequency response (PFR) of an interconnected power system has been proposed and, for speed, it is likely that such resources would operate autonomously on local frequency measurements. The commitment of the resources, however, could be coordinated globally and frequently in accordance with the state of the system. This paper investigates the minimum cost commitment of IL resources to ensure the PFR of a system remains within specified limits. The binary integer programming problem considers the commitment cost of each IL resource and includes nonlinear frequency constraints specified by the transient stability simulation of the system. A method to estimate the contribution of an IL resource towards meeting a frequency constraint is proposed and incorporated into a solution approach that involves the iterative solving of a linear commitment problem. The sensitivity-based estimation method reduces the amount of computationally burdensome transient stability simulation required by the algorithm with little increase in the final solution cost. An IEEE 118-bus test case study with 1000 IL resources demonstrates the benefit of the estimation method.

Abstract: Identification of post-fault topology is critical to not only cascaded outage prevention but also prediction of post-fault dynamic behavior. Existing methods for identifying the tripped lines rely on steady state SCADA/PMU measurements, and therefore fail to accomplish their task within fractions of a second. This limits their application to online transient stability assessment. This paper presents a method for online identification of post-fault topology on the basis of information of the pre-fault operating conditions and synchronized measurements at all generator buses. The proposed technique identifies the tripped line with negligible delay, before the system reaches steady state. An innovative index, which represents the normalized kinetic energy gained by generators immediately after the fault, is used to minimize the search set of possible tripped lines. For every candidate line, the generator output powers are calculated considering the line as tripped, and the minimum error between the measured and the calculated generator powers is used to finally identify the tripped line. The IEEE 39-bus system and a 246-bus North Indian Grid representation are used to show the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a non-linear data analysis technique that can quantify the number and duration of a dynamical system of being in nearly the same area in phase space trajectory. This paper proposes three applications of RQA to analyse power system dynamics. These are denoising of PMU data, localization of power system events, and transient stability contingency ranking of power system. All three applications have been demonstrated using a multimachine test system.

Abstract: A modified fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA) combined with a probabilistic approach are proposed in this paper to coordinate and optimize the parameters of power system stabilizers (PSSs) and static VAR compensator (SVC) damping controller for improving the probabilistic small-signal stability of power systems with large-scale wind generation, taking into consideration the stochastic uncertainty of system operating conditions. It is generally accepted that there is a threat to the stability of power system with penetration of wind farm. In addition, the stochastic fluctuations of wind generation make PSSs tuning more difficult. In this paper, PSSs and SVC damping controller are employed for suppressing local and inter-area low frequency oscillation. In order to eliminate the adverse effect between PSSs and SVC damping controller, the MFOA based on the probabilistic eigenvalue is applied to coordinate and optimize their parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on two test systems.

Abstract: A general platform is introduced to study the dynamics of power systems with high voltage dc (HVDC) transmission links. Small-signal stability, voltage stability, and interaction phenomena of power systems with both line-commutated-converter HVDC (LCC-HVDC) and voltage-source-converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) are addressed using the proposed platform. In this platform, the entire power system is modeled as a multivariable feedback control system (FCS) which consists of three interconnected blocks. The contents as well as the inputs and outputs of the blocks are selected such that the conventional analysis tools for power system stability are applicable, both in the time and frequency domains. In the FCS model, the relationships between different instabilities are clear, and participant agents of each instability can be determined. The model is developed in a modular and hybrid style, to make it feasible for a large power system. The proposed model is validated against an electromagnetic transient simulation program (PSCAD) using time responses.

Abstract: We consider the problem of deriving an explicit approximate solution of the nonlinear power equations that describe a balanced power distribution network. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a practical solution to the power flow equations, and we propose an approximation that is linear in the active and reactive power demands of the PQ buses. For this approximation, which is valid for generic power line impedances and grid topology, we derive a bound on the approximation error as a function of the grid parameters. We illustrate the quality of the approximation via simulations, we show how it can also model the presence of voltage controlled (PV) buses, and we discuss how it generalizes the DC power flow model to lossy networks.

Abstract: This paper proposes an appropriate offering strategy method for an electric railway company (ERC) to participate in reserve markets. In this respect, first the problem of energy and reserve scheduling for the ERC is modeled in a deterministic way. Next, a robust optimization technique is used to solve the problem taking into account the uncertain energy and reserve prices as well as the uncertain hourly energy demand of the electric railway substations. Afterward, a reserve offering curve construction algorithm based on the solution of robust energy and reserve scheduling is proposed. This algorithm takes into account the correlation between upward and downward reserve prices. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a realistic case study based on the characteristic of an ERC in Switzerland is presented.

Abstract: Electromechanical stability of transmission systems has been challenged by many factors such as market re-regulation, high penetration of renewables, operation under stressed conditions. After the implementation of electricity markets, it appeared evident that the transmission grid needs autonomous capacity to control the system during sudden disturbances and new protection schemes to maintain stability. This paper explores the possibility to control dynamically the impedance of transmission lines through Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC). The feasibility and the effectiveness of the approach are demonstrated through numerical tests on a realistic sized network for both voltage and transient stability.

Abstract: The increasing injections of energy from renewable energy sources far away from load centers have resulted in a more congested transmission grid. As the construction of new lines is costly, other options should be exploited as well. One possible solution is dynamic thermal line rating (DLR), which, instead of static thermal line rating, adapts the transmission capacity based on the expected weather conditions. This results, on average, in higher transmission capacities. First pilot projects have proven its efficiency. This paper analyzes the potential of DLR and demonstrates how DLR can be integrated in a dispatch optimization while managing possible errors in the forecasts of the line ratings with two different approaches. Both approaches result in robust optimization problems and guarantee that there is a suitable remedial action for all realizations of forecast errors given by uncertainty sets. The first approach relies on corrective control actions that are calculated centrally, once the actual line rating is known. The second approach relies on affine policies, which directly relate the current line rating to corrective control measures. This approach can be deployed in a decentralized manner. In case studies, the two approaches are applied and the reduction of overall operational costs is investigated exemplarily as a function of the forecast accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper we present a framework to efficiently characterize the available operational flexibility in a multi-area power system. We focus on the available reserves and the tie-line flows. The proposed approach is an alternative to the current calculation of the available transfer capacity (ATC), as it considers location and availability of reserves, transmission constraints, and interdependencies of tie-line flows between different areas, while it takes into account the N - 1 security criterion. The method is based on computational geometry using polytopic projections. It requires only a limited amount of information exchange and does not need central coordination. The method has two versions: a passive approach, and an active approach where neighboring areas can share reserves. In that respect we also introduce the term "exportable flexibility". Case studies demonstrate the improved tie-line utilization, especially if reserves are shared, and the visualization benefits.

Abstract: The paper proposes a new reliability model of ageing distribution cable and simulation methodology for prioritization of cable replacement. The proposed reliability model combines IEC cable thermal model, Arrhenius aging model and Weibull probability distribution. Here, Weibull scale parameter is defined through the Arrhenius aging model, in which conductor temperature is governed by the cable thermal model. A novel estimation method for the calculation of Arrhenius model parameters is proposed. The cable reliability model is then incorporated into the developed sequential Monte Carlo simulation procedure and reliability indicators and loss-of-lives are calculated. An industry based cable ranking scheme is further proposed to prioritize individual cable due for replacement. The whole methodology is tested on several medium voltage distribution networks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the cooperative control problem of AC microgrids consisting of both voltage-controlled voltage-source inverters and current-controlled voltage-source inverters. The voltage-controlled voltage-source inverters dictate the frequency and voltage of the microgrid and the current-controlled voltage-source inverters provide quick and decoupled active and reactive power support to the microgrid. To handle the nonlinear and heterogeneous dynamics of the inverters, we have developed a distributed feedforward approach based on the cooperative control of multi-agent systems. The proposed controller presents three advantages in comparison with the existing works. First, all the inverters share one communication network, and the locations of the inverters over the communication network can be arbitrarily sited as long as all the inverters are connected. Second, the selection of the control gains does not rely on either the whole microgrid dynamics or the topology of the communication network. Third, the inverters' dynamics after input-output feedback linearization are allowed to be different. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by the simulation study of a microgrid system for three cases, i.e., frequency and voltage restoration after islanding, active and reactive power adjustment after abrupt load changes and system performance subject to communication link failure and restoration.

Abstract: Electricity markets are based on several sequential energy and reserve trading mechanisms to constantly maintain the balance between generation and demand. During the last years, reserve markets are getting much importance all around the world with the increasing social awareness of the renewable energy benefits. Additional reserve quantities and larger remunerations are being implemented by the regulators since this renewable energy is highly dependent on weather conditions uncertainties. Utilities are therefore demanding more and more powerful models to better optimize their reserve bidding curves to be sent to the system operators. This paper describes a new methodology to obtain an optimized real bidding curve for the secondary (spinning) reserve market. The approach is based on the maximization of a company profit, assuming a set of residual demand curves scenarios for its competitors' representation, and considering the day-ahead market opportunity cost to build the reserve cost curve. The case study validates the main features of the proposed methodology by its application to the Spanish secondary reserve market. This methodology is being daily used by one of the most important electricity companies in Spain.

Abstract: In conventional optimal power flow (OPF), parameters of electrical components such as resistance and thermal ratings of the overhead lines, are assumed to be constant despite the fact that they are strongly sensitive to the weather effect (e.g., temperature or wind speed) which influences the accuracy of optimal power flow results. This paper introduces a weather-based optimal power flow (WB-OPF) algorithm with wind farm integration by considering the temperature related resistance and dynamic line rating (DLR) of overhead transmission lines. A method of calculating the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead lines, given the weather conditions, is presented as a set of coupled temperature and power flow equations. A simplified general model is proposed to calculate the dynamic line rating (DLR) for maximizing the utilization of wind power. A Primal-dual Interior Point (PDIP) method is developed to solve the WB-OPF problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and demonstrated in the paper by two example power systems.

Abstract: Distributed energy storage ( DES) offers a number of benefits to improve the power system reliability. This paper presents an improved corrective security constrained optimal power flow (CSCOPF) with DES system. The proposed DES model takes into account the current state of charge (SOC) and the energy capacity model of the DES. The corrective control actions employed in the paper include not only the traditional long-term rescheduling control actions, but also the short-term post-contingency fast corrective control of the DES. A hybrid method is developed to solve the improved CSCOPF problem, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and demonstrated in the paper by three example power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved corrective security constrained optimal power flow (CSCOPF) for a meshed AC/DC power transmission network with voltage source converter based multi-terminal HVDC (VSC-MTDC) grids. The security constrains of N-1 contingencies for both AC and DC networks are fully considered in the CSCOPF problem. The corrective actions employed in this paper include not only the traditional long-term rescheduling control actions of the AC system, but also the short term post-contingency fast corrective control of multi-terminal VSC-HVDC. A hybrid method is developed to solve the improved CSCOPF problem and the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and demonstrated in this paper by two example meshed AC/DC power systems.

Abstract: Future power systems could benefit considerably from having a continuous real-time estimate of system inertia. If realized, this could provide reference inputs to proactive control and protection systems which could enhance not only system stability but also operational economics through, for example, more informed ancillary reserve planning using knowledge of prevailing system conditions and stability margins. Performing these predictions in real time is a significant challenge owing to the complex stochastic and temporal relationships between available measurements. This paper proposes a statistical model capable of estimating system inertia in real time through observed steady-state and relatively small frequency variations; it is trained to learn the features that inter-relate steady-state averaged frequency variations and system inertia, using historical system data demonstrated over two consecutive years. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a Gaussian Mixture Model with temporal dependence encoded as Markov chains. Applied to the U.K. power system, it produces an optimized mean squared error within 0.1 s(2) for 95% of the daily estimation if being calibrated on a half-hourly basis and maintains robustness through measurement interruptions of up to a period of two hours.

In addition, the scalability is improved compared to the direct resolution of the quadratic problem involved, due to the linear mixed-integer formulation. On the other hand, the particular structure of the unit commitment problem guarantees that the solution of the mixed-integer linear formulation proposed is an epsilon-optimal of the original problem. This property allows the direct comparison of the proposed approximation with the original formulation. In most cases, analyzed results indicate that the proposed approach has the best performance compared to other formulations where the bounds of the quadratic cost function are known.

Abstract: Improved formulations of and solution techniques for the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem are critical to improving current market practices in economic dispatch. We introduce the IV-ACOPF formulation that unlike canonical ACOPF formulations-which represent network balancing through nonlinear coupling-is based on a current injections approach that linearly couple the quadratic constraints at each bus; yet, the IV-ACOPF is mathematically equivalent to the canonical ACOPF formulation. We propose a successive linear programming (SLP) approach to solve the IV-ACOPF, which we refer to as the SLP IV-ACOPF algorithm. The SLP IV-ACOPF leverages commercial LP solvers and can be readily extended and integrated into more complex decision processes, e.g., unit commitment and transmission switching. We demonstrate with the standard MATPOWER test suite an acceptable quality of convergence to a best-known solution and linear scaling of computational time in proportion to network

Abstract: This letter proposes a novel granule computing-based framework for prediction intervals (PIs) construction of solar irradiance time series that has significant impacts on solar power production. Distinguished from most existing methods, the new framework can address both stochastic and knowledge uncertainties in constructing PIs. The proposed method has proved to be highly effective in terms of both reliability and sharpness through a real case study using measurement data obtained from Hong Kong Observatory.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-nodal intertemporal Cournot gaming model with transmission constraints and uses it to simulate energy-only and capacity-energy market designs in the presence of uncertainties stemming from intermittent renewable power generation. Both market paradigms are compared to a competitive benchmark in order to determine which one performs better in a concentrated market with significant penetration of wind and solar generation. As a specific example, the model is applied to the South Australian zone of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The simulation results for the time interval 2013-2030 show that the capacity-energy market has the potential to induce significant new capacity and push prices much closer to the competitive level in contrast to the current energy-only market design.

Abstract: This paper provides a systematic approach to address the fundamental electricity auction issue regarding how to include security boundaries associated with system stability into a security-constrained DC-OPF-based model. These boundaries are linearly approximated by a reduced number of hyperplanes, from which a set of linear inequality security/stability constraints is derived and included into a proposed voltage security-constrained DC-OPF auction model. This allows the proper implementation of a true DC formulation, taking full advantage of its associated simplicity and robustness in the solution algorithm. Case studies are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method and to demonstrate that the market clearing and power dispatch resulting from the optimization solution process are within the desired feasible and secure region, contrary to the typical security constrained DC-OPF auction model, which may fail to meet this condition.

Abstract: We consider the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem, formulated as a nonconvex Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) with complex variables. ACOPF may be solved to global optimality with a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation in cases where its QCQP formulation attains zero duality gap. However, when there is positive duality gap, no optimal solution to the SDP relaxation is feasible for ACOPF. One way to find a global optimum is to partition the problem using a spatial branch-and-bound method. Tightening upper and lower variable bounds can improve solution times in spatial branching by potentially reducing the number of partitions needed. We propose special-purpose closed-form bound tightening methods to tighten limits on nodal powers, line flows, phase angle differences, and voltage magnitudes. Computational experiments are conducted using a spatial branch-and-cut solver. We construct variants of IEEE test cases with high duality gaps to demonstrate the effectiveness of the bound tightening procedures.

Abstract: The total supply capability (TSC) is an important index for assessing the reliability of a distribution power system. In this paper, two models to evaluate the TSC are established. In the first, the TSC is acquired with the conditions that all load outages can be restored via network reconfiguration with transformers' N-1 contingencies, i.e., that all constraints related to branch thermal ratings and bus-voltage limits can be satisfied following restoration for each N-1 contingency. The second model, which is revision of the first, considers the daily load curves for different classes of customers, e.g., residential, commercial and industrial. Both models can be formulated as mixed integer problems with second-order cone programming (MISOCP), which can be solved using commercially available optimization software. Two test systems are used to demonstrate the applicability of the presented models. Numerical results show that the presented model is more accurate than the previously published models. This proposed analytical approach can be applied in a range of network planning studies, e.g., for selecting appropriate ratings of transformers, or for optimal locating of circuit breakers and distributed energy resources.

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient methodology is proposed to deal with segmented-time reconfiguration problem of distribution networks coupled with segmented-time reactive power control of distributed generators. The target is to find the optimal dispatching schedule of all controllable switches and distributed generators' reactive powers in order to minimize comprehensive cost. Corresponding constraints, including voltage profile, maximum allowable daily switching operation numbers (MADSON), reactive power limits, and so on, are considered. The strategy of grouping branches is used to simplify the formulated mathematical problem and a hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) method is presented to search the optimal solution. Fuzzy adaptive inference is integrated into basic HPSO method in order to avoid being trapped in local optima. The proposed fuzzy adaptive inference-based hybrid PSO algorithm (FAHPSO) is implemented in VC++ 6.0 program language. A modified version of the typical 70-node distribution network and several real distribution networks are used to test the performance of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed methodology is an efficient method for comprehensive cost minimization in distribution systems with distributed generators.

Abstract: Distributed generations (DGs) introduce significant uncertainties to restoration of active distribution networks, in addition to roughly estimated load demands. An adjustable robust restoration optimization model with a two-stage objective is proposed in this paper, involving the uncertain DG outputs and load demands. The first stage generates optimal strategies for recovery of outage power and the second stage seeks the worst-case fluctuation scenarios. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved using the column-and-constraint generation method. The feasibility and reliability of the strategies obtained via this robust optimization model can be guaranteed for all cases in the predefined uncertainty sets with good performance. A technique known as the uncertainty budget is used to adjust the conservativeness of this model, providing a tradeoff between conservativeness and robustness. Numerical tests are carried out on the modified PG&E 69-bus system and a modified 246-bus system to compare the robust optimization model against a deterministic restoration model, which verifies the superiority of this proposed model.

Abstract: In a hydro-thermal unit commitment (H-TUC) problem, accurate modeling of the hydro unit power generation, which is a nonlinear function of the net head and the total power release, is crucial but difficult due to its nonlinearity and non-concavity. This letter proposes an efficient mixed integer linear program (MILP) approximation method for the H-TUC problem based on the variable separation and piecewise linear (PWL) technique. Tests on different systems demonstrate the proposed method can provide high quality solutions more efficiently.

Abstract: A method is proposed to detect and identify power system transmission line outages in near real-time. The method exploits the statistical properties of the small random fluctuations in electricity generation and demand that a power system is subject to as time evolves. To detect and identify transmission line outages, a linearized incremental small-signal power system model is used in conjunction with high-speed synchronized voltage phase angle measurements obtained from phasor measurement units. By monitoring the statistical properties of voltage phase angle time-series, line outages are detected and identified using techniques borrowed from the theory of quickest change detection. As illustrated through case studies, the proposed method is effective in detecting and identifying single- and double-line outages in an accurate and timely fashion.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the optimal problems of dc-segmentation for multi-infeed HVDC systems based on stability performance and studies the selecting method for the optimal dc-segmentation scheme. First, three major stability problems of multiinfeed HVDC systems are pointed out, which implies the necessity of the optimization for dc-segmentation. Second, three typical evaluation indices which correspond to the above three stability problems are introduced: multi-infeed interaction factor, multi-infeed effective short-circuit ratio, and frequency bias factor. To improve evaluation effects of the typical indices, the subindices are presented. Third, in order to solve this multi-objective decision-making problem, a linear weighted sum model is built, and a comprehensive weight method is adopted to calculate the weight coefficients. Based on the stability problems, a selecting method is established to choose the optimal dc-segmentation scheme. Finally, a four-machine multi-infeed HVDC system and a practical multi-infeed HVDC system in China are taken as examples, respectively. Candidate dc-segmentation schemes of each system are evaluated by the proposed method, and the optimal one is selected. Detailed stability studies of the candidate schemes are executed. The result indicates that the stability of the optimal scheme is better than the stabilities of others, which verifies the validity of the proposed method.

Abstract: Bitumen tanks were tested to investigate the capability of industrial heating loads to provide frequency response to an electric power system. A decentralized control algorithm was developed enabling the tanks to alter their power consumption in proportion to the variations of grid frequency. The control maintains the normal operation of tanks and causes little impact on their primary function of storing hot bitumen. Field investigations were undertaken on 76 tanks with power ratings from 17 to 75 kW. A model of a population of controlled tanks was developed. The behavior of the tanks was compared between the simulations and the field tests. The model of controlled tanks was then integrated with a simplified Great Britain power system model. It was shown that the controlled tanks were able to contribute to the grid frequency control in a manner similar to and faster than that provided by frequency-sensitive generation.

Abstract: The development of a multi-terminal (MT) high voltage DC (HVDC) grid based on voltage source converter (VSC) technology has been envisaged as a key development for harnessing the vast offshore wind production potential of the North Seas. In this paper, market integration of a centrally dispatched MT HVDC Grid based on droop control is examined. Particular emphasis is given on the management of onshore imbalance volumes due to offshore wind power forecast errors. The economic importance of the control choices of the operator of such an active transmission grid is highlighted, and regulatory implications are briefly discussed. The main contribution of the paper is the coherent development of a droop-controlled MT HVDC grid scheme that integrates optimal power flow (OPF) dispatch, and imbalance volume management.

Abstract: The recently-developed Two-sided Arnoldi and Sensitive Pole Algorithm (TSA-SPA) is effective and robust in computing the most sensitive eigenvalues with respect to control parameter changes in large-scale power systems. This paper extends the TSA-SPA to handle different system parameters, including control, system operating and network parameters. The proposed algorithm makes use of perturbation in reduced matrix obtained from Arnoldi/ TSA method through linearization and successfully avoids the need for TSA-SPA to formulate the whole state matrix of the system and to explicitly calculate the elements' variations in system state matrix. A new deflation method is also proposed and adopted in the generalized algorithm to find other sensitive eigenvalues. Simulation results illustrate that the generalized algorithm is able to not only maintain the excellent properties of TSA-SPA in terms of convergence and robustness, but also consider various parameter changes effectively in large-scale power systems.

Abstract: Convex relaxations of the power flow equations and, in particular, the semi-definite programming ( SDP) and second-order cone (SOC) relaxations, have attracted significant interest in recent years. The quadratic convex (QC) relaxation is a departure from these relaxations in the sense that it imposes constraints to preserve stronger links between the voltage variables through convex envelopes of the polar representation. This paper is a systematic study of the QC relaxation for AC optimal power flow with realistic side constraints. The main theoretical result shows that the QC relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation and neither dominates nor is dominated by the SDP relaxation. In addition, comprehensive computational results show that the QC relaxation may produce significant improvements in accuracy over the SOC relaxation at a reasonable computational cost, especially for networks with tight bounds on phase angle differences. The QC and SOC relaxations are also shown to be significantly faster and reliable compared to the SDP relaxation given the current state of the respective solvers.

Abstract: Loss minimizing generator dispatch profiles for power systems are usually derived using optimization techniques. However, some authors have noted that a system's K-GL matrix can be used to analytically determine a loss minimizing dispatch. This letter draws on recent research on the characterization of transmission system losses to demonstrate how the K-GL matrix achieves this. A new proof of the observed zero row summation property of the Y-GGM matrix is provided to this end.

Abstract: The relatively fixed residential day-ahead real-time electricity price reflects insufficient information of the market, so the response of residential energy management system (EMS) to the real-time pricing (RTP) is not complete and therefore retailers are exposed to the risk of price fluctuation in balance market. Direct load control (DLC) in cooperative game is proposed in this paper. A cooperative game union comprised of some users and a retailer is established to minimize the union costs. The union provides an opportunity to access the balance market indirectly for residents and to reduce risks and costs for the retailer. In addition, Shapley value which embodies the fairness is used in union profits allocation. The method that avoids bidding for residential users simplifies the thresholds of residents to participate in market. Furthermore, the DLC union contributes to imbalance self-management for the retailer, which helps him avoid paying for the regulation cost involved in the deviation between the total quantity bought at markets and the actual consumption. The achievement of union's goal respects the constraints set by users. The method that alleviates the disturbance of DLC to residents meets the dual goals of being both fully responsive and non-disruptive.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generator excitation voltage control scheme for emergency frequency regulation of island power systems with voltage-dependent loads. It is able to regulate the load voltages and their power demand to maintain stable frequency when the systems have no active power reserves. Taking an actual island power system with aluminum electrolysis loads as an example, a frequency and excitation voltage control model for the actual island power system is established. Then, by applying the output regulation theory, feedback control signals with the frequency deviations and the power imbalances are used to obtain a practical feasible control scheme whose structure is similar to that of primary and secondary frequency control. Furthermore, by taking into account the constraints of generator voltage controls and load bus voltages, two useful conditions are found to limit the power imbalances. Our control strategy can maintain the frequency and voltages in permitted ranges. Both the WSCC 9-bus system and the actual island power system are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the spinning reserve requirements of generating systems, taking into consideration the loss of load risk due to failures in the generation and transmission network. In order to provide a more flexible and robust tool to assess the risk indices for bulk power systems, a Monte Carlo simulation based tool is proposed. Due to the rarity of the events associated with this particular problem, an unbiased estimator based on importance sampling is applied, and the set of optimal parameters is obtained using a cross-entropy method. The proposed methodology is capable of assessing the operating reserve requirements, especially the one that is synchronized, to cope with failures and capacity restrictions of both generating and transmission systems. The IEEE-RTS (reliability test system) is used to test the proposed methodology and also some modifications of this system are created to fully verify the ability of the proposed approach to satisfactorily respond to the transmission constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for ranking critical nodes in bulk power systems. The proposed approach is able to offer a list of nodes or substations, from which system planners can easily identify those facilities with more urgent investment needs. The ranking process includes both static (via optimal power flow) and dynamic (via transient stability) performance analyses to assess deterministic indices. These indices measure the static and dynamic vulnerabilities of the network. As an extension of the deterministic approach, a new ranking based on the same indices is evaluated through a Monte Carlo simulation, considering several load scenarios modeled through uncertainties and the related generating dispatches. Applications in a test system presenting the rank of critical nodes are provided and discussed.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) can be integrated into a single entity, namely, virtual power plant (VPP). The integration enables them to participate in competitive wholesale electricity markets. According to the different types of uncertainty faced by different DERs, this integration can also act as a risk-hedging mechanism providing a surplus profit. In this paper, using a two-stage stochastic programming approach, risk-averse optimal offering model for a VPP trading in a joint market of energy and spinning reserve service is presented. The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to control the risk of profit variability. Uncertainties involved in generation of renewables, consumption of loads, calls for reserve service, as well as prices in the day-ahead market, the spinning reserve market (RM) and the balancing (real-time) market (BM), are taken into consideration. This paper assesses how total and surplus profits of VPP are affected by risk-aversion, participation in the RM, and the pricing system in the BM. For this purpose, the role of the integration and the trends of energy and reserve transactions under both single and dual pricing systems in the BM are addressed in detail through a numerical study.

Abstract: This paper considers future distribution networks featuring inverter-interfaced photovoltaic (PV) systems, and addresses the synthesis of feedback controllers that seek real-and reactive-power inverter setpoints corresponding to AC optimal power flow (OPF) solutions. The objective is to bridge the temporal gap between long-term system optimization and real-time inverter control, and enable seamless PV-owner participation without compromising system efficiency and stability. The design of the controllers is grounded on a dual epsilon-subgradient method, while semidefinite programming relaxations are advocated to bypass the non-convexity of AC OPF formulations. Global convergence of inverter output powers is analytically established for diminishing stepsize rules for cases where: i) computational limits dictate asynchronous updates of the controller signals, and ii) inverter reference inputs may be updated at a faster rate than the power-output settling time.

Abstract: Voltage source converter (VSC)-based high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission is considered the future of offshore power transmission. This paper aims at providing a reliable VSC-HVDC transmission system architecture between offshore wind farms and onshore grids. In this paper, a large-capacity, low-speed flywheel energy storage system (FESS) based on a squirrel cage induction machine is applied in parallel with the VSC-HVDC at the grid side converter. The FESS is dedicated for surge power (due to power flow imbalance during fault) absorption instead of being dissipated in the form of resistive losses. Since the duration of these surges is relatively small, it has been shown that the flywheel can effectively mitigate this problem. In addition to the fault ride-through support during fault conditions, the FESS is employed for power leveling functionality during normal operation. The performance parameters of the proposed approach are investigated via both simulation and experimental results. A 132-kV, 100-MW HVDC system is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink during normal and fault conditions. The proposed architecture is substantiated experimentally through a scaled down test rig with a 2-kW FESS.

Abstract: This paper explores the effects of allowing large, price-responsive consumers to provide reserves in a power system with significant penetration of wind energy. A bilevel optimization model represents the utility maximization problem of a large consumer, subject to a stochastic day-ahead co-optimization of energy and reserves that a system operator would solve to clear the market while considering wind power uncertainty. An examination of the market outcomes from both an illustrative and a large-scale study using this model allows analysis of a) the effects of the type of behavior of the large consumer (i.e., strategic vs competitive), b) limits on the amount of reserves it is allowed to provide, and c) variability and accuracy of characterization of wind power uncertainty.

Abstract: When power grids are heavily stressed with a bulk power transfer, it is useful to have a fast indication of the increased stress when multiple line outages occur. Reducing the bulk power transfer when the outages are severe could forestall further cascading of the outages. We show that synchrophasor measurements of voltage angles at all the area tie lines can be used to indicate the severity of multiple outages. These synchrophasor measurements are readily combined into an "area angle" that can quickly track the severity of multiple outages after they occur. We present a procedure to define thresholds for the area angle that relate to the maximum power that can be transferred through the area until a line limit is reached. Then in real time we would monitor the area angle and compare it to the thresholds when line outages occur to determine the urgency (or not) of actions to reduce the bulk transfer of power through the area. The procedure also identifies exceptional cases in which separate actions to resolve local power distribution problems are needed. We illustrate the thresholds and monitoring with the area angle across several states of Northwestern USA.

Abstract: This paper presents a tri-level reliability-constrained robust power system expansion planning (SEP) framework modeling the uncertainty of electricity demand, wind power generation, and availability of units and lines. In the proposed tri-level SEP model, electricity demand and wind power generation being continuous uncertain variables are modeled by bounded intervals and availability of units and lines being discrete uncertain variables are modeled by probability distributions. Simulation results on the Garver 6-bus, the IEEE 24-bus, and the IEEE 73-bus test systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed tri-level framework to cope with multi-fold planning uncertainties.

Abstract: Previous studies of market power within a regional system have considered multiple competing generation operators and the role of transmission constraints. However, these studies typically assume simplified structures in which each operator is restricted to a unique node in a transmission constrained network. Real systems typically have operators making decisions for units in several zones at once. Past studies also implicitly treated market power as a static concept for a given set of market rules and network configuration. We demonstrate that market power is dynamic, and can vary significantly with fuel prices and even with large-scale weather patterns. We also demonstrate the impact on region-wide market power of operators that manage units in multiple zones. We use the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) as an illustrative case study, and apply a conjectured supply function equilibrium (CSFE) approach that accounts for transmission constraints. We show that the companies with greater influence on the market price will depend on the relative prices of coal and natural gas. We also show that a weather event, such as a period without any wind, can have a substantial impact on market power.

Abstract: Merit order of renewable generation has produced an increasing, relevant number of zero values in Spanish electricity spot prices since 2010, in contrast with the rest of markets which rarely present zero values. This letter shows that existing methodologies for normalizing the price distribution fail to yield a proper normalization. This letter proposes a new algorithm based on Nataf transformation which addresses this issue and ensures a correct normalization. Numerical results validate the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Most existing approaches for distribution network reconfiguration assume that the distribution system is (three-phase) balanced and a single-phase equivalent is used. However, distribution feeders are usually unbalanced due to a large number of single-phase loads, nonsymmetrical conductor spacing, and three-phase line topology. This paper builds on our previous work and studies feeder reconfiguration for unbalanced distribution systems with distributed generation (DG). The three-phase bus locations and sizes of DG units are determined using sensitivity analysis and nonlinear programming, respectively, and distribution feeders are reconfigured every hour based on the status of time-varying loads, output power from DG units and faults on the network while minimizing the energy loss costs and DG operating costs. Simulation results show the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Accurate forecasts of electrical substations are mandatory for the efficiency of the Advanced Distribution Automation functions in distribution systems. The paper describes the design of a class of machine-learning models, namely neural networks, for the load forecasts of medium-voltage/low-voltage substations. We focus on the methodology of neural network model design in order to obtain a model that has the best achievable predictive ability given the available data. Variable selection and model selection are applied to electrical load forecasts to ensure an optimal generalization capacity of the neural network model. Real measurements collected in French distribution systems are used to validate our study. The results show that the neural network-based models outperform the time series models and that the design methodology guarantees the best generalization ability of the neural network model for the load forecasting purpose based on the same data.

Abstract: This letter presents an optimal power flow model with the consideration of flexible transmission line impedance. By the use of big-M based complementary constraints, the original non-convex model can be transformed into a mixed integer quadratic programming that can be solved by branch and bound method. Numerical results from several test systems show that flexible transmission lines can provide better economic dispatch and reduce the total generation cost. Moreover, some infeasible optimal power flow scenarios can become solvable with optimal adjustment of the flexible transmission line impedance.

Abstract: To make better use of local generators' dynamic var reserve to improve short-term voltage stability (STVS), this paper proposes an integrated high side var-voltage control (IHSV C) for power plants in receiving-end power systems. The IHSV C consists of a plant-level multi-machine var coordinator (MMVC) and several unit-level high side voltage controllers (HSVCs). MMVC coordinates the reactive power output among generators and provides control parameters for HSVCs, while HSVCs can maintain the voltage of a pre-defined voltage control point (VCP) by regulating the voltage reference of the excitation control of each generator. Therefore, when the system suffers a serious fault, (IHSVC)-C-2 can drive the generators to provide stronger var support. Consequently, the voltage stability can be improved. A conceptual model of the receiving-end power system in China Southern Power Grid (CSG) is established, and the (IHSVC)-C-2 has been validated through a simulation analysis on the system. Both time-domain simulation results and the voltage sag severity index (VSSI) have fully demonstrated its performance. Therefore (IHSVC)-C-2 offers a new and effective approach to improve STVS of receiving-end power systems.

Abstract: Proliferation of renewable energy resources in distribution networks has captured distribution companies' attention towards more active management tools. Thanks to the smart grid paradigm, hourly network reconfiguration, which is still among immature ideas, can bring the activeness required to handle fluctuating output of renewable resources. The aim of this study is to analyze the worthiness of the hourly reconfiguration in the presence of renewable energy resources. For doing so, a mathematical model is devised to minimize daily network losses via applying hourly reconfigurations. The model is a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem and is solved via MOSEK solver. The electrical demand variations as well as renewable power generation fluctuations during a day are taken into account. The proposed method is applied to the Baran 33-bus system and the results including a great deal of sensitivity analyses on key parameters are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Great emphasis has been placed on rational value assessment of wind power in system in recent times. Because there are different properties in various output levels of wind power, there should also be different values. This paper proposes a novel method for value assessment of wind power to get a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation. Wind power outputs are divided horizontally based on the wind layer model. Then comprehensive studies of cost and benefit are conducted layer by layer. Furthermore, the detailed characteristics in layers, storage benefit, and value allocation are analyzed. After that, the sensitivities about the chosen system, parameters, region size, and demand-side participation are discussed at length. The effectiveness and rationality of the model are proved by the case study. The model assesses the value of wind power more precisely and profoundly, which would provide significant guidance in the setting of price policy for wind power and market supervision.

Abstract: Grid connection of a DFIG for power generation changes the power system load flow and introduces dynamic interactions with the synchronous generators (SGs). A method is proposed in this paper for the separate examination of the impact of those two affecting factors, the change of load flow and dynamic interaction brought about by the DFIG, on the electromechanical oscillation modes of a power system. The method is developed on the establishment of a "closed-loop control system" type of state space model of the power system where the DFIG is treated as the feedback controller. The established model unambiguously indicates that the impact of the DFIG can be examined separately: (1) With the DFIG being modelled as a constant power injection into the system, the impact of the load flow change brought about by the DFIG on the oscillation modes is determined; (2) The impact of the dynamic interactions introduced by the DFIG is estimated by calculating the contribution of the damping torque from the DFIG with its full dynamics being considered. Thus a more detailed examination on and deeper insight into the impact of grid connection of the DFIGs on power system small-signal angular stability is obtained by using the proposed method.

Abstract: Although there are vast potential locations to install FACTS devices in a power system, the actual installation number is very limited due to economical consideration. Therefore the allocation strategy exhibits strong sparsity. This paper formulates FACTS device allocation problem as a general sparsity-constrained OPF problem and employs L-q(0 < q <= 1) norms to enforce sparsity on FACTS devices setting values to achieve solutions with desirable device numbers and sites. An algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve the sparsity-constrained OPF problem. The algorithm exploits the separability structure and decomposes the original problem into an NLP subproblem, an L-q regularization subproblem, and a simple dual variable update step. The NLP subproblem is solved by the interior point method. The L-q regularization subproblem has a closed-form solution expressed by shrinkage-threholding operators. The convergence of the proposed method is theoretically analyzed and discussed. The proposed method is successfully tested on allocation of SVC, TCSC, and TCPS on IEEE 30-, 118-, and 300-bus systems. Case studies are presented and discussed for both single-type and multiple-type FACTS devices allocation problems, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed formulation and algorithm.

Abstract: As penetration of wind power generation increases, system operators must account for its stochastic nature in a reliable and cost-efficient manner. These conflicting objectives can be traded-off by accounting for the variability and uncertainty of wind power generation. This letter presents a new methodology to estimate uncertainty sets for parameters of probability distributions that capture wind generation uncertainty and variability.

Abstract: Higher variable renewable generation penetrations are occurring throughout the world on different power systems. These resources increase the variability and uncertainty on the system which must be accommodated by an increase in the flexibility of the system resources in order to maintain reliability. Many scheduling strategies have been discussed and introduced to ensure that this flexibility is available at multiple timescales. To meet variability, that is, the expected changes in system conditions, two recent strategies have been introduced: time-coupled multi-period market clearing models and the incorporation of ramp capability constraints. To appropriately evaluate these methods, it is important to assess both efficiency and reliability. But it is also important to assess the incentive structure to ensure that resources asked to perform in different ways have the proper incentives to follow these directions, which is a step often ignored in simulation studies. We find that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. We also find that look-ahead horizon length in multi-period market models can impact incentives. This paper proposes scheduling and pricing methods that ensure expected ramps are met reliably, efficiently, and with associated prices based on true marginal costs that incentivize resources to do as directed by the market. Case studies show improvements of the new method.

Abstract: Unlike transmission systems, distribution feeders in North America operate under unbalanced conditions at all times, and generally have a single strong voltage source. When a distribution feeder is connected to a strong substation source, the system is dynamically very stable, even for large transients. However if a distribution feeder, or part of the feeder, is separated from the substation and begins to operate as an islanded microgrid, transient dynamics become more of an issue. To assess the impact of transient dynamics at the distribution level, it is not appropriate to use traditional transmission solvers, which generally assume transposed lines and balanced loads. Full electromagnetic solvers capture a high level of detail, but it is difficult to model large systems because of the required detail. This paper proposes an electromechanical transient model of synchronous machines for distribution-level modeling and microgrids. This approach includes not only the machine model, but also its interface with an unbalanced network solver, and a powerflow method to solve unbalanced conditions without a strong reference bus. The presented method is validated against a full electromagnetic transient simulation.

Abstract: A model predictive controller (MPC) for load frequency control (LFC) of an interconnected power system is investigated. The MPC is based on a simplified system model of the Nordic power system, and it takes into account limitations on tie-line power flow, generation capacity, and generation rate of change. The participation factors for each generator are optimization variables, and suggestions are made as to how one can ensure tie-line power transfer margins through slack-variables, and pricing information through the objective function. The solution of MPC for LFC is completed by including a Kalman filter for state estimation. The presented MPC is compared against a conventional LFC/AGC scheme with proportional integral (PI) controllers. Simulations show that the MPC gives better frequency response while using cheaper resources. This paper illustrates that MPC could be a realistic solution to some of the LFC problems power systems are facing today.

Abstract: As the number of combined-cycle units increases, efficient modeling approaches for these units play important roles for independent system operators (ISOs). Based on various combinations of combustion turbines (CTs) and steam turbines (STs), the combined-cycle unit could work at different configurations (modes) with different efficiencies. In this paper, we propose an edge-based formulation for the combined-cycle units in the unit commitment problem to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of current modeling approaches. Our formulation can 1) clearly describe the transition processes among different configurations so as to satisfy the ISO financial offer submission requirements and (2) capture physical constraints of each turbine, including the exact min-up/down time and time dependent startup cost, in the combined-cycle units so as to increase the operational flexibility while ensuring system feasibility. This model fits well with the current U.S. deregulated electricity market. The final numerical studies show that our approaches perform better than the current configuration-based modeling approach.

Abstract: With the growing development in demand response, load serving entities (LSEs) may participate in electricity market as strategic bidders by offering coupon-based demand response (C-DR) programs to customers. However, due to customers' versatile electricity consumption patterns under C-DR programs as well as the increasing penetration of wind power generation, obtaining the deterministic bidding decision becomes unprecedented complex for LSEs. To address this challenge, a new strategic bidding model for an LSE is proposed in which the primary objective is to maximize the LSE's profit by providing optimal C-DR considering high wind power penetration. The proposed strategic bidding is a bi-level optimization problem with the LSE's net revenue maximization as the upper level problem and the ISO's economic dispatch (ED) for generation cost minimization as the lower level problem. This bi-level model is converted to a stochastic mathematic program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) by recasting the lower level problem as its Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) optimality conditions. Then, the stochastic MPEC is transformed to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is solvable using available optimization software, based on strong duality theory. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified with simulation studies of two sample systems.

Abstract: Step changes in the curve of locational marginal prices (LMP) under load variation have been known characteristics given its present formulation. Identifying LMP intervals under wind uncertainty is important for market participants to assess and mitigate their risks when price forecast is needed. This work proposes a bi-level optimization model to calculate the LMP intervals under wind uncertainty without the repetitive Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The specific bus LMP maximization (or minimization) is the upper level problem, while the ISO's economic dispatch is the lower level problem. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new policy to calculate the locational marginal price (LMP) in the distribution networks containing distributed generation (DG). The proposed policy is based on remunerating the DG units to reduce the loss and emission of the network. LMP at each DG bus is calculated according to the contribution of the DG to the reduced amount of loss and emission. An iterative algorithm which is based on the nucleolus theory is proposed to allocate the loss and emission reduction. The proposed algorithm will provide a robust state estimation tool for distribution companies (DISCOs) in the next step of operation. The state estimation tool provides the decision maker with the ability to exert its control over private DG units when the loss and emission are minimized. Also, the proposed pricing policy requires decision maker to simply apply its best response strategy to the LMP based on the priority of loss, emission and DISCO's extra benefit. The proposed methodology is applied to two realistic distribution networks, and efficiency and accuracy of the method are verified.

Abstract: This paper describes a fault location method which uses sparsely located wide-area synchronized phasor measurements. The main contribution is the way fault location is reformulated as a sparse estimation problem. Faulted system is modeled by equivalent terminal bus injections which would cause the same changes in bus voltages with the fault current drawn at any point along the faulted line. Once these injections are estimated, the fact that the ratio between equivalent injections at the two terminal buses depends only on the ratio of serial impedances on each side of the fault point can be used to locate the fault. It is shown that this formulation applies to both two terminal lines as well as teed lines regardless of fault type or resistance. Assuming availability of an accurate three-phase network model and a sufficient number of phasor measurements over the entire network, an underdetermined set of linear equations can be formed and then solved for the sparse equivalent bus injections. This is accomplished by applying two norm regularization optimization methods namely Lasso and overlapping group Lasso. Effectiveness of these methods are verified by extensive simulations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel functional observer based quasi-decentralized load frequency control scheme for power systems. Based on functional observers theory, quasi-decentralized functional observers are designed to implement any given state feedback controller. The designed functional observers are decoupled from each other and have a simpler structure in comparison to the state observer based schemes. The proposed functional observer scheme is applied to a complex nonlinear power system and the proposed design method is based on the entire network topology.

Abstract: An algorithm for the detection and frequency estimation of periodic forced oscillations in power systems is proposed. The method operates by comparing the periodogram of synchrophasor measurements to a detection threshold. This threshold is established by deriving a general expression for the distribution of the periodogram and is related to the algorithm's probabilities of false alarm and detection. Unlike classic detection algorithms designed for use with white Gaussian noise, the proposed algorithm uses a detection threshold that varies with frequency to account for the colored nature of synchrophasor measurements. Further, a detection method based on multiple segments of data is also proposed to improve the algorithm's performance as a monitoring tool in the online environment. A design approach that helps to ensure that the best available probability of detection from any one detection segment is constantly increasing with the duration of the forced oscillation is also developed. Results from application of the detection algorithm to simulated and measured power system data suggest that the algorithm provides the expected detection performance and can be used to detect forced oscillations in practical monitoring of power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel mixed-integer secondorder cone programming model for the robust multi-stage substation expansion planning problem considering stochastic demand. The stochastic nature of the demands is considered through a robust model that uses chance constraints to guarantee that the substation capacity limits are satisfied within a given robustness probability. Furthermore, a multi-objective formulation that takes into account the total expected expansion planning cost and the robustness probability related to the violation of the substation capacity limits is proposed. The optimal solution of the proposed model is guaranteed by the convexity of the formulation, when classical optimization techniques are used in its solution. The results found (construction of new substations, reinforcement of existing substations, and service area of each substation) for two test systems demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed model. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations were carried out in order to evaluate the extent to which the solutions found were able to satisfy the substation capacity limits.

Abstract: We present a stochastic programming framework for a multiple timescale economic dispatch problem to address integration of renewable energy resources into power systems. This framework allows certain slow-response energy resources to be controlled at an hourly timescale, while fast-response resources, including renewable resources, and related network decisions can be controlled at a sub-hourly timescale. To this end, we study two models motivated by actual scheduling practices of system operators. Using an external simulator as driver for sub-hourly wind generation, we optimize these economic dispatch models using stochastic decomposition, a sample-based approach for stochastic programming. Computational experiments, conducted on the IEEE-RTS96 system and the Illinois system, reveal that optimization with sub-hourly dispatch not only results in lower expected operational costs, but also predicts these costs with far greater accuracy than with models allowing only hourly dispatch. Our results also demonstrate that when compared with standard approaches using the extensive formulation of stochastic programming, the sequential sampling approach of stochastic decomposition provides better predictions with much less computational time.

Abstract: This paper presents a new framework of recovering missing synchrophasor measurements (erasures). Leveraging the approximate low-rank property of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, we connect the problem of recovering PMU data erasures with recent advances in low-rank matrix completion methods. Since the existing analysis for matrix completion methods assumes an independent-erasure model that does not capture the correlations in PMU erasures, we propose two models to characterize the temporal and the channel correlations in PMU erasures and provide theoretical guarantees of a matrix completion method in recovering correlated erasures in both models. We also propose an online algorithm that can fill in the missing PMU measurements for real-time applications. Numerical experiments on actual PMU data are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a statistical classifier that quickly locates line outages in a power system utilizing only time series phasor measurement data sampled during the system's transient response to the outage. The presented classifier is a linear multinomial regression model that is trained by solving a maximum likelihood optimization problem using synthetic data. The synthetic data is produced through dynamic simulations which are initialized by random samples of a forecast load/generation distribution. Real time computation of the proposed classifier is minimal and therefore the classifier is capable of locating a line outage before steady state is reached, allowing for quick corrective action in response to an outage. In addition, the output of the classifier fits into a statistical framework that is easily accessible. Specific line outages are identified as being difficult to localize and future improvements to the classifier are proposed.

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of displacing conventional synchronous generators with wind turbine generators (WTGs) on the damping of inter-area modes. The impact of tie-line power, which can be beneficial or detrimental with increased wind penetration on the damping of the inter-area mode in a two-area test system, is investigated. It is seen that the inter-area modes are more prone to instability when areas with high wind penetrations export power to remote areas. Furthermore, the performance of supplementary controllers in WTGs (i.e., terminal voltage control and inertia emulation) on the inter-area modes are evaluated. The results show that the controllers can mitigate the possible adverse effects of increased penetration of wind power on the inter-area modes. The results of the studies on the two area system are used to guide a study on a 14-generator model of the Australian grid.

Abstract: Formulating the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) as a polynomial optimization problem makes it possible to solve large instances in practice and to guarantee asymptotic convergence in theory. We formulate the ACOPF as a degree-two polynomial program and study two approaches to solving it via convexifications. In the first approach, we tighten the first-order relaxation of the nonconvex quadratic program by adding valid inequalities. In the second approach, we exploit the structure of the polynomial program by using a sparse variant of Lasserre's hierarchy. This allows us to solve instances of up to 39 buses to global optimality and to provide strong bounds for the Polish network within an hour.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of the rotor angle and speed of synchronous generators is instrumental in developing powerful local or wide-area control and monitoring systems to enhance power grid stability and reliability. Exogenous input signals such as field voltage and mechanical torque are critical information in this context, but obtaining them raises significant logistical challenges, which in turn complicates the estimation of the generator dynamic states from easily available terminal phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals only. To overcome these issues, the authors of this paper employ the extended Kalman filter with unknown inputs, referred to as the EKF-UI technique, for decentralized dynamic state estimation of a synchronous machine states using terminal active and reactive powers, voltage phasor and frequency measurements. The formulation is fully decentralized without single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) or excitation model assumption so that only local information is required. It is demonstrated that using the decentralized EKF-UI scheme, synchronous machine states can be estimated accurately enough to enable wide-area power system stabilizers (WA-PSS) and system integrity protection schemes (SIPS). Simulation results on New-England test system, Hydro-Quebec simplified system, and Kundur network highlight the efficiency of the proposed method under fault conditions with electromagnetic transients and full-order generator models in realistic multi-machine setups.

Abstract: Prior research has shown that autocorrelation and variance in voltage measurements tend to increase as power systems approach instability. This paper seeks to identify the conditions under which these statistical indicators provide reliable early warning of instability in power systems. First, the paper derives and validates a semi-analytical method for quickly calculating the expected variance and autocorrelation of all voltages and currents in an arbitrary power system model. Building on this approach, the paper describes the conditions under which filtering can be used to detect these signs in the presence of measurement noise. Finally, several experiments show which types of measurements are good indicators of proximity to instability for particular types of state changes. For example, increased variance in voltages can reliably indicate both proximity to a bifurcation and the location of increased stress. On the other hand, growth of autocorrelation in certain line currents is related less to a specific location of stress but, rather, is a reliable indicator of stress occurring somewhere in the system; in particular, it would be a clear indicator of approaching instability when many nodes in an area are under stress.

Abstract: This paper presents a new wind farm control framework for inertial and primary frequency response for a high wind integrated power system. The proposed architecture is unique in the sense that the methodology can be used for frequency regulation support during subsynchronous and super-synchronous operation of the wind turbines (farm). The architecture work with existing wind farm controllers thus avoiding any additional replacement or tuning. The methodology depends on reduced order modeling based on model order reduction (MOR) and subsequent on-line controller design. The approach is tested on a smaller wind farm and further evaluated on a larger reduced power grid with 39 buses and ten generators. The results show that the proposed architecture provides greater flexibility in wind farm control towards frequency oscillations.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal day-ahead generation profile for a wind power producer by exploiting wind speed forecasts provided by a meteorological service. In the considered framework, the wind power producer is called to take part in the responsibility of system operation by providing day-ahead generation profiles and undergoing penalties in case of deviations from the schedule. Penalties are applied only if the delivered hourly energy deviates from the schedule more than a given relative tolerance. The optimal solution is obtained analytically by formulating and solving a stochastic optimization problem aiming at maximizing the expected profit. The proposed approach consists in exploiting wind speed forecasts to classify the next day into one of several predetermined classes, and then selecting the optimal solution derived for each class. The performance of the bidding strategy is demonstrated using real data from an Italian wind plant and weather forecasts provided by a commercial meteorological service.

Abstract: Power generation growth based on natural gas fired power plants (NGFPPs) has lead to increasing interactions between electric power and natural gas industries. More companies are progressively and simultaneously participating as big players in both markets. However, each company has traditionally been settled in one side, holding a particular competitive advantage: electric power generation companies mainly know how to operate their generation assets, whereas gas companies mainly know how to manage their gas supply contracts and make use of often regulated gas assets. Multi-product energy companies have even created independent departments which decisions are usually taken uncoordinatedly. In any case, companies (or departments) usually support their decision-making process in mathematical tools which represent each market with detail. This paper presents two methodologies for coupling two interdependent electricity and gas market models formulated as optimization problems. Each methodology fulfills different department wishes. The "electricity-perspective" methodology maximizes electricity market profits after calculating equivalent gas contracts with the gas market model. In contrast, the "gas-perspective" methodology minimizes gas operation costs after obtaining the relationship between the marginal revenue and the gas consumption with the electricity market model. This coordinated solution would allow companies to obtain synergies, resulting in a competitive advantage over other companies that operate uncoordinatedly in both markets

Abstract: Spatially distributed energy storage devices can provide additional flexibility to system operators, which is needed to transition from primarily fossil fuel based electricity generation to variable renewable generation. Aggregators in charge of controlling distributed energy storage can take advantage of existing economic incentives for more flexibility. However, controlling large numbers of energy storage devices with individual constraints in accordance with the strict rules of existing energy and reserve markets is challenging. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the design and performance of a system that enables aggregators to bring large numbers of dedicated and fully controllable energy storage devices to multiple markets concurrently. In particular, we propose algorithms and heuristic optimization methods that allow aggregators to control such energy resources in accordance with arbitrary market rules and participation strategies. Our evaluation is based on a realistic dual market (reserve and intra-day energy) use case. We find that effective market-conform control of large numbers of energy storage devices using the proposed algorithms is feasible, even on short time scales. Furthermore, our results also indicate that the scalability of the proposed system design can be further improved via parallelization without limiting the reserve/energy brought to market.

Abstract: Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in renewable energy forecasting, uncertainty quantification is a key input to maintain acceptable levels of reliability and profitability in power system operation. A proposal is formulated and evaluated here for the case of solar power generation, when only power and meteorological measurements are available, without sky-imaging and information about cloud passages. Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution of forecast errors do not follow any of the common parametric densities. This therefore motivates the proposal of a nonparametric approach to generate very short-term predictive densities, i.e., for lead times between a few minutes to one hour ahead, with fast frequency updates. We rely on an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a fast regression model, trained in varied ways to obtain both point and quantile forecasts of solar power generation. Four probabilistic methods are implemented as benchmarks. Rival approaches are evaluated based on a number of test cases for two solar power generation sites in different climatic regions, allowing us to show that our approach results in generation of skilful and reliable probabilistic forecasts in a computationally efficient manner.

Abstract: This paper presents a fast and straightforward algorithm to obtain the maximum loading points of power systems by simply performing bisection searches between feasible and infeasible load flow cases. The proposed method exploits the ability and robustness of the factored load flow solution procedure to converge to complex solutions well beyond the maximum loadability points. Test cases on a diversity of benchmark cases show that the new method is computationally attractive when compared with existing continuation power flow methods.

Abstract: Wind power ramp events have become one of the major challenges of power balance in power systems with high wind power penetration. Conventional thermal or hydro units have to be dispatched, shut down or started up more frequently to keep the balance between generation and load. This paper proposes a wind power ramp control method with energy storage system (ESS) based on wind power ramp event forecast. An optimization model is established to optimize the output power of ESS and the wind curtailment to meet a hybrid wind power ramp limit. Three types of wind power ramp scenarios are presented based on the ramp event forecast, including normal scenario, positive ramp scenarios, and negative ramp scenarios. In each scenario, the optimization model is modified with scenario switching adjustment (SSA) to reduce the capacity demand of ESS and the curtailed wind energy. While the parameters for modification are obtained by different fuzzy logic systems (FLS). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed wind power ramp control method is verified through case studies.

Abstract: The dc symmetrical component method is introduced for the analysis and control of bipolar dc distribution systems under asymmetrical operation. This method is an extension of the classical symmetrical component theory in three-phase ac power systems. The asymmetrical voltage and current in the positive and negative poles are decomposed into symmetrical components in common and differential modes. The equivalent circuit for each mode is derived, which forms decoupled mode networks. Consequently, it allows for independent investigation of each mode, and provides an insightful view of the static and dynamic behavior of a bipolar dc power system. The dc symmetrical component method is a general approach which is applicable to different aspects of system design. As an example, an enhanced common-mode voltage regulation scheme is described. It suppresses common-mode LC resonance by adding active damping control, and reduces common-mode impedance to improve power quality and voltage stability. The major theoretical conclusions are verified by experimental results.

Abstract: In deregulated electricity markets, producers offer their energy to the day-ahead market. As the subsidies for renewable producers are becoming lower and lower, they have to adapt to market prices. This paper models the energy trading in the day-ahead market for wind power producers. Different strategies are proposed for this purpose: 1) several wind farms offering their energy separately to the day-ahead market; 2) the same strategy as in 1) but compensating the imbalance among different wind farms; and 3) a joint offer involving several wind farms through an external agent in order to minimize the imbalances between the offer and the final power generation. The strategies are modeled with stochastic mixed integer linear programming and Conditional Value at Risk is used to consider the risk assessment. The expected profit including risk aversion is maximized for each wind power producer and for the set of wind power producers in the case of a joint offer. A comparison of the different cases is described in detail in a case study and relevant conclusions are provided.

Abstract: This paper presents a passivity-based control (PBC) for a type 2 static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) based on an Euler-Lagrange model. The proposed method is designed based on a Lyapunov function by considering dissipation to improve transient performance. An additional nonlinear damping term is designed to regulate the capacitor voltage. It is guaranteed that the equilibrium point of the system is locally exponentially stable in the operating range. The performance of the proposed method is validated via a 100 Mvar STATCOM system connected to the 345-kV grid system in SimPowerSystems, MATLAB/Siumlink. To compare with the input-output feedback linearization method, the proposed control method has improved convergence and reduction of oscillations of the active current and DC voltage, as shown in simulation results. Lastly, it shows that the proposed method is robust to model mismatches as the variation of the grid voltage and the degradation of the capacitance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage methodology for on-line identification of power system dynamic signature using phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements and data mining. Only transient stability status is usually predicted in the literature to assist with corrective control, without the dynamic behavior of generators in the event of instability. This paper uses traditional binary classification to identify transient stability in the first stage, and then develops a novel methodology to predict the nature of unstable dynamic behavior in the second stage. The method firstly applies hierarchical clustering to define patterns of unstable dynamic behavior of generators, and then applies different multiclass classification techniques, including decision tree, ensemble decision tree and multiclass support vector machine to identify characterized unstable responses. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a multi-area transmission test system. High prediction accuracy at both stages of identification is demonstrated.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new distributed framework for forecasting-aided state estimation in electric power systems, modeled by a nonlinear dynamic system. We first introduce the point-based Gaussian approximation filters that use Gaussian approximation and various quadrature rules for computing the related posteriors. These filters feature higher tracking accuracy for nonlinear systems compared to the conventional method, e.g., the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, motivated by the increasing demands for wide-area monitoring, we develop the distributed version of the point-based Gaussian approximation filter, based on statistical linearization. In distributed state estimation, each sub-station can only access their local measurements. In the absence of a control center, the average consensus algorithm is applied such that the sub-stations can maintain the global state through information exchange with neighbors.

Abstract: Recent advancements in high-performance parallel computing platforms and parallel algorithms have significantly enhanced the opportunities for real-time power system protection and control. This paper investigates application of Parareal in time algorithm for fast dynamic simulations. Parareal algorithm belongs to the class of temporal decomposition methods which divide the time interval into sub-intervals and solve them concurrently. Time-parallel algorithms face the difficulty of providing correct initial conditions for all the sub-intervals which impact the convergence rates. Parareal overcomes this difficulty by using an approximate trajectory. It has become popular in recent years for long transient simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics, fusion, reacting flows). This paper presents an approach for reliable implementation of Parareal with detailed models of power systems including saturation. Windowing approach is proposed for improving the convergence. Parareal is compared with the Newton-based time-parallel method. Effectiveness of the algorithm is analyzed by parallel emulation using extensive case studies on 10-generator 39-bus system and 327-generator 2383-bus system for various disturbances. Parareal with simulation windows of 1 s have shown convergence in 1 to 3 iterations for majority of the simulated cases, irrespective of the size of the system and nature of the disturbance. All the cases tested have converged with the proposed implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to early predict the transient stability status of a power system after being subjected to a severe disturbance. The proposed technique is based on rate of change of voltage vs. voltage deviation (ROCOV-Delta V) characteristics of the post-disturbance voltage magnitudes obtained from synchrophasor measurements. Converging and diverging nature of the post-disturbance trajectories on ROCOV-Delta V plane is used to recognize the transient stability status. The proposed technique is computationally simple and fast compared to the rotor angle based transient stability prediction methods. Offline simulations and real-time experimental studies carried out for the IEEE 39-bus test system showed over 99% overall success rate under symmetrical and asymmetrical faults as well as changes in pre-disturbance conditions and network topology changes.

Abstract: Increasing penetration of variable loads and renewable generation will cause the conventional operation strategy of the distribution system to become less certain and effective. This paper presents a method of determining the minimum loss network configuration of a distribution system with uncertain load and renewable generation. A robust optimization model is proposed wherein the optimal decisions on network configurations and losses are derived in two subsequent steps. The first step enforces the radiality constraint before knowing the actual system loads and output level of renewable generation. Power flows are computed next to achieve minimum network losses considering the worst operating conditions over the uncertainty sets. A mixed-integer two-stage robust optimization formulation and a decomposition algorithm in a master-slave structure are proposed to solve the problem. Results of an illustrative example and two test systems are presented to demonstrate the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a sequential power flow algorithm for hybrid ac/dc microgrids operating in the islanded mode. Unlike in grid-connected systems, variable, rather than fixed, frequency and voltage are utilized for power coordination between the ac and dc microgrids, respectively. The main challenge is to solve the power flow problem in hybrid microgrids while considering the absence of a slack bus and the coupling between the frequency and dc voltage. In the proposed algorithm, the ac power flow is solved using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method, thereby updating the ac variables and accordingly utilizing these variables in a proposed interlinking converter model for the dc problem. This sequential algorithm is iterated until convergence. The proposed algorithm is generic and can include different operational modes not only for the distributed generation units (DGs), but also for the interlinking converters. Detailed time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC have validated the algorithm's accuracy. Its robustness and computational cost are contrasted to those of conventional algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach for recharging electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed based on managing multiple discrete units of electric power flow, named energy demand particles (EDPs). Key similarities between EDPs and fluid particles (FPs) are established that allow the use of a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for scheduling the recharging times of EVs. It is shown, via simulation, that the scheduling procedure not only minimizes the variance of voltage drops in the secondary circuits, but it also can be used to implement a dynamic demand response and frequency control mechanism. The performance of the proposed scheduling procedure is also compared with alternative approaches recently published in the literature.

Abstract: This paper describes a probabilistic method for evaluating the number of spare units, regular spare transformers (RSTs), and mobile unit substations (MUSs) required for a group of similar distribution power transformers used at distribution stations in order to meet a pre-determined level of the group availability. The method uses a single Markov model for representing Class I and Class II failures of distribution transformers and a two-state model for representing the mobile unit substation (MUS). The two models are then convolved to obtain the required number of spare units. The proposed method is illustrated using a Hydro One sample of the distribution transformers and the results are compared with the previously published method.

Abstract: The European Union is targeting a 20% share of energy from renewable resources by 2020, and this increase is in turn expected to lead to operational challenges that will require various congestion management actions by system operators. In this paper, we deal with topology control of the transmission network as a congestion management resource and evaluate the impacts of topology control on the European electricity network. To do this, we co-optimize unit commitment and transmission switching over 24 h, and we use a decomposition scheme to tackle the resulting large-scale problem. Our analysis is conducted on different scenarios of load and renewable power generation. We find that topology control results in significant cost savings within Europe which tend to be inversely related to net load. The robustness of our results is supported by an extensive sensitivity analysis.

Abstract: Demand response could provide reserves to power systems and market designs should enable cost-efficient exploitation of these resources. In direct load control programs, consumers provide demand response in exchange for incentive payments. The success of such contracts is a function of level of information sharing, consumer costs, and power system constraints/costs. In this paper, we compare three approaches to contract design, each of which assumes different levels of consumer privacy. Our aim is to explore tradeoffs between privacy, resource exploitation, and the reward earned by the load aggregator. The first approach assumes full and truthful information exchange between the consumer and the system operator. We then develop a novel centralized approach in which an aggregator applies mechanism design to offer contracts to consumers who reveal partial cost information. A novel decentralized approach is developed in which consumers act cooperatively to pool demand response reserves, enabling them to keep individual cost information private. Through simulation studies, we find that, in the centralized approach, resource exploitation/rewards are highly sensitive to the accuracy of the load aggregator's consumer cost curves approximations. We also find that in the decentralized approach, rewards can be small, especially if information exchange is costly.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of continuous mixed p-norm (CMPN) algorithm-based adaptive control strategy with the purpose of enhancing the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants. The PV arrays are connected to the point of common coupling (PCC) through a DC-DC boost converter, a DC-link capacitor, a grid-side inverter, and a three-phase step up transformer. The DC-DC converter is used for a maximum power point tracking operation based on the fractional open circuit voltage method. The grid-side inverter is utilized to control the DC-link voltage and terminal voltage at the PCC through a vector control scheme. The CMPN algorithm-based adaptive proportional-integral (PI) controller is used to control the power electronic circuits due to its very fast convergence. The proposed algorithm updates the PI controller gains online without the need to fine tune or optimize. For realistic responses, the PV power plant is connected to the IEEE 39-bus New England test system. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is compared with that obtained using Taguchi approach-based an optimal PI controller taking into account subjecting the system to symmetrical, unsymmetrical faults, and unsuccessful reclosing of circuit breakers due to the existence of permanent fault. The validity of adaptive control strategy is extensively verified by the simulation results, which are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC software. With the proposed adaptive-controlled PV power plants, the LVRT capability of such system can be improved.

Abstract: The financial value of security service provided by dual-branch controller of a large-scale photovoltaic system (LPS) has been investigated in this paper. To perform this task, it is necessary to investigate the impact of LPS on small-signal stability of power network. To study the impact and performance of LPS on low-frequency oscillatory modes, a systematic scheme is developed to achieve an accurate model of multi-machine power network including of the LPS technology. A fully-described LPS model with all network-relevant control functions will be obtained. The proposed model has been then employed in the study of financial compensation strategy of security service provided by the LPS controller. The proposed compensation strategy in this paper is based on correlation of swing damping rate (SDR) criterion with generation cost (GC) criterion as dynamic and pecuniary indices, respectively. A weighted sum of performance and robustness indices is considered for SDR. The financial profit created by dual-branch controller of LPS as ancillary service (AS) is evaluated by a twopurpose optimization based on SDR and GC indices. The proposed strategy is tested on a modified 6-machine 3-area power system. Comprehensive discussion is provided to describe the performance of the presented method.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for short-term nodal voltage phasor forecasting in power systems to which a large number of renewable resources and microgrids are connected. Its motivation stems from the observation that such systems are characterized by an unconventional topology along with the presence of a number of buses with bursty power injection patterns, which in turn significantly impacts the temporal and spatial correlation of the nodal voltage phasors. Simulation results carried out on three IEEE test systems reveal that this new pattern affects the number of dominant buses, termed electrical hubs, and, subsequently, the time and spatial correlation among nodal voltage angles. They also reveal that the nodal voltage magnitudes exhibit time correlation, but no spatial correlation. In this paper, time series are represented by autoregressive (AR) processes while multivariate time series with spatial correlation are represented by vector autoregressive (VAR) processes. Statistical tests show that an order one for both models is adequate. The non-zero parameters of the VAR(1) models are identified using metrics on electrical connectivity, centrality, and node significance. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-, 118-, and 300-bus test systems in presence of large-scale distributed wind farms and microgrids, and under loss of system observability.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the use of quadratic time-frequency distributions ( QTFDs) to characterize the temporal variation of low-frequency electromechanical oscillations (LFEOs) using ringdown data. A refined Margenau-Hill distribution (MHD) and a procedure to extract the instantaneous frequencies and damping factors as well as initial phase angles of system low-frequency modes when the analyzed signal is multi-component are proposed. The refinement process enjoys a fast-converging iterative algorithm and without loss of generality it can be applied to other QTFDs for using in other applications. A non-stationary synthetic signal as well as simulated ringdown data of a 5-area, 16-machine power system and real measured data of Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) system are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in the presence of measurement noise.

Abstract: Demand response on the residential market is becoming a solution to adapt customer consumption to the offer available and therefore lower the electricity peak prices. Tariff incentives and direct load control of residential air-conditioners and electric heaters are flexible solutions to reduce the peak demand. To include residential demand response resources in planning operators, quantifying the demand reduction is becoming a major issue for all electrical stakeholders. Current methods are based on day or weather matching, regressions and control group approaches. In general, methods using available data from a control group give more accurate results. With the introduction of smart meters, the electric utilities generate a large amount of quality data, available almost in real time. In this paper, we suggest using these available residential load curves to select a control group based on individual load curves. One of the advantages of our method is that the selected control group could adapt at anytime to the number of individuals belonging to the demand reduction program, as this number evolves with customers entering and leaving the program. Constrained regression methods and an algorithm are developed and evaluated on real data, providing a reliable solution for an operational use.

Abstract: In power system operation, network topology optimization (NTO) based on bus-branch model and opening/closing transmission lines has been previously proposed and utilized as a congestion mitigating tool to reduce operation cost. The bus-branch model cannot provide a detailed picture of all substation switching actions (e.g., bus splitting) that are well known to operators. In this paper, an NTO model based on substation and node-breaker modeling is presented to relieve congestion and consequently reduce cost. The substation reconfiguration provides a practical and realistic picture of switching actions, while having a higher flexibility in switching actions. However, due to introducing more number of nodes and binary variables associated with breakers, solving an NTO model would be challenging. Therefore, some tightening bounds are presented to maintain the reliability and accelerate the computations. Furthermore, using sensitivity analysis of substations, a method to cluster the network to congestion zones is then employed to determine suitable candidate substations for reconfiguration, thus significantly reducing the number of binary variables associated with breaker switchings. The results of applying the NTO model to the IEEE 118-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to remove congestion, while utilizing less number of switching actions compared to bus-branch switching.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the portfolio effect of a system consisting of a combined heat and power (CHP) plant and a wind farm. The goal is to increase the overall profit of the portfolio by reducing imbalances and, consequently, their implicit penalty in a two-price balancing market for electricity. We investigate two different operational strategies, which differ in whether the CHP plant and the wind farm are operated jointly or independently, and we evaluate their economic performance on a real case study based on a CHP-wind system located in the western part of Denmark. We present a comprehensive mathematical model for describing the different heat and power production units of the CHP plant and suggest different ways of determining its operation in a setup with two trading floors: a day-ahead market and a balancing market. We build a simulation framework that runs in a rolling-horizon fashion, so that forecasts for heat demand, wind power production, and market prices are updated at each iteration. We conclude that the portfolio strategy is the most profitable due to the two-price structure of the balancing market. This encourages producers to handle their imbalances outside the market.

Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) optimizes simultaneously the generation dispatch and the topology of a power system. It has been shown that taking some transmission lines out of service can significantly reduce the operating cost of the system while respecting the traditional deterministic N - 1 security criterion of operational reliability. However, topology modifications could adversely affect probabilistic security metrics. The operational reliability of a power system can be translated into a cost by multiplying the expected energy not served by the value of lost load. This paper therefore explores whether it is possible to maintain a positive economic balance with OTS when considering not only the cost of generation but also the expected socio-economic cost of disruptions in the supply. This is done in two steps: the computation of an N - 1 secure OTS and then the calculation of a probabilistic estimate of the operational reliability of the OTS solution. Based on the results obtained with two test systems, it is shown that OTS tends to significantly degrade probabilistic measures of security. It is thus not obvious that OTS can lead to a positive economic balance, even when N - 1 security is enforced. Consequently, a probabilistic security analysis should be performed before implementing an OTS solution.

Abstract: Cascading outages in power systems can lead to major power disruptions and blackouts and involve a large number of different mechanisms. The typical development of a cascading outage can be split in two phases with different dominant cascading mechanisms. As a power system is usually operated in security, an initiating contingency cannot entail a fast collapse of the grid. However, it can trigger a thermal transient, increasing significantly the likelihood of additional contingencies, in a "slow cascade." The loss of additional elements can then trigger an electrical instability. This is the origin of the subsequent "fast cascade," where a rapid succession of events can lead to a major power disruption. Several models of probabilistic simulations exist, but they tend to focus either on the slow cascade or on the fast cascade, according to mechanisms considered, and rarely on both. We propose in this paper a decomposition of the analysis in two levels, able to combine probabilistic simulations for the slow and the fast cascades. These two levels correspond to these two typical phases of a cascading outage. Models are developed for each of these phases. A simplification of the overall methodology is applied to two test systems to illustrate the concept.

Abstract: This paper estimates the average Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) following islanding and/or cascading event/s using inflection points of frequency profile. Moreover, a frequency collapse barrier scheme is set up by tuning the frequency set points of Load Shedding (LS) relays as a dynamic variable using voltage drop data coordinated with plant protection scheme. A frequency anti stalling scheme is developed to interrupt more load feeders in case of frequency stall between consecutive set points. This time-based approach adjusts the time delay of the relay stages to disconnect the feeders with more voltage drop first, in order to bring the frequency back to the permissible range before the tolerable time period of plant protection relays is over. The load curtailment is stopped to avoid over LS, if the proposed algorithm recognizes that the frequency reaches the safe region in time based on estimated average ROCOF. Tripping of feeders, which inject active or reactive power to the grid due to penetration of dispersed generations into the load feeders is also prevented by considering the power flow direction of feeders.

Abstract: This paper proposes a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) based sequential analytical approach for composite generation and transmission systems reliability assessment. The basic idea is to construct a CTMC model for the composite system. Based on this model, sequential analyses are performed. Various kinds of reliability indices can be obtained, including expectation, variance, frequency, duration and probability distribution. In order to reduce the dimension of the state space, traditional CTMC modeling approach is modified by merging all high order contingencies into a single state, which can be calculated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Then a state mergence technique is developed to integrate all normal states to further reduce the dimension of the CTMC model. Moreover, a time discretization method is presented for the CTMC model calculation. Case studies are performed on the RBTS and a modified IEEE 300-bus test system. The results indicate that sequential reliability assessment can be performed by the proposed approach. Comparing with the traditional sequential Monte Carlo simulation method, the proposed method is more efficient, especially in small scale or very reliable power systems.

Abstract: This letter discusses a multi-band robust security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model for addressing spatial/temporal relationship of nodal load uncertainties. Case studies show that the proposed multi-band model derives less conservative robust solutions while maintaining the same solution robustness as compared to the single-band model in literature.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive two-stage robust security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) approach, which minimizes the operation cost of the base case while guaranteeing that the robust solution can be adaptively and securely adjusted in response to continuous load and wind uncertainty intervals as well as discrete N - K generation and transmission contingency security criteria. In addition, corrective capabilities of both non-quick-start and quick-start units are rigorously formulated. Specifically, unit commitment of quick-start units is adaptively adjusted in the recourse stage for satisfying security constraints under various uncertainties, which introduces mixed-integer recourse to the proposed two-stage robust SCUC model. The proposed model is solved by the combination of modified Benders decomposition (BD) method and column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm, which decompose the original problem into a master UC problem for the base case and security checking subproblems for uncertainties. Numerical case studies on the modified IEEE 118-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust SCUC approach. Although the modified BD does not provide the tightest lower bound and may not guarantee the global optimality, robustness performance tests indicate that a reasonable threshold on the violation of security checking subproblems would guarantee good enough solutions from engineering point of view.

Abstract: This paper proposes a measurement-based voltage stability monitoring method for a load area fed by N tie lines. Compared to a traditional Thevenin equivalent based method, the new method adopts an N buses equivalent system so as to model and monitor individual tie lines. For each tie line, the method solves the power transfer limit against voltage instability analytically as a function of all parameters of that equivalent, which are online identified from real-time synchronized measurements on boundary buses of the load area. Thus, this new method can directly calculate the real-time power transfer limit on each tie line. The method is first compared with a Thevenin equivalent based method using a 4-bus test system and then demonstrated by case studies on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 48-machine, 140-bus power system.

Abstract: Rational approximation of frequency-dependent network equivalents with vector fitting (VF) is widely used in power system analysis; however, a detailed examination of methods to determine the order of the model has not been reported. The traditional order identification method of the frequency response resonance peak is conservative, as demonstrated in this paper. We discuss the essential relationships between VF and Prony analysis (PA). A PA-based method is then proposed to identify the order of model, considering the resonance peaks. The method is computationally inexpensive, and the precision can be adjusted easily. Numerical investigations demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the method.

Abstract: This paper deals with the development of a new electromagnetic transient (EMT)-transient stability (TS) hybrid simulation platform and its application to a detailed fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) study on the WECC system. A new EMT-TS hybrid simulation platform, which integrates PSCAD/EMTDC and the open source power system simulation software InterPSS has been developed. A combined interaction protocol with an automatic protocol switching control scheme is proposed. A multi-port three-phase Thevenin equivalent is developed for representing an external network in an EMT simulator. Correspondingly, the external network is represented in three-sequence, and a three-sequence TS simulation algorithm is developed. These techniques allow simulation of unsymmetrical faults within the internal network without the constraint of phase balance at the boundary. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is first tested on the IEEE 9-bus system. Subsequently, the proposed hybrid simulation approach is applied to a detailed FIDVR study on a large WECC system. The study shows that a normally cleared single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault in the transmission system could lead to an FIDVR event, with compressor motors of the air conditioning units on the faulted phases stalling first, followed by a propagation of motor stalling to the unfaulted phase. Moreover, similar events are observed in simulations with a wide range of load compositions. Lastly, the effect of the point-on-wave (POW) at which a fault is applied on the occurrence of an FIVDR event is also analyzed.

Abstract: We study the problem of detecting transmission line outages in power grids. We model the time series of power network measurements as a hidden Markov process, and formulate the line outage detection problem as an inference problem. Due to the physical nature of the line failure dynamics, the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov Model are sparse. Taking advantage of this fact, we further propose an approximate inference algorithm using particle filtering, which takes in the times series of power network measurements and produces a probabilistic estimation of the status of the transmission line status. We then assess the performance of the proposed algorithm with case studies. We show that it outperforms the conventional static line outage detection algorithms and is robust to both measurement noise and model parameter errors.

Abstract: The management of transformers' capacity is a vital task for planners and asset managers due to their high cost. This paper proposes an optimization model for capacity management of transformers in a substation over long-run. The model considers the present worth costs of investment, losses, maintenance, reliability, and the salvage value of transformers for providing the optimal selection and scheduling of multistage transformer installations and their refurbishments. In the optimization model, growing failure rate of transformers along with their age is incorporated and the cumulative loss-of-life (LOL) of transformers is also used in determining their salvage value. The developed model is applied for planning and management of transformer capacities for a residential load dominant two-transformer primary distribution substation over a period of 40 years. The simulations are performed for various case studies representing the situations encountered by utilities. An extensive sensitivity analysis is also conducted for several conditions of the system parameters. The numerical results indicate the worth of inclusion of variable failure rate and LOL of transformers in their capacity management.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized emergency control approach for preventing voltage instability by controlling the reactive power and voltage of the system. The proposed control algorithm is based on a distributed architecture of intelligent agents to identify the affected region and to activate timely countermeasures to achieve a fast and accurate response. By dividing the network into several areas, the voltage instability problem can be localized and countermeasures can be directed to the most affected area by the authorized local agent. This facilitates quick decision making within the system. To achieve effective voltage and reactive power support, a sensitivity based zone formation is proposed. The Nordic32 74-bus test system has been used for testing the proposed multi-agent emergency control (MAEC). The results from the case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MAEC approach.

Abstract: In the future, the number of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) that will participate in the primary frequency control (PFC) is likely to increase. In our previous research, the computational complexity of the PFC problem for a large number of PEVs was reduced using aggregate models of PEVs. However, in the literature on the PFC, the distribution network characteristics have not been included in the aggregate models of PEVs for the PFC, despite the fact that PEVs will be dispersedly connected to the distribution network. This paper proposes an aggregate model of PEVs for the PFC that further incorporates distribution network characteristics, i.e., the distribution network power loss (DNPL) and the maximum allowed current (MAC) of the lines and transformers. The DNPL variation is formulated according to the line and transformer impedance, spatial distribution of PEVs and loads, and active power variation of PEVs. Then, DNPL variation together with the MAC of the lines and transformers are incorporated in the proposed model of PEVs. Finally, the simulation results show an excellent agreement of 98% between the detailed model and the proposed aggregate model of PEVs.

Abstract: This paper discusses the stability properties of electricity markets and their implications for the deregulated market environment. We formulate a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model for electricity markets to account for their uncertainty and nonlinearity and obtain realistic stability results. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the stability and instability of electricity markets. All the proposed stability and instability conditions can be tested using linear matrix inequalities. Simulation results demonstrate the application of the stability and instability tests to electric power market under different market conditions. The tests also demonstrate the importance of the including nonlinearities and uncertainty in the electricity market when investigating its stability.

Abstract: In transient stability analysis, the fifth-order generator model neglects the stator transients and may result in different simulation results as compared with the seventh-order model. Based on the two-time scale property of generators, a dynamic correction method is proposed to offset the difference. Using the singular perturbation theory, fast components in the stator flux linkage is captured to restore stator dynamics and correct the electromagnetic torque. Simulations on a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) system and a 3-machine system show that, the difference between the two generator models can be remarkably reduced by the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents a general approach for coherency detection in bulk power systems using the projection pursuit (PP) theory. Supported by the concept of center of inertia (COI) in power systems, the PP theory is employed to model the wide-area coherency detection as an optimization problem. In the proposed method, the optimal projection direction in high dimensional orthogonal space is explored in order to detect the coherent groups via the data from synchronous phasor measurement units (PMUs). Two quantitative indices constructed with projection assessment index (PI), the objective of the optimization model, are then defined in order to determine the critical coherent group and the dominant coherent groups. The coherency detection criterion and the implementation framework for the proposed approach are also presented. Simulation data from the 16-machine 68-bus test system and China Southern power Grid (CSG), along with actual field-measurement data retrieved from WAMS database in the CSG, are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm under different disturbances. It is shown that the proposed methodology successfully detects the dominant coherent groups of generators and buses in bulk power system via the wide-area field-measurement data.

Abstract: A critical function in outage management for distribution systems is to quickly detect a fault and identify the activated protective device(s). With ongoing smart grid development, numerous smart meters and fault indicators with communication capabilities provide an opportunity for accurate and efficient outage management. Using the available data, this paper proposes a new multiple-hypothesis method for identification of the faulted section on a feeder or lateral. Credibility of the multiple hypotheses is determined using the available evidence from these devices. The proposed methodology is able to handle i) multiple faults, ii) protection miscoordination, and iii) missing outage reports from smart meters and fault indicators. For each hypothesis, an optimization method based on integer programming is proposed to determine the most credible actuated protective device(s) and faulted line section(s). Simulation results based on the distribution feeders of Avista Utilities serving Pullman, WA, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose a distributed electric vehicle (EV) coordination management which exploits the potentials of the bidirectional power flow between the grid and the EV. In the literature, the proposed distributed price-based EV coordination mechanisms aiming to achieve a valley-filling concept consider electric vehicles as mere manageable loads, which are served during valley hours given the EV energy requirements and mobility pattern. In this paper, a distributed EV coordination mechanism is proposed that utilizes 1) the flexibility of EV demand in order to efficiently allocate it during the valley period and hours with high distributed renewable energy production and 2) the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) EV capability in order to minimize the network load variance. The aim of the proposed EV coordination mechanism is to: 1) exploit the synergies between the renewable distributed energy resources (DER) and EV charging needs in order to increase the EV/RES penetration level of the grid without the need for further network investments and 2) exploit the bidirectional EV battery operation for more efficient network operation in terms of voltage profile and network losses. The proposed EV coordination mechanism is assessed through simulations of a realistic rural MV distribution network.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose a distributed electric vehicle (EV) coordination mechanism, which enables the management of the charging/discharging operation of an EV fleet, offering V2G regulation services to support system operation based on a day-ahead scheduling profile generated by an EV aggregator. Initially, a decentralized iterative algorithm is introduced to manage EV charging/discharging schedule aiming to meet the daily mobility energy requirement of an EV fleet with respect to the day-ahead schedule of the EV aggregator. Then, a droop-based control and a novel distributed regulation dispatch algorithm are developed aiming to meet the regulation dispatch signals send to the EV aggregator by the system.

Abstract: In this paper, a chance-constrained system of systems (SoS) based decision-making approach is presented for stochastic scheduling of power systems encompassing active distribution grids. Based on the concept of SoS, the independent system operator (ISO) and distribution companies (DISCOs) are modeled as self-governing systems. These systems collaborate with each other to run the entire power system in a secure and economic manner. Each self-governing system accounts for its local reserve requirements and line flow constraints with respect to the uncertainties of load and renewable energy resources. A set of chance constraints are formulated to model the interactions between the ISO and DISCOs. The proposed model is solved by using analytical target cascading (ATC) method, a distributed optimization algorithm in which only a limited amount of information is exchanged between collaborative ISO and DISCOs. In this paper, a 6-bus and a modified IEEE 118-bus power systems are studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: This paper makes use of the idea of prediction intervals (PIs) to capture the uncertainty associated with wind power generation in power systems. Since the forecasting errors cannot be appropriately modeled using distribution probability functions, here we employ a powerful nonparametric approach called lower upper bound estimation (LUBE) method to construct the PIs. The proposed LUBE method uses a new framework based on a combination of PIs to overcome the performance instability of neural networks (NNs) used in the LUBE method. Also, a new fuzzy-based cost function is proposed with the purpose of having more freedom and flexibility in adjusting NN parameters used for construction of PIs. In comparison with the other cost functions in the literature, this new formulation allows the decision-makers to apply their preferences for satisfying the PI coverage probability and PI normalized average width individually. As the optimization tool, bat algorithm with a new modification is introduced to solve the problem. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method are examined using datasets taken from different wind farms in Australia.

Abstract: Time-varying renewable energy generation can result in serious under-/over-voltage conditions in future distribution grids. Augmenting conventional utility-owned voltage regulating equipment with the reactive power capabilities of distributed generation units is a viable solution. Local control options attaining global voltage regulation optimality at fast convergence rates is the goal here. In this context, novel reactive power control rules are analyzed under a unifying linearized grid model. For single-phase grids, our proximal gradient scheme has computational complexity comparable to that of the rule suggested by the IEEE 1547.8 standard, but it enjoys well-characterized convergence guarantees. Furthermore, adding memory to the scheme results in accelerated convergence. For three-phase grids, it is shown that reactive power injections have a counter-intuitive effect on bus voltage magnitudes across phases. Nevertheless, when our control scheme is applied to unbalanced conditions, it is shown to reach an equilibrium point. Numerical tests using the IEEE 13-bus, the IEEE 123-bus, and a Southern California Edison 47-bus feeder with increased renewable penetration verify the properties of the schemes and their resiliency to grid topology reconfigurations.

Abstract: Lightly damped electromechanical oscillations are major operating concerns if failed to be detected at an early stage. This paper improved the existing extended complex Kalman filter (ECKF) technique of tracking electromechanical oscillations using synchrophasor measurements. The proposed algorithm adopted a distributed architecture for estimating oscillatory parameters from local substations. The novelty lies in handling maximum likelihood (ML) to enhance the convergence property in tracking multiple modes using an expectation maximization (EM) approach. This was achieved by encapsulating the augmented Lagrangian (AL) in the maximization step of the EM algorithm, which utilized a novel ECKF-based smoother (ECKS). Performance evaluations were conducted using IEEE 68-bus system and recorded synchrophasor measurements collected from the New Zealand grid. Random noise variance test cases were generated to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm. To ensure the robustness to random noisy conditions, the algorithm was tested based on exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations. Comparisons were made with the existing Prony analysis (PA), Kalman filter (KF), and distributed EM-based FB-KLPF.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method to dynamically determine coherent generators and electrical areas of an interconnected power system. The proposed method is based on dynamic frequency deviations of both generator and non-generator buses, with respect to the system nominal frequency. The proposed method 1) largely overcomes the limitations of the existing model-based and measurement-based coherency identification methods, 2) enables dynamic tracking of the coherency time-evolution, and 3) provides noise immunity which is imperative in practical implementation. The method also promises the potential for real-time coherency calculation. The proposed method is applied to the 16-machine/68-bus NPCC system based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSS/E platform and the results are compared with those of the classical slow-coherency (model-based) method and a measurement-based method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for online monitoring of subsynchronous oscillations using ambient sensor data from high speed sampling devices such as digital fault recorders (DFRs). Ambient data is continuously available in the form of routine system responses to random load fluctuations. This paper shows the usefulness of ambient data for tracking the frequency, damping ratio and mode shape of torsional modes related to subsynchronous resonance (SSR). Frequency domain decomposition (FDD) and recursive least square (RLS) algorithms are tested for ambient monitoring of SSR modes. IEEE second SSR benchmark model is used as the study system. Nonlinear and linearized equations of this system are analyzed for testing the performance of measurement based methods and to compare their results with respective linearized system modes. It is shown that both electrical and mechanical signals can be used for the SSR monitoring while the torsional modes are more observable in mechanical signals such as generator speeds. In addition to estimating the frequency and damping ratio, torsional mode shapes can be identified by implementing FDD as a multi-dimensional method on the speeds of the masses of the turbine shaft. The algorithms are tested on an archived real system data set from a DFR.

Abstract: The trend of integrating more nondispatchable renewable sources into the electric grid and phasing out dispatchable fossil-fueled power plants in the near future reduces the operational flexibility, increases the chance of transmission congestion, and endangers the stability of electric system. Utilities are investigating the application of large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) to address some of these imminent challenges to their power systems. In this paper, the application of privately owned large-scale ESSs for the purpose of congestion relief in transmission systems as an ancillary service is investigated. It is demonstrated that in conventional optimal dispatch algorithms for an ESS, the storage system cannot effectively contribute to congestion relief since the dispatch algorithm has not prepared the ESS in advance. Hence, a new real-time optimal dispatch (RTOD) algorithm is proposed that aims to generate revenue primarily by exploiting electricity price arbitrage opportunities in the day-ahead electricity market while optimally preparing the ESS to maximize its contribution to congestion relief as an ancillary service. A compressed-air ESS is sized and employed for evaluations of the proposed RTOD algorithm. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm are validated using real-world price data from Ontario's wholesale electricity market. An analysis is presented regarding the appropriate amount of financial compensation for the ESS owner due to this contribution to congestion relief in the studied electricity market.

Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally efficient technique for estimating the composite load model parameters based on analytical similarity of parameter sensitivity. When the model parameters are updated in the optimization procedure to best fit the actual load dynamics, i.e., measurements, parameters of similar sensitivity representation in the given mathematical model structure are updated in the same manner at every iterative step. This research allows for practically reducing the number of load model parameters to be identified in the estimation process and the overall computational cost while preserving the desired complexity and accuracy of the original model. This approach consequently facilitates the parameter estimation in the optimization process and helps manage increased number of parameters often criticized for adopting the dynamic composite load model via measurement-based approach. Case studies for the real power system demonstrate the computational efficiency and intact accuracy of the proposed method with reference to the existing methods of estimating all the parameters of the given composite load model independently.

Abstract: This paper presents a modified method for power system transient stability analysis, allowing the reduction of the computational requirements while retaining important system dynamics. The approach formulates the power balance equations depending on the area of interest. The detailed ac model, including full real and reactive power equations, is used for the area in which high accuracy is required, while the simpler dc model, including linear real power equation, is used for more remote areas where real power dynamics dominate. A high level of accuracy can be achieved using the ac model in the area of interest, and computational complexity can be reduced with the less detailed dc model in the remainder of the system. In order to prevent the loss of simulation accuracy, this paper proposes a way to compensate line losses neglected using the dc model. Case studies with the IEEE 118-bus system are provided to validate the performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper describes an analysis of a variable speed heat pump (VSHP), which responds to direct load control (DLC) signals to provide grid frequency regulation (GFR) ancillary service, while ensuring the comfort of building occupants. A data-driven dynamic model of the VSHP is developed through real-time experimental studies with a time horizon ranging from seconds to hours. The model is simple, yet still sufficiently comprehensive to analyze the operational characteristics of the VSHP. The DLC scheme is then experimentally applied to the VSHP to evaluate its demand response (DR) capability. Two control methods are considered for a practical implementation of the DLC-enabled VSHP and a further improvement of the DR capability, respectively. Additionally, a small-signal analysis is carried out using the aggregated dynamic response of a number of DLC-enabled VSHPs to analyze their contribution to GFR in an isolated power grid. For experimental case studies, a laboratory-scale microgrid is then implemented with generator and load emulators. We show that the DLC-enabled VSHP can effectively reduce grid frequency deviations and required reserve capacities of generators.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a frequency and voltage control strategy for a standalone microgrid with high penetration of intermittent renewable generation systems, which might cause large frequency and voltage deviation in the system due to unpredictable output power fluctuations. To this end, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is suggested for generating the nominal system frequency instead of a synchronous generator, from a frequency control perspective. This makes the system frequency independent of the mechanical inertia of the synchronous generator. However, a BESS has a capacity limitation; a synchronous generator is used to maintain the state of charge (SOC) of the BESS at a certain value. For voltage control, we proposed that a reactive power/active power (Q/P) droop control be added to the conventional reactive power controller. By adding a Q/P droop control, renewable generation acquires a voltage-damping effect, which dramatically alleviates the voltage fluctuation induced by its own output power fluctuation. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy from both frequency and voltage control perspectives.

Abstract: DC microgrid provides a viable and more efficient option to cater for DC loads in the building space and, in particular, data centers. This paper investigates the opportunities associated for utilities to optimize industrial demand response for smart AC and DC microgrid environment thus facilitating distribution utility to reduce peak energy on the existing AC distribution system. A load shifting demand side management (DSM) technique is used to shift AC industrial loads in response to time of day (TOD) tariff. Hence, an attempt has been made to study the impact of DSM strategies with optimal shifting of AC devices in the presence of DC microgrid. Simulations are carried out on a practical distribution system having large industrial loads but it has been assumed that the AC distribution system has DC microgrid with renewables and battery storage systems (BSSs). DSM results for AC distribution grid are compared and analyzed with differing DC microgrid set ups, for example with and without battery storage. It has been observed that the DSM strategy with DC microgrid in the presence of solar renewables and battery storage can substantially reduce average energy cost for demand to response and peak load burden on AC distribution utilities.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of renewable energy sources in power system leads to the replacement of conventional power plants (CPPs) and consequently challenges in power system reliability and security are introduced. This study is focused on improving the grid frequency response after a contingency event in the power system with a high penetration of wind power. An energy storage system (ESS) might be a viable solution for providing inertial response and primary frequency regulation. A methodology has been presented here for the sizing of the ESS in terms of required power and energy. It describes the contribution of the ESS to the grid, in terms of inertial constant and droop. The methodology is applied to a 12-bus grid model with high wind power penetration. The estimated ESS size for inertial response and primary frequency regulation services are validated through real-time simulations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ESS can provide the response similar to that provided by the CPPs.

Abstract: It has been recently proven that the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the optimal power flow problem over radial networks is exact under technical conditions such as not including generation lower bounds or allowing load over-satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate the situation where generation lower bounds are present. We show that even for a 2-bus 1-generator system, the SDP relaxation can have all possible approximation outcomes, that is 1) SDP relaxation may be exact, 2) SDP relaxation may be inexact, or 3) SDP relaxation may be feasible while the optimal power flow (OPF) instance may be infeasible. We provide a complete characterization of when these three approximation outcomes occur and an analytical expression of the resulting optimality gap for this 2-bus system. In order to facilitate further research, we design a library of instances over radial networks in which the SDP relaxation has positive optimality gap. Finally, we propose valid inequalities and variable bound tightening techniques that significantly improve the computational performance of a global optimization solver. Our work demonstrates the need of developing efficient global optimization methods for the solution of OPF even in the simple but fundamental case of radial networks.

Abstract: In this paper, a new scenario-based stochastic optimization framework is proposed for price-maker economic bidding in day-ahead and real-time markets. The presented methodology is general and can be applied to both demand and supply bids. That is, no restrictive assumptions are made on the characteristics of the pool and its agents. However, our focus is on the operation of time-shiftable loads with deadlines, because they play a central role in creating load flexibility and enhancing demand response and peak-load shaving programs. Both basic and complex time-shiftable load types are addressed, where the latter includes time-shiftable loads that are uninterruptible, have per-time-slot consumption limits or ramp constraints, or comprise several smaller time-shiftable subloads. Four innovative analytical steps are presented in order to transform the originally nonlinear and hard-to-solve price-maker economic bidding optimization problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program. Accordingly, the global optimal solutions are found for the price and energy bids within a relatively short amount of computational time. A detailed illustrative case study along with multiple case studies based on the California energy market data are presented. It is observed that the proposed optimal price-maker economic bidding approach outperforms optimal price-maker self-scheduling as well as even-load-distribution.

Abstract: This paper presents a design of a power system damping controller using partial right eigenstructure assignment. The eigenstructure assignment technique selects a set of closed-loop eigenvalues along with their right or left eigenvectors. The selection of eigenvectors offers extra flexibility which is exploited in this paper by designing a robust damping controller which provides the required damping under multiple operating conditions. A multi-input controller is used to increase the degrees of freedom available for the design. Remote measurements available from synchronised phasor measurements are also considered. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem and solved using the nonlinear simplex function in MATLAB. The proposed technique is used to design a robust power system stabilizer for the interconnected New England New York simplified power system model. Four contingencies are selected as additional operating conditions. The designed controller is validated using a nonlinear simulation.

Abstract: Utilities continually investigate ways to optimize the utilization of their existing plant and improve their network's flexibility and resiliency to future uncertainties. With respect to overhead lines (OHL), smart grid solutions aim to increase adequacy through the implementation of probabilistic thermal rating (PTR), dynamic thermal rating (DTR) or novel high temperature low sag (HTLS) conductor technologies. At present, the risks related to these particular solutions, both for the OHL plant and the power network, are not quantified. This paper presents a novel methodology for power network reliability evaluation which integrates a network level sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with a detailed modeling of OHL. This integration facilitates a holistic evaluation of power network reliability as it considers the properties of OHL design technologies and their associated ageing risks. As a result, the network performance (adequacy) and plant risks (ageing) introduced by increased OHL capacities through PTR, DTR, and HTLS solutions can be objectively quantified. An application of the methodology is demonstrated using the IEEE-RTS 96 network which is assessed considering PTR-based OHL capacities.

Abstract: In recent years, the penetration of renewable resources in electrical power systems has increased. These renewable resources add more complexities to power system operations, due to their intermittent nature. As a result, operators must acquire additional reserves in order to maintain reliability. However, one persistent challenge is to determine the optimal location of reserves and this challenge is exacerbated by the inability to predict key transmission bottlenecks due to this added uncertainty. This paper presents robust corrective topology control as a congestion management tool to manage power flows and the associated renewable uncertainty. The proposed day-ahead method determines the maximum uncertainty in renewable resources in terms of do-not-exceed limits combined with corrective topology control. The day-ahead topology control formulation is based on the direct current optimal power flow; therefore, topology control solutions obtained from these algorithms are tested for AC feasibility and system stability. The numerical results provided are based on the IEEE-118 bus test case and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) test system.

Abstract: This study develops an open-source 8-zone test system for teaching, training, and research purposes that is based on ISO New England structural attributes and data. The test system models an ISO-managed wholesale power market populated by a mix of generating companies and load-serving entities that operates through time over an 8-zone AC transmission grid. The modular extensible architecture of the test system permits a wide range of sensitivity studies to be conducted. To illustrate the capabilities of the test system, we report energy cost-savings outcomes for a comparative study of stochastic versus deterministic DAM security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) formulations under systematically varied reserve requirement levels for the deterministic formulation.

Abstract: In this paper, a technique for designing fixed parameter decentralized power system stabilizers (PSSs) for interconnected power systems is proposed. In the proposed method, local information available at each machine in the multimachine environment, is used to tune parameters of PSS. Conventional design techniques such as P-Vr frequency response approaches, and the method of residues are based on complete system information, wherein phase angles of residues are consistent with the P-Vr phase response and can be used with confidence for design purposes. It is shown that magnitude and phase information of the proposed GEP TF agrees closely with that of P-Vr TF and yields a robust stabilizer. Nonlinear simulation and eigenvalue analysis show the efficacy of the proposed stabilizer to damp out the interarea and local modes of oscillations effectively over a wide range of operating conditions. Superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional approaches is demonstrated with simulation studies on two widely used multimachine systems.

Abstract: Identification of optimal locations to deploy the phasor measurement units (PMUs) is a preliminary task in wide area monitoring and control of power systems. Given the cost and other associated restrictions, it is highly unlikely for any utility to install all the required number of PMUs to ensure the complete observability of the network. This necessitates judicious identification of locations in the network to deploy the PMUs. Ideally, the choice of location must depend on the intended purpose. In this paper, an approach for placement of PMUs considering both the stability and topological aspects is presented. First, a probabilistic framework based on proximity to instability is proposed to rank the generators/load buses in the order of vulnerability. Subsequently, a binary integer linear programming formulation is proposed to identify the optimal locations considering both stability and topological aspects. The optimal locations obtained using the proposed approach ensures a priori observability of most vulnerable buses in addition to enhancing the network observability. Results on IEEE 39-bus system and 246-bus equivalent system of Indian southern grid are presented to illustrate the proposed approach.

Abstract: As the number of renewable energy generation units and, consequently, solid-state based converters increases in the power grid, many power electronics concepts should be integrated into power system analysis and design. Thus, a power laboratory course with emphasis on the nexus between power electronics and power system is desired. However, the flexibility of instructors in designing a wide range of educational experiments is limited by the use of specialized educational setups. This problem can be resolved by allowing students to assemble their setups using laboratory scaled-down devices; however, implementation times can limit students to focus on the main concepts of the experiments. In particular, lacking experience with hardware description languages to develop switching patterns and control schemes for solid-state based converters further increases the implementation times. In this paper, a technique for rapidly implementing switching patterns and control schemes for power converters is proposed. This technique provides an easy-to-use laboratory allowing students to focus on reinforcing the theory learned in energy conversion, motor-drive, power electronics, and power system classes while still providing instructors with the flexibility to design a wide range of educational experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple method for voltage stability assessment by reducing the bus impedance matrix of a network into its two-bus equivalent model at a referred bus. Closed-form equations of the equivalent model could then be derived to facilitate an equivalent nodal analysis at the referred bus to determine its voltage stability limit. The method was also shown to have parallels with the well-accepted modal analysis of the Jacobian matrix. These include defining geometric indices to identify critical buses and participation factors to quantify contribution of network elements to their criticality. The method however does not require post power flow solution processing of the Jacobian matrix; such computational advantage may make it suitable for online applications. The IEEE 300-bus system was tested with the method which was shown to be valid and computationally robust and efficient.

Abstract: A microgrid can be a useful entity to support stable and efficient operation of power systems with large-scale penetration of distributed generators. Suppose that a microgrid should provide reserve operation in a decentralized environment; determining a suitable reserve capacity becomes an important problem for reliable and economic operation. To address this problem, in this paper we present a method of determining the optimal reserve capacity under the power exchange for frequency control (PXFC) market environment. After creating some penalty rules that take microgrid islanding into account, determining the optimal reserve capacity is formulated as an optimization problem. Microgrid islanding probability (MIP) is proposed as an index to describe the likelihood of microgrid islanding. The effectiveness of the method in terms of the operating cost is investigated using simulations, where our method and two further methods are applied to microgrids with different generation capabilities. The properties of MIP are also demonstrated by the simulations.

This paper shows that ac-feasibility, i.e., to find whether some generator dispatch can satisfy a given demand, is NP-hard for tree networks.

Abstract: Unit commitment (UC) is one of the core problems in short-term power generation scheduling and electricity market clearing. The problem is generally formulated as a mixed integer programming model that is computationally complex for large sized systems. Introducing valid inequalities (VIs) is an effective method to improve the computational efficiency. Recently the analytical necessary conditions for determining feasible commitment states are reported in literature, which provides an opportunity to form VIs for UC. In this paper, we equivalently convert the nonlinear necessary conditions into a group of linear inequalities by analyzing the problem structure, and add them to the original UC formulation as VIs. In the branch-and-cut framework, these VIs can quickly identify a large percentage of infeasible nodes and thus reduce the scale of the search tree. They can also assist in forming effective cuts to speed up the branch-and-cut process. A procedure of selecting the most effective VIs is developed to further improve the computational performance. Numerical results based on three testing systems show that the VIs added can significantly improve the computational efficiency in most cases.

Abstract: With the popularization of electric vehicles (EVs), the influence on power systems is receiving increasing attention. According to statistics, EVs are in a parking state for more than 90% of the time, thus, the electric energy of the EVs accumulated by aggregators can be used to support the operation of power systems. This paper takes reducing operation costs as the objective function and considers the constraints of EVs and power systems to establish the optimal charging/discharging control of electric vehicles, which meet the operational safety of power systems and convenient driving. The influence on operation costs, peak load, and loss for the proposed charging/discharging two-way control, charging-only control, and free charging modes of EVs are compared. The influence of battery charging and discharging efficiency on these results is also discussed in this paper.

Abstract: This paper investigates a procedure of coordinated tuning of power system decentralized damping controllers based on reduced-order model (ROM). In the paper, the cross-gramian technique is applied to obtain an equivalent ROM for power systems. Once the controllers' locations are selected appropriately, the critical modes are approximated well in the reduced model. The controllers are designed on ROM using search algorithm and then tested on the unreduced system to demonstrate their availability. The benefit of adopting ROM is to decrease the complexity of objective function computation. The proposed method is tested on power systems with 4-machine and 156-machine to validate its efficiency.

Abstract: Time-delay exists widely in electric power systems, and is found to have significant effect on the performance of operation and control under certain conditions. It is shown that even a very small delay may destabilize the power system. Therefore, time-delay is of important concern and should be properly handled, especially in the wide-area measurement and control environment. However, only few results about the controller design for power system considering multiple time-delays are reported. In this paper, a multiple time-delayed power system model is constructed with power system stabilizer (PSS) considering time-delays. By using Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, two H-infinity control schemes are developed for time-varying multiple delayed systems. The proposed controllers guarantee the closed-loop system asymptotic stable with H-infinity performance. A two-area four-machine power system and the New England 10-machine 39-bus system are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methods. The simulation results verify that the designed controllers can improve the control performance significantly.

Abstract: Generating representative scenarios of wind power time series to reflect its stochastic characteristic is important for power system planning and operation. However, there is no comprehensive model to optimize the space and moment distances between original and generated scenarios simultaneously, which deteriorates the quality of generated scenarios. This letter proposes an optimal model to minimize the space and moment distances simultaneously and proposes a heuristic search method (HS) to solve it. Simulation results show that scenarios generated by the proposed model have better ability to approximate the original scenarios set both in moment distance and space distance than the traditional optimization model. Meanwhile, the HS method is much faster than the traditional backward/forward reduction methods.

Abstract: In this paper, a new ensemble forecasting model for short-term load forecasting (STLF) is proposed based on extreme learning machine (ELM). Four important improvements are used to support the ELM for increased forecasting performance. First, a novel wavelet-based ensemble scheme is carried out to generate the individual ELM-based forecasters. Second, a hybrid learning algorithm blending ELM and the Levenberg-Marquardt method is proposed to improve the learning accuracy of neural networks. Third, a feature selection method based on the conditional mutual information is developed to select a compact set of input variables for the forecasting model. Fourth, to realize an accurate ensemble forecast, partial least squares regression is utilized as a combining approach to aggregate the individual forecasts. Numerical testing shows that proposed method can obtain better forecasting results in comparison with other standard and state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This two-part paper considers the coordination of a population of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) with unknown parameters to achieve group objectives. The problem involves designing the bidding and market clearing strategy to motivate self-interested users to realize efficient energy allocation subject to a peak energy constraint. The companion paper (Part I) formulates the problem and proposes a load coordination framework using the mechanism design approach. To address the unknown parameters, Part II of this paper presents a joint state and parameter estimation framework based on the expectation maximization algorithm. The overall framework is then validated using real-world weather data and price data, and is compared with other approaches in terms of aggregated load response. Simulation results indicate that our coordination framework can effectively improve the operational efficiency of the distribution system and reduce power congestion at key times.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the coordination of a population of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) with unknown parameters to achieve group objectives. The problem involves designing the device bidding and market clearing strategies to motivate self-interested users to realize efficient energy allocation subject to a peak energy constraint. This coordination problem is formulated as a mechanism design problem, and we propose a mechanism to implement the social choice function in dominant strategy equilibrium. The proposed mechanism consists of a novel bidding and clearing strategy that incorporates the internal dynamics of TCLs in the market mechanism design, and we show it can realize the team optimal solution. This paper is divided into two parts. Part I presents a mathematical formulation of the problem and develops a coordination framework using the mechanism design approach. Part II presents a learning scheme to account for the unknown load model parameters, and evaluates the proposed framework through realistic simulations.

Abstract: The use of phasor angle measurements provided by phasor measurement units (PMUs) in fault detection is regarded as a promising method in identifying locations of power line outages. However, communication errors or system malfunctions may introduce errors to the measurements and thus yield bad data. Most of the existing methods on line outage identification fail to consider such error. This paper develops a framework for identifying multiple power line outages based on the PMUs' measurements in the presence of bad data. In particular, we design an algorithm to identify locations of line outage and recover the faulty measurements simultaneously. The proposed algorithm does not require any prior information on the number of line outages and the noise variance. Case studies carried out on test systems of different sizes validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: An efficient parallel Krylov-Schur method is proposed for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors related with oscillating modes of low damping for large-scale power systems. Improved restarting techniques are explained and demonstrated in details, which focus on a refined selection of kept subspace in contraction and a reliable mechanism of no missing target eigenvalues. Cayley and shift-invert transforms are used to de-couple the computation of eigen-analysis and enable the proposed parallelization with a master-slave scheme. Based on the improved restarting techniques, the strategy for adaptive allocation of shifts and the coordination of parallel computing tasks, the proposed method is capable of computing a large number of eigen-pairs with satisfactory accuracy, convergence rate and parallel acceleration. The computational efficiency is validated by three test cases from real-world large-scale power systems on a symmetric multi-processing (SMP) computer.

Abstract: This letter proposes a concept of the downside risk (DR) for the study of probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) with wind power integrated. It aims to obtain optimal dispatch solutions with the minimal expectation of generation cost and the minimal downside risk. This risk is manifested by semi-variance (semi-deviation) of generation cost in a uncertain environment of wind power. The downside risk constrained POPF is then solved via a multi-objective optimization algorithm in a numerical experiment to capture the trade off between the expected generation cost and the downside risk.

Abstract: This paper presents the nonlinear interval optimization (NIO) model to solve optimal power system dispatch (OPSD) with uncertain wind power integrated. In this model, not only the average of the dispatching objective, but its deviation are also taken into account. Therefore, the NIO model based on OPSD is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. An optimization algorithm, group search optimizer with multiple producers (GSOMP) is applied to obtain Pareto solutions, which show the tradeoff relationship between the average and deviation of the dispatching objective. Then, a decision-making method, the evidential reasoning (ER) approach, is applied to determine the final dispatch solution. Simulation results based on the modified IEEE 30-bus system prove the applicability and effectiveness of the NIO model to deal with the OPSD, considering the integration of the uncertain wind power.

Abstract: Large-scale wind farms are typically geographically separated from load centers and distributed in different control areas. Therefore, interregional energy dispatch is important for wind power generation via sharing spinning reserve capacity among interconnected systems. However, existing tie-line scheduling methods in China do not provide satisfactory performance in accommodating the recent large-scale integration of wind power. In this paper, we describe a coordination framework for tie-line scheduling and power dispatch to operate multi-area systems. Tie-line flows are updated hourly to hedge uncertainty in the near future, preserving the operational independence of areas. The coordinated tie-line scheduling problem is formulated using two-stage adaptive robust optimization to account for uncertainties in the available wind power and is solved using a column-and-constraint generation method in a coordinate-and-decentralize manner. Comparative simulations show that the method is effective in enabling further wind power penetration and can improve economic efficiency in multi-area systems. A case study using a large-scale power system demonstrates the benefits and scalability of the method in practice.

Abstract: Fluctuations in wind power in geographically distributed areas are typically complementary, and therefore a coordinated multi-area dynamic economic dispatch may enable greater wind power penetration in interconnected power systems. Here we describe a decentralized approach based on a modified generalized Benders decomposition in which locally optimal cost function of each area is introduced. The technique exhibits rapid convergence and does not require parameter tuning. It is suitable for multi-area interconnected systems with a hierarchical control architecture. Comparative numerical simulations demonstrate that the performance of our method is favorable in terms of accuracy, convergence and computational efficiency. A case study on a real power system is also carried out to demonstrate the potential of this technique to increase wind power penetration.

A mathematical proof is provided, and the numerical tests verify the effect of this method.

Abstract: As traditional transmission contingency screening (TCS) methods neglect impacts of distribution grids, the contingency selection result may not be always satisfactory, especially when distribution networks are more frequently looped in a smart grid. Two new contingency screening methods considering impacts of distribution grids are proposed in this letter. The first one is based on global power flow, and the second only utilizes distribution network equivalencing. Numerical tests show both new methods can give more reliable results than TCS.

Abstract: An unobservable false data injection (FDI) attack on AC state estimation (SE) is introduced and its consequences on the physical system are studied. With a focus on understanding the physical consequences of FDI attacks, a bi-level optimization problem is introduced whose objective is to maximize the physical line flows subsequent to an FDI attack on DC SE. The maximization is subject to constraints on both attacker resources (size of attack) and attack detection (limiting load shifts) as well as those required by DC optimal power flow (OPF) following SE. The resulting attacks are tested on a more realistic non-linear system model using AC state estimation and ACOPF, and it is shown that, with an appropriately chosen sub-network, the attacker can overload transmission lines with moderate shifts of load.

Abstract: Load-damping characteristic models the load response to the frequency deviation, which has important impact on system frequency response. The load-damping coefficient is normally considered as a constant, obtained from operational experiences in large-scale power systems or from detailed load models in isolated power systems. An industrial isolated power system for aluminum production driven by coal-fired power and large scale wind power is studied in this paper. Since the electrolytic aluminum load is driven by direct current, it is one type of voltage-sensitive load and does not respond to the frequency deviation. This paper proposes a load-damping characteristic control method for such isolated industrial power system with voltage-sensitive load. To decrease the maximum frequency deviation during transient process, a time-varying load-damping coefficient control scheme is presented. Simulation is done on real-time digital simulator (RTDS) and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Abstract: Electric power systems can display a range of undesirable dynamic phenomena by which acceptable, stable operation may be lost. Quasi-steady-state operational problems such as the voltage instability phenomena are among these. Ill-conditioning of the power flow, reflected in high sensitivity of bus voltage magnitudes to load variation is an often observed precursor to such quasi-steady state operational problems. Motivated by this insight, work here will propose a voltage stability and conditioning monitor that is model-free in real-time, based solely on phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, arguing that such an approach is well suited to near-real-time application. We review model-dependent singular value analysis in voltage stability assessment, and relate these existing approaches to our proposed model-free method in real-time application. The proposed algorithm is first applied under the idealized assumption of full measurement data at all buses. This work then extends the algorithm to apply in the more practical case for which only subset of buses have available measurement data. The proposed approach is illustrated in IEEE test cases, augmented to include heavy load conditions that stress voltage stability. Algorithms for efficient computation of small numbers of singular values, as well as means to exploit low-rank updates in data, are reviewed to demonstrate opportunities for fast computation that allow these SVD methods to operate in near-real-time in large systems.

Abstract: This letter proposes a two-layer active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method with the compensation of estimated equivalent input disturbances (EID) for load frequency control (LFC) of multi-area interconnected power system. This method has a capability of rejecting the effects of random load variations and parameter uncertainties, and guaranteeing high dynamic performance. The state-space model of LFC system is established. Then a full-order generalized state observer (GSO) is employed in ADRC system to estimate EID. A stability condition is derived based on the small-gain theory. Simulation results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method, by comparing with traditional one.

Abstract: This paper presents a reliability evaluation method for a tidal power generation system ( TPGS) with a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The key to the method is the modeling of the tidal current speed-dependent failure rates of the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC). The models for calculating the rotor currents through the RSC and GSC and the rotor current state related failure rates are presented. Based on the Wake by distribution of tidal current speed, a multistate discrete probability distribution technique for rotor current is developed. Case studies are described using tidal current speed data from four coastal sites in North America. The results indicate that the failure rates of the RSC, GSC, and the entire TPGS vary with tidal current speeds and the probability distributions of tidal current speed. The TPGS suffers a much higher failure risk in the super-synchronous mode than in the idle and subsynchronous modes. The failure rate of the RSC is much higher than that of the GSC. The change trends in the failure rates of RSC and GSC in the operation modes are different. The probability distributions of tidal current speed have significant impacts on the reliability of the TPGS.

Abstract: In order to provide the ancillary service for smart grid, this paper proposes a modelling and control protocol design approach for the aggregation of heterogeneous thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). A 2-D state bin is proposed to model the second-order TCL dynamics in a population model. Detailed procedure of calculating the transition probability in the system matrix is provided. In the controller design, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed to obtain the optimal control actions along the prediction horizon. In addition, implementation of the control signal for adjusting TCLs' statuses are also investigated with practical situations considered. Simulation results reveal the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed modelling and control approach when applied on a large population of TCLs. Some factors that may affect the service performance are also discussed in this paper.

Abstract: Based on data available from phase measurement units (PMUs), this paper proposes an energy margin constrained online coordinated voltage control (CVC) algorithm. First, the energy function model is established, which is based on detailed device models that include the effects of shunt capacitor banks, reactive power output of generators and under-load-tap-changers (ULTCs). In order to improve the computational efficiency, a Lie derivative-based method is used to map the energy change into the system trajectory along the energy manifold. Then, the change of energy margin based on the Lie derivative is used as the objective function and the reactive power margin is used as a constraint to formulate a linear programming problem. A coordinated strategy is proposed to help achieve the optimal solution when the linear programming problem is solved. In comparison with the other control modes, the proposed method improves the stability margin and the control effectiveness of voltage profile. Numerical results are provided for a three-machine system, the IEEE-30 bus system and the New England-39 bus benchmark system.

Abstract: In this study, a new pinning-based distributed cooperative control scheme is proposed for multi-agent system (MAS)-based autonomous microgrids. By pinning parts of selected agents, only a small fraction of the pinned agents are controlled by simple feedback controllers, while the other DGAs in the MAS synchronize through the communication coupling among the pinned agents in a distributed manner. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) the proposal of a fully distributed control for autonomous microgrids where each agent shares its operation information only with its neighbors, which obviates the requirement for a central controller and complex communication topology; 2) the proposal of a pinning-based control scheme, which reduces the number of controllers, for a predefined consensus can be reached if a small fraction of the pinned agents is controlled; and 3) the proposal of the pinning consensus under uncertain communication topologies that can meet the requirements of line switches and plug-and-play operation. Simulation results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Cascading failure is one of the most damaging events to power systems. To mitigate the risk, it is essential to first evaluate the risk and then take corresponding protective measures. However, the issue of multiple solutions in DCOPF, which is a tool used in the existing OPA risk assessment models and a linear programming (LP) problem, has not been considered. In this letter, we show that the risk may be seriously under-estimated if we do not consider the existence of multiple solutions. The risk is evaluated by generating two dispatch plans based on a bilevel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for DCOPF. The solution to the bilevel MILP model is obtained by solving one LP and one MILP. Simulation results based on the IEEE 118-bus and 300-bus systems demonstrate the impact of multiple solutions in DCOPF and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: A frequency-based approach is proposed in this paper to size a battery-supercapacitor energy storage system for maintaining power balance of an isolated system with high penetration of wind generation, thus to maintain the grid frequency stability with the stochastic wind power fluctuations being considered. The sizing method proposed makes full use of the combined technical merits of two types of energy storage systems, battery and supercapacitor, as their specific power/energy densities and the corresponding expected life cycle cost/year are different. The power imbalance between hourly dispatched wind power and the corresponding actual real-time wind power output is decomposed into different time-varying periodic components by use of the Fourier transformation. Then two different types of energy storage systems are applied to balance the low-frequency and intermediate-frequency component respectively. A computational procedure is developed in the paper for choosing the optimal cut-off frequencies in determining the range of low and intermediate frequency for sizing the hybrid energy storage system. Comparative studies of a real isolated system in China are presented in the paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Frequency deviation of power systems caused by grid-connected wind power fluctuations is one of the key factors limiting the level of wind penetration. Applying an energy storage system (ESS) to overcome the constraint of frequency deviation can increase the level of permitted wind penetration. This paper proposes a method to evaluate the wind penetration as limited by grid frequency deviation and to size the ESS to increase the permitted wind penetration to an expected level. The proposed method treats wind power fluctuations as a stochastic process rather than deterministic signal and takes the frequency response characteristics of power grid into full consideration. Application of the proposed method is based on theoretical derivations and does not require conducting dynamic simulation. It can catch the stochastic characteristic of wind power fluctuations.

Abstract: This paper proposes two switching controllers working in a coordinated manner to enhance the transient stability of multi-machine power systems. One is switching excitation controller (SEC) and the other is switching governor (SG). The SEC switches between a bang-bang excitation controller (BEC) and a conventional excitation controller (CEC) and the SG switches between a bang-bang governor (BG) and a conventional governor (CG), via a state-dependent switching strategy. The BEC and the BG are designed as bang-bang constant funnel controllers (BCFC), which are able to provide fast switching of excitation voltage and valve position between their upper and lower limits. A detailed steam turbine model including boiler pressure effect is considered in the controller design process. Simulation studies are undertaken in the IEEE 16-generator 68-bus power system to evaluate the control performance of the switching controllers, which include the cases that three-phase-to-ground fault and transmission line outage occur in the system, respectively. Coordination between the excitation loop and speed governing loop is studied. Two system resilience indexes are introduced, and the short-term resilience is investigated for the power systems with and without switching controllers installed, respectively.

Abstract: This work presents a parallel transient stability simulation based on waveform relaxation for large-scale power systems. A power system described by large-scale differential-algebraic equations (DAE) is decomposed into several subsystems by a partitioning algorithm based on epsilon decomposition. The method adopts preconditioning and waveform prediction to accelerate convergence of the system. Moreover, a two-stage parallel strategy based on OpenMP further improves parallel efficiency. All subsystems are solved using a very dishonest Newton (VDHN) method combined with an iteration method based on Adomian decomposition independently after the state variables are discretized by implicit-trapezoidal rule. Finally, two large-scale test cases with detailed dynamic models verify the proposed algorithm. The computational results show that the proposed waveform relaxation method achieves high parallel efficiency.

Abstract: Due to the increasing adoption of domestic photovoltaic (PV) systems, the use of technologies such as on-load tap changer (OLTC)-fitted transformers, capacitor banks, and remote monitoring are being considered to mitigate voltage issues, particularly in European-style low voltage (LV) networks. Depending on the control strategy, however, the effects on customer voltages and control actions (e.g., tap changes or capacitor switching) can vary significantly. This work presents a framework to assess the performance of different OLTC-based control strategies in terms of voltage compliance with the standard BS EN50160 and the number of control actions. Three control strategies are proposed: constant set-point (CSC), time-based (TBC) and remote monitoring-based (RMC). A week-long Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering a real UK LV network, three-phase power flows, different PV penetrations and seasonality. Results show that the TBC outperforms the CSC but at the expense of more tap changes. Due to the enhanced visibility, the RMC significantly increases the PV hosting capacity whilst limiting tap operations. Finally, when feeders have contrasting voltage issues, capacitor banks are found to provide additional flexibility and allow higher PV penetrations. These findings are expected to help the industry determining the benefits from OLTC-based solutions in future LV networks.

Abstract: Emerging smart-grid-enabling technologies will allow an unprecedented degree of observability and control at all levels in a power system. Combined with flexible demand and storage, they could allow procuring energy at minimum cost and environmental impact. That however presupposes real-time coordination of demand of individual households and industries down at the distribution level, with generation at the transmission level. This is closely related with the balancing market economic dispatch (ED) problem, which currently does not take into account distribution network constraints and flexible demand characteristics. Still, assuming a suitably modified form of that problem was available, due to both computational and communications requirements, its centralized solution in its full detail would not be tractable. While there is currently a wealth of literature dealing with distributed optimization applications in power systems, it typically focuses on smaller parts of the overall energy management problem (e.g., transmission area synchronization or electric vehicles management) often without considering its full scale or establishing any association with energy market mechanisms. The target of this paper is twofold: 1) identify a flexible demand and distribution network inclusive formulation for ED and 2) propose a solution method.

Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) dispatches controllable generation at minimum cost subject to operational constraints on generation and transmission assets. The uncertainty and variability of intermittent renewable generation is challenging current deterministic OPF approaches. Recent formulations of OPF use chance constraints to limit the risk from renewable generation uncertainty, however, these new approaches typically assume the probability distributions which characterize the uncertainty and variability are known exactly. We formulate a robust chance constrained (RCC) OPF that accounts for uncertainty in the parameters of these probability distributions by allowing them to be within an uncertainty set. The RCC OPF is solved using a cutting-plane algorithm that scales to large power systems. We demonstrate the RRC OPF on a modified model of the Bonneville Power Administration network, which includes 2209 buses and 176 controllable generators. Deterministic, chance constrained (CC), and RCC OPF formulations are compared using several metrics including cost of generation, area control error, ramping of controllable generators, and occurrence of transmission line overloads as well as the respective computational performance.

Abstract: In medium-voltage DC (MVDC) systems, to manage the impacts of uncertainty and variability brought by the high-penetrated renewable energy sources (RES), this paper proposes a two-time-scale coordinated energy management method. Based on a hierarchical control framework, the droop control is used and its two key factors, operating point and droop coefficient, are co-optimized. To improve operational benefits, operating points are determined in the reference optimization, considering the long-term cooperative operation of various integrated units. To enhance system security, droop coefficients are optimized in the coefficient optimization, where controllers' responses to the system unbalanced power and changes of system voltage profile within the dispatch interval are both considered. Since these two optimizations are performed in different time scales, a two-time-scale coordinated strategy is designed to balance long-term economic benefits and short-term security performance. The proposed approach is verified on a typical MVDC system which has a meshed network topology. Conventional and renewable energy sources as well as schedulable and unschedulable load demands are considered. Numerical experiments indicate that, the proposed approach is capable of providing economical and reliable dispatch, such that the forecast errors and fluctuations brought by the high-penetrated RESs and other unschedulable units can be adapted to.

Abstract: Uneven load distribution leads to a 3-phase imbalance at the low voltage (LV) substation level. This imbalance has distinct impacts on main feeders and LV transformers: for main feeders, it reduces the available capacity as the phase with the least spare capacity determines the usable capacity; for LV transformers, phase imbalance reduces the available capacity due to additional power along the neutral line. To assess the additional reinforcement cost (ARC) arising from a 3-phase imbalance, this paper proposes two novel costing models for main feeders and LV transformers respectively. Each model involves the derivation of an accurate ARC formula based on the degree of three-phase imbalance and a linearized approximation through Taylor's expansion to simplify the detailed ARC formula, enabling quantification of future LV investment in scale. The developed models are tested on 4 cases where imbalance ranges from 0 to 10%, and reveals that i) a small imbalance degree may cause a substantial ARC on main feeders; ii) ARC grows exponentially as asset utilization is close to its capacity; and that iii) a main feeder is more sensitive to its respective imbalance degree than an LV transformer under the same condition. The models serve as an effective tool to assist distribution network operators (DNOs) to quantify a key cost (ARC) element from the phase imbalance, allowing DNOs to evaluate their future LV investment in scale.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate whether considering the fine structure of half-hourly electricity prices, the market closing prices of fundamentals (natural gas, coal and) and the system-wide demand can lead to significantly more accurate short-and mid-term forecasts of APX U.K. baseload prices. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of a number of univariate and multivariate time series models over a three-year out-of-sample forecasting period and compare it against that of a benchmark autoregressive model. We find that in the short-term, up to a few business days ahead, a disaggregated model which independently predicts the intra-day prices and then takes their average to yield baseload price forecasts is the best performer. However, in the mid-term, factor models which explore the correlation structure of intra-day prices lead to significantly (as measured by the Diebold-Mariano test) better baseload price forecasts. At the same time, we observe that the inclusion of fundamental variables-especially natural gas prices (in the short-term) and coal prices (in the mid-term)-provides significant gains. The prices, on the other hand, generally do not improve the price forecasts at all, at least in the time period considered in this study (April 2009-December 2013).

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem, where each contingency corresponds to the outage of an arbitrary number of lines and generators. The problem is studied by means of a convex relaxation, named semidefinite program (SDP). The existence of a rank-1 SDP solution guarantees the recovery of a global solution of SCOPF. We prove that the rank of the SDP solution is upper bounded by the treewidth of the power network plus one, which is perceived to be small in practice. We then propose a decomposition method to reduce the computational complexity of the relaxation. In the case where the relaxation is not exact, we develop a graph-theoretic convex program to identify the problematic lines of the network and incorporate the loss over those lines into the objective as a penalization (regularization) term, leading to a penalized SDP problem. We perform several simulations on large-scale benchmark systems and verify that the global minima are at most 1% away from the feasible solutions obtained from the proposed penalized relaxation.

Abstract: This paper takes into account the reliability and economic effects of line maintenance on the transmission network expansion planning considering line repairs and the reliability effect of line loadings. For this purpose, a quantitative relationship between line lifetimes and the value of the transmission system is introduced in order to formulate the economic effect of maintenance. Also, the failure rate and mean time to repair coefficients are employed to calculate reliability effects of line maintenance using the cost of load shedding. Furthermore, the effect of line loadings on transmission system reliability is formulated through the line failure rates. The proposed model is tested on the Garver's network and the IEEE Reliability Test System, which is followed by a discussion of the results.

Abstract: efficient analytical (EA) method is proposed for optimally installing multiple distributed generation (DG) technologies to minimize power loss in distribution systems. Different DG types are considered, and their power factors are optimally calculated. The proposed EA method is also applied to the problem of allocating an optimal mix of different DG types with various generation capabilities. Furthermore, the EA method is integrated with the optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm to develop a new method, EA-OPF which effectively addresses overall system constraints. The proposed methods are tested using 33-bus and 69-bus distribution test systems. The calculated results are validated using the simulation results of the exact optimal solution obtained by an exhaustive OPF algorithm for both distribution test systems. The results show that the performances of the proposed methods are superior to existing methods in terms of computational speed and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper considers a wind power producer playing strategically in a day-ahead market while willing to set demand response (DR) contracts with a DR aggregator. To this end, a bilevel problem including a single leader and two followers is formulated. The wind power producer is the leader aiming at maximizing its profit through offering into a day-ahead market and clearing its deviation in a balancing market. The strategic behavior of the producer in the day-ahead market is modeled through the market clearing process (follower 1). In addition, the DR aggregator behavior is modeled through a revenue function in which the aggregator is able to sell its DR product to the wind power producer, other competitors and the day-ahead market (follower 2). The overall problem is a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) in which wind power production and imbalance prices are associated with uncertainty. The problem is then transformed into a linear programming approach. A case of the Nordic market is chosen to assess the validity of the given problem.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for N - 1 contingency constrained transmission capacity expansion planning (TCEP), which is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. In relatively well-designed power systems, a single outage of a majority of lines will not usually cause overload on other lines in most loading conditions. Thus they will not affect the feasible region and the optimal answer of the TCEP optimization problem, and can be safely removed from contingency analysis if we can identify them. A contingency identification index is developed to detect these lines and create variable contingency lists (VCL) for different network loading conditions. In our proposed method, we use results of a relaxed version of the original problem as a lower bound answer in the first step, and integrate contingencies into TCEP in the next steps to solve this optimization problem faster while still satisfying N - 1 criterion. For solving TCEP with contingencies, two options are offered, i. e., option A that uses an updated system as its base case (original existing network together with selected lines by the relaxed problem) and option B that uses the original existing network as its base case (without results of the relaxed problem). Option A is faster than option B because it usually should select fewer new lines compared to B, but cannot guarantee optimality. Option B provides the optimal answer while taking more computational time. An ERCOT case study is used to show capabilities of the proposed method for solving large scale problems, and the numerical result demonstrates this method is much faster than the integrated MIP method that directly incorporates all contingencies.

The proposed formulation can prevent the wasteful utilization of different PMUs observing incident branch current phasors at a given bus more than once. The method is tested on the IEEE 57-bus test system.

Abstract: A new methodology for selecting a global group of the most effective preventive controls in the context of voltage stability analysis in electrical power systems for a set of multiple critical contingencies is developed in this paper. This methodology is based on a sensitivity analysis of the maximum loadability point with respect to voltage controls. Considering not only the effectiveness of the control elements but also their availability, coordination, and cost, the methodology determines a set of controllers to simultaneously eliminate all critical contingencies. The methodology is fast and suitable for online assessment of preventive control. The methodology was successfully tested in a reduced south-southeast Brazilian system composed of 107 buses.

Abstract: We consider a novel paradigm for demand side management, assuming that an aggregator communicates with a household only at the meter, imposing a capacity constraint, i.e., a restriction on the total power consumption level within a given time frame. Consumers are then responsible to adjust the set-points of the individual household devices accordingly to meet the imposed constraint. We formulate the problem as a stochastic household energy management program, with stochasticity arising due to local photovoltaic generation. We show how a demand bidding curve for capacity increments can be constructed as a by-product of the developed problem and provide a rigorous pricing analysis that results in a probabilistic "shadow" price envelope. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we compare it with an idealized real-time market price set-up and show how our analysis can provide guidelines to consumers when selecting a service contract for load curtailment.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new method of removing thermal overloads and voltage limits in an electric power system by means of the Evolution of Corrective and Preventive control Actions (ECPA). The goal is to find the minimum number of control actions that solve the identified limit violations at minimum cost. A recombination operator based on form theory allows the codification of control actions in a natural and simple way. ECPA has been tested on the IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 118-bus systems. The limit violations are solved at minimum cost and with fewer control actions on average than alternative methods.

Abstract: The deeper penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in microgrids (s) has led to their wider deployment in specific applications. The inherent variability in loads and in renewable energy resource outputs necessitates the development and implementation of effective voltage control strategies so as to reliably serve the loads, particularly under is-landed operations mode. We propose a dispersed control strategy to maintain voltage levels within the operational limits by means of the DERs reactive and active power outputs. We implement an optimization approach and demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed voltage control scheme using a set of representative studies from the extensive testing of the simulation approach performed with the methodology. Simulation results demonstrate the absence of any opportunity cost to implement the control action and the maximization of active power production by renewable energy resources.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new multi-objective framework for primary distribution system planning (DSP). Further consideration is devoted to early DSP formulations in order to assess the risk imposed by probabilistic customer choices on reliability (CCOR). The CCOR is a buy/sell strategy that permits customers to pay the electricity price equiponderant to the reliability level provided by the distribution utility over the contract period. A Monte Carlo-based simulation is carried out to examine the effects of the probability of a customer's interest in adopting the CCOR on profit-at-risk. Furthermore, the DSP was conducted to simultaneously minimize both total planning cost and profit-at-risk. The resultant optimization problem is solved through the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) accompanied by a fuzzy decision making method to select the best result among the obtained Pareto optimal set of solutions. The developed method is applied to an actual large-scale distribution system with about 140 000 customers, followed by a discussion on results.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an approach for a fast assessment of the dynamic characteristics of system frequency during the period of cold load pickup following a large-scale blackout. The approach is developed based on a load model and a model of generation control system: the load model considers the unique time-dependent characteristic of inrush power surges during the period of cold load pickup, while the model of generation control system mimics the characteristics of various governors that are crucial to the determination of the key variables including initial rate of frequency change, frequency nadir and settling frequency. With the proposed linearization and estimation methods, the model of generation control system can be quickly constructed to offer a great amount of flexibility and simplicity for the study of the impact of cold load on frequency response. The proposed approach allows system operators to quickly evaluate many different options for system restoration. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system. The differences between the results obtained using the proposed approach and those obtained from complete PSS/E simulation are very small, which suggests that the linearized model of generation control system is fast, and accurate enough to address the major concerns of cold load pickup in system restoration.

Abstract: If an interarea oscillatory mode has insufficient damping, generator redispatch can be used to improve its damping. We explain and apply a new analytic formula for the modal sensitivity to rank the best pairs of generators to redispatch. The formula requires some dynamic power system data and we show how to obtain that data from synchrophasor measurements. The application of the formula to damp interarea modes is explained and illustrated with interarea modes of the New England 10-generator power system.

Abstract: This letter presents an important finding: the parameters of secondary frequency control based on integral or proportional integral control can be tuned to achieve economic operation and frequency regulation simultaneously. We show that if the power imbalance is represented by frequency deviation, an iterative dual ascent based economic dispatch solving is equivalent to integral control. An iterative method of multipliers based economic dispatch is equivalent to proportional integral control. Similarly, if the controller parameters of the secondary frequency controls are chosen based on generator cost functions, these secondary frequency controllers achieve both economic operation and frequency regulation simultaneously.

Abstract: The paper focuses on the small-signal stability analysis of large power systems with inclusion of multiple delayed signals. The following four techniques are compared: 1) a Chebyshev discretization scheme of an equivalent partial differential equations that resembles the original delay differential-algebraic equations (DDAEs); 2) an approximation of the time integration operator; 3) a linear multistep discretization of the DDAEs based on an high-order implicit time-integration scheme; and 4) the well-known Pade approximants. These techniques are compared using a GPU-based parallel implementation of the Shur method and QR factorization and tested through a real-world transmission system.

Parallel and lossy zero impedance branches can also be straightforwardly defined. A detailed discussion of the features and numerical performance of all models considered in this letter is carried out by means of the a 21,177-bus model of the European ENTSO-E transmission.

Abstract: This letter provides a comparison between the current and power injection models for angle and voltage stability analysis of power systems. Traditionally, it is believed that the current injection model is computationally more efficient. On the other hand, the power injection model requires computing the products of currents and voltages and, hence, is expected to be computationally more demanding than the current injection one. This letter compares the two approaches using a unique framework. The two formulations are compared through a dynamic 1479-bus model of the all-island Irish transmission system.

The letter also illustrates theoretical caveats and numerical issues of both methods. In particular, the case study, based on a 2383-bus system, shows that the fixed points of these methods are not necessarily a solution of the power flow problem.

Abstract: We propose a fully distributed Gauss-Newton algorithm for state estimation of electric power systems. At each Gauss-Newton iteration, matrix-splitting techniques are utilized to carry out the matrix inversion needed for calculating the Gauss-Newton step in a distributed fashion. In order to reduce the communication burden as well as increase robustness of state estimation, the proposed distributed scheme relies only on local information and a limited amount of information from neighboring areas. The matrix-splitting scheme is designed to calculate the Gauss-Newton step with exponential convergence speed. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in various numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to control the output power of a wind farm with the aim of improving the transient stability of a multi-machine power system. Doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) are considered for the variable speed wind farms. The variation of the frequency of the DFIG terminal bus is used to modulate the torque reference and thus the output power of the DFIG in the post-disturbance condition. This in turn modifies the electrical power of the nearby alternators and causes improvement of stability. The proposed control technique is validated in WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system and IEEE 16-machine 68-bus system. The study is carried out in PSCAD/EMTDC as well as in MATLAB platforms.

Abstract: In this paper, a new optimization framework is proposed to coordinate the operation of large, price-maker, and geographically dispersed energy storage/battery systems in a nodal transmission-constrained energy market. The energy storage units are assumed to be investor-owned and independently-operated, seeking to maximize their total profit. Various design factors are taken into consideration such as the location, size, efficiency, and charge and discharge rates of the energy storage units as well as the joint impact of the energy storage operations on the locational marginal prices. While the formulated optimization problem is originally nonlinear and hard to solve, nonlinearities are tackled both in the objective function and in the constraints and the problem is transformed into a tractable mixed-integer linear program, for which the global optimal solutions are found for the charge and discharge schedules of each energy storage unit. Both deterministic and stochastic design scenarios are addressed. Various case studies are presented. It is observed that transmission line congestion is often, but not always, desirable for the coordinated storage systems. Locational diversity, practice of arbitrage, robust design, self-scheduling versus economic bidding, and the overall power system performance are also investigated.

Abstract: An optimal supply and demand bidding, scheduling, and deployment design framework is proposed for battery systems. It takes into account various design factors such as the day-ahead and real-time market prices and their statistical dependency, as well as the location, size, efficiency, lifetime, and charge and discharge rates of the batteries. Utilizing second-life/used batteries is also considered. Without loss of generality, our focus is on the California Independent System Operator (ISO) energy market and its two available bidding options, namely self-schedule bidding and economic bidding. While the formulated stochastic optimization problems are originally nonlinear and difficult to solve, we propose a methodology to decompose them into inner and outer subproblems. Accordingly, we find the global optimal solutions within a short amount of computational time. All case studies in this paper are based on real market data.

Abstract: Charging schedules of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) coordinated by an aggregating agent may increase system efficiency of allocating generation, transmission and distribution resources. Decentralized self-scheduling and local charging control appear to be preferred by vehicle manufacturers and PEV drivers who are simultaneously concerned about the longevity and reliability of their energy storage systems. In such a setting, the aggregator would have to determine energy retail prices as means to indirect load control. This paper proposes a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints optimizing the aggregator's decisions. It endogenously determines the profit-optimal price level subject to the cost minimizing charging schedule of the final customers, who are reacting to a combination of retail price signals and distribution use-of-system network charges. This active response follows an affine demand-price relationship, which is individually parametrized for each vehicle by local information of vehicle characteristics and mobility pattern. The proposed program is applied to two cases: 1) a small case study with 3 vehicles, which highlights the model functionality with detailed hourly information per vehicle; 2) a large-scale fleet of 1000 vehicles provides insights on computational burden. Numerical results indicate that adequate competition in the retail market is necessary to limit the aggregator's monopolistic profitability. Finally, sensitivity runs show dependency on the individual's willingness to pay, the cost of alternative fueling opportunities and minimum state-of-charge requirements.

Abstract: Private investors, flexibility, efficiency and environmental requirements from deregulated markets have led the existence and building of a significant number of combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) in many power systems. These plants represent a complex optimization problem for the short-term planning unit commitment (UC) carried out by independent system operators due to their multiple operating configurations. Accordingly, this paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulation of the configuration-based model of CCGTs, which is commonly utilized for bid/offering market processes. This formulation is simultaneously tighter and more compact than analogous MIP-based models; hence, it presents a lower computational burden. The computational efficiency of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by solving network-constrained UC case studies, of different size and complexity, using three of the leading commercial MIP solvers: CPLEX, GUROBI, and XPRESS.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-agent control strategy to coordinate power sharing between heterogeneous energy storage devices distributed throughout a DC microgrid. Without requiring a central controller, the proposed control strategy extends the benefits offered by hybrid energy storage systems to DC microgrids with batteries and ultracapacitors spatially distributed at different levels of the power distribution hierarchy. The proposed control strategy has the following advantages. 1) The high frequency microgrid load is provided by the ultracapacitors. 2) The low frequency load is provided by batteries used for bulk energy storage during islanded mode, and the main grid during grid connected operation. 3) The ultracapacitor voltages are regulated at a desired reference. 4) State of charge balancing is provided between the batteries. 5) The energy storage systems cooperate based on neighbor-to-neighbor output feedback over a sparse communication network. The only communication requirement is a spanning tree from the ultracapacitor leaders and battery leaders to their respective followers. Simulations are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed control strategy for a 380 VDC datacenter during grid connected and islanded operation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified distributed control strategy for DC microgrid operating modes, without bus voltage signaling or mode detection mechanisms that are normally required for decentralized control strategies. The proposed control strategy is based on the novel integration of distributed controllers for energy balancing between DC microgrid energy storage systems with distributed controllers used to regulate the average DC microgrid bus voltage, and a new method for controlling the grid connected rectifier that maintains the distributed control structure. Under the proposed control strategy, seamless mode transitions are achieved between qualitatively different operating modes, namely, 1) grid connected operation with the rectifier providing load balancing, 2) grid connected operation with the rectifier charging the energy storage systems, and 3) islanded operation. In all operating modes, the average DC microgrid bus voltage is regulated to the microgrid voltage reference, and the energy storage systems are controlled independently of the operating mode to achieve and maintain a balanced energy level. Simulations are presented demonstrating the performance of the proposed control strategy for a 380 VDC datacenter with intermittent photovoltaic generation and communication delays expected from a WiFi control network implementation.

Implementation of dynamic ratings was driven by current economic and environmental constraints placed on the construction of additional electrical transmission infrastructure, thus creating a need to operate the existing equipment closer to its physical limitations. In order to effectively utilize these dynamic limits, the necessary data constructs must be modeled, so ERCOT extended the CIM representation of the balanced three-phase power system model used to operate its various grid functions, in order to support the modeling and use of dynamic ratings in its operational real-time and congestion hedging market models. This paper also explains how the process utilized in the identification and extension of the CIM model for this purpose is flexible enough for generic application within the power industry.

Abstract: Meeting the reliability requirements in wind integrated power systems is a challenging problem due to the volatility of wind power generation. Wide implementation of demand response (DR) programs is an effective solution for this problem. This paper studies the impacts of DR programs on short-term reliability assessment of wind integrated power systems. A new algorithm including the effects of time and components initial states is presented for short-term reliability evaluation. This algorithm involves a multi-segment optimal power flow (OPF) approach to model the lead-time of DR and reserve resources. Taking into account the uncertainties associated with DR programs, a new model for these programs is also proposed. In addition, a reliability modeling is developed for wind energy conversion systems to be employed in short-term studies. The results show that DR programs can eliminate the negative impacts of wind energy volatility on power system reliability. It is also shown that the actual operating conditions, such as the uncertainties in demand-side participation and elasticity estimation, and the lead-time of remedial resources, may significantly affect the efficiency of DR programs. Therefore, it seems that these issues should also be included in the reliability-based planning of DR resources.

Abstract: This paper describes the incorporation of uncertainty and reliability in the dynamic expansion planning of distribution network assets and distributed generation. Several alternatives for the installation of feeders, transformers, and distributed generation are considered. Thus, the optimal expansion plan identifies the best alternative, location, and installation time for the candidate assets under the uncertainty related to demand and renewable energy sources. To that end, an iterative algorithm is devised to yield a pool of high-quality candidate solutions in terms of total investment and operational costs. Each candidate solution results from a stochastic-programming-based model driven by the minimization of the expected investment and operational costs. The associated scenario-based deterministic equivalent is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program for which finite convergence to optimality is guaranteed and efficient off-the-shelf software is available. Standard metrics are subsequently applied to each candidate solution to characterize its reliability so that valuable information is provided to the distribution system planner. Numerical results illustrate the effective performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Demand response programs are currently being proposed as a solution to deal with issues related to peak demand and to improve the operation of the electric power system. In the demand response paradigm, electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently, time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the individual residential demands, innovative electricity price structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient solution approach based on Benders' decomposition to solve a network-constrained ac unit commitment problem under uncertainty. The wind power production is the only source of uncertainty considered in this paper, which is modeled through a suitable set of scenarios. The proposed model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming problem, whose first-stage refers to the day-ahead market, and whose second-stage represents real-time operation. The proposed Benders' approach allows decomposing the original problem, which is mixed-integer nonlinear and generally intractable, into a mixed-integer linear master problem and a set of nonlinear, but continuous subproblems, one per scenario. In addition, to temporally decompose the proposed ac unit commitment problem, a heuristic technique is used to relax the inter-temporal ramping constraints of the generating units. Numerical results from a case study based on the IEEE one-area reliability test system (RTS) demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Residential-scale low carbon technologies (LCTs) can help decarbonizing our economies but can also lead to technical issues, particularly in low voltage (LV) distribution systems. To quantify these problems this work proposes a probabilistic impact assessment methodology. First, realistic 5-min time-series daily profiles are produced for photovoltaic panels, electric heat pumps, electric vehicles, and micro combined heat and power units. Then, to cater for the uncertainties of LCTs (e.g., size, location, and behavior), a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering 100 simulations for different penetration levels (percentage of houses with a LCT). This methodology is applied to 128 real U.K. LV feeders showing that about half of them can have voltage and/or congestion issues at some penetration of LCTs. Furthermore, to identify the relationships between the first occurrence of problems and key feeder parameters (e.g., length, number of customers), a correlation analysis is developed per LCT. Crucially, these results can be translated into lookup tables to help distribution network operators in producing preliminary estimates of the LCT hosting capacity of a given feeder.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of scheduling a large population of electric water heaters (EWHs) by incorporating a physically-based aggregate model of the population into the day-ahead unit commitment (UC). This goal has been accomplished via several innovations: (i) consideration of a large controllable temperature range over which random distributions of heaters can take many different shapes; (ii) modeling the random nature of the heater population and its dynamics via histograms and their transition equations; (iii) for varying levels of energy stored in the EWH population, finding the specific shapes of stationary EWH histograms that have minimum overlaps with the uncontrollable temperature zones; (iv) from such histograms, computing the bounds on the number of heaters that can be turned on/off in terms of the energy stored in the population; (v) incorporating the aggregate EWH power consumed and energy stored and their constraints into a modified UC; (vi) developing a scheme whereby individual EWHs self-dispatch to meet the scheduled histograms along with their aggregate energy and power levels. Numerical simulations illustrate the applicability and benefits of the approach, which, with minor extensions, can be extended to other forms of electric loads with energy storage such as space heating and cooling systems and electric vehicles.

Abstract: The steady-state performance of low frequency AC (LFAC) systems for bulk power transmission is proposed and investigated in this paper. It is demonstrated that the LFAC is superior to the conventional 60 Hz AC system in terms of power transfer capability and voltage stability. An existing power system can increase its power transfer capability by up to more than eleven times if it operates at 5 Hz. In low operating frequency conditions, the transmission overhead line reactance is significantly lowered and thus results in less voltage drop along the line. If the system operating frequency is in the range of 1 to 10 Hz, the voltage profile along a transmission line is comparable to the surge impedance loading at the no-load condition or approaches that of the HVDC system at the full-load condition. More importantly, the V-P and Q-V characteristic curves show that the dependency of voltage on the real and reactive power flow is greatly reduced. In other words, the sensitivity of voltage on reactive power variations is diminished and results in a more stable voltage and a higher stability margin for the LFAC system compared to the conventional 60 Hz system.

Abstract: This paper presents optimal pricing design for demand response (DR) integration in the distribution network. In particular, we study the energy scheduling problem for a load serving entity (LSE) that serves two types of loads, namely inflexible and flexible loads. Inflexible loads are charged under a regular pricing tariff while flexible loads enjoy a dynamic pricing tariff that ensures cost saving for them. Moreover, flexible loads are assumed to be aggregated by several DR aggregators. The interaction between the LSE and its customers is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem where the LSE is the leader and DR aggregators are the followers. The optimal solution of this problem corresponds to the optimal pricing tariff for flexible loads. The key advantage of the proposed model is that it can be readily implemented thanks to its compatibility with existing pricing structures in the retail market. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed approach provides a win-win solution for both the LSE and its customers.

Abstract: Dynamic response of loads has a significant effect on system stability and directly determines the stability margin of the operating point. Inherent uncertainty and natural variability of load models make the stability assessment especially difficult and may compromise the security of the system. We propose a novel mathematical "robust stability" criterion for the assessment of small-signal stability of operating points. Whenever the criterion is satisfied for a given operating point, it provides mathematical guarantees that the operating point will be stable with respect to small disturbances for any dynamic response of the loads. The criterion can be naturally used for identification of operating regions secure from the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation. Several possible applications of the criterion are discussed, most importantly the concept of robust stability assessment (RSA), that could be integrated in dynamic security assessment packages and used in contingency screening and other planning and operational studies.

Abstract: Integration of renewable energy resources in microgrids has been increasing in recent decades. Due to the randomness in renewable resources such as solar and wind, the power generated can deviate from forecasted values. This variation may cause increased operating costs for committing costly reserve units or penalty costs for shedding load. In addition, it is often desired to charge/discharge and coordinate the energy storage units in an efficient and economical way. To address these problems, a novel battery operation cost model is proposed which considers a battery as an equivalent fuel-run generator to enable it to be incorporated into a unit commitment problem. A probabilistic constrained approach is used to incorporate the uncertainties of the renewable sources and load demands into the unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch problems.

Abstract: The integration of the dynamic line rating (DLR) of overhead transmission lines (OTLs) in power systems security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) potentially enhances the overall system security as well as its technical/economic performances. This paper proposes a scalable and computationally efficient approach aimed at integrating the DLR in SCUC problem. The paper analyzes the case of the SCUC with AC load flow constraints. The AC-optimal power flow (AC-OPF) is linearized and incorporated into the problem. The proposed multi-period formulation takes into account a realistic model to represent the different terms appearing in the Heat-Balance Equation (HBE) of the OTL conductors. In order to include the HBE in the OPF, a relaxation is proposed for the heat gain associated to resistive losses while the inclusion of linear approximations are investigated for both convection and radiation heat losses. A decomposition process relying on the Benders decomposition is used in order to breakdown the problem and incorporate a set of contingencies representing both generators and line outages. The effects of different linearization, as well as time step discretization of HBE, are investigated. The scalability of the proposed method is verified using IEEE 118-bus test system.

Abstract: This paper proposes the notion of "critical cluster" in inverter based droop controlled microgrids, thus representing the neighborhood of the distributed generation units that determines the small signal stability margin of the entire system. The clustering starts from the lowest impedance electrical connection between distributed generators, termed as "critical line". At first, the systematic study of few similar microgrids by means of the eigen-value analysis of their small signal models reveals the correlation between the location of their dominant low frequency modes and the individual connections between neighboring inverters. Second, the sensitivity analysis of active power droop gain with respect to network parameters confirms the previous findings and shows the dominating effect of the critical line's impedance. Simulations and small signal analysis studies assess the impact of the choice of various interconnection points when two individual droop controlled islanded microgrids are connected to form a single microgrid. At the same time, simplified models on the basis of critical clusters allow the effective approximation of the stability margin corresponding to the original systems. The results reveal that different interconnection points lead to strong variations in the performance of the coupled microgrid both in terms of transient response and small signal stability.

Abstract: Increasing wind penetration in non-interconnected power systems represents a techno-economic challenge for system operators. To accommodate the increased variability and uncertainty adequate reserve levels and advanced solutions that increase the controllability of wind power output, such as hybrid power stations, are used to ensure system stability. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic optimization model for the joint scheduling of energy and reserves of conventional units and hybrid power stations in insular power systems. The proposed methodology is based, in general, on the recently established regulatory framework for the non-interconnected island systems of Greece. The main scope of the paper is to analyze wind and pumped-storage solutions for the normal operation of saturated insular power systems. In this context, the introduction of hypothetical hybrid power stations in a real-life system, the insular power system of Crete, Greece is examined. Test results are analytically presented and thoroughly discussed.

Abstract: Accurate control of deferrable electrical loads results in an aggregate load profile more desirable to the system operator. This in turn could lead to reduced peak consumption of power, less ramping of generators and lower emissions of greenhouse gases. In this paper, we describe an algorithm which automatically schedules deferrable loads. The scheduling is carried out by a greedy algorithm which attempts to reduce the error between the scheduled load profile and a predefined "target" load profile. We develop scheduling algorithms for two scenarios: a notified system where load demands are known in advance and a stochastic system, where load demands are random. The algorithms rely on appropriate approximation methods and are evaluated in a dataset collected from a large number of households. We show the algorithms can be used for reducing peak consumption and describe a correspondence between deferrability and storage devices.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method of describing the load shifting ability of flexible electrical loads in a manner suitable for existing power system dispatch frameworks. The concept of an asymmetric block offer for flexible loads is introduced. This offer structure describes the ability of a flexible load to provide a response to the power system and the subsequent need to recover. The conventional system dispatch algorithm is altered to facilitate the dispatch of demand response units alongside generating units using the proposed offer structure. The value of demand response is assessed through case studies that dispatch flexible supermarket refrigeration loads for the provision of regulating power. The demand resource is described by a set of asymmetric blocks, and a set of four blocks offers is shown to offer cost savings for the procurement of regulating power in excess of 20%. For comparative purposes, the cost savings achievable with a fully observable and controllable demand response resource are evaluated, using a time series model of the refrigeration loads. The fully modeled resource offers greater savings; however the difference is small and potentially insufficient to justify the investment required to fully model and control individual flexible loads.

Abstract: This paper presents a generalized energy storage system model for voltage and angle stability analysis. The proposed solution allows modeling most common energy storage technologies through a given set of linear differential algebraic equations (DAEs). In particular, the paper considers, but is not limited to, compressed air, superconducting magnetic, electrochemical capacitor and battery energy storage devices. While able to cope with a variety of different technologies, the proposed generalized model proves to be accurate for angle and voltage stability analysis, as it includes a balanced, fundamental-frequency model of the voltage source converter (VSC) and the dynamics of the dc link. Regulators with inclusion of hard limits are also taken into account. The transient behavior of the generalized model is compared with detailed fundamental-frequency balanced models as well as commonly-used simplified models of energy storage devices. A comprehensive case study based on the WSCC 9-bus test system is presented and discussed.

Abstract: The transition to a deregulated electric power system industry has created a highly competitive electricity market with immense power transfer activity performed between the market participants. A poorly-damped oscillation of small-signal instability is usually imminent during a stress power system condition attributed by the base case power transfer or available transfer capability (ATC) compounded with an outage of critical line. The contingency ranking by means of lowest damping ratio is introduced so that execution of the most critical line outage will incite to a poorly-damped oscillation during the base case ATC. The rescheduling of few critical generators determined by using the normalized participation factor is presented in this paper as a novel, non-intricate and cost-effective solution for estimating a new value of ATC while ensuring a secure power system operating condition. Sturdiness of the proposed method is verified through comparison with the weighted-average sensitivity of stability index required for rescheduling the critical generators performed in a case study of 39-bus New England system. Comparative study on the results of cost minimization in generators rescheduling has also been done based on the critical generators selected by the two methods.

Abstract: The growth of demand response programs and renewable generation is changing the economics of transmission. Planners and regulators require tools to address the implications of possible technology, policy, and economic developments for the optimal configuration of transmission grids. We propose a model for economic evaluation and optimization of inter-regional transmission expansion, as well as the optimal response of generators' investments to locational incentives, that accounts for Kirchhoff's laws and three important nonlinearities. The first is consumer response to energy prices, modeled using elastic demand functions. The second is resistance losses. The third is the product of line susceptance and flows in the linearized DC load flow model. We develop a practical method combining Successive Linear Programming with Gauss-Seidel iteration to co-optimize AC and DC transmission and generation capacities in a linearized DC network while considering hundreds of hourly realizations of renewable supply and load. We test our approach for a European electricity market model including 33 countries. The examples indicate that demand response can be a valuable resource that can significantly affect the economics, location, and amounts of transmission and generation investments. Further, representing losses and Kirchhoff's laws is also important in transmission policy analyses.

Abstract: Small isolated power systems often experience generator outages, which are responsible for the activation of the under-frequency load shedding scheme with the corresponding negative impact on electricity consumers and, hence, market loss. There are three main causes of this problem: the power system's low inertia, the speed governors' low capacity, and a poor size-ratio between generator and system. The most extensive research line in this area is focused on the optimization of the load shedding scheme, which is a partial solution. Another research line is presented to solve the problem from the point of view of the system operator. This paper proposes an online method to predict and correct possible load shedding by redistributing load dispatching. This proposal uses artificial intelligence techniques, in particular neural networks, and a special-purpose power system simulator. In order to evaluate the proposal, the achieved solution is applied to a real case study: the island of Gran Canaria. This application shows the improvement that might be achieved by implementing this simple method. The method proposed in this paper is strongly recommended for regions that have suitable geographical sites as well as energy problems similar to those of the Canary Islands (see tech. rep. "Map of the Canary Islands Power Systems" by Red Electrica de Espana).

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a strengthened MILP formulation for certain gas turbine unit commitment problems, in which the ramping rates are no smaller than the minimum generation amounts. This type of gas turbines can usually start-up faster and have a larger ramping rate, as compared to the traditional coalfired power plants. Recently, the number of this type of gas turbines increases significantly due to affordable gas prices and their scheduling flexibilities to accommodate intermittent renewable energy generation. In this study, several new families of strong valid inequalities are developed to help reduce the computational time to solve these types of problems. Meanwhile, the validity and facet-defining proofs are provided for certain inequalities. Finally, numerical experiments on a modified IEEE 118-bus system and the power system data based on recent studies verify the effectiveness of applying our formulation to model and solve this type of gas turbine unit commitment problems, including reducing the computational time to obtain an optimal solution or obtaining a much smaller optimality gap, as compared to the default CPLEX, when the time limit is reached with no optimal solutions obtained.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of wind farms causes volatile bus net injections. Although these fluctuations are anticipated, their timing, magnitude and duration cannot be predicted accurately. In order to maintain the operational reliability of the system, this uncertainty must be adequately addressed at the day-ahead generation scheduling stage. The ad-hoc reserve rules incorporated in deterministic unit commitment formulations do not adequately account for this uncertainty. Scenario-based stochastic unit commitment formulations model this uncertainty more precisely, but require computationally demanding simulations. Interval and robust optimization techniques require less computing resources, but produce overly conservative and thus expensive generation schedules. This paper proposes a transmission-constrained unit commitment formulation that improves the performance of the interval unit commitment. The uncertainty is modeled using upper and lower bounds, as in the interval formulation, but inter-hour ramp requirements are based on net load scenarios. This improved interval formulation has been tested using the IEEE RTS-96 and compared with existing stochastic, interval and robust unit commitment techniques in terms of solution robustness and cost. These results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing interval technique both in terms of cost and computing time.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of shortage of ramping resources in the real-time operation of power systems. To explain and remedy this problem systematically, in this paper we take a novel look at the way the day-ahead unit commitment (UC) problem represents the information about load, generation and ramping constraints. We specifically investigate the approximation error made in mapping of the original problem, that would decide the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories of the committed generating units, onto the discrete-time problem that is solved in practice. We first show that current practice amounts to approximating the trajectories with linear splines. We then offer a different representation through cubic splines that provides physically feasible schedules and increases the accuracy of the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories by capturing sub-hourly variations and ramping of load in the day-ahead power system operation. The corresponding day-ahead UC model is formulated as an instance of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), with the same number of binary variables as the traditional UC formulation. Numerical simulation over real load data from the California ISO demonstrate that the proposed UC model reduces the total day-ahead and real-time operation cost, and the number of events of ramping scarcity in the real-time operations.

Abstract: This paper deals with the distribution network reconfiguration problem in a multi-objective scope, aiming to determine the optimal radial configuration by means of minimizing the active power losses and a set of commonly used reliability indices formulated with reference to the number of customers. The indices are developed in a way consistent with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. A key contribution of the paper is the efficient implementation of the epsilon-constraint method using lexicographic optimization in order to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. After the Pareto efficient solution set is generated, the resulting configurations are evaluated using a backward/forward sweep load-flow algorithm to verify that the solutions obtained are both non-dominated and feasible. Since the epsilon-constraint method generates the Pareto front but does not incorporate decision maker (DM) preferences, a multi-attribute decision making procedure, namely, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, is used in order to rank the obtained solutions according to the DM preferences, facilitating the final selection. The applicability of the proposed method is assessed on a classical test system and on a practical distribution system.

Abstract: This paper investigates load frequency control (LFC) of power systems with probabilistic interval delays. The LFC design specifically takes the probability distribution characteristic of the communication delays into account. Firstly, by considering the probability distribution characteristic of the communication delays in the modeling, the original power systems with a PI-based LFC are transformed into a stochastic closed-loop time-delay system. Secondly, by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, sufficient delay-distribution-dependent stability and stabilization criteria are derived for the power systems with a PI-based LFC. Following this, an algorithm is provided to obtain the gain of PI-based LFC and the allowable upper bound of the communication delay simultaneously while preserving the desired performance. Finally, a case study is applied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed delay-distribution-dependent PI-based LFC design method.

Abstract: This paper formulates an optimality criterion for the selection of synchrophasor signals to be used in ambient mode estimators. This criterion, which is associated with each measured signal and each dominant mode, is defined as the asymptotic variance of the corresponding estimated mode damping ratio. The value of the criterion is computed directly from an estimated autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. Because the online computation of the defined criterion (for each measured signal in the system) may be computationally expensive, a fast pre-selection method for initial signal ranking is formulated. The pre-selection method is used to effectively determine a set of the candidate signals for which the formal criterion is evaluated in a second stage. The methodology is illustrated using synthetic measurements from the KTH Nordic 32 and the IEEE 39-bus test systems.

Abstract: This paper discusses methods for estimation of area's frequency response characteristic (AFRC) during large frequency changes. The operating point changes significantly during such transient events; consequently the estimation method should adapt to the time-varying nature of the AFRC. Moreover, available measurements have a poor time resolution and are considerably contaminated by errors. Therefore, new estimation methods are proposed that are based on local correlation between the frequency deviation and interchange power variation measured on all area's tie-lines. The presented estimation methods were compared with a classical approach that is based on the ratio of mean changes as well as with conventional least squares parameter estimators. Extensive numerical simulations and field measurements were applied for performance evaluation, where the obtained results show robust and satisfactorily accurate responses of the proposed estimation methods.

Abstract: This letter presents an unambiguous distance-based mixed-integer quadratic programming (UDB-MIQP) model to solve economic dispatch problems with disjoint operating zones. By considering the distances among the prohibited zones, the unnecessary variables will be eliminated and, consequently, a significant decrease, both in terms of variables and constraints, is obtained. The results show that the UDB model compared to existing MIQP models in the literature can achieve the global optimal solution with a significantly reduced problem complexity, both in terms of variables and constraints. In addition, the results indicate the superiority of the method in computational time reduction.

Abstract: In Part I of this tutorial, we provided a canonical modeling framework for sequential, stochastic optimization (control) problems. A major feature of this framework is a clear separation of the process of modeling a problem, versus the design of policies to solve the problem. In Part II, we provide additional discussion behind some of the more subtle concepts such as the construction of a state variable. We illustrate the modeling process using an energy storage problem. We then create five variations of this problem designed to bring out the features of the different policies. The first four of these problems demonstrate that each of the four classes of policies is best for particular problem characteristics. The fifth policy is a hybrid that illustrates the ability to combine the strengths of multiple policy classes.

Abstract: There is a wide range of problems in energy systems that require making decisions in the presence of different forms of uncertainty. The fields that address sequential, stochastic decision problems lack a standard canonical modeling framework, with fragmented, competing solution strategies. Recognizing that we will never agree on a single notational system, this two-part tutorial proposes a simple, straightforward canonical model (that is most familiar to people with a control theory background), and introduces four fundamental classes of policies which integrate the competing strategies that have been proposed under names such as control theory, dynamic programming, stochastic programming and robust optimization. Part II of the tutorial illustrates the modeling framework using a simple energy storage problem, where we show that, depending on the problem characteristics, each of the four classes of policies may be best.

Abstract: Non-local measurements from wide area measurement systems can be used to synthesize feedback signals for FACTS or HVDC based power oscillation damping controllers. Although non-local feedback signals may have better damping influence than local feedback signals, they involve greater complexity and reduced robustness due to the possibility of partial or complete loss of communication. A composite control strategy is proposed in this paper, which uses both local and non-local feedback channels to achieve enhanced damping and improved robustness. Special local signals and their non-local equivalents are identified for series reactive and shunt real power injection devices, which facilitate the design of controllers with a simple structure and fewer parameters. Unlike modal speed signals, synthesis of these signals does not require an online eigen-solution. Case studies are presented which demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of this strategy.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates a number of uncertainty importance measures for use in power system stability studies. Sensitivity analysis of uncertain system parameters is vital as new technologies proliferate and the total level of system uncertainty grows. Accurate assessment of the importance of different uncertainties can guide power system operators towards parameters which will require the greatest levels of mitigation or increased monitoring in order to reduce the uncertainty and its subsequent impact. Local and global sensitivity analysis techniques are described and evaluated within this paper, including nonparametric methods, variance-based approaches, and distribution-based techniques. The techniques are illustrated using a large 295-bus realistic network model of a generic distribution system. Numerical experiments on dynamic models are used in order to assess the impact of uncertainties on the mitigation of system frequency excursions using single-site and distributed energy storage devices.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to efficiently estimate the probability of small-disturbance rotor angle instability of uncertain power systems. Traditional Monte Carlo (MC) approaches are computationally intensive and inefficient, particularly when used to study low probability conditions which result in small disturbance instabilities and develop into serious outage events high impact. The proposed methodology uses importance sampling to focus on conditions which contain the high information content required to make relevant decisions about low probability events. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is used to efficiently bound the search space and identify operating conditions leading to a marginally stable or unstable system response. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a model of a multi-area transmission network with a significant capacity of intermittent generation connected through a multi-terminal voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) grid. It is demonstrated that the methodology yields accurate results with just a small fraction of the sample points required using a conventional numerical MC approach.

Abstract: This paper studies the general problem of operating energy storage under uncertainty. Two fundamental sources of uncertainty are considered, namely the uncertainty in the unexpected fluctuation of the net demand process and the uncertainty in the locational marginal prices. We propose a very simple algorithm termed Online Modified Greedy (OMG) algorithm for this problem. A stylized analysis for the algorithm is performed, which shows that comparing to the optimal cost of the corresponding stochastic control problem, the sub-optimality of OMG is controlled by an easily computable bound. This suggests that, albeit simple, OMG is guaranteed to have good performance in cases when the bound is small. Meanwhile, OMG together with the sub-optimality bound can be used to provide a lower bound for the optimal cost. Such a lower bound can be valuable in evaluating other heuristic algorithms. For the latter cases, a semidefinite program is derived to minimize the sub-optimality bound of OMG. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the use of the algorithm.

Abstract: The restoration of the bulk power system after a partial or complete blackout relies on black-start (BS) resources. To prepare for system restoration, it is important to procure the right amount of BS resources at the right locations in the grid so that the total restoration time can be minimized. Achieving this goal requires that resource procurement planning takes the restoration process into account. In this study, we integrate the BS resource procurement decision with a restoration planning model and develop an optimization model that produces a minimal cost procurement plan that satisfies the restoration time requirement.

Abstract: The restructuring of electric power industry has brought in plenty of challenges for transmission expansion planning (TEP), mainly due to uncertainties. The commonly used probabilistic TEP approach requires the network to meet an acceptable risk criterion. However, a series of blackouts in recent years caused by extreme weather-related events have raised the concerns about network vulnerability through calculating the expected risk value. In this paper, we have proposed the concept that TEP should be economically adjusted in order to make network less vulnerable to extreme events (EEs) caused by climate change, e.g., floods or ice storms. We firstly give the explicit definitions of economic adjustment (EA) index and adjusted risk value. Then we formulate our model as a risk-based decision making process while satisfying the deterministic criterion. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system. Results based on various risk aversion levels are given and comparison studies with other risk-based TEP approaches have been done. Also, sensitivity analysis of parameter setting has been conducted. According to the numerical results, the proposed risk-based TEP model is a flexible decision-making tool, which can help decision makers make a tradeoff between economy and security.

Abstract: In a carbon-constrained world, the continuing and rapid growth of gas-fired power generation (GPG) will lead to the increasing demand for natural gas. The reliable and affordable gas supply hence becomes an important factor to consider in power system planning. Meanwhile, the installation of GPG units should take into account not only the fuel supply constraints but also the capability of sending out the generated power. In this paper, a novel expansion co-planning (ECP) model is proposed, aiming to minimize the overall capital and operational costs for the coupled gas and power systems. Moreover, linear formulations are introduced to deal with the nonlinear nature of the objective functions and constraints. Furthermore, the physical and economic interactions between the two systems are simulated by an iterative process. The proposed linear co-planning approach is tested on a simple six-bus power system with a seven-node gas system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system with a 14-node gas system. Numerical results have demonstrated that our co-planning approach can allow systematic investigations on supporting cost-effective operating and planning decisions for power systems.

Abstract: High penetrations of domestic electric vehicles (EVs) in U.K. low voltage (LV) networks may result in significant technical problems. This paper proposes an implementable, centralized control algorithm, currently being trialed in 9 U.K. residential LV networks, that uses limited information to manage EV charging points to mitigate these technical problems. Two real U.K. LV networks are used to quantify the potential impacts of different EV penetration levels and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control algorithm (using different control cycles) for simultaneous thermal and voltage management. Monte Carlo simulations (adopting 1-min resolution data) are undertaken to cater for domestic and EV demand uncertainties. Results for these LV networks show that problems may occur for EV penetrations higher than 20%. More importantly, they highlight that even for a 100% penetration and control cycles of up to 10 min, the control algorithm successfully mitigates problems on the examined LV networks. Crucially, to determine effects on the comfort of EV users, a metric is introduced and discussed. The results of different control settings are presented to analyze potential adaptations of the control strategy. Finally, a comparison with an optimization framework highlights that the proposed algorithm is as effective while using limited information.

Abstract: This paper applies a new technique for modal decomposition based solely on measurements to test systems and demonstrates the technique's capability for partitioning a power network, which determines the points of separation in an is landing strategy. The mathematical technique is called the Koopman mode analysis (KMA) and stems from a spectral analysis of the so-called Koopman operator. Here, KMA is numerically approximated by applying an Arnoldi-like algorithm recently first applied to power system dynamics. In this paper we propose a practical data-driven algorithm incorporating KMA for network partitioning. Comparisons are made with two techniques previously applied for the network partitioning: spectral graph theory which is based on the eigenstructure of the graph Laplacian, and slow-coherency which identifies coherent groups of generators for a specified number of low-frequency modes. The partitioning results share common features with results obtained with graph theory and slow-coherency-based techniques. The suggested partitioning method is evaluated with two test systems, and similarities between Koopman modes and Laplacian eigenvectors are showed numerically and elaborated theoretically.

Abstract: This paper investigates the interconnection of current-source converters (CSCs) to a very weak grid using the conventional vector control in the rotating reference frame. It is shown that the system stability is degraded under weak-grid conditions due to the implementation of the synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (PLL). Supplementary controllers are proposed and integrated to the outermost control loops of the CSC to alleviate the associated negative impacts of the PLL. The proposed compensators do not alter the dynamic characteristics of the conventional vector control. More importantly, they enable the CSC to inject 1.0 per-unit of active power at a unity short-circuit ratio. Small-signal stability analysis and controllers design procedures are presented in details. The design of the proposed compensators is independent of the conventional vector control and hence no extensive coordination and parameters tuning are needed. Time-domain simulations results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

Abstract: We consider an energy management system that controls a cluster of price-responsive demands. Besides these demands, it also manages a wind-power plant and an energy storage facility. Demands, wind-power plant, and energy storage facility are interconnected within a small size electric energy system equipped with smart grid technology and constitute a virtual power plant that can strategically buy and sell energy in both the day-ahead and the real-time markets. To this end, we propose a two-stage procedure based on robust optimization. In the first stage, the bidding strategy in the day-ahead market is decided. In the second stage, and once the actual scheduling in the day-ahead market is known, we decide the bidding strategy in the real-time market for each hour of the day. We consider that the virtual power plant behaves as a price taker in these markets. Robust optimization is used to deal with uncertainties in wind-power production and market prices, which are represented through confidence bounds. Results of a realistic case study are provided to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a general framework for determining the effect of communication delays on the convergence of certain distributed frequency regulation (DFR) protocols for prosumer-based energy systems, where prosumers are serving as balancing areas. DFR relies on iterative and distributed optimization algorithms to obtain an optimal feedback law for frequency regulation. But, it is, in general, hard to know beforehand how many iterations suffice to ensure stability. This paper develops a framework to determine a lower bound on the number of iterations required for two distributed optimization protocols. This allows prosumers to determine whether they can compute stabilizing control strategies within an acceptable time frame by taking communication delays into account. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated on two realistic power systems.

Abstract: The Holomorphic Embedding Load-Flow Method (HELM) solves the power-flow problem to obtain the bus voltages as rational approximants, that is, a ratio of complex-valued polynomials of the embedding parameter. The proof of its claims (namely that: 1) it is guaranteed to find a solution if it exists; 2) it is guaranteed to find only a high-voltage (operable) solution; and 3) that it unequivocally signals if no solution exists) are rooted in complex analysis and the theory developed by Antonio Trias and Herbert Stahl. HELM is one variant of the holomorphic embedding method (HEM) for solving nonlinear equations, the details of which may differ from those available in its published patents. In this paper we show that the HEM represents a distinct class of nonlinear equation solvers that are recursive, rather than iterative. As such, for any given problem, there are an infinite number of HEM formulations, each with different numerical properties and precision demands. The objective of this paper is to provide an intuitive understanding of HEM and apply one variant to the power-flow problem. We introduce one possible PV bus model compatible with the HEM and examine some features of different holomorphic embeddings, giving step-by-step details of model building, germ calculation, and the recursive algorithm.

Abstract: Frequency-scan approaches for conducting Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction (SSCI) studies of wind farms is becoming a normal practice in the industry. Modern power electronics control used in many wind generators has a characteristic that couples two frequency components, similar to saliency effects of conventional generators. As a consequence, treating both wind farm and grid as single-dimension impedances could generate an inaccurate result. This paper describes a two-dimension transfer function approach that can be practically applied to ensure accuracy when evaluating SSCI aspects of power-electronic equipment such as renewable generation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic power flow analysis technique based on the stochastic response surface method. The probability distributions and statistics of power flow responses can be accurately and efficiently estimated by the proposed method without using series expansions such as the Gram-Charlier, Cornish-Fisher, or Edgeworth series. The stochastic continuous input variables following normal distributions such as loads or non-normal distributions such as photovoltaic generation and wind power and their multiple correlations can be easily modeled. The correctness, effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparing the probabilistic power flow analysis results of the IEEE 14-bus and 57-bus standard test systems obtained from the proposed method, the point estimate method, and the Monte Carlo simulation method.

Abstract: The adoption of residential-scale low carbon technologies, such as photovoltaic panels or electric vehicles, is expected to significantly increase in the near future. Therefore, it is important for distribution network operators (DNOs) to understand the impacts that these technologies may have, particularly, on low voltage (LV) networks. The challenge, however, is that these LV networks are large in number and diverse in characteristics. In this work, four clustering algorithms (hierarchical clustering, k-++, improved k-++, and Gaussian Mixture Model-GMM), are applied to a set of 232 residential LV feeders from the North West of England to obtain representative feeders. Moreover, time-series monitoring data, presence of residential-scale generation, and detailed customer classification are considered in the analysis. Multiple validity indices are used to identify the most suitable algorithm. The improved k-++ and GMM showed the best performances resulting in eleven representative feeders with prominent characteristics such as number and type of customers, total cable length, neutral current, and presence of generation. Crucially, the results from studies performed on these feeders can then be extrapolated to those they represent, simplifying the analyses to be carried out by DNOs. This is demonstrated with a hosting capacity assessment of photovoltaic panels in LV feeders.

Abstract: This paper proposes a quasi-steady-state modeling approach for an approximation of long-term frequency dynamics in power systems. A specific phenomenon of concern is an onset of frequency swings during load/generation imbalance scenarios. The effects of system voltage characteristics, system inertia, and, more importantly, damping controllers are explained and quantified using the described quasi-steady-state models. Application of the methodology to a 14-generator benchmark system demonstrates that described models are suitable for simulation of different disturbance scenarios that can trigger frequency instability. Moreover, linearization of the proposed models can provide convenient means for impact assessment and coordinated design of damping controllers. To demonstrate this, coordinated tuning of multiband power system stabilizers to improve frequency dynamics has been performed and validated through nonlinear simulations using a commercial transient stability software.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to optimally set the reactive power contributions of distributed energy resources (DERs) present in distribution systems with the goal of regulating bus voltages. For the case when the network is balanced, we use the branch power flow modeling approach for radial power systems to formulate an optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Then, we leverage properties of the system operating conditions to relax certain nonlinear terms of this OPF, which results in a convex quadratic program (QP). To efficiently solve this QP, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we include the unbalanced three-phase formulation to extend the ideas introduced for the balanced network case. We present several case studies to demonstrate the method in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to optimally set the tap position of voltage regulation transformers in distribution systems. We cast the problem as a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP), in which the transformer tap ratios are captured by 1) introducing a secondary-side "virtual" bus per transformer, and 2) constraining the values that these virtual bus voltages can take according to the limits on the tap positions. Then, by relaxing the non-convex rank-1 constraint in the rank-constrained SDP formulation, one obtains a convex SDP problem. The tap positions are determined as the ratio between the primary-side bus voltage and the secondary-side virtual bus voltage that result from the optimal solution of the relaxed SDP, and then rounded to the nearest discrete tap values. To efficiently solve the relaxed SDP, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We present several case studies with single- and three-phase distribution systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed ADMM-based algorithm, and compare its results with centralized solution methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to solve the restoration problem in balanced radial distribution systems. The restoration problem, originally modeled as mixed integer nonlinear programming, is transformed into a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem, which can be solved efficiently using several commercial solvers based on the efficient optimization technique family branch and bound. The proposed mathematical model considers several objectives in a single objective function, using parameters to preserve the hierarchy of the different objectives: 1) maximizing the satisfaction of the demand, 2) minimizing the number of switch operations, 3) prioritizing the automatic switch operation rather than a manual one, and 4) prioritizing especial loads. General and specialized tests were carried out on a 53-node test system, and the results were compared with other previously proposed algorithms. Results show that the mathematical model is robust, efficient, flexible, and presents excellent performance in finding optimal solutions.

Abstract: With increasing wind penetration levels on power systems worldwide, conventional thermal plant, along with the ancillary services they provide are being displaced. To address this issue, modern variable speed wind turbines can offer a short-term controlled response to temporary power imbalances, by harnessing their stored rotational energy, a so called emulated, or synthetic, inertial response. However, unlike conventional frequency response services, the emulated inertial response is dependent on the wind turbine operating condition and provides a response which is distinct to that from synchronously connected plant. While much research has investigated the harnessing of such a response from wind turbines and its effect on system frequency, this paper investigates potential issues associated with the system-wide integration of the technology at scale. The ability for wind generation to provide frequency support through emulated inertia is assessed, as well as the potential for tuning such a distributed response resource to ensure timely and effective frequency recovery under different system conditions. It is shown that the frequency response capability of future systems and the operating protocols for system participants, including wind generation, will require development if emulated inertia technology is adopted at scale.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fuzzy logic controlled bridge type fault current limiter (FCL) to enhance the transient stability of multi-machine power systems. The transient stability performance of the fuzzy logic controlled bridge type FCL is compared with that of another static nonlinear controlled bridge type FCL. The total kinetic energy (TKE) of the generators in the system is used to determine the transient stability enhancement index. Also, the critical clearing time has been presented as a stability limit. Instead of conventional reclosing, the optimal reclosing of circuit breakers is considered. Simulations are performed by using the Matlab/Simulink software. Simulation results of both permanent and temporary faults at different points of the IEEE 30-bus power system indicate that the fuzzy logic controlled bridge type FCL can enhance the transient stability of the system well. Also, the performance of the proposed fuzzy logic controller is better than that of the static nonlinear controller.

Abstract: Traditionally, electric system operators have dispatched generation to minimize total production costs, ignoring the flexibility of the transmission system. Implementation of smart-grid systems could allow operators to co-optimize flexible transmission alongside generation dispatch; the technologies that would enable such co-optimization are still regulated as part of the monopoly transmission system. One particular flexible transmission asset is variable impedance flexible AC transmission system (FACTS). This paper 1) points out the positive externality problem existing in a recent market design proposal with active transmission participation, and 2) proposes a sensitivity-based method to estimate the marginal market value of FACTS adjustments to overcome this positive externality problem. The marginal value would suggest efficient impedance adjustments to the operator and provide the right financial incentives for the FACTS owners to operate their assets in a socially optimal way. Revenue adequacy is demonstrated under specific conditions and more broadly investigated through simulation studies. An analytical example on a two-bus system as well as a numerical study on the IEEE 118-bus system are presented. The results suggest that inclusion of a price signal for FACTS devices would lead to significant social welfare improvements in competitive power markets.

Abstract: Reserve requirements serve as a proxy for N-1 reliability in the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, there is no guarantee that the reserve is deliverable for all scenarios (post-contingency states). One cheap way to improve reserve deliverability is to harness the flexibility of the transmission network. Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices are able to significantly improve the transfer capability. However, FACTS utilization is limited today due to the complexities these devices introduce to the DC optimal power flow problem (DCOPF). With a linear objective, the traditional DCOPF is a linear program (LP); when variable impedance based FACTS devices are taken into consideration, the problem becomes a nonlinear program (NLP). A reformulation of the NLP to a mixed integer linear program, for day-ahead corrective operation of FACTS devices, is presented in this paper. Engineering insight is then introduced to further reduce the complexity to an LP. Although optimality is not guaranteed, the simulation studies on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the method finds the globally optimal solution in 98.8% of the cases. Even when the method did not find the optimal solution, it was able to converge to a near-optimal solution, which substantially improved the reliability, very quickly.

Abstract: Transmission systems are under stress and need to be upgraded. Better utilization of the existing grid provides a fast and cheap alternative to building new transmission. One way to improve the utilization of the transmission network is power flow control via flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. While FACTS devices are used today, the utilization of these devices is limited; traditional dispatch models (e.g., security constrained economic dispatch) assume a fixed, static transmission grid even though it is rather flexible. The primary barrier is the complexity that is added to the power flow problem. The mathematical representation of the DC optimal power flow, with the added modeling of FACTS devices, is a nonlinear program (NLP). This paper presents a method to convert this NLP into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The MILP is reformulated as a two-stage linear program, which enforces the same sign for the voltage angle differences for the lines equipped with FACTS. While this approximation does not guarantee optimality, more than 98% of the presented empirical results, based on the IEEE 118-bus and Polish systems, achieved global optimality. In the case of suboptimal solutions, the savings were still significant and the solution time was dramatically reduced.

Abstract: Transmission switching (TS) has shown to be an effective power flow control tool. TS can reduce the system cost, improve system reliability, and enhance the management of intermittent renewable resources. This letter addresses the state-of-the-art problem of TS by developing an AC-based real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) package with TS. The package is tested on real power system data, taken from energy management systems of PJM, TVA, and ERCOT. The results show that post-contingency corrective switching is a ready to be implemented transformational technology that provides substantial reliability gains. The computational time and the performance of the developed RTCA package, reported in this letter, are promising.

Abstract: Active management strategies such as coordinated on load tap changer (OLTC) voltage control and reactive power compensation (RPC) are frequently suggested for voltage regulation in a distribution system with a high level of distributed generation (DG). This paper proposes a control and coordination algorithm for these two active management strategies. Voltage control through OLTC is achieved by using state estimation (SE) to determine the voltage in the network. To lower the implementation cost of the proposed control strategy, pseudo-measurements are used together with real-time measurement data in the SE. Moreover, the deadband of the automatic voltage control (AVC) relay is relaxed so that the AVC relay acts on the network's maximum or minimum voltage obtained through the SE. This is found to be simpler to realize than adjusting the set point of the AVC relay. Voltage control through RPC is actualized by using integral controllers implemented locally at the wind turbine site. Furthermore, RPC from the local wind turbine is also used to mitigate an overvoltage at a remote bus on the same feeder when the remote wind turbine reaches its regulation limit. The applicability of the proposed voltage regulation algorithm is successfully demonstrated using a case study system.

Abstract: Energy theft is a notorious problem in electric power systems, which causes great economic losses and threatens the reliability of the power grid. Recently, the Smart Grid has been proposed as the next-generation power system to modernize the current grid and improve its efficiency, sustainability, and security. Key technologies of the Smart Grid include smart meters, which allow system operators to collect real-time power consumption data from users, and microgrids, which allow users to own and control renewable resources. However, the Smart Grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks, thus making stealing energy much easier in it. Most existing energy theft detection schemes require the collection of real-time power consumption data from users, i.e., users' load profiles, which violates their privacy. In this paper, we first propose a centralized energy theft detection algorithm utilizing the Kalman filter, called SEK. It can efficiently identify the energy thieves but cannot protect users' privacy. Then, based on SEK, we develop a privacy-preserving energy theft detection algorithm called PPBE, which privately finds the energy thieves by decomposing the Kalman filter into two parallel and loosely coupled filters. Finally, we conduct thorough privacy analysis and extensive simulations to validate our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: This paper takes advantage of wide-area measurements to propose a centralized nonlinear controller that acts on power system stabilizers (PSSs), to cooperatively increase the damping of problematic small-signal oscillations all over the system. Details are given to utilize existing stabilizers while causing minimum changes to the equipment and warranting improvement, or at least no detriment, of current system behavior. A set of gains is designed by linear state feedback control to respond to representative system conditions, and these are coordinated with an equal number of decision trees in charge of scheduling by switching. The resulting nonlinear controller is implemented on a model that resembles the characteristics of the Central American System, exemplifying its feasibility to be applied in large systems. The effect of time delay in the control loop is assessed, and the limits for tolerance to latency in this application are determined.

Abstract: A more realistic management of electric vehicle (EV) charging points requires to cope with stochastic behavior on vehicle staying patterns. This paper presents a stochastic programming model to achieve optimal management taking into account price variation in day-ahead and intraday electricity markets, together with regulating reserve margins. In this model, first-stage decisions determine day-ahead energy purchases and sales and the upward and downward reserve margins committed. Second-stage decisions correspond to intraday markets and deal with reserve requirements and several possible scenarios for vehicle staying pattern. The design of the objective function prioritizes supplying energy to EV batteries while minimizing the net expected energy cost at the EV charging point. A case study describing a parking for 50 EVs is analyzed. The case includes household, commercial and mixed EV staying patterns with several intraday arrival and departure scenarios. Pure and hybrid EVs are included, taking into account their respective energy characteristics. Sensitivity analysis is used to show the potential energy cost savings and the impact of different non-supply penalizations. The case study considers several vehicle staying patterns, energy price profiles and discharge allowances. The model achieves energy cost reductions between 1% and 15% depending on the specific case. A model validation by simulation has been done.

Abstract: An aggregator acts as a mediator between the system operator and residential customers, enabling mutually beneficial coordination for electric vehicle (EV) owners and the power system. The aggregator aims to maximize its profits from trading energy and regulation reserve in wholesale markets. Since the aggregator does not own EV batteries, the EV owners must be reimbursed for the degradation of their batteries due to the additional cycling beyond transportation needs. This paper proposes a bidding strategy for the aggregator to maximize its profits from participating in competitive energy and different regulating reserves markets, while compensating EV owners for degradation. The results show that depending on the battery cost, the aggregator splits its resources between the energy and reserves markets. The results also show the system operator attains cost savings, if an aggregator uses EVs to provide services.

Abstract: This paper discusses a recent event in the western American power system when a forced oscillation was observed at a frequency that was close to a well-known 0.38-Hz inter-area electromechanical mode frequency of the western system. The event motivates a systematic investigation in this paper on the possibility of resonant interactions between forced oscillations and electromechanical inter-area oscillatory modes in power systems. When the natural oscillatory mode of a power system is poorly damped, and the forced oscillation occurs at a frequency close to system mode frequency at critical locations for the mode, resonance is observed in simulation test cases of the paper. It is shown that the MW oscillations on tie-lines can be as high as 477 MW from a 10-MW forced oscillation in Kundur test system because of resonance. This paper discusses the underlying system conditions and effects as related to resonance in power systems caused by forced oscillations and discusses ways to detect such scenarios using synchrophasors. Simulated data from Kundur two-area test power system as well as measurement data from western American power system are used to study the effect of forced oscillations in power systems.

Abstract: Recent widespread interest in Convex Hull Pricing has not been accompanied by an equally broad understanding of the method. This paper seeks to narrow the gap between enthusiasm and comprehension. The connection between Convex Hull Pricing and basic electricity market clearing processes is clearly developed, and a new formulation of the pricing problem is presented. From this formulation, several important consequences of the method are derived and discussed. Some counterintuitive properties of Convex Hull Pricing are highlighted and demonstrated with simple examples. It is hoped that this paper will spur additional research on Convex Hull Pricing so that an informed judgment can be made regarding its costs and benefits.

Abstract: The increased level of demand that is associated with the restoration of service after an outage, Cold Load Pick-Up (CLPU), can be significantly higher than pre-outage levels, even exceeding the normal distribution feeder peak demand. These high levels of demand can delay restoration efforts and in extreme cases damage equipment. The negative impacts of CLPU can be mitigated with strategies that restore the feeder in sections, minimizing the load current. The challenge for utilities is to manage the current level on critical equipment while minimizing the time to restore service to all customers. Accurately modeling CLPU events is the first step in developing improved restoration strategies that minimize restoration times. This paper presents a new method for evaluating the magnitude of the CLPU peak, and its duration, using multi-state load models. The use of multi-state load models allows for a more accurate representation of the end-use loads that are present on residential distribution feeders.

Abstract: The penetration of renewable distributed generation (DG) sources has been increased in active distribution networks due to their unique advantages. However, non-dispatchable DGs such as wind turbines raise the risk of distribution networks. Such a problem could be eliminated using the proper application of energy storage units. In this paper, optimal planning of batteries in the distribution grid is presented. The optimal planning determines the location, capacity and power rating of batteries while minimizing the cost objective function subject to technical constraints. The optimal long-term planning is based on the short-term optimal power flow considering the uncertainties. The point estimate method (PEM) is employed for probabilistic optimal power flow. The batteries are scheduled optimally for several purposes to maximize the benefits. A hybrid Tabu search/particle swarm optimization (TS/PSO) algorithm is used to solve the problem. The numerical studies on a 21-node distribution system show the advantages of the proposed methodology. The proposed approach can also be applied to the realistic sized networks when some sensitive nodes are considered as candidate locations for installing the storage units.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for solving the short-term unit commitment and loading problem for a specific hydropower system. Dynamic programming is used to compute maximum power output generated by a power plant. This information is then used as input of a two-phase optimization process. The first phase solves the relaxation of a nonlinear mixed-integer program in order to obtain the water discharge, reservoir volume and number of units working at each period in the planning horizon. The second stage solves a linear integer problem to determine which combination of turbines to use at each period. The goal is to maximize total energy produced over all periods of the planning horizon which consists of a week divided in hourly periods. Start-up of turbines are penalized. Numerical experiments are conducted on thirty different test cases for two Rio Tinto Alcan power plants with five turbines each.

Abstract: The digital Taylor-Fourier transform (DTFT) is used to identify low-frequency electromechanical modes in power systems. The identification process is based on the time-frequency analysis of nonlinear signals that arise after a large disturbance. The DTFT creates a signal decomposition, from which mono-component signals are extracted by spectral analysis using a filter bank. This analysis is accomplished through sliding-window data, which is updated each sample, yielding estimates of the reconstructed signal and providing information of its instantaneous damping and frequency. Results demonstrate the applicability of the proposition.

Abstract: This paper studies a unified steady-state power flow analysis considering electrical, natural gas, and district heating networks all together. The important reason of such a view is the increasing utilization of cogeneration plants which makes a strong coupling between these networks. Another reason is the increasing usage of district heating networks because they have a higher efficiency besides a lower carbon dioxide emission than localized boilers. In this paper, interdependencies of the mentioned infrastructures are considered in detail including a nonlinear part-load efficiency performance for units. An integrated framework based on the Newton-Raphson technique is presented to solve the combined power flow problem and several case studies are utilized to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: An all-electric ship (AES) uses integrated power generators and an energy storage system (ESS) to match its propulsion and service loads, thus forming an isolated microgrid. Existing work has hitherto set the minimisation of the AES operational cost as the single optimisation objective, with the reduction of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission merely treated as a constraint of the optimisation. Moreover, the potential of the ESS as part of the scheduling has not been fully exploited. The work presented in this paper emphasises the environmental concerns and makes GHG mitigation a separate objective, thus expanding the optimisation into multi-objective. In achieving both objectives, the ESS-integrated joint generation - voyage scheduling of the AES is proposed: the generation scheduling is combined with the load management (propulsion load - cruising speed) and the ESS dispatch to optimally operate the diesel generators. The optimisation is formulated using optimal control, and is solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Extensive simulations demonstrate that optimising the cruising speed (voyage) jointly with the generation scheduling results in the reduction of both operational cost and GHG emission, compared to the fixedvoyage generation scheduling. Integrating the ESS dispatch into the generation scheduling further enhances the benefits.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach to test and validate a number of power system dynamic state estimation (PSDSE) algorithms, utilizing Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS), a real-time simulation tool. WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 30-bus systems have been utilized to demonstrate the proposed approach. The test systems are developed on the RSCAD software of the RTDS. The conventional remote terminal unit (RTU) measurements and the phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements are sent from the RTDS runtime environment to the MATLAB based PSDSE application at regular intervals for the estimation of the states, using software-in-the-loop (SIL) configuration. The PSDSE is solved by utilizing the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) approaches, and their relative performances are studied with the help of the simulation results on the two test systems.

Abstract: To diminish damaging consequences of power system major disturbances, under frequency load shedding (UFLS) plans are devised so as to prevent power networks from collapse. Since load shedding scenarios in conventional UFLS plans are specified regardless to voltage stability criteria, they cannot bring desired outcomes at the event of severe and combinational contingencies. In these circumstances, the location of load drops, in addition to their amounts, should be determined as well. This paper presents a two-unit wide-area adaptive load shedding scheme based on synchrophasors. In the first unit, an adaptive precise system frequency response (SFR) model is developed, by the help of which, the appropriate amount of load rejections is determined such that the dynamic and steady state frequency limitations are fulfilled. Incorporation of both static and dynamic loads into the adaptive SFR model results in a negligible error in calculations. Specifying the best location of load drops based on suitable voltage stability criteria is the main task of the second unit. These two units are executed in a parallel way; the computational burden of the proposed approach is thus tractable for real world applications. The new method is successfully testified in the IEEE 39-bus system and Khorasan network.

Abstract: Several transient stability software packages are widely used for power grid planning and operations. Prior research and software documentations have shown that packages can vary in the implementations of dynamic models, and hence could potentially yield different results for the same system simulation. This paper presents a systematic methodology to determine the sources of the discrepancies seen in results obtained from different transient stability packages. This methodology can be applied to various types of dynamic models and is illustrated with generator-associated dynamic models in this paper. Consistent metrics, data mining techniques, and engineering heuristics are used to determine the discrepancy sources. This hybrid top-down+bottom-up method has been implemented on a practical, large-system case to demonstrate its scalability and transferability to real-world system studies.

Abstract: In this paper, a robust approach to the energy storage system (ESS)-based stabilizer is proposed to select its installation location, feedback signals, and damping control loop, and to tune the stabilizer parameters. Based on the linearized model of the power system with ESS and application of damping torque analysis (DTA), the maximum of all minimum damping torque indices (DTIs) under multi-operational conditions is used as the index for selecting ESS installation locations, feedback signals and damping control loops. The operational condition for the minimum DTI provides the condition for tuning the ESS-based stabilizer parameters for robust operation. And a proper compensation angle is selected by a robust method to design the ESS-based stabilizer parameters. The eigenvalue analysis and non-linear simulation results of a four-machine power system and New England ten-machine power system with ESS show that power system oscillations are suppressed effectively and robustly by the ESS-based stabilizer.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) power generation is being decentralized and introduced on various scales in electric power systems that are expanding over wider areas. To understand the effect of PV power generation on these electric power systems (in areas ranging from power generation operation and control to voltage management of the distribution system), areal solar irradiance must be estimated for a target area, particularly, for the position and surface area that correspond to the PV power generation equipment location. By applying spatiotemporal kriging and covariance analysis to observed solar irradiance time series (obtained from sparsely distributed solar irradiance meters), we developed a technique that determines areal solar irradiance for an arbitrary location and surface area to estimate its surficial distribution. The weather conditions under which the spatiotemporal kriging technique can be applied were clarified using solar irradiance and meteorological observations during a one-year period at 25 observation points in the Kansai area.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved mixed-integer model for the thermal unit commitment problem. By introducing new variables for the temperature of each thermal unit, the off-time-dependent start-up costs are modeled accurately and with a lower integrality gap than state-of-the-art formulations. This new approach significantly improves computational efficiency compared to existing formulations, even if they only model a rough approximation of the start-up costs. Our findings were validated on real-world test cases using CPLEX.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized algorithm for real-time control of oscillatory dynamics in power systems. The algorithm integrates dynamic state estimation (DSE) with an extended linear quadratic regulator (ELQR) for optimal control. The control for one generation unit only requires measurements and parameters for that unit, and hence the control at a unit remains completely independent of other units. The control gains are updated in real-time, therefore the control scheme remains valid for any operating condition. The applicability of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated on a representative power system model.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer linear optimization problem for unit commitment and economic dispatch of power generators in a meshed isolated power system. The optimization problem is referred to as the optimal reserve planning problem (ORPP). The ORPP guarantees that the system frequency is kept above a predefined limit in the event of a contingency. The minimum frequency constraints are formulated using novel sufficient conditions that take into account the system inertia and the dynamics of the power generators. The proposed sufficient conditions are attractive from both a computational and a modelling point of view. We compare the ORPP to a unit commitment problem that only considers the stationary behavior of the frequency. Simulations based on a Faroe Islands case study show that, without being overly conservative, potential blackouts and power outages can be avoided using the ORPP. In the particular case study, the cost increase associated with the additional security provided by the ORPP is less than 3%.

Abstract: The modeling of cascading failure in power systems is difficult because of the many different mechanisms involved; no single model captures all of these mechanisms. Understanding the relative importance of these different mechanisms is important for choosing which mechanisms need to be modeled for particular applications. This work presents a dynamic simulation model of both power networks and protection systems, which can simulate a wider variety of cascading outage mechanisms relative to existing quasi-steady-state (QSS) models. This paper describes the model and demonstrates how different mechanisms interact. In order to test the model, we simulated a batch of randomly selected contingencies for several different static load configurations, and found that the distributions of blackout sizes and event lengths from the simulator correlate well with historical trends. The results also show that load models have significant impacts on the cascading risks. Finally, the dynamic model was compared against a simple dc-power-flow based QSS model; we find that the two models tend to agree for the early stages of cascading but produce substantially different results for later stages.

Abstract: The extensive usage of open communication networks in power system control causes inevitable time delays. This paper studies impacts of such delays on the stability of one-area and two-area load frequency control (LFC) systems and proposes an analytical method to determine delay margins, the upper bound on the delay for stability. The proposed method first eliminates transcendental terms in characteristic equation of LFC systems without making any approximation and transforms the transcendental characteristic equation into a regular polynomial. The key result of the elimination process is that real roots of the new polynomial correspond to imaginary roots of the transcendental characteristic equation. With the help of new polynomial, it is also possible to determine the delay-dependency of system stability and root tendency with respect to the time delay. An analytical formula is then developed to compute delay margins in terms of system parameters. For a large set of controller gains, delay margins of LFC systems are computed to investigate the qualitative effect of controller gains on the delay margin. Finally, simulations studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The merit order stack is used to tackle a wide variety of problems involving electricity dispatch. The simplification it relies on is to neglect dynamic issues such as the cost of starting stations. This leads the merit order stack to give a poor representation of the hourly pattern of prices and under-estimate the optimal level of investment in both peaking and inflexible baseload generators, and thus their run-times by up to 30%. We describe a simple method for incorporating start-up costs using a single equation derived from the load curve and station costs. The technique is demonstrated on the British electricity system in 2010 to test its performance against actual outturn, and in a 2020 scenario with increased wind capacity where it is compared to a dynamic unit-commitment scheduler. Our modification yields a better representation of electricity prices and reduces the errors in capacity investment by a factor of two.

Abstract: This paper proposes a tractable and scalable algorithm to identify and analyze bifurcation points of a large-scale power system model, which are directly related to dynamic voltage instability problems. Different types of bifurcations are analyzed, including: saddle-node (fold), Hopf, singularity-induced and limit-induced. An algorithm that combines optimization and predictor- corrector procedure is proposed for equilibrium tracing. The algorithm is based on calculation of only critical (rightmost and closest-to-zero) eigenvalues. The proposed algorithm is extended to the case of dynamic voltage stability assessment for power systems with optimized topology (simultaneously subjected to the topology control changes and generation re-dispatch). The proposed approach is illustrated on two (medium- and large-scale real-world) test power systems.

Abstract: The ancillary services that could be provided by the distributed generators and the energy storage systems are expected to give great added value to the microgrid-based smart grid topologies. These services must be integrated into the control system of the microgrids. In this paper, the pseudo-state-of-charge concept is introduced to improve energy storage management. Additionally, a noninvasive-to-the-inverter PV-plant control strategy, based on the remote control of PV-strings actuators, is presented and applied on a microgrid-based smart grid topology. The operation of the microgrid with the improved control infrastructure and the iterative algorithm is compared, in terms of reliability, to a microgrid with a different control strategy and topology. The experimental results highlight the advantages of the developed strategy.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method based on phasor measurement units (PMUs) for the estimation of voltage stability margin in a power system to increase operator's situational awareness. The method assumes a PMU measurement preprocessing technique as a priori in order to eliminate data inconsistency and uncertainty caused by random load disturbances. The measurements are then used in the computation of voltage stability margin based on the coupled single-port Thevenin equivalent model and the cubic spline extrapolation technique. Moreover, some practical operating constraints such as the generator reactive power limits are taken into account for practical assessment of the method's performance. Extensive case studies conducted on several standard IEEE test systems are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Distribution networks, which are already complex large scale systems with diverse loads, are becoming more complicated in the smart grid era due to the increasing connections of distributed generators (e.g., solar and wind) and smart devices (e.g., electric vehicles and storage batteries). Although highly automated and integrated control systems have been proposed, systems with coverage from the zone substation to the low-voltage feeders practically do not exist. Based on the natural voltage decomposition of distribution networks and authors' previous research on distribution system control, this paper proposes an efficient multi-objective hierarchical optimization strategy that can fully exploit the capabilities of both traditional and emerging devices, expand network load capacity and accommodate more renewable connections. Detailed simulations are performed on a real Australian distribution network over 24 hours to verify the feasibility, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed hierarchical optimization and some future work is also discussed.

Abstract: Delta-connected switched capacitors are common in three-wire MV distribution systems as found in Europe and Australia but the majority of past studies focus on star-connected capacitors as applied in North America. This study presents a comprehensive optimization based sequential strategy and a multi-objective optimization based real-time strategy for the optimal placement and control of delta-connected switched capacitors. Considering load variations, a comprehensive optimization for capacitor placement is formulated to maximize the net annual returns from network loss reduction and capacity release. A sequential strategy based on loss sensitivity analysis is presented for efficient capacitor placement on large-scale unbalanced distribution networks. Then a capacitor control strategy is proposed to simultaneously minimize network losses, voltage deviations and voltage unbalance factor (VUF) while a weighted sum method reflects the preferences on the mutually conflicting control objectives. For the mixed integer programming (MIP) problems of capacitor placement and control, an improved backward/forward sweep (BSFS) load flow based particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used. Finally, the robustness of the proposed capacitor placement and control strategies are verified by comparison against existing popular schemes through detailed simulations over 24 h on a real unbalanced Australian MV network.

Abstract: Phase balancing is essential to safe power system operation. We consider a substation connected to multiple phases, each with single-phase loads, generation, and energy storage. A representative of the substation operates the system and aims to minimize the cost of all phases and to balance loads among phases. We first consider ideal energy storage with lossless charging and discharging, and propose both centralized and distributed real-time algorithms taking into account system uncertainty. The proposed algorithm does not require any system statistics and asymptotically achieves the minimum system cost with large energy storage. We then extend the algorithm to accommodate more realistic non-ideal energy storage that has imperfect charging and discharging. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulation and compared with that of a benchmark greedy algorithm. Simulation shows that our algorithm leads to strong performance over a wide range of storage characteristics.

Abstract: Short-term load forecasting at the distribution level predicts the load of substations, feeders, transformers, and possibly customers from half an hour to one week ahead. Effective forecasting is important for the planning and operation of distribution systems. The problem, however, is difficult in view of complicated load features, the large number of distribution-level nodes, and possible switching operations. In this paper, a new forecasting approach within the hierarchical structure is presented to solve these difficulties. Load of the root node at any user-defined subtree is first forecast by a wavelet neural network with appropriate inputs. Child nodes categorized as "regular" and "irregular" based on load pattern similarities are then forecast separately. Load of a regular child node is simply forecast as the proportion from the parent node load forecast while the load of an irregular child node is forecast by an individual neural network model. Switching operation detection and follow-up adjustments are also performed to capture abnormal changes and improve the forecasting accuracy. This new approach captures load characteristics of nodes at different levels, takes advantage of pattern similarities between a parent node and its child nodes, detects abnormalities, and provides high quality forecasts as demonstrated by two practical datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve the multistage long-term expansion planning problem of electrical distribution systems (EDSs) considering the following alternatives: increasing the capacity of existing substations, constructing new substations, allocating capacitor banks and/or voltage regulators, constructing and/or reinforcing circuits, and modifying, if necessary, the system's topology. The aim is to minimize the investment and operation costs of the EDS over an established planning horizon. The proposed model uses a linearization technique and an approximation for transforming the original problem into an MILP model. The MILP model guarantees convergence to optimality by using existing classical optimization tools. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed methodology, a 24-node test system was employed.

Abstract: This paper presents a sliding mode robust control based active-power modulation (SMAPM) for voltage source converter based multi-terminal HVDC (VSC-MTDC) systems, which could enhance the stability of the onshore power system subjected to disturbances by fast changing transmitted power of onshore VSCs. The development of the SMAPM includes three steps. First, the onshore disturbed ac system could be divided into two areas with generators sharing different swing modes. The center of the inertia (COI) reference frame is utilized to be the representative of the area's behavior. Secondly, an index called sensitive index is proposed to quantify the sensitivity of generator angular speed to the active-power change of an onshore VSC. A strategy is developed to determine the modulation direction and intensity of each onshore converter. Thirdly, the final control law is derived based on sliding mode variable structure control method. Simulation verifications are run in a four-machine ac system and a modified New England 39-bus system.

Abstract: In this paper, the authors firstly present the theoretical foundation of a state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification method, the dimension-adaptive sparse grid interpolation (DASGI), for introducing it into the applications of probabilistic power flow (PPF), specifically as discussed herein. It is well-known that numerous sources of uncertainty are being brought into the present-day electrical grid, by large-scale integration of renewable, thus volatile, generation, e.g., wind power, and by unprecedented load behaviors. In presence of these added uncertainties, it is imperative to change traditional deterministic power flow (DPF) calculation to take them into account in the routine operation and planning. However, the PPF analysis is still quite challenging due to two features of the uncertainty in modern power systems: high dimensionality and presence of stochastic interdependence. Both are traditionally addressed by the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) at the cost of cumbersome computation; in this paper instead, they are tackled with the joint application of the DASGI and Copula theory (especially advantageous for constructing nonlinear dependence among various uncertainty sources), in order to accomplish the dependent high-dimensional PPF analysis in an accurate and faster manner. Based on the theory of DASGI, its combination with Copula and the DPF for the PPF is also introduced systematically in this work. Finally, the feasibility and the effectiveness of this methodology are validated by the test results of two standard IEEE test cases.

Abstract: A two-stage load control scheme is presented to address severe under-frequency conditions. The first stage is event-based under-frequency load shedding that guarantees fast response to the detected high-consequence disturbances, for initial system protection. The control signals are obtained by solving mixed-integer programming problems. After the first stage, model predictive control is triggered in the second stage for step-by-step online closed-loop control of interruptible loads, the amount of which is identified via solving linear programming problems. Trajectory sensitivities are used in the optimization problems in both stages to facilitate the analysis. The proposed scheme has been tested on a 9-bus system and on the New England 39-bus system.

Abstract: Increasing penetration of renewable power sources (RESs) is bringing more uncertainties to power systems. Real-time economic dispatch should be able to handle the fluctuations caused by the load as well as RESs, and obtain new optimal operating points after deviating from original generation schedules. This paper proposes a generation adjustment algorithm based on the base point and participation factor method. The objective of the method is to obtain fast adjustments to generators' real power outputs in real-time economic dispatch. The proposed method achieves significant and consistent improvements comparing to the original participation factor method by using a more precise model of transmission losses in the optimization process. The computational burden and execution time of the proposed method is much less than OPF and heuristic economic dispatch methods. The proposed method and its effectiveness are tested using IEEE 30-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, and GuangDong 1018-bus system. Simulation results are demonstrated with comparisons and discussions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to energy exchange between electric vehicle (EV) load and wind generation utilities participating in the day-ahead energy, balancing, and regulation markets. An optimal bidding/offering strategy model is developed to mitigate wind energy and EV imbalance threats, and optimize EV charging profiles. A new strategy model is based on optimizing decision making of a wind generating company (WGenCO) in selecting the best option among the use of the balancing or regulation services, the use of the energy storage system (ESS) and the use of all of them to compensate wind power deviation. Energy imbalance is discussed using conventional systems, ESS, and EV-Wind coordination; results are compared and analyzed. Stochastic intra-hour optimization is solved by mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Uncertainties associated with wind forecasting, energy price, and behavior of EV owners based on their driving patterns, are considered in the proposed stochastic method and validated through several case studies.

Abstract: Electricity demand forecasts are needed for decisions regarding generation dispatch for lead times as short as just a few minutes. Imbalance between generation and demand causes deviation of the system frequency from its target, which in Great Britain is 50 Hz. This, in turn, causes a change in demand, due largely to motor loads. For Great Britain, the change is estimated to be 2.5% of demand per 1 Hz of frequency deviation from its target. This can be used to calculate the demand that would have occurred if frequency had been at 50 Hz. Modeling and forecasting the resulting frequency-corrected demand provides a better basis for dispatching generation. This paper evaluates methods for forecasting frequency-corrected demand up to 10 min ahead. We introduce an exponential smoothing model that, like the system operator's proposed Kalman filter approach, jointly models frequency and demand. We also evaluate a set of univariate methods applied directly to the series of frequency-corrected demand. These methods have not previously been considered for lead times less than 10 min. In our empirical analysis, the best results were produced by a seasonal exponential smoothing method applied directly to the series of frequency-corrected demand.

Abstract: This paper deals with the short-circuit level constrained transmission expansion planning (TEP) problem through a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. The proposed framework is outlined by a master problem and three subproblems based on the Benders decomposition technique. The master problem incorporates the optimal investment planning model. System security and short-circuit level constraints are examined by subproblems I and II, respectively. In case of any violation, infeasibility cuts are derived to reflect the appropriate modification in the master problem solution. The short-circuit study is inherently a nonlinear analysis and hard to concurrently be tackled in power system studies. To overcome this difficulty, a linear approximation is developed for the short-circuit analysis which not only mitigates the computational burden of the problem, but even is efficient for taking the advantage of decomposed schemes. Subproblem III examines optimality of the investment solution from the operation point of view and, through optimality cuts, steers the master problem toward the optimal solution. The proposed model is tested on the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system and its effectiveness is assured by comprehensive simulation studies.

Abstract: Microprocessor-based relays protecting against fault current have revolutionized power automation industry. The leverage using commercially available information communication technologies has been the currency for future cyberinfrastructure deployment, which enables plausible electronic manipulation that can affect system operation. The bus differential protection has been recognized as one of the most critical protection schemes, if compromised, that would disconnect a large number of components within a substation. A hypothesized substation outage is the worst case scenario of intrusion attack events. This paper proposes an impact analysis of critical cyber assets in substations that capture historical load and topology conditions. This is to identify critical substations and other "nightmare" hypothesized combinations for security protection planning. The proposed metrics of attack scenarios incorporate electronic instrumentation in relation to the physical system for impact and dependency evaluation. Combinatorial verification of these hypothesized events based on the proposed reverse pyramid model ( RPM) is validated using IEEE 30- and 118-bus systems.

Abstract: High penetration of wind generation will increase the requirement for fast frequency response services as currently wind plants do not provide inertial response. Although the importance of inertia reduction has been widely recognized, its impact on the system scheduling has not been fully investigated. In this context, this paper proposes a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for stochastic unit commitment that optimizes system operation by simultaneously scheduling energy production, standing/spinning reserves and inertia-dependent fast frequency response in light of uncertainties associated with wind production and generation outages. Post-fault dynamic frequency requirements, 1) rate of change of frequency, 2) frequency nadir and 3) quasi-steady-state frequency are formulated as MILP constraints by using the simplified model of system dynamics. Moreover the proposed methodology enables the impact of wind uncertainty on system inertia to be considered. Case studies are carried out on the 2030 Great Britain system to demonstrate the importance of incorporating inertia-dependent fast frequency response in the stochastic scheduling and to indicate the potential for the proposed model to inform reviews of grid codes associated with fast frequency response and future development of inertia-related market.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of variable and uncertain generation from renewable resources poses a challenge for balancing the power system supply and demand. Violations of this constraint seriously impact system reliability and thus carry with them a very high cost. In order to address the issues created by variable generation increased system flexibility is required. System operators are considering modifications to the conventional real-time economic dispatch model to provide improved ramp flexibility. In this paper an operational flexibility metric called lack of ramp probability (LORP) is proposed for the real-time economic dispatch. Further, a two-step robust optimization based framework is introduced to simultaneously guarantee LORP flexibility metric and ensure ramp deliverability in a multi-zonal setting. The proposed framework is illustrated on a 3-zone modified IEEE 73 bus (RTS-96) test system.

Abstract: French electricity load forecasting has encountered major changes during the past decade. These changes are, among other things, due to the opening of the electricity market and the economic crisis, which require the development of new automatic time adaptive prediction methods. The advent of innovating technologies also needs the development of some automatic methods because thousands or tens of thousands of time series have to be studied. In this paper we adopt for prediction a semi-parametric approach based on additive models. We present an automatic procedure for explanatory variable selection in an additive model and show how to correct middle term forecasting errors for short term forecasting. First, we consider an application to the EDF customer load demand which is typical of a load demand at an aggregate level. The goal of the application is to select variables from a large explanatory variables dictionary. The second application presented is an application on load demand of GEFCom 2012 competition, which we consider as a local application, where a major difficulty is to select some meteorological stations.

Abstract: The use of natural gas as fuel for electricity generation in thermal plants has played a key role in the development of power systems. The development of gas pipelines and other related infrastructure imposes availability constraints, which are often ignored when determining the optimal dispatch of the electric power system. This research proposes the use of an integrated optimization model, based on a stochastic dual dynamic programming methodology, to simulate both the scheduling of a hydrothermal power system and the transportation and availability of natural gas. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed model through the implementation of different case studies in the context of the main Chilean power network. We conclude that it is essential to consider the limitations that occur in natural gas power plant's dispatch due to the fuel availability constraints, because they induce the use of power plants with higher variable costs, directly impacting the total operational costs and marginal costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a generic rms model of voltage source converter (VSC) in modular multilevel converter (MMC) topology for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) application. The generic rms model is suitable for stability analysis of a MMC-VSC-HVDC interconnected to ac power system. Based on the rms model, a linearized model for analytical model analysis is also developed and described. The parameters of the generic rms model are identified via an established averaged EMT model. The dynamic performance of the proposed generic model is tested in both time and frequency domain analysis using a typical high-voltage transmission system.

Abstract: In this paper we present a novel method for daily short-term load forecasting, belonging to the class of "similar shape" algorithms. In the proposed method, a number of parameters are optimally tuned via a multi-objective strategy that minimizes the error and the variance of the error, with the objective of providing a final forecast that is at the same time accurate and reliable. We extensively compare our algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we apply our approach upon publicly available data and show that the same algorithm accurately forecasts the load of countries characterized by different size, different weather conditions, and generally different electrical load profiles, in an unsupervised manner.

Abstract: The United States targets to supply 20% of its electricity generation using wind energy by 2030. The expansion of renewable resources, especially weather-based resources such as wind, creates more uncertainty and variability in the operation of the power grid. New methods and approaches in electricity market operations are needed to efficiently manage the continuing increase in variability and uncertainty caused by expanding intermittent wind. This paper proposes an improved stochastic programming approach for incorporating wind uncertainty into energy markets. The proposed formulation improves the two-stage stochastic unit commitment problem by introducing a dynamic decision making approach similar to a multi-stage formulation in the presence of wind power scenarios which are not well represented by a scenario tree. The numerical results present up to 1%-2% decrease in operational costs compared to the two-stage stochastic unit commitment formulation.

Abstract: Integration of wind turbines introduces new challenges in terms of planning criteria. In this study, a new transmission expansion planning methodology considering N-1 contingency conditions is proposed to minimize investment cost and curtailed wind energy over planning period. To deal with the uncertainty of load and output power of wind turbines, probabilistic method based on clustering is used for determination of load and wind model. To incorporate the wind power curtailment into the proposed methodology, optimal power flow which uses DC-power flow equations is utilized by including cost functions of generators and overall optimization is carried out by using an integer genetic algorithm. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to the modified IEEE RTS 24-bus test system by considering different case studies in order to show the effects of including cost functions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel control algorithm for improving steady-state (quasi-static) voltage stability by use of an embedded voltage source converter (VSC) based high voltage direct current (HVDC) system. In this paper, the terms "steady-state" and "quasi-static" are used interchangeably. By embedded HVDC, we refer to a meshed AC system with all HVDC terminals connected within the same AC grid. The sensitivity between VSC control input and the voltage stability margin is introduced. Based on this sensitivity, the proposed control algorithm jointly satisfies system-wide voltage stability margin as well as local voltage magnitude requirements. The proposed approach is to first migrate the entire system to have sufficient voltage stability margin, and then to correct any voltage magnitude violation while keeping that stability margin. A contour-based visualization of the VSC capability space for maintaining system voltage stability is introduced, which can effectively illustrate how the singular value sensitivity (SVS) based control achieves both the local and global voltage stability requirements. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is shown via case studies on a 6-bus and 118-bus system with and without static VAR compensation.

Abstract: This paper presents a wide-area control approach to improve the transient stability of the power systems while also damping the post-fault inter-area oscillations. The proposed approach employs a nonlinear Kalman filter to estimate the inter-area modes using phasor measurement units (PMUs). The wide-area control system then uses the estimated inter-area dynamics through the developed control algorithms to improve the first swing and damping stability of the system. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the simplified Australian test system with different load models including induction motors and the results show significant improvement in the stability of the system by simply adding the wide-area control signals to the available controllers in the system. The application of the proposed wide-area control system is shown to be feasible on realistic systems by improving the system stability and efficiency.

Abstract: In several countries, the wind power penetration increased tremendously in recent years. To ensure the proper functioning of the power system, some grid operators already require the capability to provide inertial response or primary control with wind turbines. This paper discusses the emulated inertial response with wind turbines by means of the synthetic inertia and the droop control strategy. The behavior of the synthetic inertia strategy is determined by the inertial and the droop constant, whereas droop control only has a droop constant. When these strategies are used, it is important to tune the control parameters depending on the power system to which the wind turbines are connected. Simulations show that it is possible to enhance but also to deteriorate the frequency response of the system, dependent on these parameters. For different power system compositions, the optimal inertial constant is always close to zero. This way, the synthetic inertia strategy reduces to a fast droop control strategy. This is an important outcome, as it means that no differentiation of the frequency is needed to obtain an optimal inertial response from the wind turbines, which is beneficial in terms of robustness. Consequently, droop control is a viable alternative for the synthetic inertia.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a measurement-based approach to the real-time security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED). The real-time SCED is a widely used market scheduling tool that seeks to economically balance electricity supply and demand and provide locational marginal prices (LMPs), while ensuring system reliability standards are met. To capture network flows and security considerations, the conventional SCED formulation relies on sensitivities that are typically computed from a linearized power flow model, which is vulnerable to phenomena such as undetected topology changes, changes in the system operating point, and the existence of incorrect model data. Our approach to the formulation of the SCED problem utilizes power system sensitivities estimated from phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. The resulting measurement-based real-time SCED is robust against the aforementioned phenomena. Moreover, the dispatch instructions and LMPs calculated with the proposed measurement-based SCED accurately reflect real-time system conditions and security needs. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach via several case studies.

Abstract: In this study, implementation of flatness-based control on doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is investigated. Flatness-based approach is well adopted to control systems in two-level control structure where the tasks of planning, trajectory generation, and tracking the desired trajectories can be easily separated. As a result, the system is decoupled into two trivial linear systems. While in vector control the trajectories are found using PI controllers, in the proposed control structure the trajectories are computed directly, through algebraic equations. Desired active and reactive power are used to develop the set points for trajectory generation. Tracking of the desired trajectories is guaranteed through feedback linearization. The two-level control structure enables active power control and the opportunity for wind plants to contribute in frequency regulation. The proposed control shows promising results in tracking the desired reactive power and the active power across a variety of scenarios and in providing ancillary service to support the frequency regulation of the grid.

Abstract: Long-term contracting is the traditional governance mechanism to deal with the transaction costs associated with the specificity of gas industry assets. Long-term contracts have been often used to allocate risks among players, and to that end, they often include take-or-pay provisions. These clauses specify that buyers take the volume risk, as they are obliged to pay for a minimum amount of gas consumption. In exchange, buyers pay a predefined price, supposedly lower than the risk-neutral expectation of short-term gas prices. In that view, if the buyer is able to resell that gas in the short term, the contract is an effective hedge against short-term volatility. Otherwise, the contract does not act as a hedge but it becomes a sunk cost. The corresponding power producers' behavior involves not only output decisions but also financial decisions. To analyze that situation, this paper develops a new quantitative methodology that allows comparing risk-neutral valuations of gas and power markets decisions. We test the model in a real-size system, and show the additional cost of the power system associated with a possible illiquidity of the short-term gas market.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-level voltage controller for large-scale power systems. The aim of the controller is to maintain a near-optimal voltage profile in the transmission network by coordinating discrete reactive power (var) control devices in the system. The controller is targeted for implementation in electric power transmission utility companies where most of the voltage controls are coordinated by switching of discrete var devices such as shunt capacitor and reactor banks and transformer banks load tap changers (LTCs). By effectively dividing the controller responsibilities between local substation controls and a central coordinator at control center level, the design is aimed at voltage control of large-scale power systems. At local level, the substation controllers maintain their respective substation bus voltages by local power-flow-like computations using mostly local PMU measurements. The central coordinator computes and provides the voltage set-points to the substation controllers and also coordinates by enabling or disabling the local controllers as needed. The controller is being designed towards prototype implementation in Southern California Edison (SCE), starting with local controllers at specific substations in the first stage. It is tested on real-time dynamic models and large-scale power-flow simulations of SCE transmission network.

Abstract: Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has gradually become commonplace within the utilities industry and has brought with it numerous improvements in all related fields. Specifically in tariff setting and demand response models, classification of smart meter readings into load profiles helps in finding the right segments to target. This paper addresses the issue of assigning new customers, for whom no AMI readings are available, to one of these load profiles. This post-clustering phase has received little attention in the past. Our framework combines commercial, government and open data with the internal company data to accurately predict the load profile of a new customer using high performing classification models. The daily load profiles are generated using Spectral Clustering and are used as the dependent variable in our model. The framework was tested on over 6000 customers from GDF SUEZ in Belgium and six relevant load profiles were identified. The results show that the combination of internal data with commercial and cartographic data achieves the highest accuracy. Using external data alone, the model was still able to adequately place customers into their relevant load profile.

Abstract: Environmental concerns have motivated governments in the European Union and elsewhere to set ambitious targets for generation from renewable energy (RE) technologies and to offer subsidies for their adoption along with priority grid access. However, because RE technologies like solar and wind power are intermittent, their penetration places greater strain on existing conventional power plants that need to ramp up more often. In turn, energy storage technologies, e.g., pumped hydro storage or compressed air storage, are proposed to offset the intermittency of RE technologies and to facilitate their integration into the grid. We assess the economic and environmental consequences of storage via a complementarity model of a stylized Western European power system with market power, representation of the transmission grid, and uncertainty in RE output. Although storage helps to reduce congestion and ramping costs, it may actually increase greenhouse gas emissions from conventional power plants in a perfectly competitive setting. Conversely, strategic use of storage by producers renders it less effective at curbing both congestion and ramping costs, while having no net overall impact on emissions.

Abstract: A novel integrated exchange-based and flow-based model is presented in this paper, which attains simultaneously (a) intuitive exchanges, (b) maximum flows at the critical branches (up to their physical limits denoted by their Remaining Available Margin), and (c) it is cleared at one-shot. The model practically represents two problems that are forced to equilibrate: the first problem aims at the maximization of supply/demand surplus subject to respective supply/demand limits; the second aims at the maximization of intuitive branch exchanges subject to respective boundaries of exchange volumes as imposed by physical flow limits. The solution results attain a simultaneously physically feasible and "commercially" rational solution. The model is formulated as a Mixed Complementarity Problem, comprising linear complementarity conditions of the associated quantity and price variables, thus leading to computationally efficient solutions even in large-scale day-ahead electricity markets. The model is compared in terms of social surplus and cleared bilateral exchanges with the "intuitive patch" currently applied in the Central-Western European region, proving its superiority in attaining optimal intuitive solutions.

Abstract: This paper summarizes an instability monitoring and protection method based on local identification of global voltage instability (LIVES) and applies it to an IEEE test system for voltage stability and security assessment. The identification method (LIVES-alarm) is tested with both detailed and Quasi-Steady-State simulation tools, and two protection schemes, based respectively on reverse Load Tap Changer operation (LIVES-restore) and firm load shedding, are evaluated and compared using the unstable scenario provided with the test system. The effect of load sensitivity to voltage is also investigated.

Abstract: Analysis of transient stability of strongly nonlinear post-fault dynamics is one of the most computationally challenging parts of dynamic security assessment. This paper proposes a novel approach for assessment of transient stability of the system. The approach generalizes the idea of energy methods, and extends the concept of energy function to a more general Lyapunov functions family (LFF) constructed via semidefinite programming techniques. Unlike the traditional energy function and its variations, the constructed Lyapunov functions are proven to be decreasing only in a finite neighborhood of the equilibrium point. However, we show that they can still certify stability of a broader set of initial conditions in comparison to the energy function in the closest-UEP method. Moreover, the certificates of stability can be constructed via a sequence of convex optimization problems that are tractable even for large scale systems. We also propose specific algorithms for adaptation of the Lyapunov functions to specific initial conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a number of IEEE test cases.

Abstract: Unit commitment, as one of the most important control processes in power systems, has been studied extensively in the past decades. Usually, the goal of unit commitment is to reduce as much production cost as possible while guaranteeing the power supply operated with a high reliability. However, system operators encounter increasing difficulties to achieve an optimal scheduling due to the challenges in coping with uncertainties that exist in both supply and demand sides. This study develops a day-ahead two-stage multi-objective unit commitment model which optimizes both the supply reliability and the total cost with environmental concerns of thermal generation systems. To tackle the manifold uncertainties of unit commitment in a more comprehensive and realistic manner, stochastic and fuzzy set theories are utilized simultaneously, and a unified reliability measurement is then introduced to evaluate the system reliability under the uncertainties of both sudden unit outage and unforeseen load fluctuation. In addition, a cumulative probabilistic method is proposed to address the spinning reserve optimization during the scheduling. To solve this complicated model, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed. Finally, a series of experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this research; we also justify its feasibility on test systems with generation uncertainty.

Abstract: Markets for ramp products (called "flexiramp" in the California ISO and "ramp capability" in the Midcontinent ISO) have been proposed to address the need for generator flexibility due to increased renewable penetration. Flexiramp is committed capacity reserved to meet unexpected ramps in net load. We evaluate flexiramp market designs by comparing solutions of 1) an ISO real-time market simulation (a deterministic real-time unit commitment (RTUC) model with flexiramp requirements) with 2) a stochastic RTUC model, used as a baseline for evaluating flexiramp solutions. The flexiramp constraint improves the expected performance of ISO real-time markets, but is inefficient compared to stochastic RTUC. Flexiramp markets are inefficient in part because the deterministic model disregards the possibility of higher than anticipated energy production by capacity reserved for ramp. Thus, for instance, capacity with low commitment costs but high running costs might be overcommitted, increasing energy costs under high ramp outcomes. The amount of flexiramp acquired strongly affects costs. Too little results in under-commitment of generators and high price fluctuations and even demand curtailment; too much leads to over-commitment, inflating production costs. Hence, careful design of the ramp market and consideration of the use of full stochastic dispatch and commitment models is recommended.

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of modern power systems and the integration of volatile renewable energy bring great challenges to the existing security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) solution engines. This paper presents a fully parallel stochastic SCUC approach to obtain an efficient and fast solution for a large-scale power system with wind energy uncertainty. Variables duplication and auxiliary problem principle (APP) techniques are adopted to fully decompose the original stochastic optimization problem into three major solution modules: the unit commitment (UC) module solves multiple single UC problems; the optimal power flow (OPF) module handles multiple hourly DC-OPF problems; and the bridge module builds a connection between the UC and OPF modules. These three modules are conducted for both base case and scenarios, and can be totally solved in a parallel manner. Numerical case studies on a modified IEEE 118-bus system and a practical 1168-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach which will offer the power system a secure and economic operation under various uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper proposes a rule-based power management algorithm to enable the dispatch of a utility-scale PV power plant consisting of a hybrid energy storage system, in accordance with the Australian national electricity rules. This algorithm is purposely designed to regulate the instantaneous power of a PV plant with the same level of dispatchability as conventional power plants. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is robust under large forecasting errors (up to 60%) of solar irradiance and it can be easily implemented in practice. Specifically, this algorithm can be executed within seconds even when considering detailed market operation and model nonlinearities. A 30 MW PV plant, including a 7.5 MW/1.25 MWh vanadium redox battery and a 1.5 MW/0.25 MWh suppercapacitors bank, has been modeled using MATLAB/Simulink and PLECS software environment. The simulation results were based on various scenarios and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed power management algorithm. It has been shown that even in the worst-case scenario of solar forecasting error of 60%, the proposed algorithm still managed to deliver over 94% of the available energy for a given solar irradiance profile of one month.

Abstract: A novel online line switching methodology for increasing load margins to static stability limit of a look-ahead power system is developed. A design goal of the methodology is to balance speed (for online computation) and effectiveness (for quality of line switching solutions). Instead of dealing with the combinatorial nature of line switching problem, the proposed methodology employs the strategy of screening, ranking and identifying to find a set of high-quality solutions. The proposed methodology ensures the satisfaction of operational and engineering constraints of (look-ahead) post-switching power system. The proposed methodology also determines multiple solutions of line switching for operators to choose a desired one. The effectiveness of the online line switching methodology is evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus and a 1648-bus power systems with very promising results.

Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) provides promising development for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) applications, including multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) and renewable energy integration. This paper, considering an offshore wind farm (OWF) integrated MMC MTDC system, investigates its start-up process with three main developments: 1) it further develops the mathematical model of MTDC with active networks and proposes a hierarchical start-up control scheme; 2) for the terminal which connects the OWF, it proposes a reduced dc voltage control scheme of mitigating the current surges with deblocking the converter at zero voltage difference on submodules (SMs) and proposes an overall sequential start-up control scheme for the offshore integrated MTDC; and 3) it analyzes and compares different start-up control schemes. To evaluate the proposed sequential start-up control scheme, an offshore MMC HVDC system is established on the RTDS. The simulation results verify effectiveness of the proposed scheme on the MMC MTDC system with two control paradigms, i.e., master-slave control and droop control, respectively. In comparison with different start-up control schemes, the superiority of the mitigation of voltage spikes and current surges are shown using the proposed scheme with less complexity and easier implementation.

Abstract: Sustained oscillations observed in power systems can damage equipment, degrade the power quality and increase the risks of cascading blackouts. There are several mechanisms that can give rise to oscillations, each requiring different countermeasure to suppress or eliminate the oscillation. This work develops mathematical framework for analysis of sustained oscillations and identifies statistical signatures of each mechanism, based on which a novel oscillation diagnosis method is developed via real-time processing of phasor measurement units (PMUs) data. Case studies show that the proposed method can accurately identify the exact mechanism for sustained oscillation, and meanwhile provide insightful information to locate the oscillation sources.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for integrated generation and transmission maintenance scheduling model (IMS) that takes into consideration N-1 contingencies. The objective is to maximize the maintenance preference of facility owners while satisfying N-1 security and other constraints. To achieve this goal, Benders decomposition is employed to decompose the problem into a master problem and several sub-problems. A Relaxation Induced (RI) algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the large mixed integer programming (MIP) master problem. This algorithm is based on the solution of the linear relaxed problem. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reach a near-optimal solution that is usually satisfactory. If this near-optimal solution is not acceptable, it is used as the initial solution to fast start the solution of the original IMS problem. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using a modified version of the IEEE 30-bus system and a model of the power system of a Chinese province. Case studies show that the proposed algorithm can improve the computational efficiency by more than an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Natural disasters can cause large blackouts. Research into natural disaster impacts on electric power systems is emerging to understand the causes of the blackouts, explore ways to prepare and harden the grid, and increase the resilience of the power grid under such events. At the same time, new technologies such as smart grid, micro grid, and wide area monitoring applications could increase situational awareness as well as enable faster restoration of the system. This paper aims to consolidate and review the progress of the research field towards methods and tools of forecasting natural disaster related power system disturbances, hardening and pre-storm operations, and restoration models. Challenges and future research opportunities are also presented in the paper.

Abstract: We present a rolling decision-making process for electrical power systems, in which unit commitment, dispatch and reserve policies are co-optimized in order to minimize expected short-run operating costs in the presence of uncertainty arising from demand and renewable infeeds. The uncertainty is assumed to be bounded, with estimated first and second moment statistics available. The rolling "look-ahead" process employs a planning horizon of several hours, with re-optimization taking place each time the first step has been implemented. We present an expected-cost formulation incorporating multi-stage recourse on continuous decision variables-plans for adjusting the dispatch in the light of future information to be discovered at each stage of the optimization horizon. The generic formulation allows the flexibility of devices such as energy storage units to be exploited in the reserve mechanism. We demonstrate using closed-loop numerical tests that significant reductions in the cost of accommodating uncertainty are attainable relative to a time-decoupled reserve mechanism. In contrast to previous results, we show that a time-coupled cost function is not required for this benefit to be observed. In addition, we show that relaxing binary unit commitment decisions after the first step of the horizon brings significant computational speed-ups, and in some cases also reduce closed-loop system operation costs.

Abstract: This paper presents a method that in real-time determines remedial actions, which restore stable operation with respect to aperiodic small signal rotor angle stability (ASSRAS) when insecure or unstable operation has been detected. An ASSRAS assessment method is used to monitor the stability boundary for each generator in real-time. The ASSRAS boundary represents the condition when a generator reaches the maximum steady state active power injection. The proposed control method exploits analytically derived expressions for the ASSRAS boundary and other characteristic curves in the injection impedance plane to determine an active power redispatch among selected generators to restore stable and secure operation. Since the method is purely based on analytically derived expression, the computation of the remedial actions is fast and well suited for real-time operation. The method was tested on the IEEE 14-bus and the Nordic32 test systems where results show that the method can efficiently determine the required active power redispatch to avoid an imminent instability.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider dispatchability as the set of all admissible nodal wind power injections that will not cause infeasibility in real-time dispatch (RTD). Our work reveals that the dispatchability of the affine policy based RTD (AF-RTD) is a polytope whose coefficients are linear functions of the generation schedule and the gain matrix of affine policy. Two mathematical formulations of the dispatchability maximized energy and reserve dispatch (DM-ERD) are proposed. The first one maximizes the distance from the forecast to the boundaries of the dispatchability polytope subject to the available production cost or reserve cost. Provided the forecast value and variance of wind power, the generalized Gauss inequality (GGI) is adopted to evaluate the probability of infeasible RTD without the exact probability distribution of wind power. Combining the first formulation and the GGI approach, the second one minimizes the total cost subject to a desired reliability level through dispatchability maximization. Efficient convex optimization based algorithms are developed to solve these two models. Different from the conventional robust optimization method, our model does not rely on the specific uncertainty set of wind generation and directly optimizes the uncertainty accommodation capability of the power system. The proposed method is also compared with the affine policy based robust energy and reserve dispatch (AR-ERD). Case studies on the PJM 5-bus system illustrate the proposed concept and method. Experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the applicability of our method on moderate sized systems and its scalability to large dimensional uncertainty.

Abstract: We introduce emerging utility-scale energy storage (e.g., batteries) as part of the set of control measures in a corrective form of the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. This enhanced SCUC (ESCUC) leverages utility-scale energy storage for multiple applications. In the base case, the storage units are optimally charged and discharged to realize economic operation. Immediately following a contingency, the injections of storage units are adjusted almost instantly to alleviate short-term emergency overloads, thereby avoiding potential cascading outages and giving slow ramping generating units time to adjust their output. The ESCUC is a large two-stage mixed-integer programming problem. A Benders decomposition has been developed to solve this problem. In order to achieve computational tractability, we present several acceleration techniques to improve the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Case studies on the RTS-79 and RTS-96 systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: An island formation identification scheme utilizing both phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) information, in conjunction with an analytical method, is developed and presented. The motivation for this work came from the investigation of the islanding event in the Entergy, Louisiana power system in 2008. During Hurricane Gustav in September of 2008, 14 transmission lines were lost which led to the formation of a large electrical island containing much of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This work proposes a method for identifying any specific area of the transmission system that is vulnerable to islanding as the result of losing a system branch. PMU measurements are then utilized to verify SCADA reports that a system branch has been lost. The proposed identification scheme is called the one line remaining (OLR) algorithm. The proposed algorithm identifies potential island formations based on the criteria that a single bus, or a number of buses, are connected to the rest of the system by only a single branch as a direct result of a branch outage. The OLR algorithm is detailed and applied to several small test systems to motivate and validate the approach. The OLR algorithm is then applied to a large Entergy test system for the Gustav islanding event and correctly identifies the last tie line that was lost and created the island.

Abstract: As wind penetration increases in power systems around the world, new challenges to the controllability and operation of a power system are encountered. In particular, frequency response is impacted when a considerable amount of power-electronics interfaced generation, such as wind, is connected to the system. This paper uses small-signal analysis and dynamic simulation to study frequency response in power systems and investigate how Type-3 DFAG wind turbines can impact this response on a test power system, whose frequency response is determined mainly by a frequency-regulation mode. By operating the wind turbines in a deloaded mode, a proposed pitch-angle controller is designed using a root-locus analysis. Time simulations are used to demonstrate the transient and steady-state performance of the proposed controller in the test system with 25% and 50% wind penetration.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new methodology to formulate storage behavior in medium- and long-term power system models that use a load duration curve. Traditionally in such models, the chronological information among individual hours is lost; information that is necessary to adequately model the operation of a storage facility. Therefore, these models are not fully capable of optimizing the actual operation of storage units, and often use pre-determined data or some sort of peak-shaving algorithm. In a rapidly changing power system, the proper characterization of storage behavior and its optimization becomes an increasingly important issue. This paper proposes a methodology to tackle the shortcomings of existing models. In particular, we employ the so-called system states framework to recover some of the chronological information within the load duration curve. This allows us to introduce a novel formulation for storage in a system states model. In a case study, we show that our method can lead to computational time reductions of over 90% while accurately replicating hourly behavior of storage levels.

Abstract: The expected increase in the penetration of renewables in the approaching decade urges the electricity market to introduce new products-in particular, flexible ramping products-to accommodate the renewables' variability and intermittency. A risk-limiting economic dispatch scheme provides the means to optimize the dispatch and provision of these products. In this paper, we adopt the extended loss-of-load probability as the definition of risk. We first assess how the new products distort the optimal economic dispatch by comparing to the case without such products. Specifically, using parametric analysis, we establish the relationship between the minimal generation cost and the two key parameters of the new products: the up-and down-flexible ramping requirements. Such relationship yields a novel routine to efficiently solve the non-convex risk-limiting economic dispatch problem. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results suggest that our approach may substantially reduce the cost for incorporating the new products. We believe our approach can assist the ISOs with utilizing the ramping capacities in the system at the minimal cost.

Abstract: This paper presents tighter formulations and dynamic global cutting plane solution approaches for accelerating network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problems, as the computational bottleneck of NCUC problems is always a concern to independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission owners (RTOs). Specifically, this paper explores tighter mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based NCUC formulations, via locally ideal reformulation for piece-wise linear cost functions of generators and valid cover inequalities by linking system load balance/power flow constraints with generation capacity limits. The paper also discusses an enhanced solution approach by dynamically generating global cutting planes at infeasible/sub-optimal nodes of the branch-and-cut (BAC) tree, which would prevent similar infeasible/suboptimal nodes from being explored repeatedly. Since the major computational complexity of NCUC is caused by the large number of binary UC variables, the proposed strategies, being directly related to binary UC variables, could quickly identify infeasible/suboptimal binary solutions, reduce the search space in the BAC tree, and in turn improve the computational performance. Numerical case studies show that the proposed approach could significantly reduce the overall computational time as compared to the traditional NCUC approach.

Abstract: Motivated by several recent incidents, this paper investigates the impact of wind farm spatial distribution and shunt compensation levels on triggering system-side sub-synchronous oscillations (SSO) in wind-integrated power systems. Quantitative analysis on system eigenvalue sensitivities with respect to wind farm and transmission line parameters as well as system operating conditions is performed systematically to understand the multi-wind-farm-induced SSO. Coupling relationship for wind turbines with identical and different parameter settings on the studied SSO modes is investigated. Electro-magnetic simulations are performed on a multi-machine wind farm model derived from a practical wind-integrated power system, in order to verify the proposed study.

Abstract: Many singular value decomposition (SVD) problems in power system computations require only a few largest singular values of a large-scale matrix for the analysis. This letter introduces two fast SVD approaches recently developed in other domains to power systems for speeding up phasor measurement unit (PMU) based online applications. The first method is a randomized SVD algorithm that accelerates computation by introducing a low-rank approximation of a given matrix through randomness. The second method is the augmented Lanczos bidiagonalization, an iterative Krylov subspace technique that computes sequences of projections of a given matrix onto low-dimensional subspaces. Both approaches are illustrated on SVD evaluation within an ambient oscillation monitoring algorithm, namely stochastic subspace identification (SSI).

Abstract: Local and inter-area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically identified using spatial profiles of poorly damped modes, and they are mitigated via carefully tuned decentralized controllers. In this paper, we employ non-modal tools to analyze and control inter-area oscillations. Our input-output analysis examines power spectral density and variance amplification of stochastically forced systems and offers new insights relative to modal approaches. To improve upon the limitations of conventional wide-area control strategies, we also study the problem of signal selection and optimal design of sparse and block-sparse wide-area controllers. In our design, we preserve rotational symmetry of the power system by allowing only relative angle measurements in the distributed controllers. For the IEEE 39 New England model, we examine performance tradeoffs and robustness of different control architectures and show that optimal retuning of fully-decentralized control strategies can effectively guard against local and inter-area oscillations.

Abstract: Many interconnected power systems are constructed to meet the ever-increasing electric power transfer demand. A disturbance anywhere in such an interconnected system will directly influence the power transfer capability of major transfer interfaces, as well as the transient stability of the system. Instead of the current practice of monitoring the power transfer limit on a given interface, this paper proposes a real-time synchrophasor method to monitor the stability margin using generator phase angle differences and alert operators of the potential risk to the system at the steady state operation. This is accomplished by developing an algorithm to directly correlate the phase angle separation of critical generator bus pairs to power transfer on major interfaces. These critical generator bus pairs are selected systematically through transient stability simulation. The Eastern North American power system is used as a platform to illustrate the utility of the proposed method.

Abstract: The subsynchronous resonance (SSR) problem may become more serious with the continuous evolvement of a series-compensated power system. Consequently, the existing SSR mitigation scheme might no longer keep the system stable. This issue has been encountered by Shangdu Power Plant, where the deployed supplementary excitation damping controllers (SEDCs) that well stabilized the system before cannot maintain torsional stability after the recent change occurred in the power system. Therefore, a combined mitigation scheme of SEDC and generator terminal subsynchronous damping controller (GTSDC) is proposed in this paper to regain system stability. SEDC provides electrical damping by modulating the excitation voltage at the rotor side. Meanwhile, GTSDC can damp SSR via injecting super-synchronous and subsynchronous currents into the generator stator. Field tests have proven the effectiveness of this combined scheme in addressing the deteriorated SSR issue. Eigen-value analysis indicates that the combined scheme can provide enough positive damping for the system under any operating condition. Thanks to the low investment of SEDC and the flexibility of GTSDC, this combined scheme provides an economical and scalable solution for SSR mitigation, especially when the target system changes constantly.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the procurement of load shifting service by optimally scheduling the charging and discharging of PEVs in a decentralized fashion. We assume that the energy flow between PEVs and the grid is bidirectional, i.e., PEVs can also release energy back into the grid as distributed generation, which is known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G). The optimal scheduling problem is then formulated as a mixed discrete programming (MDP) problem, which is NP-hard and extremely difficult to solve directly. To get over this difficulty, we propose a solvable approximation of the MDP problem by exploiting the shape feature of the base demand curve during the night, and develop a decentralized algorithm based on iterative water-filling. Our algorithm is decentralized in the sense that the PEVs compute locally and communicate with an aggregator. The advantages of our algorithm include reduction in computational burden and privacy preserving. Simulation results are given to show the performance of our algorithm.

Abstract: This paper extends evaluation of reliability of the distribution system to incorporate electric vehicles' (EVs') contribution in different modes of operation. For each load point, two topologies-centralized and dispersed EV charging-are considered. During the islanding mode of operation, household demands can be supported by vehicle-to-home (V2H) and/or local vehicle-to-grid (V2G), depending on the charging topologies applied. In grid connected mode of operation, energy not supplied can be further reduced by interregional V2G, which allows energy exchange among load points through healthy mains and laterals by sectionalizing the failure parts of the grid. Evaluation methods are proposed to determine the capacity contribution of EVs for each scenario. For the scenario of interregional V2G, optimal power flow is conducted to maximize the energy exchange. From the results of a case study, V2H and V2G, on both local and system levels, show great promise for the reliability enhancement.

Abstract: The rapid development of wind power has led to an increased demand for spinning reserve in power systems today. However, one of the most severe challenges to China's power systems is the mismatch between wind power installation capacity and the capability for supplying spinning reserve within each independently operated provincial power system. Coordinating the spinning reserve across multiple areas would providentially improve the accommodation of wind power. This paper proposes a game-theoretical model for spinning reserve trading between provincial systems that treat spinning reserve as a commodity. Based on the incomplete information, the trading price is calculated by satisfying the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and then the trading quantity is determined. This ensures that both the buyer and the seller are able to maximize their expected profit. Case studies are performed using a 2-bus interconnected system and a 3-area IEEE RTS system. The results show that the proposed model is valid and effective.

Abstract: Variable wind power output introduces new challenges to power system frequency regulation and control, such as automatic generation control (AGC) which is very important to regulate power system frequency. The existing methods to design control gains for proportional-integral (PI) controllers in AGC are either time consuming or easily affected by the designer's experience. Further, the control gains are usually designed with fixed values for specific scenarios in the studied power system. The desired response may not be achieved when variable wind power is integrated into power systems. To address these challenges, a dynamic gain tuning control (DGTC) method for AGC is proposed in this paper. By the proposed control method, PI control gains can be dynamically adjusted to reach the desired performance. The proposed method is tested in a modified IEEE 39 bus system with actual wind data, and compared with conventional control approach with well-tuned fixed gains in the simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed control method provides better AGC response with less deviation of system frequency and tie-line flow under variable wind power.

Abstract: A smart distribution system should restore service to interrupted customers as quickly as possible after an outage. Upgrading manual switches to remote-controlled switches (RCSs) enhances restoration capability. The placement of RCSs should consider both functional and economic requirements. This paper presents a systematic method to determine the set of switches to be upgraded for an existing distribution system. The maximum restoration capability is achieved by upgrading a near-minimum number of manual switches to RCSs. The RCS placement problem is formulated as a weighed set cover (WSC) problem. A greedy algorithm with a polynomial-time computational efficiency is designed to generate a near-optimal solution for the WSC problem. A 3-feeder 9-node test system and a 4-feeder 1069-node unbalanced test system with microgrids are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We study the problem faced by an operator who aims to allocate a certain amount of load adjustment (either load reduction or increment) to multiple consumers so as to minimize the aggregate consumer disutility. We propose and analyze a simple uniform-price market mechanism where every consumer submits a single bid to choose a supply function from a group of parameterized ones. These parameterized supply functions are designed to ensure that every consumer's load adjustment is within an exogenous capacity limit that is determined by the current power system operating condition. We show that the proposed mechanism yields bounded efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium. In particular, the proposed mechanism is shown to achieve approximate social optimality at a Nash equilibrium, if the total capacity limit excluding the consumer with the largest one is much larger than the total amount of load to be adjusted. We complement our analysis through numerical case studies.

Abstract: Prediction and shaping of dynamic response of the demand will enable advanced control algorithms for active demand management as well as improved stability assessment of the power system. Based on previously developed demand disaggregation approach, this paper develops a methodology for day-ahead prediction and shaping of dynamic response of the demand at bulk supply points without having to perform field measurements. The methodology is broadly based on application of artificial neural network and Monte Carlo simulations and incorporates multiple approaches namely, load forecasting, load disaggregation and the component-based load modelling approach. The input data include standard rms measurements at bulk supply points and actual and day-ahead forecasted weather data and does not rely on having access to detailed customer surveys or high-resolution load signatures. Measured dynamic responses of the demand from the substations of the local utility are used for validation. Load shifting and shaping of dynamic response of the demand are also illustrated.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid converter configuration for conventional Line-Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDC technology aiming to eliminate commutation failures under serious faults. Dynamic series insertion of capacitors during commutation is utilized to increase the effective commutation voltage. The operating principles are presented followed by detailed mathematical analysis for both zero impedance single-phase and three-phase faults in order to select the required capacitor size and its voltage level. The performance of the proposed method is validated by simulation results in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the results show that the proposed converter configuration is able to eliminate commutation failures under both fault cases. Consequently partial power transferring capability during single-phase fault and fast fault recovery from three-phase fault can be achieved. Further simulation results show that the harmonic content of inverter AC voltage and current are not significantly increased and the voltage stress of the thyristor valve is comparable to that of the original benchmark system.

Abstract: In this paper, a method for designing coordinated power system stabilizer (PSS) is presented. The proposed method is based on the reference model controller design. To this end, a model that is called single-machine non-infinite bus is presented for studying low frequency oscillations. Then a reference model is proposed for designing PSS based on the single-machine non-infinite bus model. Transfer functions of the understudy machine augmented with stabilizer are equated by transfer functions of the proposed reference model to compute the PSS's parameters. The damping of the reference model and consequently the damping of the designed PSS do not depend on the frequency of oscillations. Hence, the proposed PSS damps all intra-and inter-area oscillations and no incoordination will happen among the system's stabilizers. Two PSSs are designed using the proposed method for a test power system. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, the performance of the proposed PSSs are compared with the performance of multi-band PSS4B, conventional PSS, conventional PSS, and PSS designed based on particle swarm optimization. Robustness of stabilizers against variation of oscillations' frequency, variation of operating point, and existence of harmonics are used to measure their performances.

Abstract: In the distribution management system (DMS), an essential application for the energy efficiency improvement is loss reduction. Loss reduction often involves the control of reactive power (var) resources to optimize the var flow in the network. Traditionally, most available var resources in the distribution network have been switchable shunt capacitor banks. Today distributed energy resources (DER) are becoming another significant var resource due to their increasing penetration, which brings new opportunities as well as challenges for loss reduction. This paper proposes an advanced loss reduction approach to achieve the optimal control coordination among multiple capacitors and DERs. The proposed approach and solution are developed on the basis of the detailed multi-phase distribution network modeling and the state-of-the-art optimization technology. This work also investigates the impact of the DER var control on the loss reduction improvement and voltage violation correction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on practical utility distribution circuits with varying degree of unbalance and model complexity. The performance of the solution method proves the capability of online solution speed for large and complex distribution systems.

Abstract: Energy production of a wind farm is greatly affected by the wake-effect. In wind farm planning, it is essential to optimize the layout of wind turbine generators (WTGs) to alleviate the impact of wake-effect. This paper presents a new wind farm layout optimization model with an objective function to maximizing equivalent power of the wind farm. The proposed model incorporates the discrete joint probability distribution and characteristics of the wind, wind energy model, and the wake-effect. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. In the optimization process, geometric analysis is conducted to determine the upstream WTGs and to calculate the horizontal and deviating distances among WTGs along the wind direction. An effective look-up table is constructed to directly determine the upstream/downstream WTGs. Then the optimal layout of a wind farm can be obtained. The proposed technique is applied to the wind farm layout optimization and the modified Roy Billinton Test System and IEEE Reliability Test System for reliability analysis of a generating system containing a wind farm. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and flexibility of the proposed technique in the layout optimization of WTGs in a wind farm.

Abstract: The dynamic phasor (DP) concept has been widely used in modeling electrical power systems. So far, the DP concept has been restricted to modeling systems with one single electrical source at a fixed fundamental frequency, either one generator or an ideal three-phase AC source. This paper aims to extend the DP modeling methodology to a wider application area. Two major achievements have been introduced: 1) application of DPs for multi-source, multi-frequency systems; 2) modeling of systems with time-varying frequencies. These two techniques enable the use of DPs to study nearly all types of electrical power systems (EPS). The developed theory is validated using a twin-generator system from the More Open Electrical Technologies (MOET) project. The accuracy and effectiveness of the developed models is confirmed by comparing the simulation results of detailed switching models and DP models under both balanced and unbalanced conditions.

Abstract: With the expansion and enhancement of the power transmission network, short-circuit current (SCC) has become a major concern in grid operations. While transmission switching is one effective solution to reduce the SCC without investing in additional equipment, switching lines could threaten system N-1 security. To find an efficient, and secure, yet economic switching solution, this paper proposes an optimal transmission switching model with SCC limitation and N-1 reliability. As the relationship between SCC and integer variables associated with the line states is coupled, nonlinear and difficult to explicitly express, an effective linearization method is proposed. Theoretical analysis of the linearization error is performed using an illustrative example. Case studies have shown that the linearization error is generally small and decreases rapidly with the increase of electrical distance. Based on the linearized expression for SCC, a transmission switching model with SCC limitation and N-1 reliability constraints is proposed. Furthermore, to assure the calculation accuracy for the SCC, an iterative algorithm is designed to compensate for the linearization error. Case studies on the modified IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus and practically-sized 300-bus systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The solving efficiency of the model is investigated and discussed as well.

Abstract: In liberalized electricity markets, it is essential and of great importance to develop a fair transmission cost allocation scheme that is able to reflect the "extent of use" of the transmission facilities as much as possible. In this paper, the transmission capacity is divided into four components: capacity used in normal conditions (CN), capacity reserved for contingencies (CC), capacity reserved for future use (CF) and invalid capacity (IC). CN and CC are determined by the power flow in the normal and contingency conditions of the system operation snapshot, respectively. The CF is determined by the maximum power flow in contingency conditions over a certain period (say yearly). The cost corresponding to IC would not be allocated to network users. Based on capacity usage identification, differential cost allocation methods are designed according to the functions of the transmission capacity. The cost corresponding to the capacity usage of the transmission asset under normal and contingency conditions is allocated separately. Case studies in a 3-bus system and the IEEE 30-bus system validate the good performance of the proposed structural transmission cost allocation scheme.

Abstract: Many blackouts in electric power grids throughout the world are caused by cascading outages, which often involve complex processes in various timescales. The multi-timescale nature of cascading outages makes conventional quasi-static simulation methods inaccurate in characterizing actual evolution of outages. This paper proposes a multi-timescale cascading outage model using a quasi-dynamic simulation method. The model establishes a framework for simulating interactions among dynamics in quite different timescales. It realizes simulation of cascading outages with representation of time evolution, so it overcomes ambiguity of time in conventional cascading outage models and hence has better practicality. Moreover, the model considers dynamics, e.g., load variation and generator excitation protection which affect voltage and reactive power profiles. Also, an improved re-dispatch model based on sensitivity is proposed. These improvements facilitate better simulation for a realistic power system. Also, dynamic simulation can be flexibly incorporated into the simulation of short-term processes in this model as needed. Case studies with the proposed multi-timescale model on the IEEE 30-bus system discuss the role of generator protection in cascading outage evolution, and analyze stage characteristics in outages. The multi-timescale model is also demonstrated on a reduced 410-bus US-Canada northeast power grid. Moreover, impacts from dispatchers' involvements are analyzed.

Abstract: Widespread utilization of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) would incur more uncertainties, and thus challenge the traditional planning strategies for distribution systems. In this paper, a scenario-based comprehensive expansion planning (SCEP) approach for distribution systems is presented to cope with future uncertainties. This approach can not only take into account the initial investment and operation costs but also consider the expected adaptation cost to other future scenarios, and in this way the flexibility of an initial planning scheme can be achieved. Future scenarios are identified in line with three uncertainties, namely the conventional load levels, penetration levels of PEVs and whether or not with successful implementation of a coordinated charging strategy. The charging profile for dump charging mode has been determined straightforwardly, while that for coordinated charging mode is obtained by solving the proposed day-ahead dispatching model (DDM). Furthermore, a priority-based real time dispatching strategy (PRTDS) is proposed to obtain direct charging instructions for PEVs, and thus to demonstrate the rationality of utilizing the charging profile acquired from DDM in distribution system expansion planning (DSEP). Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by numerical studies.

Abstract: In this letter, a set of general necessary conditions for line congestions are established during ramping delivery, i.e., the redispatch process for uncertainty accommodation. Mathematically, the consideration of all line flow constraints may cause the intractability of the max-min problem in robust security-constrained unit commitment and dispatch. Without solving time-consuming linear programming (LP) problems, the lines that will not be congested can be quickly identified based on the necessary conditions and corresponding line flow constraints can be removed from the max-min subproblem in robust approaches. A promising application of the conditions is presented via the preprocessed max-min problem with high computational performance.

Abstract: Time delays significantly compromise the performance of wide-area measurement and control system and thus may jeopardize the stability of cyber-physical power systems (CPPS). A delayed CPPS (DCPPS) has a transcendental characteristic equation, leading to an infinite number of eigenvalues basically unsolvable by traditional eigen-analysis methods. In this paper, an explicit infinitesimal generator discretization (EIGD) approach is presented to tackle the traditionally intractable problem. First, the delayed differential equation of DCPPS is transformed to an ordinary differential equation by using an operator called infinitesimal generator. The operator is then optimally discretized, resulting in a highly structured, sparse and explicit approximant matrix. By exploiting the sparsity of the matrix and that of system matrices, the rightmost eigenvalues of the original DCPPS can be accurately computed. The contributions of the EIGD approach lie in the following: 1) it forms a theoretical foundation for accurately obtaining the critical eigenvalues of a CPPS with multiple delays; 2) it constructs a highly structured approximant matrix that enables efficient eigen-analysis of a large DCPPS by making full use of sparsity techniques; and 3) it integrates the shift-invert transformation, Arnoldi algorithm, Newton correction and eigen-sensitivity to form a computational framework for the analysis of large DCPPS. The accuracy, efficiency and scalability of EIGD have been extensively studied and thoroughly validated on the two-area four-machine test system and a practical large transmission grid.

Abstract: Available inertia and variable droop responses from a wind farm to support the short-term frequency control in power systems are analytically evaluated. The novelty lies in the approach to formulating the inertia constant and primary power reserve for a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) that operates at derated conditions. The formulations are extended to evaluate the capability of providing inertia and primary frequency support from a wind farm using an aggregated wind speed. As a consequence, the capability as a function of VSWT operating characteristics and conditions is quantified to rationally adjust the frequency controller gains, thereby ensuring stable performance of the wind farms during frequency transients. A modified system frequency response (SFR) model considering available inertial and droop responses from wind farms is developed to well simulate the SFR following wind power fluctuations. The effectiveness of the analytical method is verified through comparisons of the results with those obtained from the empirical method.

Abstract: With increasing renewable energy resources, price-sensitive loads, and electric-vehicle charging stations in the power grid, uncertainties on both power generation and consumption sides become critical factors in the Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) problem. Recently, worst scenario based robust optimization approaches are employed to consider uncertainties. This paper proposes a non-conservative robust SCUC model and an effective solution approach. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, the commitment and dispatch solution obtained in this paper can be directly used in day-ahead market as it overcomes two issues, conservativeness and absence of robust dispatch, which are the two largest obstacles to applying robust SCUC in real markets. Secondly, a new concept recourse cost requirement, similar to reserve requirement, is proposed to define the upper bound of re-dispatch cost when uncertainties are revealed. Thirdly, a novel decomposition approach is proposed to effectively address the well-known computational challenge in robust approaches. Simulation results on the IEEE 118-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed novel model and solution approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel cooperative charging strategy for a smart charging station in the dynamic electricity pricing environment, which helps electric vehicles (EVs) to economically accomplish the charging task by the given deadlines. This strategy allows EVs to share their battery-stored energy with each other under the coordination of an aggregator, so that more flexibility is given to the aggregator for better scheduling. Mathematically, the scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to capture the discrete nature of the battery states, i.e., charging, idle and discharging. Then, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the MILP by means of dual decomposition and Benders decomposition. At last, the algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion, which makes it scalable and thus suitable for large-scale scheduling problems. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: We propose a model of a battery switching station (BSS) for electric buses (EBs) that captures the predictability of bus operation. We schedule battery charging in the BSS so that every EB arrives to find a battery ready for switching. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal schedule. It uses dual decomposition to decouple the charging decisions at different charging boxes so that independent subproblems can be solved in parallel at individual charging boxes, making the algorithm inherently scalable as the size of the BSS grows. We propose a direct projection method that solves these subproblems rapidly. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed approach is far more efficient and scalable than generic algorithms and existing solvers.

Abstract: Low-frequency inter-area oscillation is a potentially dangerous phenomenon in power systems involving exchange of power among generators in different areas. In this paper, we study the characteristics of inter-area oscillation by analyzing the distribution of the oscillation energy. First, we introduce equations for the kinetic energy of generators and the potential energy of network branches, derived from the linearization of system dynamic equations. Then, we study the mode composition and the distribution of the generators' kinetic energy during low-frequency oscillations. A modal kinetic energy participation factor is proposed for evaluating the participation of each generator in the oscillation. The relationships among electromagnetic power oscillation distribution, rotor speed deviation, and generator kinetic energy are analyzed and compared to their modal parameter left eigenvectors, right eigenvectors, and linear participation factors, respectively. The bus voltage angle deviation, active power oscillation, and branch potential energy are calculated using the right eigenvector from modal analysis. The distribution characteristics of voltage angle oscillation and branch potential energy in inter-area oscillation is developed. The simulation results for a four-generator two-area system and the New England 10-machine 39-bus system illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed theory and method for analysis of inter-area oscillations.

Abstract: In this paper, a modified auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling procedure that can capture time correlation and probability distribution of observed wind-speed time-series data is presented. The procedure introduces frequency decomposition (splitting the wind-speed data into high frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components), shifting, and limiting in addition to differencing and power transformation which are used in the standard ARIMA modeling procedure. The modified modeling procedure is applied to model 10 minute average measured wind-speed data from three locations in the Baltic Sea area and the results show that the procedure can capture time correlation and probability distribution of the data. In addition, it is shown that, for 10-min average wind-speed data in the Baltic Sea area, it could be sufficient to use ARIMA(6,0,0) and ARIMA(0,1,6) to model the HF and LF components of the data, respectively. It is also shown that, in the Baltic Sea area, a model developed for an observed wind-speed data at one location could be used to simulate wind-speed data at a nearby location where only the average wind-speed is known.

Abstract: The dynamic economic dispatch problem is a high-dimensional complex constrained optimization problem that determines the optimal generation from a number of generating units by minimizing the fuel cost. Over the last few decades, a number of solution approaches, including evolutionary algorithms, have been developed to solve this problem. However, the performance of evolutionary algorithms is highly dependent on a number of factors, such as the control parameters, diversity of the population, and constraint-handling procedure used. In this paper, a self-adaptive differential evolution and a real-coded genetic algorithm are proposed to solve the dynamic dispatch problem. In the algorithm design, a new heuristic technique is introduced to guide infeasible solutions towards the feasible space. Moreover, a constraint-handling mechanism, a dynamic relaxation for equality constraints, and a diversity mechanism are applied to improve the performance of the algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated on a number of dynamic economic dispatch problems for a cycle of 24 h. Their simulation results are compared with each other and state-of-the-art algorithms, which reveals that the proposed method has merit in terms of solution quality and reliability.

Abstract: Online disturbance location is of significant importance to wide-area response-based situational awareness, stability analysis and control of the power systems. This paper presents an adaptive online disturbance location method that considers the anisotropy of the frequency propagation speed (FPS). The method geographically partitions the studied power system into several different regions offline. It then extracts the FPS vector for events occurring in each region. The method uses one event simulation for each region. The online simulations take into account changes in the generation, load and power grid topology. The location of the disturbance in each region is estimated specifically based on the speed vector of the region. Parallel computing is used to accelerate the estimation procedure. A part of the North and Central China interconnected power grid, which covers 7 provinces, is selected as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed disturbance location method and to analyze the speedup properties of the parallel computing.

Abstract: In this study, a locally weighted linear regression (LWLR) method is proposed to predict damping ratio of a dominant mode online. The LWLR method, which is nonparametric and data-oriented, is essentially proposed for nonlinear data fitting; therefore, it can track the nonlinear power system operations and help damping ratio prediction in real power systems, which is hardly achieved by the conventional linear regression. To successfully implement this method, the measurement of weighting value and the choice of weighting function as well as its parameter setting, related to prediction accuracy and numerical conditions, are extensively discussed. Simulations are carried out in a two-area four-machine system and a large complex system, China Southern Grid. Both results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Reactive power outputs of DGs are used along with capacitor banks to regulate distribution network voltage. However, reactive power capability of a DG is limited by the inverter ratings and real power outputs of the DG. In order to achieve optimal power flow, minimize power losses, and minimize switching of capacitor banks, a day-ahead coordinated dispatch method of reactive power is proposed. Forecast errors of DG real power in every period are used to estimate the probability distribution of DGs reactive power capacity. Considering different output characteristics and constraints of reactive power sources, a dynamic preliminary-coarse-fine adjustment method is designed to optimize DG and shunt compensator outputs, decrease the switching cost, and reduce loss. The preliminary optimization obtains initial values, and multiple iterations between the coarse and fine optimizations are used to achieve a coordinated result.

Abstract: Displacement of conventional synchronous generators by non-inertial units such as wind or solar generators will result in reduced-system inertia affecting under-frequency response. Frequency control is important to avoid equipment damage, load shedding, and possible blackouts. Wind generators along with energy storage systems can be used to improve the frequency response of low-inertia power system. This paper proposes a fuzzy-logic based frequency controller (FFC) for wind farms augmented with energy storage systems (wind-storage system) to improve the primary frequency response in future low-inertia hybrid power system. The proposed controller provides bidirectional real power injection using system frequency deviations and rate of change of frequency (RoCoF). Moreover, FFC ensures optimal use of energy from wind farms and storage units by eliminating the inflexible de-loading of wind energy and minimizing the required storage capacity. The efficacy of the proposed FFC is verified on the low-inertia hybrid power system.

Abstract: In order to ensure the reliable operation of the electric power grid, infrastructure with increasing levels of distributed generation deployment, various entities and subsystems (e.g., ISOs, distribution utilities, micro-grids) needs a higher level coordination. Such coordination requires a formal decentralized control and management architecture that creates mechanisms for the operation and planning of numerous entities. A key function in power system operations and planning is the determination of total transfer capability (TTC), or the maximum amount of power that can be transferred from a set of source points to a set of sink points. This paper develops an algorithm for the decentralized computation of TTC through the application of the domain decomposition method (DDM). DDM decouples the correlation among interconnected control areas by taking advantage of the Schur complement matrix to form the power transfer distribution factor matrix. The decentralized TTC evaluation requires sparse information exchange among control areas. It is efficient and fully parallelizable. We demonstrate the decentralized TTC evaluation method on the IEEE 118-bus test case.

Abstract: This paper studies the role of hourly economic demand response in the optimization of the stochastic day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems with natural gas transmission constraints. The proposed coordinated stochastic model (referred to as EGTran) considers random outages of generating units and transmission lines, and random errors in forecasting the day-ahead hourly loads. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to create multiple scenarios for representing the coordinated system uncertainties. The nonlinear natural gas network constraints are linearized and incorporated into the stochastic model. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of applying the hourly economic demand response for enhancing the scheduling coordination of natural gas and electricity networks. It is demonstrated that electricity demand response would offer a less volatile hourly load profile and locational marginal prices, and less dependence on natural gas constraints for the optimal operation of electric power systems. The proposed model for EGTran could be applied by grid operators for the hourly commitment and dispatch of power system units.

Abstract: Integrating renewable energy into the modern power grid requires risk-cognizant dispatch of resources to account for the stochastic availability of renewables. Toward this goal, day-ahead stochastic market clearing with high-penetration wind energy is pursued in this paper based on the DC optimal power flow (OPF). The objective is to minimize the social cost which consists of conventional generation costs, end-user disutility, as well as a risk measure of the system re-dispatching cost. Capitalizing on the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the novel model is able to mitigate the potentially high risk of the recourse actions to compensate wind forecast errors. The resulting convex optimization task is tackled via a distribution-free sample average based approximation to bypass the prohibitively complex high-dimensional integration. Furthermore, to cope with possibly large-scale dispatchable loads, a fast distributed solver is developed with guaranteed convergence using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Numerical results tested on a modified benchmark system are reported to corroborate the merits of the novel framework and proposed approaches.

Abstract: Considering recent development of deregulated energy markets and the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, it is important for power system operators to ensure cost effectiveness while maintaining the system reliability. To achieve this goal, significant research progress has recently been made to develop stochastic optimization models and solution methods to improve reliability unit commitment run practice, which is used in the day-ahead market for ISOs/RTOs to ensure sufficient generation capacity available in real time to accommodate uncertainties. Most stochastic optimization approaches assume the renewable energy generation amounts follow certain distributions. However, in practice, the distributions are unknown and instead, a certain amount of historical data are available. In this research, we propose a data-driven risk-averse stochastic unit commitment model, where risk aversion stems from the worst-case probability distribution of the renewable energy generation amount, and develop the corresponding solution methods to solve the problem. Given a set of historical data, our proposed approach first constructs a confidence set for the distributions of the uncertain parameters using statistical inference and solves the corresponding risk-averse stochastic unit commitment problem. Then, we show that the conservativeness of the proposed stochastic program vanishes as the number of historical data increases to infinity. Finally, the computational results numerically show how the risk-averse stochastic unit commitment problem converges to the risk-neutral one, which indicates the value of data.

Abstract: Flexibility is a widely used term in planning process and real-time operation. The existing research on flexibility uses different techniques to study flexibility property from different aspects. While studying a property from various viewpoints increases the understanding on the subject, we need a consistent theoretical framework to consolidate the ideas generated in the field, compare and contrast results, and build on for future analysis. Based on the insights of the nature of flexibility, this paper proposes a unified framework for defining and measuring flexibility in power system. Under the proposed framework, we propose a flexibility metric which evaluates the largest variation range of uncertainty that the system can accommodate. Such a metric takes into account transmission network and system operations constraints, which are critical to assessing flexibility, but are often ignored in literature. A robust optimization technique is used to calculate the proposed metrics. While the illustrative example presented in this paper focuses on the flexibility in real-time system operation in the presence of wind and load uncertainty, this framework can generally be applicable to long-term studies such as system planning.

Abstract: Voltage problems are challenging in modern power systems with a high penetration of renewables integrated via power electronics. This paper extends the transient time-scale classification to identify voltage dynamics in modern power systems. Voltage dynamics in the current control time-scale is firstly proposed and then the mechanism of terminal voltage change is elaborated. After that the significant influences of the voltage source converter (VSC), current control (CC) loop and voltage feed forward (VFF) on the voltage dynamics in the current control time-scale are discussed. The VSC current control loop provides positive damping on the terminal voltage, while the VFF scheme results in an additional loop that deteriorates terminal voltage dynamic performance and stability. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the influence of critical parameters on stability. Finally, simulation results of a current-controlled VSC attached to different strength of AC grids (including a weak grid) are presented to validate the phenomenon and the influencing factors of voltage dynamics in the current control time-scale.

Abstract: A hierarchical unit commitment (HUC) model is presented with the objective of maintaining system security by scheduling reserves in power systems with high wind penetration. The reserves in the HUC model include generation reserve, ramping reserve, and transmission reserve. These three reserves are proposed to guarantee system security with uncertain wind power. Moreover, the simplifications for the transmission reserve are applied to reduce computational burden. The hierarchical scheduling strategy, which considers both conventional and emergency operations, divides the wind power output into two intervals based on confidence levels, and uses different scheduling strategies for different intervals of wind power output. Finally, case studies compare HUC with RUC and SUC, which shows the effectiveness in system safety enhancement and the effectiveness in practical systems of the proposed HUC model.

Abstract: Oscillations threaten the stability of a power system. Timely detecting oscillations can improve operators' situational awareness of system stability and enable remedial reactions. To detect oscillations during their early stages, this paper proposes a cross-coherence method using multiple-channel phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Oscillations are related to the peaks in coherence spectra and can be detected by visual inspection and setting up a threshold. Using simulation data, it is shown that the proposed coherence method can detect oscillations even under low signal-to-noise ratios. Three algorithms for estimating coherence spectra are implemented and evaluated. Their performances are compared using Monte Carlo methods. Based on the comparison, this paper makes some recommendations for proper use of the algorithms.

Abstract: High penetration of distributed energy resources presents several challenges and opportunities for voltage regulation in power distribution systems. A local reactive power (VAR) control framework will be developed that can fast respond to voltage mismatch and address the robustness issues of (de-)centralized approaches against communication delays and noises. Using local bus voltage measurements, the proposed gradient-projection based schemes explicitly account for the VAR limit of every bus, and are proven convergent to a surrogate centralized problem with proper parameter choices. This optimality result quantifies the capability of local VAR control without requiring any real-time communications. The proposed framework and analysis generalize earlier results on the droop VAR control design, which may suffer from under-utilization of VAR resources in order to ensure stability. Numerical tests have demonstrated the validity of our analytical results and the effectiveness of proposed approaches implemented on realistic three-phase systems.

Abstract: As advances in scientific and business data collection have exponentially created more data, electric utility companies are seeking new tools and techniques to turn the collected data into operational insights and assist with cost-saving decisions. The cost of building a specific business-driven big data application, however, can be tremendously high. This paper proposes developing a standard-based software framework to address key utility big data issues and foster development of big data analytical applications. Based on the support of this generic framework, new big data analytical solutions can be rapidly built and deployed to improve business practices in a utility organization. The proposed framework-based approach, as demonstrated in the conducted case studies, has proven to be promising for addressing the emerging big data challenges in the utility industry.

Abstract: This paper describes an online short-term voltage stability assessment scheme from an overall view of the load area in the power system. In this scheme, data acquisitions are completed by post-contingency phasor measurements and a time series shapelet classification method is employed for classification learning. Combined with decision trees, this novel approach can not only hold a high performance of classification but also offer an acceptable interpretation of classification results. An improved algorithm to speed up shapelet searching is proposed, which makes it more practical. Semi-supervised cluster learning is also adopted in this scheme to mitigate the unreliability of the previous practical criteria. The test results on the Nordic test system demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Existing population-based Stochastic Search Algorithms (SSAs) are too time-consuming to solve dynamic optimal power flow (OPF). The solution proposed in this paper is to accelerate SSAs with memory. Two memory schemes, the similarity retrieval scheme and the mean-based immigrants scheme, are proposed and applied together to the Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimizer, which are two representatives of SSAs. Experiments are conducted on modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems with changing load buses and the objective of minimizing real power transmission loss. The results show that the proposed schemes significantly improve the performance of the two existing algorithms, and that SSAs could be practical for tracking optima of dynamic OPF.

Abstract: Auctions with non-convexities, as considered in this paper, use a multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) model based on generators' offers to calculate efficient schedules. The standard locational marginal prices (LMPs) may not support these schedules and uplifts are needed to help the generators break even. This paper presents a direct minimum-uplift (DMU) pricing model, which is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem with uplift minimization objective. New DMU prices are major variables constrained with decomposition formula based on shift factors, similar to the actual practice of developing LMPs. The remaining constraints reflect the generators' profits and uplifts modeled as functions of the DMU prices. The main feature of the DMU model is individual rationality attained in pool-based auction, under prices properly reflecting network constraints, complemented with minimum uplifts. The model is validated on several cases, including the IEEE 24-node system.
