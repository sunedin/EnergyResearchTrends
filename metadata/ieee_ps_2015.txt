Abstract: Imbalance settlement markets are managed by the system operators and provide a mechanism for settling the inevitable discrepancies between contractual agreements and physical delivery. In European power markets, settlements schemes are mainly based on heuristic penalties. These arrangements have disadvantages: First, they do not provide transparency about the cost of the reserve capacity that the system operator may have obtained ahead of time, nor about the cost of the balancing energy that is actually deployed. Second, they can be gamed if market participants use the imbalance settlement as an opportunity for market arbitrage, for example if market participants use balancing energy to avoid higher costs through regular trade on illiquid energy markets. Third, current practice hinders the market-based integration of renewable energy and the provision of financial incentives for demand response through rigid penalty rules. In this paper we try to remedy these disadvantages by proposing an imbalance settlement procedure with an incentive compatible cost allocation scheme for reserve capacity and deployed energy. Incentive compatible means that market participants voluntarily and truthfully state their valuation of ancillary services. We show that this approach guarantees revenue sufficiency for the system operator and provides financial incentives for balance responsible parties to keep imbalances close to zero.

Abstract: This paper presents a short-term power regulation mechanism for post-segmentation power distribution systems in the presence of severe fault or large disturbance. Firstly, load priority is introduced into system separation and centroids of load clusters are allocated at nodes with distributed sources, respecting power balance and network connectedness. Secondly, fast power flow calculation is performed on the primarily formed islands to resolve load interruption for operational feasibility of partitions from power quality perspective. Then the effect of distributed generation fluctuations on durable operation of subsystems with various optimization objectives is examined. The load response is instructed by the proposed cost-based pricing scheme contemplating consumers' willingness. In addition, the influence of network congestion and load controllability on results of economic scheduling is investigated. Numerical results from the PG&E-69 distribution system are used to show the effectiveness of the developed model in radial structure load clusters. Illustration on the IEEE 118-bus case further proves its robustness and practicability for other distribution systems applications. This property is also useful for transmission switching and micro-grid applications.

Abstract: Aluminum production relies on the smelting process which consumes huge amounts of electrical energy. One possible solution to reduce the fossil fuel consumption by aluminum production is the integration of wind power. Based on this background, this paper studies an isolated power system for aluminum smelting production with a high penetration of wind power. A dynamic model of the aluminum smelter load (ASL) is introduced in this paper using the field experiment data. Based on this model, the dynamic model of the isolated system considering demand side participation is proposed. The MPC-based frequency controller is proposed to keep the frequency deviation within a proper range (0.1 Hz) under wind power fluctuation as well as to recover the system frequency after a large disturbance (such as one generator trip). Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC based frequency controller.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control method to coordinate multiple energy storage systems (ESS) spread across an AC microgrid. Each storage unit controls its own local node voltage (i.e., where the storage is connected in the network) as well as a global node voltage (i.e., a remote location in the network) that is controlled by all ESSs together. The storage power output is controlled in a way that the node voltage is restored and maintained in case it drops or rises outside the predefined limits. This can occur due to disturbances, such as load changes, loss of distributed generators (DGs), or power limitations in the DGs. In order to determine the power reference for each storage unit, a state of charge (SoC) based adaptive deadband droop control is used. In this decentralized control, the storage power output is inversely proportional to its SoC. By using this approach, the ESS with higher SoC will inject more power whereas storage units with lower SoC will inject less power, leading to more balanced SoC levels among the ESSs. The controller is tested in a microgrid in both island-and grid-connected modes in different scenarios. The microgrid includes several DGs that operate in different control modes depending on the microgrid operation. The storage unit configurations differ in their response time and capacity. This has significant implication in dynamic response of the storage units which is scrutinized in this paper with time-domain simulation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel formulation of the Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) optimization model. For a given electric three-phase circuit feeder, network models are built using a quasi-symmetric impedance matrix TRX representing the entire structure and topology of the radial network. As a key contribution, the state variables of demands and generators connected to large-scale distribution grids are obtained by using a convenient matrix reduction technique. As a result, the size of the optimization problem is considerably reduced with respect to the jacobian formulation by considering radial and weakly meshed exploitation and elimination of interconnecting nodes. Results and comparative analysis are presented using the IEEE 4-, 13-, 37-, 123-, and 8500-node test systems.

Abstract: Distribution microgrids are being challenged by reverse power flows and voltage fluctuations due to renewable generation, demand response, and electric vehicles. Advances in photovoltaic (PV) inverters offer new opportunities for reactive power management provided PV owners have the right investment incentives. In this context, reactive power compensation is considered here as an ancillary service. Accounting for the increasing time-variability of distributed generation and demand, a stochastic reactive power compensation scheme is developed. Given uncertain active power injections, an online reactive control scheme is devised. This scheme is distribution-free and relies solely on power injection data. Reactive injections are updated using the Lagrange multipliers of a second-order cone program. Numerical tests on an industrial 47-bus microgrid and the residential IEEE 123-bus feeder corroborate the reactive power management efficiency of the novel stochastic scheme over its deterministic alternative, as well as its capability to track variations in solar generation and household demand.

Abstract: Increased penetration of renewable energy leads to increased challenges for the transmission system operators (TSOs) to operate their system in a secure way. Through the limited means available to the TSOs to manage power flows in the system, reliability is jeopardized. Reliability must be managed differently, replacing the current ways of reliability management which fails as uncertainty increases. In this paper, a novel risk-based approach of system operation is proposed that can be helpful for the TSOs to assess the confidence of system operation day-ahead, that is, the probability of the forecasted system to end up in an insecure state is calculated. This paper only focuses on violation of power flow constraints in the system. It also demonstrates the increase of this operation confidence using already installed power flow controlling devices. It is shown that these devices aid in enhancing confidence of system operation by shifting power flows to a more optimal one in the light of generation uncertainty. The main emphasis is laid on preventive action. The proposed approach is demonstrated on test systems.

Abstract: The DC power flow model is in widespread utilization in electricity-market applications and contingency analysis. The presented versions of this model can be classified into two categories: state-dependent, or Hot-Start, models and state-independent, or Cold-Start, models. A reasonable accuracy is reported in the literature regarding Hot-Start models as they take into account branch losses and bus voltages by using available base point. On the contrary, due to the absence of base point in Cold-Start models, branch losses must be either neglected or guessed (which is an uncertain precautionary measure), or evaluated by a cumbersome iteration process. In addition, the bus voltage profiles are inevitably considered to be flat. Hence, the accuracy of available Cold-Start models in different circumstances remains of great concern. This paper addresses this concern and unveils a new Cold-Start model that does not rely on a risky assumption. In other words, there will be no lossless or flat voltage profile assumption in the presented approach whereas the equations remain linear. Besides, the exact effect of the net reactive loads on phase angles is considered and, consequently, the reactive power balance equations are reflected in the model for the first time.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized two-level structure for real-time modal estimation of large power systems using ambient synchrophasor data. It introduces two distributed algorithms that fit the structure well, namely, 1) decentralized frequency domain decomposition and 2) decentralized recursive stochastic subspace identification. As opposed to present-day oscillation monitoring methodologies, the bulk of the algorithmic computations is done locally at the substation level in the two-level framework. Substation modal estimates are sent to the control center where they are grouped, analyzed, and combined to extract system modal properties of local and inter-area modes. The framework and the proposed algorithms provide a scalable methodology for handling oscillation monitoring from a large number of substations efficiently. The two-level structure and the two decentralized algorithms are tested using simulated data from standard test systems and from archived real power system synchrophasor data.

Abstract: This paper models and analyzes a power distribution system with sources connected through inverters. The stabilizing effect of generator rotational inertia is emulated through inverter droop control logic. We model the nonlinear dynamics of the system with multiple distributed droop inverters using dynamical phasors. Linearizing the system around the steady-state, we construct closed-loop transfer functions from exogenous disturbances to system states. This allows to evaluate the load disturbance impact on the inverter power and line voltage profile. As an example, the distribution system with 150 inverters is used to illustrate the approach.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) as distributed storage devices have the potential to provide frequency regulation services due to the fast adjustment of charging/discharging power. In our previous research, decentralized vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control methods for EVs were proposed to participate in primary frequency control. In this paper, our attention is on bringing a large number of EVs into the centralized supplementary frequency regulation (SFR) of interconnected power systems. An aggregator is the coordinator between EVs and the power system control center. The aggregator calculates the total frequency regulation capacity (FRC) and expected V2G (EV2G) power of EVs based on the data communicated between the aggregator and individual EVs or EV charging stations. With FRC and EV2G power, a V2G control strategy is proposed for the aggregator to dispatch regulation requirements to EVs and EV charging stations. In individual EV charging stations, the FRC is calculated on the basis of the V2G power at present time, and EV2G power is presented considering both frequency regulation and charging demands. Besides, V2G control strategies are developed to distribute regulation requirements to each EV. Simulations on an interconnected power grid based on a practical power grid in China have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: A method for solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem including HVDC connected offshore wind farms is presented in this paper. Different factors have been considered in the proposed method, namely, voltage source converter (VSC-HVDC) and line-commutated converter high-voltage DC (LCC-HVDC) link constraints, doubly fed induction generators' (DFIGs) capability curve as well as the uncertainties of wind power generation. Information gap decision theory (IGDT) is utilized for handling the uncertainties associated with the volatility of wind power generation. It is computationally efficient and does not require the probability density function of wind speed. The proposed decision-making framework finds the optimal decision variables in a way that they remain robust against the considered uncertainties. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied on the IEEE 118-bus system. The obtained results validate the applicability of the proposed IGDT-based OPF model for optimal operation of AC/DC power systems with high penetration of offshore wind farms.

Abstract: The voltage source converter (VSC) station is playing a more important role in modern power systems, but the dynamic behavior of the VSC station is quite different from that of the synchronous generator. This paper presents the synchronous generator emulation control (SGEC) strategy for the VSC-HVDC station. The SGEC strategy is divided into the inner control loop and the outer control loop. The inner controller is developed for fast current and voltage regulations. An inertia element is introduced into the frequency-power droop to determine the command reference of the frequency, and the inertia response and the primary frequency regulation are emulated. In addition, the secondary frequency regulation can be achieved by modulating the scheduled power in the SGEC strategy. The time-domain simulation results demonstrate the VSC station with the proposed control strategy can provide desired frequency support to a low-inertia grid. Therefore, the SGEC strategy provides a simple and practical solution for the VSC station to emulate the behavior of a synchronous generator.

Abstract: A global multiscale method based on a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm to characterize the global behavior of transient processes recorded using wide-area sensors is proposed. The method interprets global dynamic behavior in terms of both, spatial patterns or shapes and temporal patterns associated with dynamic modes containing essentially single-frequency components, from which the mode shapes, frequencies and growth and decay rates of the modes can be extracted simultaneously. These modes are then used to detect the coherent and dominant structures within the data. The technique is well suited for fast wide-area monitoring and assessment of global instability in the context of modern data fusion-based estimation techniques. Results of the application of the proposed method to large, high-dimensional data sets are encouraging.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic multiplier-based Lagrangian relaxation approach for the solution to multi-area economic dispatch (MAED) in a fully decentralized manner. Dynamic multipliers refer to the multipliers associated with power balance equations at tie-line buses in each area. Dynamic multipliers can be approximated as linear functions of tie-line power exports via sensitivity analysis and can serve as the equivalent supply/demand functions to neighboring areas. In contrast to the conventional static point-wise multiplier, which is unable to reflect the marginal cost change that results from variations in the power exchange level, the proposed dynamic multiplier provides each area the look-ahead capability to foresee the range of the marginal cost for power export over a range of tie-line exchange variations. In turn, this allows for a significantly faster convergence to the global optimal solution. The algorithm is also shown to be early termination friendly, which is very desirable in practice for ultra-large systems such as the State Grid of China. Numerical examples in a 6-bus system, a 3-area 354-bus IEEE system, and large test systems illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: This paper develops an analytical model of an unbalanced radial distribution system consisting of a single-phase photovoltaic (PV), a three-phase induction machine load, a three-phase power factor correction capacitor (PFC), and a load. The analytical model is based on dynamic phasors (DP) for phases. The single-phase PV model includes inverter current control [proportional resonance (PR) controller], an L, or an LCL filter. The induction machine model is based on positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence components' dynamic phasors. The sequence-based induction machine model was converted to the DP-reference frame and interconnected with other grid components. The developed analytical model is capable of small-signal analysis and can be used to identify variety of stability and/or harmonic issues in distribution networks, e.g., instability due to weak grid. Impact of unbalance on system dynamic performance can also be investigated using this model. The analytical model is benchmarked with a high-fidelity model built in Matlab/SimPowerSystems where power electronic switching details are included. The small-signal analysis results are validated via Matlab/SimPowerSystems time-domain simulations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a two-stage stochastic program for transmission planning. The model has two dependent random variables, namely, total electric load and available wind power. Given univariate marginal distributions for these two random variables and their correlation coefficient, the joint distribution is modeled using a Gaussian copula. The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is solved based on the linearized direct current (DC) power flow. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) network model and its load and wind data are used for a test case. A 95% confidence interval is formed on the optimality gap of candidate solutions obtained using a sample average approximation with 200 and 300 samples from the joint distribution of load and wind.

Abstract: Measuring the efficiency of power plant systems requires capturing fluctuations in the level of sales to customers as well as accounting for the effects of regulatory caps on emissions. This study proposes a novel effectiveness measure considering desirable outputs and undesirable outputs via data envelopment analysis (DEA). The new measure complements typical efficiency measures. We test the validity of the proposed measure with an empirical case study of the fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We find that the current interregional electricity transmission plan increases 8.56% in effectiveness. For the emissions control, we suggest a 9.8% reduction in electricity generation towards an effective production frontier. We conclude that the proposed effectiveness measure's ability to distinguish sales and regulation effects from typical productive efficiency eliminates the bias often found in currently used measures.

Abstract: In future smart grids, with distribution networks having loops more frequently, current transmission contingency analysis (TCA) which usually neglects the distribution power flow variations after a contingency may leave out severe outages. With more distribution management systems deployed on the distribution side, a new transmission CA method based on global power flow (GPF) analysis which integrates both the transmission and distribution power flow is proposed in this paper (named as GTCA) to address the problem. The definition and new features of GTCA are first introduced. Then, the necessity of GTCA is physically illustrated. Difference in the results of GTCA and TCA is mathematically analyzed. A GPF-embedded algorithm of performing GTCA is then provided. The data exchange process and the performance with communication interruptions are discussed. As multiple contingencies are considered in GTCA, several approaches are proposed and discussed to reduce communication burdens and improve the computational efficiency. Plenty of numerical tests are performed in several systems to verify the theoretical analysis. With theoretical analysis and numerical verification, it is suggested that GTCA should be performed instead of TCA to avoid potential false alarms, especially in the condition that DNs are more frequently looped in the future smart grids.

Abstract: The deployment of the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in distribution systems provides an excellent opportunity for load monitoring applications. Load decomposition can be done at the smart meters level, providing a better understanding of the load behavior at near-real-time. In this paper, loads' current and voltage waveforms are processed offline to form a comprehensive library. This library consists of a set of measurements projected onto the eigenloads space. Eigenloads are basically the eigenvectors describing the load signatures space. Similar to human faces, every load has a distinct signature. Each load measurement is transformed into a photo and an efficient face recognition algorithm is applied to the set of photos. A list of all the online devices is always stored and can be accessed at any time. The proposed method can be implemented at the smart meters level. The distributed computation that can be achieved by performing simple calculations at each smart meter, without the need for sending intensive data to a central processor, is beneficial. From a system operator perspective, load composition in near-real-time provides the loads' voltage dependence that are needed, for example, in volt-VAR optimization (VVO) in distribution systems. Further applications of load composition data are also discussed.

Abstract: Variable power sources are becoming increasingly common in low-inertia microgrids. Inadequate amounts, however, can disrupt electric service if ramped events occur too quickly. The authors introduce an approach to predict how long microgrids can withstand ramped events as a function of local inertia. Although microgrids can ride through disturbances using local inertia and other technologies, it is not clear for how long disturbances can be tolerated-particularly when in progress. The estimated reaction times are presented, first, as stability margins to illustrate how ramp-rate magnitudes relate to local inertia. Then, use of the reaction times is demonstrated as a forward-looking capability to anticipate frequency deviation times as a microgrid model undergoes large solar ramp rates. It is shown that the available remaining times can be estimated even as disturbances and remedial actions take place.

Abstract: This paper discusses the need for short circuit analysis in real-time applications of modern distribution networks and presents a short circuit tool that builds on recent advances in Fortescue-based current injection power flow. The proposed short circuit computation (SCC) method is fundamentally based on the symmetrical components transformation of three-phase, two-phase, and one-phase systems. Unlike the classical symmetrical components SCC method that postulates a structurally symmetrical three-phase pre-fault network with balanced loading, the proposed method accounts for multiphase networks that are comprised of three-phase, two-phase, and one-phase network parts; given a pre-fault power flow solution, it requires a maximum of three current injection iterations to compute the short circuit current flow in the entire network. Numerical results show that the Fortescue SCC approach with multiphase lines exhibits significant computational performance improvement on large-scale networks as compared to classical SCC in phase coordinates.

Abstract: The significant growth in gas-fired units worldwide has increased the grade of interdependency between power and natural gas networks. Since these units are usually required to ramp up during the peak and backup intermittent renewable generation and contingencies, the power system tends to demand more flexibility and reliability from the gas system. This paper contributes with a novel mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) formulation that couples power and gas networks taking into account the gas traveling velocity and compressibility. As a result, the model accounts for the gas adequacy needed to assure the power system reliability in the short term. The robustness of the MILP formulation allows guaranteeing global optimality within predefined tolerances. Case studies integrate the IEEE 24-bus system and Belgian high-calorific gas network for validating the formulation.

Abstract: Variations of load demands and generations bring multiple uncertainties to power system operation. Under this situation, power flows become increasingly uncertain, especially when significant distributed generations (DGs), such as wind and solar, are integrated into power systems. In this paper, a Complex Affine arithmetic based unbalanced Three-phase Forward-Backward Sweep power flow model (CATFBS) is proposed to study the impacts of uncertainties in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. An index of Relative Influence of Uncertain Variables on Outcomes (RIUVO) is proposed for quantifying the impacts of individual uncertain factors on power flows and bus voltages. The CATFBS method is tested on the modified IEEE 13-bus system and a modified 292-bus system. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms the Monte Carlo method for exploring the impacts of uncertainties on the operation of distribution systems. The proposed CATFBS method can be used by power system operators and planners to effectively monitor and control unbalanced distribution systems under various uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper presents a co-optimization planning model that considers the long-term interdependency of natural gas and electricity infrastructures. The model incorporates the natural gas transportation planning objective in the co-optimization planning of power generation and transmission systems. The co-optimization planning model is decomposed into a least-cost master investment problem for natural gas and electricity systems which interacts with two operation subproblems representing the feasibility (security) and the optimality (economic) of the proposed co-optimization. In addition, the natural gas subproblem would check the feasibility of fuel supply transportation system as part of the proposed co-optimization planning. The co-optimization planning of electricity and natural gas infrastructures would satisfy the desired power system reliability criterion. The iterative process will continue between the co-optimization investment and the operation subproblems until an economic, secure, reliable, and fuel-supply feasible planning for the two interdependent infrastructures is obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization planning approach.

Abstract: With the increasingly high demand for well-trained power systems engineers, the University of Pittsburgh has partnered with Eaton in the creation of the new Electric Power Systems Laboratory at the Swanson School of Engineering. This laboratory demands the capability to perform a wide variety of experimental procedures while providing students and researchers with a seamless working environment. To accomplish that goal, a novel lab workbench was developed. This lab workbench integrates the load banks necessary for laboratory procedures with advanced metering, controls and safety features, and contains them within a work station ideally suited for the laboratory space. This paper details the development of those lab workbenches, from concept, to design, to prototype construction, to testing. Additionally, this work describes planned classroom experiments utilizing the developed bench. Ultimately the realized workbench demonstrates its capability to be reconfigured to suit the demands of both education as well as new research projects for undergraduate and graduate studies.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct, fit, and validate a hidden Markov model for predicting variability and uncertainty in generation from distributed (PV) systems. The model is unique in that it: 1) predicts metrics that are directly related to operational reserves, 2) accounts for the effects of stochastic volatility and geographic autocorrelation, and 3) conditions on latent variables referred to as "volatility states." We fit and validate the model using 1-min resolution generation data from approximately 100 PV systems in the California Central Valley or the Los Angeles coastal area, and condition the volatility state of each system at each time on 15-min resolution generation data from nearby PV systems (which are available from over 6000 PV systems in our data set). We find that PV variability distributions are roughly Gaussian after conditioning on hidden states. We also propose a method for simulating hidden states that results in a very good upper bound for the probability of extreme events. Therefore, the model can be used as a tool for planning additional reserve capacity requirements to balance solar variability over large and small spatial areas.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel solution method is proposed for the optimal topology control problem in AC framework with N-1 reliability. The resultant new topology of the proposed method is guaranteed to yield a better objective function value than the global solution of the problem with the original topology. In order to prove our statement, semi-definite programming relaxation is formulated to find a lower bound to the objective function value of the problem. The proposed method is favorable for parallelization to increase the computational efficiency, and the parallel computing flowchart is presented. Computational time of the algorithm for IEEE test cases is reported. An in-house power market simulator is developed to simulate a market environment complete with optimal topology control mechanism. Simulations held by participating human subjects are analyzed under the subtitles of the total operating cost, real power losses, and locational marginal price (LMP) variance. A simple example is illustrated to show that the resultant network topology may increase the real power losses while still providing a lower operating system cost than that of the original topology.

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit breaker (CB) aging failure model based on condition monitoring. This model is inserted into a basic CB Markov model and applied in substation reliability assessment. The proposed model can accurately incorporate the wearing status and aging process of CBs. The results from applying the proposed method to a utility substation configuration demonstrate that ignoring aging failures of CBs can lead to significant underestimation of substation unreliability.

Abstract: This paper presents the coordinated design of multiple FACTS supplementary damping controllers to improve system small-signal stability. A BMI-based multi-objective multi-model system approach is formulated to solve the robust damping control problem. Two-step method is proposed to determine controller variables. Regional pole placement and control effort optimization are set as the control objectives. An SVC and a TCSC damping controller are designed sequentially with minimized decoupling effort. Selection of the feedback signals for the FACTS damping controllers is realized by evaluating the modal residues of each feedback signal to the system input. To cover multiple inter-area oscillation modes, wide-area decentralized control methodology is proposed and remote feedback signals are selected. Real-time simulation is carried out on real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to test the performance of the proposed controller. The results show that the FACTS damping controllers are feasible and able to increase system damping to a satisfactory level under different system operating points.

Abstract: Contingency analysis has been an integral part of power system planning and operations. Dynamic contingency analysis is often performed with offline simulation studies, due to its intense computational effort. Due to a large number of possible system variations, covering all combinations in planning studies is very challenging. Contingencies must be chosen carefully to cover a wider group of possibilities, while ensuring system security. This paper proposes a method to classify dynamic contingencies into different clusters, according to their behavioral patterns, in particular, with respect to voltage recovery patterns. The most severe contingency from each cluster becomes the representative of other contingencies in the corresponding cluster. Using the information of contingency clusters, a new concept called dynamic voltage control area (DVCA) is derived. The concept of DVCA will address the importance of the location of dynamic reactive reserves. Simulations have been completed on the modified IEEE 162-bus system to test and validate the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper studies the online dynamic security assessment (DSA) of future distribution systems in which multiple electrically coupled microgrids are operated as an interconnection. By leveraging the highly controllable power-electronics-based interfaces, we propose a novel interface control strategy for desirable load sharing among interconnected microgrids. Under such a control framework, theoretical results on system-wide stability criteria in the sense of Lyapunov are obtained. Potential application of these results for microgrid-based smart distribution system DSA is presented. Minimum information exchange is required among microgrid modules and the distribution system operator, which is a highly desirable feature in future distribution management systems. Numerical studies of a five-microgrid study system designed based on the IEEE 123-node test feeder show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and DSA framework.

Abstract: This paper addresses an advanced vector current control for a voltage source converter (VSC) connected to a weak grid. The proposed control methodology permits high-performance regulation of the active power and the voltage for the feasible VSC range of operation. First, the steady state characteristics for a power converter connected to a very weak system with a short circuit ratio (SCR) of 1 are discussed in order to identify the system limits. Then, the conventional vector control (inner loop) and the conventional power/voltage control (outer loop) stability and frequency responses are analyzed. From the analysis of the classic structure, an enhanced outer loop based on a decoupled and gain-scheduling controller is presented and its stability is analyzed. The proposed control is validated by means of dynamic simulations and it is compared with classic vector current control. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control system could provide a promising approach to tackle the challenging problem of VSC in connection with weak AC grids.

Abstract: This paper proposes a vehicle-to-grid reactive power support (V2GQ) strategy for optimal coordinated voltage regulation in distribution networks with high distributed generation (DG) penetration. The proposed algorithm employs plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), DG, and on-load tap changer (OLTC) to satisfy PEV charging demand and grid voltage requirements with relaxed tap operation, and minimum DG active power curtailment. The voltage regulation problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming and consists of three consecutive stages, in which successive stages apply the outputs of their preceding stages as constraints. The first stage aims to maximize the energy delivered to PEVs to assure PEV owner satisfactions. The second stage maximizes the DG extracted active power. Third stage minimizes the voltage deviation from its nominal value utilizing the available PEV and DG reactive powers. The main implicit objective of the third stage problem is relaxing the OLTC tap operation. In addition, the conventional OLTC control is replaced by a proposed centralized controller that utilizes the output of the third stage to set its tap position. Real-time simulations are developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal coordinated algorithm on a typical distribution network using OPAL-RT real-time simulator (RTS) in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to estimate modal parameters of power systems for monitoring and analyzing the embedded modes of small signal oscillations. The proposed approach applies continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to identify damping and frequency of critical modes based on its time-frequency localization capability. The CWT has modified Morlet function as its mother wavelet. A procedure is also presented to fine-tune settings of the modified Morlet function of the CWT based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Shannon's entropy criterion. Additionally, high computational burden of the time-frequency methods is an important obstacle in online monitoring of power systems by these methods. To remedy this problem, the convolution integral of the CWT is calculated by efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) routine in the proposed approach leading to a low computational burden. The proposed approach is compared with several other signal processing methods for modal identification of power systems. These comparisons illustrate effectiveness of the proposed approach, regarding run time, persistency against noise and estimation accuracy for online monitoring of small signal oscillations.

Abstract: Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in "tighter" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.

Abstract: Isolated microgrid power systems are prone to large frequency and voltage deviations, since they have limited generation and finite inertia and may include pulse power loads and large proportion of dynamic loads. Thus, they require effective power management methods to operate optimally, while satisfying operating and security constraints. In this paper, a novel integrated security-constrained model-based power management approach is proposed for isolated microgrids in all-electric ships during the normal/alert operating state. The new power management method was formulated as a multi-objective optimal control problem. A method based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II was developed to solve the problem. The developed integrated security-constrained power management approach was applied to a notional all-electric ship computer model. The simulation results, conducted in PSCAD, showed the effectiveness of the new power management method.

Abstract: Estimation of electromechanical modes of a power system has attracted attention in the past few decades because it can provide vital information about the stability of the system. In this paper, a new state-space model is proposed for online detection of parameters of a ringdown signal using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed model can estimate both constant and time-varying parameters. Furthermore, stability analysis of the proposed model is performed to demonstrate the convergence of the parameters. Simulation results confirm the desirable performance of the proposed method for ringdown parameter estimation.

Abstract: This paper presents a multiphase continuation power flow (MCPF) methodology to perform voltage security analyses on unbalanced multiphase distribution systems. The proposed tool includes comprehensive models of most network components, and allows for explicit representation of neutral cables and grounding connections. The methodology has been validated through comparisons with a commercial software and with results available in the literature. Additional analyses are presented using the IEEE 4-bus, the Neutral-to-Earth (NEV) and the IEEE 8500 Test Systems. These systems have been developed to present several challenges to distribution systems analytical tools. In particular, the influence of the 3-phase transformer connections on the PV curves have been demonstrated and has been useful to stress the importance of a complete system representation.

Abstract: It is of paramount importance that power system operators be able to assess transient stability in order to realize a reliable and stable power supply. Transient stability analysis can be formulated as a large-scale system of differential and algebraic equations (DAE). However, as power systems are becoming larger and more complex, it is becoming difficult to solve DAE in a practical amount of time for system operations. Parallel computing based on the waveform relaxation method is an effective solution to achieve faster calculations for transient stability analysis. To enhance the performance of the waveform relaxation method, a proper partitioning of the original problem is essential. Although various partitioning approaches have been used, those approaches might not be effective when analyzing a weakly damped low-frequency oscillation. In particular, in the Japanese 60-Hz power system, this oscillation becomes an important problem. To resolve this issue, in this paper we have developed a new partitioning method that is better suited to analyzing a weakly damped low-frequency oscillation based on eigenvalue analysis. Specifically, effective partitioning can be automatically determined by the proposed index, which can evaluate the validity of the partitioning. The proposed method was tested using the Japanese standards of the IEEJ WEST10 system model and the WEST30 system model.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel comprehensive operation and self-healing strategy for a distribution system with both dispatchable and nondispatchable distributed generators (DGs). In the normal operation mode, the control objective of the system is to minimize the operation costs and maximize the revenues. A rolling-horizon optimization method is used to schedule the outputs of dispatchable DGs based on forecasts. In the self-healing mode, the on-outage portion of the distribution system will be optimally sectionalized into networked self-supplied microgrids (MGs) so as to provide reliable power supply to the maximum loads continuously. The outputs of the dispatchable DGs will be rescheduled accordingly too. In order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumptions, we formulate the problems as a stochastic program. A scenario reduction method is applied to achieve a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden. A modified IEEE 123-node distribution system is used as a test system. The results of case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems with flexible resources for managing the variability of renewable energy sources (RES). The flexible resources include thermal units with up/down ramping capability, energy storage, and hourly demand response (DR). The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used in this paper for simulating random outages of generation units and transmission lines as well as representing hourly forecast errors of loads and RES. Numerical tests are conducted for a 6-bus system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system and the results demonstrate the benefits of applying demand response as a viable option for managing the RES variability in the least-cost stochastic power system operations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a DC optimal power flow (OPF) framework for storage portfolio optimization in transmission-constrained power networks. In particular, this model is designed to investigate two problems: 1) optimizing storage operation and allocation over a network given a fixed technology portfolio and 2) optimizing the storage portfolio (i.e., the size, technology, and network allocation of these resources). We demonstrate this framework using case studies based on the IEEE 14-bus test system with four different storage technologies. Our results show that although certain technologies are generally classified as being suitable for either power or energy services, many technologies can add value to the system by performing both fast-time scale regulation (power) and load-shifting (energy) services. These results suggest that limiting the type of service that a certain technology is compensated for may result in inefficiencies at the system level and under-valuation of storage.

Abstract: Particle filters provide a general framework for dynamic state estimation (DSE) in nonlinear systems. The scope for particle filter-based DSE can be significantly enhanced by exploiting data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) when available at higher sampling frequencies. In this paper, we present a particle filtering approach to dynamically estimate the states of a synchronous generator in a multi-machine setting considering the excitation and prime mover control systems. The filter relies on typical output measurements assumed available from PMUs stationed at generator buses. The performance of the proposed filter is illustrated with dynamic simulations on IEEE 14-bus system including: 1) generators models with subtransient dynamics, 2) excitation units (IEEE DC1A, DC2A, AC5A), and 3) turbine-governor models (steam and hydro). The estimation accuracy of the proposed filter is assessed for three classes of disturbances assuming noisy PMUs' measurements and comparative results are presented with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The accuracy-computational burden trade-off is also analyzed and the results strengthen the feasibility of using particle filters for dynamic state estimation.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for processing real-time data error in generalized state estimation (GSE). Attention is focused on the two main types of error: network topology errors and bad data on analog measurements. The proposed approach is able to handle both errors without making any previous assumption regarding the nature of those errors. The degrading effects of topology errors over bad data processing when both topology and measurement errors occur at the same time are evaluated and new strategy is proposed to overcome it. GSE is treated as a constrained optimization problem where measurements and circuit-breaker status are modeled as equality constraints. Geometric tests based on the geometric interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier vector are then utilized to determine the source of the error. The proposed strategy is tested on two model power networks represented at the bus-section level which is derived from the IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems.

Abstract: The small-signal stability analysis of power systems concerns the critical modes as well as the modes associated with a physical meaning, e.g., the interarea oscillation modes for weakly connected systems and the modes sensitive to a particular parameter. As the order of the power-system state matrix increases, it becomes more difficult to determine these modes. In this paper, a method is proposed to compute the interarea oscillation modes of large-scale power systems. The deviation in the active power of the transmission section is selected to identify the interarea oscillation modes. Then, the two-sided Jacobi-Davidson method combined with this selection is employed to compute these modes. Participation factors are used to separate the electromechanical oscillation modes. Numerical tests show that the proposed method is valid and efficient.

Abstract: Dynamic state estimation (DSE) in power system combines forecasting technique with measurement data to accurately estimate system state. The current DSE techniques cannot handle the situation where communication failure occurs and measurement data are lost. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to address this problem. The proposed approach combines the extended Kalman filter (EKF) with load forecasting technique that predicts missing measurement data. A time-forward kriging model is used to forecast the missing load data from the available measurement data. The forecast load is then converted to forecast system state through power flow analysis. The EKF is used to combine the measurement data with the forecast state to obtain a more accurate filtered state. The proposed approach is tested on IEEE 14-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system using realistic load pattern from NYISO and PJM with various scenarios of measurement error and communication failure. The test results from the proposed approach are compared with traditional weighted least square (WLS) state estimation and DSE with multi-step ahead autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) load forecasting. From the case studies, we find that the proposed approach provides more accurate and faster state estimation under most scenarios.

Abstract: Generating units, participating in the secondary frequency control of a control area, are usually spinning units already connected to the network and operating outside their range of optimal performance. This paper deals with an alternative method of providing secondary frequency control called Rapid-Start (RS). It consists in assigning a regulation band to several off-line units (RS units) which are capable of being started and connected rapidly, therefore allowing the online units to operate closer to their nominal power. As RS operation may have economic benefits, an appropriate algorithm to start up an RS unit needs to be developed. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate, compare, and choose the most appropriate RS algorithm among the ones developed for a certain AGC control area. An optimization model provides a reference by determining the hypothetically ideal start-ups and shut-downs of RS units. In addition, the definition of performance indexes to evaluate, compare, and choose the different RS algorithms is proposed. The proposed methodology is illustrated for a secondary frequency control zone within the Spanish power system by using real data signals.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a fully distributed bisection algorithm for the economic dispatch problem (EDP) in a smart grid scenario, with the goal to minimize the aggregated cost of a network of generators, which cooperatively furnish a given amount of power within their individual capacity constraints. Our distributed algorithm adopts the method of bisection, and is based on a consensus-like iterative method, with no need for a central decision maker or a leader node. Under strong connectivity conditions and allowance for local communications, we show that the iterative solution converges to the globally optimal solution. Furthermore, two stopping criteria are presented for the practical implementation of the proposed algorithm, for which sign consensus is defined. Finally, numerical simulations based on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems are given to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of the dynamic behavior of photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems on short-term voltage stability of the transmission system. First, the impact of the fault ride-through capability of a PV model is studied by setting several recovery speeds of the active current output when the operation of the PV system is interrupted because of a voltage sag. The results are analyzed by using transient P-V curves and a stability boundary, which has been proposed in our previous research. Further, we show that the installation of PVs severely impairs the short-term voltage stability if the PVs shut off after a voltage sag, and its recovery speed is low. Next, two countermeasures to control short-term voltage instability phenomena are tested. One is the operation of the PV system at a leading power factor in the normal state, and the other is the dynamic reactive power control by the inverters of the PV system after a voltage sag. Numerical examples are carried out for a one-load infinite-bus power system and a five-machine five-load power system. The results show that these countermeasures can play a substantial role in preventing the voltage instability phenomena caused when a PV system is suddenly interrupted because of a fault.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel contribution factor (CF) approach to predict diversified daily peak load of low voltage (LV) substations. The CF for each LV template developed in part I of the paper is determined by a novel method-clusterwise weighted constrained regression (CWCR). It takes into account the contribution from different customer classes to substation peaks, respecting the natural difference in time and magnitude between LV substation peaks and the variance within the templates. In CWCR, intercept and coefficients are constrained to ensure that the resultant coefficients do not lead to reverse load flow and can respect zero-load substations. Cross validation is developed to validate the stability of the proposed method and prevent over fitting. The proposed method shows significant improvement in the accuracy of peak estimation over the current status quo across 800 substations of different mixes of domestic, industrial and commercial (I&C) customers. The work in the two parts of the paper is particularly useful for understanding the capabilities of LV networks to accommodate the increasing penetration of low carbon technologies without large-scale monitoring.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for single and simultaneous fault location in distribution networks by means of a sparse representation (SR) vector, Fuzzy-clustering, and machine-learning. The method requires few smart meters along the primary feeders to measure the pre- and during-fault voltages. The voltage sag values for the measured buses produce a vector whose dimension is less than the number of buses in the system. By concatenating the corresponding rows of the bus impedance matrix, an underdetermined set of equation is formed and is used to recover the fault current vector. Since the current vector ideally contains few nonzero values corresponding to fault currents at the faulted points, it is a sparse vector which can be determined by l(1)-norm minimization. Because the number of nonzero values in the estimated current vector often exceeds the number of fault points, we analyze the nonzero values by Fuzzy-c mean to estimate four possible faults. Furthermore, the nonzero values are processed by a new machine learning method based on the k-nearest neighborhood technique to estimate a single fault location. The performance of our algorithms is validated by their implementation on a real distribution network with noisy and noise-free measurement.

Abstract: This paper presents a bilevel model for describing the interdependence of decisions between a retailer/aggregator and the distributed resources owners that the former serves and represents. Decision making is performed in a hierarchical fashion. The retailer performs the energy management of various resources indirectly; price signals are used as incentives for inducing the entities owning the distributed resources in a behavior that optimizes the operation and economic profit of the microgrid that they compose. The two-level interaction is formulated mathematically as a mathematical programming problem with complementarity constraints, while nonlinearities are replaced by equivalent linear expressions. The results of a characteristic case study indicate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed model.

Abstract: There is growing interest in discerning behaviors of electricity users in both the residential and commercial sectors. With the advent of high-resolution time-series power demand data through advanced metering, mining this data could be costly from the computational viewpoint. One of the popular techniques is clustering, but depending on the algorithm the resolution of the data can have an important influence on the resulting clusters. This paper shows how temporal resolution of power demand profiles affects the quality of the clustering process, the consistency of cluster membership (profiles exhibiting similar behavior), and the efficiency of the clustering process. This work uses both raw data from household consumption data and synthetic profiles. The motivation for this work is to improve the clustering of electricity load profiles to help distinguish user types for tariff design and switching, fault and fraud detection, demand-side management, and energy efficiency measures. The key criterion for mining very large data sets is how little information needs to be used to get a reliable result, while maintaining privacy and security.

Abstract: In order to improve low voltage (LV) network visibility without extensive monitoring and integrate low carbon technologies (LCTs) in a cost-effective manner, this paper proposes a novel three-stage network load profiling method. It uses real-time information monitored from selective representative areas to develop network templates. The three stages are: clustering, classification and scaling. It can be used to identify the loading conditions of unmonitored LV systems with similar fixed data to those monitored LV substations. In the clustering stage, hierarchical clustering and K-means are used to cluster substations into groups based on the shape of the monitored load profiles. The classification tool designed with multinomial logistic regression maps an unmonitored LV substation into the most probable templates by using routinely available fixed data. Finally, clusterwise weighted constrained regression is employed to estimate peak for individual LV substations and the developed templates. The three-stage profiling is demonstrated on a practical system in the U.K. under the umbrella of a smart grid trail project. Ten LV templates are developed by using the metered data from 800 monitored LV substations. A comprehensive comparison between the estimated peaks using the three-stage process and the metered peaks suggests that the methodology can achieve superior accuracy. This is part I of the paper, introducing clustering and classification. The scaling (peak estimation) process will be introduced in part II of the paper.

Abstract: In response to the computational challenges produced by the integrated dispatch of generation and load (IDGL), this paper proposes a novel and efficient decomposition method. The IDGL is formulated using the mixed-integer quadratic constrained programming (MIQCP) method. To efficiently solve this complex optimization problem, the nodal equivalent load shifting bidding curve (NELSBC) is proposed to represent the aggregated response characteristics of customers at a node. The IDGL is subsequently decomposed into a two-level optimization problem. At the upper level, grid operators optimize load shifting schedules based on the NELSBC of each node. Transmission losses are explicitly incorporated into the model to coordinate them with generating costs and load shifting costs. At the bottom level, customer load adjustments are optimized at individual nodes given the nodal load shifting requirement imposed by the grid operators. The key advantage of the proposed method is that the load shifting among different nodes can be coordinated via NELSBCs without iterations. The proposed decomposition method significantly improves the efficiency of the IDGL. Parallel computing techniques are utilized to accelerate the computations. Using numerical studies of IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus, and practically sized 300-bus systems, this study demonstrates that accurate and efficient IDGL scheduling results, which consider the nonlinear impact of transmission losses, can be achieved.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) refers to the consumers' activities for changing the load profile with the purpose of lowering cost, improving power quality or reliability of power system. Enhancement in participation of the DR is widely recognized as a profit-making pattern in distribution systems for both residential units (to increase their benefits) and distribution companies (DISCO) (to reduce their peak demand and costs). The target of this research is concentrated on proposing a new strategy for optimal scheduling of flexible loads for the next day. Then, the day ahead pricing (DAP) is modeled using the inclining block rates (IBR), assumed for retail electricity markets, to investigate the efficiency of the proposed strategy. At the same time, the appliances stochastic time of use (ASTOU) are taken into account in residential units for non-controllable part of the load during a day stochastically. Among five various copulas, the Gaussian copula (GC) function shows the best performance in modeling and estimation of non-controllable load consumption. Finally, simulations, performed with the GAMS, illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach which is formulated as a stochastic nonlinear programming (NLP) modeled by the GC. Notice that copulas use samples of real data gathered from residential units.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of a wind power producer participating in a short-term electricity market that allows for the continuous, but potentially illiquid, intraday trading of energy. Considering the realistic case of a wind farm operating in the western Danish price area of Nord Pool, we build a simple but effective algorithm for the wind power producer to fully benefit from the Elbas intraday market. We then investigate the sensitivity of the obtained benefits to the maximum volume of energy the wind power producer is willing to trade in the intraday market, the ultimate aim of the trade (either to decrease energy imbalances or to increase profits) and to the installed capacity of the wind farm. Our numerical results reveal that the wind power producer can substantially increase his revenues by partaking in the intraday market but with diminishing returns to scale-a result that we attribute to the low liquidity of Elbas.

Abstract: Portfolios of renewable electricity sources are interesting risk-management mechanisms for trading in electricity contract markets. When formed by players belonging to different companies, their stability relies on the way the benefit generated by the optimal portfolio is allocated. The challenge of finding a fair and efficient allocation can be mathematically formulated in terms of finding the Core of a cooperative game, which in turn is stated as an optimization problem with a set of constraints that exponentially grows with the number of participants, quickly becoming computationally intractable. Moreover, the right-hand-side of each constraint relies on a given coalition value, which in our case is obtained by a two-stage stochastic optimization model. This paper presents an efficient methodology based on mixed-linear programming and Benders decomposition to find the Nucleolus share of large-scale renewable portfolios. Case studies are presented with data from the Brazilian power system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a bi-level branch-and-bound ((B&B) method to solve the economic dispatch problem with prohibited zones and network losses. The approach employs binary variables for each prohibited zone and utilizes the B-coefficient for network losses, which can be transformed into a mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming (MIQCQP), where linear relaxation technique is applied on each bilinear term. Due to the complexity in solving the MIQCQP problem, this paper proposes a bi-level B&B method to achieve global optimum. A spatial B&B method is utilized in the higher level to solve the quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, whereas a simple B&B method is employed in the lower level to solve a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The bi-level B&B algorithm that combines spatial and simple B&B methods is actually a deterministic optimization method and can produce global optimal solutions. Numerical results on 6-unit, 15-unit, and 40-unit test systems show that the bi-level B&B method can solve the MIQCQP problem with superior solution quality and convergence characteristics.

Abstract: Demand response is a key solution in smart grid to address the ever-increasing peak energy consumption. With multiple utility companies, users will decide from which utility company to buy electricity and how much to buy. Consequently, how to devise distributed real-time demand response in the multiseller-multibuyer environment emerges as a critical problem in future smart grid. In this paper, we focus on the real-time interactions among multiple utility companies and multiple users. We propose a distributed real-time demand response algorithm to determine each user's demand and each utility company's supply simultaneously. By applying dual decomposition, the original problem is firstly decoupled into single-seller-multibuyer subsystems; then, the demand response problem in each subsystem can be distributively solved. The major advantage of this approach is that each utility company and user locally solve subproblems to perform energy allocation, instead of requiring a central controller or any third party. Therefore, privacy is guaranteed because no entity needs to reveal or exchange private information. Numerical results are presented to verify efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The potential for cascading failure in power systems adds substantially to overall reliability risk. Monte Carlo sampling can be used with a power system model to estimate this impact, but doing so is computationally expensive. This paper presents a new approach to estimating the risk of large cascading blackouts triggered by multiple contingencies. The method uses a search algorithm (Random Chemistry) to identify blackout-causing contingencies, and then combines the results with outage probabilities to estimate overall risk. Comparing this approach with Monte Carlo sampling for two test cases (the IEEE RTS-96 and a 2383-bus model of the Polish system) illustrates that the new approach is at least two orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo, without introducing measurable bias. Moreover, the approach enables one to compute the sensitivity of overall blackout risk to individual component-failure probabilities in the initiating contingency, allowing one to quickly identify low-cost strategies for reducing risk. By computing the sensitivity of risk to individual initial outage probabilities for the Polish system, we found that reducing three line-outage probabilities by 50% would reduce cascading failure risk by 33%. Finally, we used the method to estimate changes in risk as a function of load. Surprisingly, this calculation illustrates that risk can sometimes decrease as load increases.

Abstract: In interconnected power systems, operated by several system operators, the participating areas are strongly dependent on their neighbors. In order to identify the economically efficient generation dispatch in each area, a distributed multi-area optimal power flow (OPF) must be solved. Additionally, installation of an increasing number of HVDC lines to deal with increased power flows from renewable generation is expected to change the power system operation paradigm. The controllability introduced by the HVDC lines should be considered and incorporated in the OPF algorithm. In this paper we introduce a formulation for the distributed solution of the OPF problem in multi-area systems consisting of both HVAC and HVDC lines. We show the applicability of this formulation on two different operating schemes for HVDC grids and we compare their performance with a central solution for the mixed HVAC/HVDC grid. The proposed formulations are based on a linearized solution of the OPF problem. The only data to be exchanged between the areas pertains to the border nodes.

Abstract: Risk of blackouts is more than expected and must be considered in the power system studies. The interest of this paper is to minimize the blackouts risk during minimizing the costs in probabilistic transmission expansion planning (TEP). In this paper, a long-term reliability analysis, which was developed by self-organized criticality theory, is used in a multi-objective optimization to include risk of blackouts in TEP. The objective functions are costs and expected energy not supplied. Also, a new formulation for calculating transmission operating cost as a part of cost function is proposed. The problem is solved by a multi-objective particle swarm optimization to find an optimal Pareto set from which the decision-maker can choose the most desirable one, regarding existing budget. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 118-bus test system to investigate its applicability and scalability. The results are compared with security-constrained TEP, which uses famous deterministic criterion known as N-1. The proposed approach produces more efficient plans for suppressing cascading blackouts with less network investment. Moreover, the results provide motivation for considering the risk of cascading blackouts in TEP, which afford substantial saving to society.

Abstract: Due to substantial generation and demand fluctuations in standalone green microgrids, energy management strategies are becoming essential for the power sharing and voltage regulation purposes. The classical energy management strategies employ the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms and rely on batteries in case of possible excess or deficit of energy. However, in order to realize constant current-constant voltage (IU) charging regime and increase the life span of batteries, energy management strategies require being more flexible with the power curtailment feature. In this paper, a coordinated and multivariable energy management strategy is proposed that employs a wind turbine and a photovoltaic array of a standalone DC microgrid as controllable generators by adjusting the pitch angle and the switching duty cycles. The proposed strategy is developed as an online nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm. Applying to a sample standalone dc microgrid, the developed controller realizes the IU regime for charging the battery bank. The variable load demands are also shared accurately between generators in proportion to their ratings. Moreover, the DC bus voltage is regulated within a predefined range, as a design parameter.

Abstract: This paper examines the application of STATCOM and battery energy storage to enhance the transient stability of large-scale multimachine power systems with synchronous and doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs). A passivity-based control design method [interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC)] is developed for multimachine power systems and its performance is evaluated on a two-area system consisting of two synchronous generators (SGs) and two DFIG along with STATCOM/battery energy storage system. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) use of a STATCOM and battery energy storage system to enhance transient stability and provide voltage regulation with SG and DFIG; 2) demonstrating the application of nonlinear control theory (specifically the IDA-PBC methodology) for the design of a stabilizing feedback controller in large-scale power systems to improve transient system performance; and 3) developing a methodology that can use the additional degrees of freedom in large-scale power systems in order to further improve system performance, in particular the transient stability margin [measured through critical clearing time (CCT)] and the dynamic transient performance of the system. In order to achieve power angle stability along with the simultaneous regulation of frequency and voltage, the performance of the proposed control scheme after the occurrence of large disturbances is evaluated and compared with a conventional power system stabilizer and a feedback linearizing controller.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources and energy storage systems present specific challenges to the traditional optimal power flow (OPF) paradigm. First, storage devices require the OPF to model charge/discharge dynamics and the supply of generated power at a later time. Second, renewable energy sources necessitate that the OPF solution accounts for the control of conventional power generators in response to errors of renewable power forecast, which are significantly larger than the traditional load forecast errors. This paper presents a sparse formulation and solution for the affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) of the multi-period OPF problem. The AARC aims at operating a storage portfolio via receding horizon control; it computes the optimal base-point conventional generation and storage schedule for the forecasted load and renewable generation, together with the constrained participation factors that dictate how conventional generation and storage will adjust to maintain feasible operation whenever the renewables deviate from their forecast. The approach is demonstrated on standard IEEE networks dispatched over a 24-h horizon with interval forecasted wind power, and the feasibility of operation under interval uncertainty is validated via Monte Carlo analysis. The computational performance of the proposed approach is compared with a conventional implementation of the AARC that employs successive constraint enforcement.

Abstract: Distribution systems are naturally unbalanced as a consequence of unbalanced loads and the electrical network itself, where the use of single-phase or two-phase sections is not uncommon. In addition, a detailed representation of a typical distribution system can have tens of thousands of nodes, depending on the area selected for study and whether a three-phase representation is employed. This contrasts with Transmission systems, where typical sizes in terms of number of nodes are much smaller and where a balanced (single-phase) representation is sufficient in most situations. Thus, Transmission and Distribution systems have traditionally been studied separately, but this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate for various reasons. This paper then proposes a methodology that integrates Transmission and Distribution systems into a common electrical model. At the core of the methodology there are 1) single-and three-phase models for each component (branches, transformers, loads, etc.) and 2) interchangeable balanced and unbalanced network equivalents that allow for analyzing specific areas of a given complete network. Potential gains brought about by the proposed methodology are illustrated through its application in a real-world electric system.

Abstract: Distance relays are immune to inadvertent operation during power swings by a block known as "power swing blocking (PSB)". Its main function is discriminating faults from power swings. However, if a fault occurs during a power swing, PSB should be de-blocked and let the distance relay to operate normally and clear the fault accordingly. Meanwhile, discrimination of a three-phase fault from a power swing is the most difficult task due to their likelihood. This paper proposes a new method to overcome this issue by monitoring the transient period established in the process of current dynamic phasor estimation. In this regard, transient monitor (TM) index, which is the difference between the estimated current samples regenerated from the calculated dynamic phasors and the actual sample values, is used to distinguish the fault from the power swing. Fourier-Taylor transformation is applied to estimate the dynamic phasor of the current signal. Simulation results verify the inherent potential of the proposed method to overcome the issue.

Abstract: Intraday energy markets have been established in some power markets mainly because of large-scale wind power integration. Inspired by the Spanish power market, this paper proposes a modified market design which contains day-ahead and intraday energy bidding sections to better accommodate stochastic wind energy. Then coordinated operation of the wind farm (WF) and energy storage system (ESS) is studied. Rolling stochastic optimization formulations for day-ahead, intraday biddings and real-time operations are put forward to obtain the optimal bidding strategy of WF-ESS union in each bidding section to maximize its overall profit. Case studies and sensitivity analyses are carried out on a union of WFs and a pumped storage plant (PSP). Simulation results show that the proposed rolling optimization method can effectively utilize the updated wind power forecast data and regulation capability of ESS, and thus increase profit for the union prominently.

Abstract: Load profile classification is very important in load forecast, planning and management. Although customers are generally grouped by utilities into residential, commercial classes and respective subclasses, there is a lack of systematic framework that can be used to characterize different classes with signatures that are both human-readable and machine-readable. The work presented in this paper attempts to formulate the theoretical framework for customer classification using the annual load profiles. This paper demonstrates how to extract characteristic attributes in frequency domain (CAFD) and use these CAFDs to formulate a hierarchy of load profiles that can be used as the systematic framework for customer load classification. As signatures for customer classes and subclasses, the CAFDs are obtained by using a data mining method called CART (classification and regression tree). The paper presents a load profile classification test to establish the efficacy of the proposed approach which is significant improvement over current practices that provide mostly qualitative labeling.

Abstract: This paper presents a new under-frequency load shedding technique based on the combination of random and fixed priority of loads. It has been observed that placing all of the loads in the distribution system with fixed priority results in un-optimum load shedding. On the other hand, designing the load priority with a combination of random and fixed priority provides the technique with some sort of flexibility in achieving the optimal load shedding. The validation of the proposed scheme on different scenarios proves that the proposed technique is capable of achieving the optimal load shedding and recovering frequency to nominal value without any overshoot.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel particle filter based dynamic state estimation scheme for power systems where the states of all the generators are estimated. The proposed estimation scheme is decentralized in that each estimation module is independent from others and only uses local measurements. The particle filter implementation makes the proposed scheme numerically simple to implement. What makes this method superior to the previous methods which are mainly based on the Kalman filtering technique is that the estimation can still remain smooth and accurate in the presence of noise with unknown changes in covariance values. Moreover, this scheme can be applied to dynamic systems and noise with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a mixed-integer formulation with nonlinear production functions of the day-ahead hydro unit commitment problem for hydro-dominant power systems. The objective is to minimize unit startup and shutdown costs and maximize water use efficiency in the daily operation of multiple hydro plants. Determination of hourly generation dispatches and unit configurations is subject to reservoir dynamics, power balance, as well as target constraints coupling short-term generation with long-term reservoir operation goals. In addition, ac power flow constraints are considered. An equivalent quadratically-constrained quadratic formulation is approximated by successive convex semidefinite programming relaxations in a branch-and-bound algorithm for optimal solutions. Numerical case studies for several system configurations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the relaxation algorithm.

Abstract: In order to increase the utilization of renewable energy sources and to reduce the need of generator-provided ancillary services and inefficient peaking generation, buildings are progressively transforming into smarter electricity consumers and active participants in power system operations. In this work, an R-C thermodynamic model of building that strongly relates to the power consumption of heating ventilation air-conditioning system (HVAC) is firstly introduced. To offer the aggregated flexible HVAC power to the grid as regulating power, we propose a building-aggregator-grid contract framework and formulate a robust model predictive control (MPC) algorithm which both maximizes the profit of aggregator and minimizes the payment of each participating building to optimally declare power flexibility. Lastly, simulation results on a group of real and hypothetical buildings validate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Abstract: The task of autonomous power sharing in a micro-grid is usually achieved by decentralized droop control on individual interface power converters, which may suffer from the dependence on output line impedances. Inaccurate reactive power sharing will occur under strongly non-uniform line impedances. Due to inherently distributed and heterogeneous nature of the micro-grid, it becomes an ideal platform for applications of consensus control algorithms. In this paper, the consensus-based droop control with sparse communication network is proposed to overcome the drawback of existing droop control methods. In particular, when line impedances of the power grid are either lossy with the uniform R/X ratio or even pure resistive, the consensus droop control is still an effective method for autonomous real and reactive power sharing. In addition, closed-loop system stability of the proposed consensus-based droop control method can be ensured by the energy function approach under certain conditions. Real-time simulations of two micro-grid systems are studied to validate the feasibility of the proposed consensus-based droop control method.

Abstract: Converter control is an important aspect of voltage-source-converter high-voltage dc (VSC-HVDC) based multi-terminal dc grids. Variants of power drooped against dc voltage control have previously been proposed for this purpose. However, there is at this time no clear methodology available on how to select the size of the droop constants for distributing a power mismatch, following, e.g., a converter trip, on several converters. This paper proposes a methodology for establishing droop constants for a variant of power drooped against dc voltage called pilot voltage droop control. The methodology is derived from the basic control laws in a straight forward fashion and the accuracy is exemplified by time domain simulations in Digsilent's Powerfactory platform.

Abstract: The rapid development of wind power generation imposes unprecedented challenges on power system operations due to its stochastic variations. This paper proposes the concept of dispatchable region (Disp-Reg) of the variable wind generation, and reveals its geometrical property. Disp-Reg is a polytope that indicates exactly how much nodal injected wind uncertainty a power system can handle. This concept can lead to a measure on the flexibility of economic dispatch strategies, or an extended version of the crucial concept "security region" in the uncertainty space. Moreover, this paper develops a systematic algorithm to compute the boundaries of Disp-Reg by solving linear programs and mixed integer linear programs. The PJM 5-bus system is used for illustrating the Disp-Reg concept. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real power grid in China to demonstrate its practical implications.

Abstract: Installed capacities of distributed generation (DG) are projected to increase substantially in Great Britain and many other power systems. This paper will discuss the definition of capacity value of DG arising from its ability to support additional demand without the need for new network capacity, in analogy with the definition of effective load carrying capability (ELCC) at transmission level. This calculated ELCC depends on the precise detail of its definition; in particular in a demand group fed by a pair of circuits where the double outage state dominates the calculated reliability index, the ELCC will be very small unless the generator can run in islanded mode. Finally, requirements for use in practical planning studies and development of formal planning standards will be discussed.

Abstract: Time-domain simulation (TDS) is the most accurate and reliable method for solving transient stability problem. This approach relies on the solution of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) using numerical integration, wherein a system of nonlinear equations is solved at each integration time step. Very DisHonest Newton (VDHN) method is one of the fastest available approaches for solving the system of nonlinear equations in the TDS. However, VDHN does not guarantee convergence and its sequential nature makes it difficult to take advantage of available multicore processors. This paper presents a new multi-decomposition approach (MDA) to achieve fast TDS, wherein the nonlinear system of DAEs is decomposed into three linear subsystems. An adaptive scheme is developed for updating the linear subsystems to ensure that approximation remains sufficiently accurate. The linear subsystems can be solved in parallel using multi-processor architecture. The MDA is demonstrated using IEEE 145-bus test system, and the results are verified against a commercial transient stability problem, Powertech Labs' DSATools.

Abstract: This paper presents a symmetrical components approach for computing the phase-coordinates nodal admittance matrices of three-phase transformers, where each connection is comprised either of three single-phase units or one three-phase unit. The approach is based on assembling the symmetrical component circuits into the different three-phase connections; it can straightforwardly handle unsymmetrical transformer banks with different phase electrical characteristics or missing phases, and grounding impedances. The proposed approach easily accounts for the various clock numbers quoted in the British Standard (BS) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard on power transformers; this presents an advantage as compared to classical phase-coordinates approaches that require defining a distinct connection matrix corresponding to each transformer vector group.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for online determination of the Thevenin equivalent parameters of a power system at a given node using the local PMU measurements at that node. The method takes into account the measurement errors and the changes in the system side. An analysis of the effects of changes in system side is carried out on a simple two-bus system to gain an insight of the effect of system side changes on the estimated Thevenin equivalent parameters. The proposed method uses voltage and current magnitudes as well as active and reactive powers; thus avoiding the effect of phase angle drift of the PMU and the need to synchronize measurements at different instances to the same reference. Applying the method to the IEEE 30-bus test system has shown its ability to correctly determine the Thevenin equivalent even in the presence of measurement errors and/or system side changes.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of joint optimal allocation and sizing of dynamic Var sources (ODynVarS) for short-term dynamic performance enhancement of power systems. A heuristic optimization based approach is proposed with the aim of achieving a desirable performance under multiple contingencies with respect to a reference short-term voltage response. Based on a pre-selected set of credible contingencies and potential candidate locations for device additions, the approach employs the mean-variance mapping optimization (MVMO) in combination with an integrated mixed-integer search strategy (IMIS) and two intervention schemes, to accelerate and guide the search process towards a techno-economically optimum solution. The first intervention is performed at fitness evaluation stage to screen economic solutions which entail technical feasibility and to reduce computational effort. IMIS and the second intervention is concerned with MVMO's knowledge management, which facilitates the search for solutions comprising a small number of devices with relatively large VAr capacity. The approach is tested using the IEEE 39-bus New England system.

Abstract: In this paper we address some shortcomings in existing nonlinear dynamic models of power system experiencing symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in their transmission/distribution networks. The shortcomings relate to: 1) approximations relating to stator dynamics, internal voltage of the positive sequence network and the dynamics of the negative and zero sequence networks, and 2) existing models are time -variant, which may not be suitable for system studies such as stability and fault detection studies that require time invariant model. The approximations outlined in 1) adversely affect the modeling accuracy, especially that of the system response during the period immediately after the occurrence of faults. We present in this paper a full fault-dependent time-invariant dynamical model of power systems experiencing symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in their transmission/distribution networks and verify it through simulation studies mimicking real life scenarios. IEEE 30 bus power system is considered as the study case. The simulation results are compared to Matlab's "SimPower" and PSCAD/EMTDC software packages.

Abstract: For optimal microgrid (MG) operation, one challenge is the supply of cooling and electricity energy is a coupled co-optimization issue when considering the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) units and ice-storage air-conditioners. Another challenge is the inherent randomness of renewable energy within the MG should be accommodated by MG itself. In Part I of this two-part paper, the partial load performance of CCHPs and the performance of ice-storage air-conditioners are modeled, and the cooling and electricity coordinated MG day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatching models are established. In day-ahead scheduling model, the uncertainty of wind and solar power is represented by multi-scenarios and the objective is to achieve the minimal expected MG operation cost. In real-time dispatching model, the different time-scale dispatch schemes are respectively applied for cooling and electricity to smooth out the fluctuations of renewable energy supply and to follow the variations of cooling and electricity demands by the fine dispatching of the components within MG such that the impact of MG to the connected main grid is minimal. The proposed MG multi time-scale cooling and electricity coordinated schedule achieves an integrated optimization for multi energy-type supply, and makes the MG be controllable as seen from the main grid.

Abstract: Market power assessment is a prime concern when designing a deregulated electricity market. In this paper, we propose a new functional market power measure, termed transmission constrained network flow (TCNF), that unifies three large classes of transmission constrained structural market power indices in the literature: residual supply based, network flow based, and minimal generation based. Furthermore, it is suitable for demand-response and renewable integration and hence more amenable to identifying market power in the future smart grid. The measure is defined abstractly, and allows incorporation of power flow equations in multiple ways; we investigate the current market operations using a DC approximation and further explore the possibility of including detailed AC power flow models through semidefinite relaxation, and interior-point algorithms from Matpower. Finally, we provide extensive simulations on IEEE benchmark systems and highlight the complex interaction of engineering constraints with market power assessment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized adaptive emergency control scheme against power system voltage instability. Decentralized control architecture is proposed by segregating the system into several local areas or zones based on the concept of electrical distance. Intelligent agents are assigned in each area to monitor the bus voltages and generator reactive powers to detect any threat of voltage collapse and to actuate countermeasures. A novel performance index has been formulated based on the load voltage and generator reactive power violations to identify the severity of disturbance and the risk of system emergency in each area. The coordination of the timing of the countermeasures among the agents is achieved through the formulation of the integral of the performance index. The simplicity and the adaptive nature of the proposed control scheme to provide countermeasures against any disturbance make it useful for real-time application. The robustness of the proposed approach has been validated through several case studies using the New England 39-bus test system and a more realistic Nordic32 test system.

Abstract: Hierarchically structured automatic voltage control (AVC) architecture has attracted increased interest as networks operate closer to their capacity limits. Hierarchical AVC enables wide-area coordinated voltage regulation (CVR). Due to the inherent complexity of the task, it is based on reduced control models, i.e., simplified models of the system suitable for voltage control. It is a fact however that a single reduced control model (static RCM) cannot be optimal for all network configurations and operating conditions. In pursuit of an improved CVR, this paper investigates the applicability of zoning methodologies in adaptively determined RCM. It further argues that the selection of a zoning methodology affects not only the CVR operation, but also its robustness to erroneous data and proposes a comprehensive generic framework for evaluating its performance. Lastly, it extends and evaluates several zoning-based control model reduction methodologies: namely, hierarchical clustering employing two different proximity metrics, spectral k-way and fuzzy C-means, on both static and adaptive schemes.

Abstract: This paper presents a model for the microgrid planning problem with uncertain physical and financial information. The microgrid planning problem investigates the economic viability of microgrid deployment and determines the optimal generation mix of distributed energy resources (DERs) for installation. Net metering is considered for exchanging power with the main grid and lowering the cost of unserved energy and DER investments. A robust optimization approach is adopted for considering forecast errors in load, variable renewable generation, and market prices. The microgrid islanding is further treated as a source of uncertainty. The microgrid planning problem is decomposed into an investment master problem and an operation subproblem. The optimal planning decisions determined in the master problem are employed in the subproblem to examine the optimality of the master solution by calculating the worst-case optimal operation under uncertain conditions. Optimality cuts sent to the master problem will govern subsequent iterations. Numerical simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model and further analyze the sensitivity of microgrid planning results on variety levels of uncertainty.

Abstract: Given the rapid increase in the number of phasor measurement units (PMU) installed in substations in recent years, it is not unrealistic to assume that most transmission systems will be fully observable by only PMU measurements in the not so distant future. Such a scenario will enable faster and numerically easier state estimation solution which will be non-iterative due to the linearity of the PMU measurement equations. However, as will be shown in this paper, the benefits do not end there and a closer look at these equations reveals further possibilities of simplification and therefore improved performance of state estimators that use only PMU measurements. Specifically, the paper formulates an alternative decoupled solution, which reduces the size of the state estimation problem, increases computational performance yet maintains high solution accuracy. Both state estimation as well as bad data processing can be efficiently carried out within the developed decoupled formulation.

Abstract: This paper aims to study the measurement and modeling methods for delays in wide-area closed-loop control systems (WACS). The delays are classified into communication delays and operational delays based on the information flow of WACS. For communication delays, an affine evaluation model is proposed based on previous studies, and this model is verified by the measured communication delays of the Guizhou Power Grid in Southwest China. For operational delays, a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) hardware-in-the-loop measurement method is developed, and the measured operational delays are obtained and analyzed. Finally, an estimation method for the closed-loop delay in actual WACS is proposed, in which the uplink and downlink communication delays are modeled as constants and the operational delay is modeled as a normal distribution. Consequently, the closed-loop delay follows a normal distribution with the calculated parameters by combining the communication delays and operational delay. The measurement results and analysis presented in this paper are important for the development and applications of WACS.

Abstract: This paper addresses the multistage expansion planning problem of a distribution system where investments in the distribution network and in distributed generation are jointly considered. Network expansion comprises several alternatives for feeders and transformers. Analogously, the installation of distributed generation takes into account several alternatives for conventional and wind generators. Unlike what is customarily done, a set of candidate nodes for generator installation is considered. Thus, the optimal expansion plan identifies the best alternative, location, and installation time for the candidate assets. The model is driven by the minimization of the net present value of the total cost including the costs related to investment, maintenance, production, losses, and unserved energy. The costs of energy losses are modeled by a piecewise linear approximation. As another distinctive feature, radiality conditions are specifically tailored to accommodate the presence of distributed generation in order to avoid the isolation of distributed generators and the issues associated with transfer nodes. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed-integer linear program for which finite convergence to optimality is guaranteed and efficient off-the-shelf software is available. Numerical results illustrate the effective performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: In part II of this two-part paper, the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm for solving the microgrid (MG) day-ahead cooling and electricity coordinated scheduling is proposed. Significant improvements are made in comparison with the conventional PSO algorithm from two aspects. First, the mandatory correction is implemented to ensure the complex coupled constraints among the components of a particle are met after the particle's position is updated, which could enhance the algorithm performance when solving the problem including complex constraints. Second, it is assumed that a solution denoted by a particle occupies a neighboring area, the size of which decreases from a certain value to nearly zero as the iteration step increases to its limitation, which helps to avoid the pre-maturity of algorithm. For an MG composed of the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) units, PV panels, wind turbines, and storage batteries, a range of case studies under different MG operating modes are carried out through simulations. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed multi time-scale, multi energy-type coordinated MG scheduling solution can achieve the co-optimization of multi energy-type supply to meet customer's cooling and electricity demands, and make the MG be controllable as seen from the connected main grid.

Abstract: With a large-scale introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), a new entity, the PEV fleet aggregator, is expected to be responsible for managing the charging of, and for purchasing electricity for, the vehicles. We approach the problem of an aggregator bidding into the day-ahead electricity market with the objective of minimizing charging costs while satisfying the PEVs' flexible demand. The aggregator places demand bids only (no vehicle-to-grid is considered). The aggregator is assumed to potentially influence market prices, in contrast to what is commonly found in the literature. Specifically, the bidding strategy of the aggregator is formulated as a bilevel problem, which is implemented as a mixed-integer linear program. The upper level problem represents the charging cost minimization of the aggregator, whereas the lower level problem represents the market clearing. Since the bids of other market participants are not known to the aggregator ex ante, a simple strategy is used to estimate them, based on historical data. An aggregated representation of the PEV end-use requirements as a virtual battery, with time varying power and energy constraints, is proposed, derived from individual driving patterns. Since driving patterns cannot be perfectly forecasted, we introduce a probabilistic virtual battery model. We compare the results of the proposed bidding strategy with those of a bidding strategy assuming exogenous prices, uncontrolled charging, and a central dispatch of the fleet. We also explore the impacts of different sources of uncertainty. Results show that with the proposed bidding strategy, costs are significantly lower than under inflexible charging and are lower than assuming exogenous prices. Moreover, the approach also performs well under uncertainty. Results also suggest that the aggregator only has limited market power potential at moderate PEV penetrations.

Abstract: In this letter, we present an algorithm for rotor angle stability monitoring of power system in real-time. The proposed algorithm is model-free and can make use of high resolution phasor measurement units (PMUs) data to provide reliable, timely information about the system's stability. The theoretical basis behind the proposed algorithm is adopted from dynamical systems theory. In particular, the algorithm approximately computes the system's Lyapunov exponent (LE), thereby measuring the exponential convergence or divergence rate of the rotor angle trajectories. The LE serves as a certificate of stability where the positive (negative) value of the LE implies exponential divergence (convergence) of nearby system trajectories, hence, unstable (stable) rotor angle dynamics. We also show the proposed model-free algorithm can be used for the identification of the coherent sets of generators. The simulation results are presented to verify the developed results in the paper on the modified IEEE 162-bus system.

Abstract: Impact of increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation is expected in Japan in the near future; thus a new voltage control scheme is required in order to improve the operation of distribution networks. We propose a new voltage control scheme for distribution networks based on a multi-agent system. The large voltage fluctuations caused by PV generations are effectively regulated by adjusting the conventional types of tap-changing controllers. We achieved an optimal control performance by developing a new optimal control law applicable to decentralized autonomous control. The autonomy is accomplished by using a multi-agent system. The proposed method is applicable to general distribution network and highly efficient for popular radial networks under certain approximations. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations of radial 6.6-kV test system with successful results.

Abstract: Uncertainty and geographical diversity of wind speeds create risk for a wind power generation company (WGenco) to make the maximum profit from power market trading. A probabilistic approach is proposed to estimate the profit of a WGenco considering geographical diversity and uncertainty of wind speeds and market prices. The objective of the optimization problem is to assist a WGenco to do the optimal bidding in market trading in order to make the maximum profit under various market and wind speed uncertainties. The point estimate method (PEM) has been improved to facilitate stochastic modeling of the aggregated power output of wind turbine generators in different locations in the problem formulation. The principal component analysis (PCA) is used to manage correlated wind speeds.

Abstract: In this paper, a multi-period integrated framework is developed for generation expansion planning (GEP), transmission expansion planning (TEP), and natural gas grid expansion planning (NGGEP) problems for large-scale systems. New nodal generation requirements, new transmission lines, and natural gas (NG) pipelines are simultaneously obtained in a multi-period planning horizon. In addition, a new approach is proposed to compute NG load flow by considering grid compressors. In order to solve the large-scale mixed integer nonlinear problem, a framework is developed based on genetic algorithms. The proposed framework performance is investigated by applying it to a typical electric-NG combined grid. Moreover, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for real-world systems, it has been applied to the Iranian power and NG system, including 98 power plants, 521 buses, 1060 transmission lines, and 92 NG pipelines. The results indicate that the proposed framework is applicable for large-scale and real-world systems.

Abstract: The need for improved utilization of existing system assets and energy sources, as well as the smooth incorporation of new technologies (such as electric vehicles) into the grid, has prompted the participation of small power consumers and generators in the energy markets. A problem of such scale however cannot be managed in a centralized manner in its full detail. This paper examines the idea of a decentralized approach in clearing the energy market. A general framework for the problem decomposition and its distributed solution is presented and analyzed. A key point of interest in this work is the fundamental question of how far decomposition may be pursued for a given system, while still achieving reasonable convergence properties. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated and solved through a parallel implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A thorough investigation of its convergence properties is conducted, and through its coordination with an additional proximal based decomposition method, we improve its scalability characteristics.

Abstract: Power systems can make use of electric vehicle (EV) charging to improve system reliability. EV charging can serve the grid with charging interruption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity-injecting energy back into the system during the outage. However, the contribution of EVs is uncertain because they serve both the power system and the transportation sector. Scheduled EV charging can be affected either by failures of components such as charging facilities, or by human errors such as punctuality, rounding of time and errors in forecast of energy consumption. Moreover, with the introduction of the aggregator, the realization of EVs' grid services also plays an important role. This paper examines uncertainties of EV charging that can affect the EVs' capability to improve the system reliability. Methods are proposed to incorporate these uncertainties into generating system well-being analysis. Results show that the uncertainties identified directly affect EVs' contribution in the system well-being enhancement.

Abstract: DC microgrids may have time-varying system structures and operation patterns due to the flexibility and uncertainty of distributed resources. This feature poses a challenge to conventional stability analysis methods, which are based on fixed and complete system models. To solve this problem, the concept of self-disciplined stabilization is introduced in this paper. A common stability discipline is established using the passivity-based control theory, which ensures that a microgrid is always stable as long as this discipline is complied by each individual converter. In this way, the stabilization task is localized to avoid investigating the entire microgrid, thereby providing immunity against system variations. Moreover, a passivity margin criterion is proposed to further enhance the stability margin of the self-disciplined control. The modified criterion imposes a tighter phase restriction to provide explicit phase margins and prevent under-damped transient oscillations. In line with this criterion, a practical control algorithm is also derived, which increases the converter's passivity through voltage feed forward. The major theoretical conclusions are verified by a laboratory DC microgrid test bench.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel entropy-based metric to characterize the fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) phenomenon. In particular, we make use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to determine both the rate and the level of voltage recovery following a fault or disturbance. The computation of the entropy-based measure relies on voltage time-series data and is independent of the underlying system model used to generate the voltage time-series. The proposed measure provides quantitative information about the degree of WECC voltage performance violation for FIDVR phenomenon. The quantitative measure for violation allows one to compare the voltage responses of different buses to various contingencies and to rank order them, based on the degree of violation.

Abstract: High-quality wind power prediction intervals (PIs) are of utmost importance for system planning and operation. To improve the reliability and sharpness of PIs, this paper proposes a new approach in which the original wind power series is first decomposed and grouped into components of reduced order of complexity using ensemble empirical mode decomposition and sample entropy techniques. The methods for the prediction of these components with extreme learning machine technique and the formation of the overall optimal PIs are then described. The effectiveness of proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to real wind farms from Australia and National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Compared to the existing methods without wind power series decomposition, the proposed approach is found to be more effective for wind power interval forecasts with higher reliability and sharpness.

Abstract: Power system voltage control has traditionally been the responsibility of transmission-connected reactive power resources. Accordingly, high penetration levels of distributed generation present new challenges for reactive power management. Simply stipulating voltage control operation for distributed generators will not generally deliver voltage-responsive reactive power flows at the transmission system level, due mainly to the voltage-isolating effects of tap-changing bulk supply transformers. Additionally, the resistance of distribution system conductors establishes an unhelpful interaction between active power flows and voltage magnitudes. This work uses optimal power flow techniques to explore two ways to overcome these challenges. Most innovatively, a methodology is presented to optimally select static voltage control settings for distributed generators and transformers, such that they will provide an autonomous voltage-responsive behavior without supervisory control systems. In this scheme, distributed generators are exposed to transmission voltage fluctuations as far as is feasible, by blocking the tapping of the bulk supply transformer when operating within an optimally-determined range of transmission voltages. Comparatively, an active control scheme is presented, where reactive power and tap positions are dispatched period-to-period to support the transmission system voltage. Comparing these approaches suggests the level of smart-grids investment required to effectively harness the reactive power available from distributed generation.

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic energy level balancing between distributed storage devices as a strategy to improve frequency regulation and reliability in droop controlled microgrids. This has been achieved with a distributed multi-agent cooperative control system which modifies the output power of droop controlled storage devices so that they reach a balanced energy state. As the storage devices approach a common energy level they are able to contribute their full power capacity to deal with generation and demand fluctuations in the microgrid. The cooperative control system also provides secondary frequency control, restoring the microgrid to the reference frequency. Simulations have been completed showing that the cooperative control system improves frequency regulation compared to traditional droop control strategies when the storage devices begin at different energy levels and the microgrid experiences generation or demand variability. A control input saturation constraint has been developed which ensures that the cooperative control system will not overload the storage devices.

Abstract: The burden on conventional units to regulate the system frequency increases if they are replaced due to wind farms. This paper explores up to which time scales the rotating kinetic energy in wind turbines can smooth frequency variations and assist with the regulation task. To this end, a comparison is made between a standard wind turbine controller and optimal control of wind turbines, respectively derived from causal time-domain simulations and an optimization algorithm that allows predicting. The latter algorithm is used to give a benchmark for the smoothing potential, shown by plotting the Pareto efficiency of the normalized standard deviation of frequency variability versus a normalized measure of the energy yield. Results indicate that smoothing comes with an energy loss that is determined by the energy content of power imbalances. It is shown that a wind share of 20%, within the instantaneous generation mix, can absorb frequency variations on timescales up to 100 sec while the energy loss is limited to only 2%. A higher share of wind power aggravates frequency variability. Nevertheless, in such circumstances the potential of rotating kinetic energy in wind farms increases.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that machine learning can be used to create effective algorithm selectors that select between power system control algorithms depending on the state of a network, achieving better performance than always using the same algorithm for every state. Also presented is a novel method for creating algorithm selectors that consider two objectives. The method is used to develop algorithm selectors for power flow management algorithms on versions of the IEEE 14- and 57-bus networks, and a network derived from a real distribution network. The selectors choose from within a diverse set of power flow management algorithms, including those based on constraint satisfaction, optimal power flow, power flow sensitivity factors, and linear programming. The network state-based algorithm selectors offer performance benefits over always using the same power flow management algorithm for every state, in terms of minimizing the number of overloads while also minimizing the curtailment applied to generators.

Abstract: Subsynchronous resonance (SSR) was observed in wind farms located in North China. These wind farms prevailingly consist of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) and are connected to series-compensated transmission lines. The observed resonant frequency is about 6 similar to 8 Hz, which is much lower than that of the reported SSR occurred in Texas. The frequency varies during the occurrence and this phenomenon is observed for the first time. The output power is usually within a certain range, when SSR occurs. Based on the practical system, an equivalent simulation system has been established, in which wind farms are modeled as many identical low rating DFIGs. Then, the SSR event is reproduced by simulations. Analysis results indicate that SSR happens even when the equivalent transmission system compensation level seen from wind farms is only 6.67%. Eigenvalue analysis shows that this phenomenon is an electrical resonance, and could be affected considerably by wind speed, number and control of DFIGs. The number of in-service DFIGs has a nonlinear impact on the damping of SSR. An equivalent electric circuit is deduced to intuitively explain why SSR happens and how the above factors affect it. Considering its features, this phenomenon is recognized as DFIG control participated induction generator effect.

Abstract: The paper assesses the cyber-security of power systems static state estimation (SE) in the possible presence of phasor measurement units (PMUs). Attacks are considered in the Jacobian matrix or the measurement function of the state estimation leading to the presence of coordinated leverage points. Leverage points, which are outliers, constitute a very challenging attack configuration even if randomly present. It is shown that coordinated cyber-attacks when applied to the Jacobian matrix raise major concerns about robust SE. The vulnerability of the least trimmed squares (LTS) estimator, which is robust towards leverage points, is shown. More generally, the weaknesses of robust regression equivariant estimators are discussed if attacks are developed and optimized based on a projection framework. Attack scenarios are outlined considering the number of attacked Jacobian elements, a decomposition of the system to maximize robustness, and whether a DC or AC formulation is used by the operator. Stealthy attacks that stay undetected with respect to the robust LTS are studied. Masked attacks are defined as well. Some possible solutions and remedial actions are proposed. Robust state estimation methods are evaluated and compared in the presence of different configurations of attacks through Monte Carlo simulations on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus test beds.

Abstract: This paper incorporates, as part of an attacker-defender (AD) model for an electric power transmission grid, an inventory of "recovery spares" for high-voltage transformers (HVTs). In this sequential-game model, an attacker first uses limited resources to disable grid components, seeking to maximize second-stage "total cost." This value corresponds to a defender who operates the damaged grid to minimize generating and economic load-shedding costs. The defender's problem includes 1) optimal power-flow solutions to represent post-attack operations, 2) optimized replacement of disabled HVTs with quickly installable recovery spares, and 3) longer-term replacements using new procurements. Global Benders decomposition, with a mixed-integer subproblem, solves the AD model; new enumerative techniques help solve the decomposition's master problem and subproblems. Computational tests demonstrate tradeoffs between the number of recovery spares and worst-case total cost, and show how the model could help guide an inventory strategy for recovery spares in an adversarial setting.

Abstract: This paper presents the modeling of intelligent energy control center (ECC) controlling distributed generators (DGs) using multi-agent system. Multi-agent system has been proposed to provide intelligent energy control and management in grids because of their benefits of extensibility, autonomy, reduced maintenance, etc. The multi-agent system constituting the smart grid and agents such as user agent, control agent, database agent, distributed energy resources (DER) agent work in collaboration to perform assigned tasks. The wind power generator connected with local load, the solar power connected with local load and the ECC controlled by fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The DER model is created in client and ECC is created in server. Communication between the server and the client is established using transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP). The results indicate that the controlling of DER agent can be achieved both from server and client.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the complementarity, connection technology and network control strategy of offshore wind generation on the probabilistic small-signal stability of power systems. The cumulant-based theory is firstly applied to assess the variances of both the complementarity of combined wind power and the probabilistic small-signal stability of power systems. These variances are later employed as two indices to explain how the different complementarity levels, connection topologies and DC network control schemes of offshore wind generation affects the probabilistic distribution of critical eigenvalue and thus the probabilistic small-signal stability. In the paper, an example of 16-machine 5-area power system with three grid-connected offshore wind farms is presented. The index of probabilistic small-signal stability is computed and then compared under two complementarity conditions, two typical HVDC transmission systems through which the offshore wind farms are connected, and two DC grid control schemes, respectively. It is demonstrated that complementarity can effectively enhance probabilistic stability and multi-terminal HVDC may have either beneficial or detrimental impact on small-signal stability depending on the control pattern and setting when compared with point-to-point topology.

Abstract: Usage of wide area PSSs (WAPSS) in actual power systems is limited because of their restricted adaptability to different operating conditions. Numerous adaptive control methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but they are limited due to strict prerequisites, such as the necessity of consistent excitations or large disturbances. This paper, therefore, presents a novel adaptive wide area PSS (AWAPSS), which has the ability of tracking system operating condition without the need for meeting the above prerequisites. The inherent dead-band structure of a WAPSS enables a steady system to perform like in an open loop, thus allowing the parameters of a WAPSS to be tuned adaptively through output-only modal analysis. The effectiveness of the novel AWAPSS has been validated in a two-area four-machine system as well as in a large complex system, China Southern Grid.

Abstract: With the rising number of intermittent renewable energy sources and growing energy demand, transfer capabilities are very close to their limits. Consequently, redispatch events occur more frequently and flexibility of conventional generation and storage devices will become increasingly important. The cooperative multi-area optimization strategy presented here enables transmission system operators (TSOs) to dispatch/redispatch interconnected networks securely, while reducing dispatch/redispatch costs. Schedules for storage devices, conventional-and renewable generation are obtained considering network constraints and ramping rates. An optimal schedule for several control areas is attained, including storage operation to achieve congestion relief. The distributed approach preserves control area responsibilities. All participating control areas attain a schedule close to the global optimum. TSOs implement agreements to share resulting profits. The functionality was shown successfully using stressed 14- and 118-node systems. A cross border dispatch with use of storage devices is realized to maintain a high share of renewable energy source (RES) feed-in, while reducing overall dispatch costs.

Abstract: The demand of electricity keeps increasing in this modern society and the behavior of customers vary greatly from time to time, city to city, type to type, etc. Generally, buildings are classified into residential, commercial and industrial. This study is aimed to distinguish the types of residential buildings in Singapore and establish a mathematical model to represent and model the load profile of each type. Modeling household energy consumption is the first step in exploring the possible demand response and load reduction opportunities under the smart grid initiative. Residential electricity load profiling includes the details on the electrical appliances, its energy requirement, and consumption pattern. The model is generated with a bottom-up load model. Simulation is performed for daily load profiles of 1 or 2 rooms, 3 rooms, 4 rooms and 5 rooms public housing. The simulated load profile is successfully validated against the measured electricity consumption data, using a web-based Customer Energy Portal (CEP) at the campus housings of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Abstract: The integration of intermittent generation in power grids, such as wind energy, imposes new challenges for transmission congestion management. In order to solve this problem, energy storage systems (ESS) have been proposed in the literature, as they provide an efficient mechanism for balancing variability while reducing operational costs. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interactions between wind energy curtailment and an energy storage system (ESS) when the ramping rates of power plants are considered. An analytical framework is developed to study different mitigation measures in terms of total energy curtailed, total congestion costs, line load factor and congestion probability. This framework is tested in a real case study and a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the influence of the main ESS design parameters in congestion mitigation performance.

Abstract: Due to progressive displacement of conventional power plants by wind turbines, dynamic security of large-scale wind integrated power systems is significantly compromised. In this paper we first highlight the importance of dynamic reactive power support/voltage security in large-scale wind integrated power systems with least presence of conventional power plants. Then we propose a mixed integer dynamic optimization based method for optimal dynamic reactive power allocation in large-scale wind integrated power systems. One of the important aspect of the proposed methodology is that unlike static optimal power flow based approaches, the proposed method considers detailed system dynamics and wind turbine grid code compliance while optimizing the allocation of dynamic reactive power sources. We also advocate that in large-scale wind integrated power systems, 1) better utilization of existing wind turbines especially wind farms with additional grid support functionalities like dynamic support (e.g., dynamic reactive power support, etc.) and 2) refurbishment of existing conventional central power plants to synchronous condensers could be one of the efficient, reliable and cost-effective option to address not only the issue of dynamic voltage security but also to strengthen other dynamic capabilities of the system including system inertia, etc. that are also significant challenges in large-scale wind penetrated power system. The proposed methodology is applied to the detailed model of the western Danish power system which is characterized by large-scale wind integration and least presence of central power plants.

Abstract: Two distinct methods of applying generalized averaging techniques appear in the literature. The first method involves a direct mathematical mapping of all system equations and inputs into the frequency domain to produce harmonic coefficients that precisely match those produced by a sliding window Fourier decomposition during transient events. Although this approach reproduces the same harmonic coefficients as a sliding window decomposition, it is shown that reconstruction of the time domain waveforms does not match the response of the underlying time domain system during transients. In contrast, a second method has recently been employed by some researchers that does not strictly map all system equations and inputs into the frequency domain, and yet it has been shown to precisely reproduce time domain results during transients. This paper shows that this matching of the time domain transients comes at the expense of introducing spurious dynamics into the associated harmonic domain model, which may not exist in the underlying time domain system. The limitations and implicit assumptions behind these two methods are identified and compared, thus allowing researchers to readily determine which compromises are to be made based on the application in question.

Abstract: In this paper we describe an analytical method for estimating uncertainty in distribution loads, with applications to network monitoring and optimal meter placement. Our model works by assessing the impact of consumption aggregation from customers of different types, in order to determine the mean and variance of loading profile in each distribution transformer in the network. Such parameters are then adjusted by correlating with real-time information taken from the supervisory control and data acquisition system. Studies have been conducted on actual data to verify the proposed model and show its application for the optimal meter placement in distribution networks.

Abstract: Energy storage can alleviate the problems that the uncertainty and variability associated with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar create in power systems. Besides applications such as frequency control, temporal arbitrage or the provision of reserve, where the location of storage is not particularly relevant, distributed storage could also be used to alleviate congestion in the transmission network. In such cases, the siting and sizing of this distributed storage is of crucial importance to its cost-effectiveness. This paper describes a three-stage planning procedure to identify the optimal locations and parameters of distributed storage units. In the first stage, the optimal storage locations and parameters are determined for each day of the year individually. In the second stage, a number of storage units is available at the locations that were identified as being optimal in the first stage, and their optimal energy and power ratings are determined. Finally, in the third stage, with both the locations and ratings fixed, the optimal operation of the storage units is simulated to quantify the benefits that they would provide by reducing congestion. The quality of the final solution is assessed by comparing it with the solution obtained at the first stage without constraints on storage sites or size. The approach is numerically tested on the IEEE RTS 96.

Abstract: In this paper, a new multi-agent control system (MACS) is proposed for smart distribution networks. It can: 1) eliminate the feeders' congestion, 2) globally correct voltage violations, and 3) coordinate the operation of reactive power control devices. In performing its functions, the MACS must prevent overstress on the substation voltage regulator tap changer under all operating conditions, and avoid selective active power curtailment from DG units. This can help to improve reliability, economic revenue, and power quality. A fuzzy rule-based system is employed for decision-making support in MACS. The proposed MACS can achieve the self-healing requirement of smart distribution network. It eliminates feeders' congestion by properly reconfiguring the distribution network. Meanwhile, it amends most of voltage violation problems by coordinated operation of voltage control devices in the distribution system. The MACS overcomes the severe voltage violation problems via distribution network reconfiguration. It is applied to the IEEE 33-bus test feeder. A full dynamic model is constructed using a parallel MATLAB-JADE simulation arrangement. Comparative performance evaluations of the MACS and other schemes are presented under various conditions.

Abstract: A recent solution to tackle environmental issues is the electrification of transportation. Effective integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into the grid is important in the process of achieving sustainable development. One of the key solutions regarding the need for charging stations is the installation of PEV parking lots (PLs). However, contrary to common parkings, PLs are constrained by various organizations such as municipalities, urban traffic regulators, and electrical distribution systems. Therefore, this paper aims to allocate PLs in distribution systems with the objective of minimizing system costs including power loss, network reliability, and voltage deviation as possible objectives. A two-stage model has been designed for this purpose. PLs' behavior considering market interactions is optimized at the first stage to provide profit to the PL owner. At the second stage, the PL allocation problem is solved considering various network constraints. Conclusions are duly drawn with a realistic example.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of voltage regulation in power distribution networks with deep-penetration of distributed energy resources, e.g., renewable-based generation, and storage-capable loads such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. We cast the problem as an optimization program, where the objective is to minimize the losses in the network subject to constraints on bus voltage magnitudes, limits on active and reactive power injections, transmission line thermal limits and losses. We provide sufficient conditions under which the optimization problem can be solved via its convex relaxation. Using data from existing networks, we show that these sufficient conditions are expected to be satisfied by most networks. We also provide an efficient distributed algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm adheres to a communication topology described by a graph that is the same as the graph that describes the electrical network topology. We illustrate the operation of the algorithm, including its robustness against communication link failures, through several case studies involving 5-, 34-, and 123-bus power distribution systems.

Abstract: Independent system operators (ISOs) of electricity markets solve the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem to plan a secure and economic generation schedule. However, as the size of power systems increases, the current centralized SCUC algorithm could face critical challenges ranging from modeling accuracy to calculation complexity. This paper presents a distributed SCUC (D-SCUC) algorithm to accelerate the generation scheduling of large-scale power systems. In this algorithm, a power system is decomposed into several scalable zones which are interconnected through tie lines. Each zone solves its own SCUC problem and a parallel calculation method is proposed to coordinate individual D-SCUC problems. Several power systems are studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a hybrid AC-DC offshore wind power plant (OWPP) topology and to optimize its design in order to minimize the OWPP's total cost. This hybrid concept is based on clustering wind turbines and connecting each group to an AC/DC power converter installed on a collector platform which is located between the AC wind turbine array and the HVDC offshore platform. Thereby, individual power converters of each wind turbine are not required, since such AC/DC converters can provide variable speed generator control for each cluster. The optimal design for an OWPP based on the hybrid AC-DC topology is formulated as a MINLP problem. The capital costs of each component within the OWPP as well as the costs associated to the inherent losses of this topology are minimized. The optimal number of AC/DC converters and offshore collector platforms needed, as well as their locations, are determined. The cable route connecting the wind turbines between each other is also optimized. The results suggests a good potential for the hybrid AC-DC OWPP topology achieving a total cost saving of 3.76% for the case study compared to the conventional OWPP topology.

Abstract: The feeder reconfiguration problem chooses the on/off status of the switches in a distribution network in order to minimize a certain cost such as power loss. It is a mixed-integer nonlinear program and, hence, hard to solve. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm that is based on the recently developed convex relaxation of the ac optimal power flow problem. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales linearly with the number of redundant lines. It requires neither parameter tuning nor initialization for different networks. It successfully computes an optimal configuration on all four networks we have tested. Moreover, we have proved that the algorithm solves the feeder reconfiguration problem optimally under certain conditions for the case where only a single redundant line needs to be opened. We also propose a more computationally efficient algorithm and show that it incurs a loss in optimality of less than 3% on the four test networks.

Abstract: This paper presents the distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP) method through quadratic programming (QP) designed to alleviate the congestion that might occur in a distribution network with high penetration of flexible demands. In the DLMP method, the distribution system operator (DSO) calculates dynamic tariffs and publishes them to the aggregators, who make the optimal energy plans for the flexible demands. The DLMP through QP instead of linear programing as studied in previous literatures solves the multiple solution issue of the aggregator optimization which may cause the decentralized congestion management by DLMP to fail. It is proven in this paper, using convex optimization theory, the aggregator's optimization problem through QP is strictly convex and has a unique solution. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the unique solution of the aggregator optimization ensure that the centralized DSO optimization and the decentralized aggregator optimization converge. Case studies using a distribution network with high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs) validate the equivalence of the two optimization setups, and the efficacy of the proposed DLMP through QP for congestion management.

Abstract: Cooperation between controllable loads such as electrical vehicles (EVs) and wind power is regarded as a promising way to promote the integration of wind power. A novel layered and distributed charging load dispatch mechanism is proposed for the control of thousands of EVs in this paper. Based on the Lagrangian Relaxation and Auxiliary Problem Principle, the dispatch framework is developed, consisting of layers of system operator, generation units/EV aggregators, and EVs, and the cooperation between the generation and EVs is considered. Furthermore, the necessity of EV aggregators is analyzed, and the function of them is stressed. Compared with existing distributed methods, the proposed method is proper for large populations of EVs and gains an advantage in reducing generation cost directly. In addition, it is with a wider application scope such as problems with coupled constraints. The case study on IEEE-RTS verifies the method is feasible and valid and the charge load dispatch based on it reduces generation cost and wind power spillage.

Abstract: Load shedding (LS) is the last firewall and the most expensive control action against power system blackout. In the conventional under frequency LS (UFLS) schemes, the load drop locations are already determined independently of the event location. Furthermore, the frequency thresholds of LS relays are prespecified and constant values which may not be a comprehensive solution for widespread range of possible events. This paper addresses the decentralized LS in which the instantaneous voltage deviation of load buses is used to determine the frequency thresholds of LS relays. The higher frequency thresholds are assigned to the loads with larger voltage decay which are often located in the vicinity of disturbance location. The proposed method simultaneously benefits from individual UFLS and under voltage LS (UVLS) features which operate in the power system without coordination. Numerical simulations in DigSilent Power Factory software confirm the efficiency of proposed methodology in the stabilization of the power system after various severe contingencies.

Abstract: Day-ahead energy market clearing relies on a deterministic equivalent model with a limited time horizon, which may lead to inefficient scheduling of generating units from the point of view of generators. For this reason, generators may wish to assume the risk of self-committing their units with the hope of securing greater profits. This phenomenon may reduce the room for economic signals in the day-ahead market. In this paper we investigate the influence of risk aversion and price volatility on the decision of generators to self-commit units. We present a stochastic programming model for self-committing combined cycle units under price uncertainty with a conditional value at risk criterion. We use Benders decomposition to solve the problem and present results on a case study to draw conclusions.

Abstract: In order to ensure a reliable and continuous supply of electric energy, operators must manage hundreds to thousands of generators with complex operating requirements, maintain synchronism, and manage thousands of transmission assets. Further complications arise due to stringent reliability standards, resource uncertainty, and limited economical energy storage. With advances in algorithmic performance and hardware, such optimization problems still require an engineered and simplified market structure. Market operators must therefore adjust the proposed market solution in order to obtain a valid solution. An overview of existing industry practices related to such market adjustments, referred to as out-of-market corrections, is presented. This paper also analyzes the market implications and required out-of-market corrections for the day-ahead scheduling process. Multiple out-of-market correction algorithms are created and used to analyze the potential impacts on market solutions and settlements. Finally, such solutions are compared against an extensive form stochastic unit commitment solution.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enable frequent computational cycles in online dynamic security assessment by using the terms of the transient energy function (TEF) as input features to a machine learning algorithm. The aim is to train a single classifier that is capable of classifying stable and unstable operating points independent of the contingency. The network is trained based on the current system topology and the loading conditions. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the New England 39-bus test power system model using the support vector machine as the machine learning technique. It is shown that the classifier can be trained using a small set of data when the terms of the TEF are used as input features. The prediction accuracy of the proposed scheme was tested under the balanced and unbalanced faults with the presence of voltage sensitive and dynamic loads for different operating points.

Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for economic dispatch in electric power grids. The method is inspired by statistical inference methods. Using discretized optimization variables, our algorithm finds the globally optimal, single time-step dispatch assignment for radial grids in linear time with respect to the number of network nodes. For such problems, the algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art mixed-integer scheduling, both in run-time and in the allowed complexity of component and line models. Moreover, the necessary computations can be performed in a distributed fashion, facilitating both practical implementation as well as information privacy. Our algorithm is thus optimally suited for the very large dispatch problems that will arise in future smart distribution grids with hosts of small, decentralized, and flexibly controllable prosumers, i.e., entities able to consume and produce electricity.

Abstract: We use a unit commitment (UC) model to quantify the operational impacts of subsidizing wind generation when energy prices are negative. Such prices occur increasingly often in U.S. and European Union (EU) markets. Subsidies such as production tax credits, feed-in tariffs, and renewable energy credits motivate renewable generators to submit negative price offers; this lessened flexibility increases system operation and management costs and, in some cases, CO2 emissions when energy prices are negative. Our simulations of large negative bids can also be interpreted as representing EU policies of granting wind absolute dispatch priority. Applications to four hypothetical systems with high wind penetration and distinct generation mixes quantify the UC and dispatch effects of negative bids. Larger negative bids lead to less wind spillage (reducing the 2.8% average curtailment under $0 bids to 1.0%), more conventional plant startups, higher system costs, and, in many cases, higher total CO2 emissions (by up to 2%). In some systems, wind power's effective incremental emissions are as high as coal's. This impact depends strongly on generation mix, carbon price, and the size of the negative bids. In general, there can be significant economic and, often, environmental benefits to reforming renewable support policies to encourage flexibility in operations.

Abstract: To respond to volatility and congestion in the power grid, demand response (DR) mechanisms allow for shaping the load compared to a base load profile. When tapping on a large population of heterogeneous appliances as a DR resource, the challenge is in modeling the dimensions available for control. Such models need to strike the right balance between accuracy of the model and tractability. The goal of this paper is to provide a medium-grained stochastic hybrid model to represent a population of appliances that belong to two classes: deferrable or thermostatically controlled loads. We preserve quantized information regarding individual load constraints, while discarding information about the identity of appliance owners. The advantages of our proposed population model are 1) it allows us to model and control load in a scalable fashion, useful for ex-ante planning by an aggregator or for real-time load control; 2) it allows for the preservation of the privacy of end-use customers that own submetered or directly controlled appliances.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to determine suitable countermeasures against emerging aperiodic small disturbance rotor angle (ASD) instability. The method utilizes stability indicators, computed in real time, to define a criterion for ASD stability. Sensitivities of these stability indicators are then determined and used to identify the most influential nodes for countermeasures. To increase the computational speed, only nodes visited by a self-propagating graph, rooted at the vulnerable generator, will have their sensitivities calculated. The steady state voltages after a given countermeasure are then determined, using a grid transformation coefficient (GTC) and a numerical, iterative solution to an equation system. The stability criteria can then be assessed to evaluate the sufficiency of a suggested countermeasure. The method is demonstrated on a synthetic 8-bus network and a 464-bus model of the Western Denmark transmission grid. The method successfully demonstrates its ability to efficiently identify and evaluate countermeasures for a large, practical system.

Abstract: High net load variability, driven by high penetrations of wind and solar generation, will create challenges for system operators in the future, as installed wind generation capacities increase to unprecedented levels globally. Maintaining system reliability, particularly at shorter time-scales, leads to increased levels of conventional plant starts and ramping, and higher levels of wind curtailment, with sub-hourly unit commitment and economic dispatch required to capture the increased cycling burden. The role of energy storage in reducing operating costs and enhancing system flexibility is explored, with key storage plant characteristics for balancing at this time-scale identified and discussed in relation to existing and emerging grid-scale storage technologies. Unit dispatches for the additional storage plant with varying characteristics highlight the unsuitability of energy only markets in incentivizing suitable levels of flexibility for future systems with high net load variability.

Abstract: Optimization models have been widely used in the power industry to aid the decision-making process of scheduling and dispatching electric power generation resources, a process known as unit commitment (UC). Since UC's birth, there have been two major waves of revolution on UC research and real life practice. The first wave has made mixed integer programming stand out from the early solution and modeling approaches for deterministic UC, such as priority list, dynamic programming, and Lagrangian relaxation. With the high penetration of renewable energy, increasing deregulation of the electricity industry, and growing demands on system reliability, the next wave is focused on transitioning from traditional deterministic approaches to stochastic optimization for unit commitment. Since the literature has grown rapidly in the past several years, this paper is to review the works that have contributed to the modeling and computational aspects of stochastic optimization (SO) based UC. Relevant lines of future research are also discussed to help transform research advances into real-world applications.

Abstract: The exceptional benefits of wind power as an environmentally responsible renewable energy resource have led to an increasing penetration of wind energy in today's power systems. This trend has started to reshape the paradigms of power system operations, as dealing with uncertainty caused by the highly intermittent and uncertain wind power becomes a significant issue. Motivated by this, we present a new framework using adaptive robust optimization for the economic dispatch of power systems with high level of wind penetration. In particular, we propose an adaptive robust optimization model for multi-period economic dispatch, and introduce the concept of dynamic uncertainty sets and methods to construct such sets to model temporal and spatial correlations of uncertainty. We also develop a simulation platform which combines the proposed robust economic dispatch model with statistical prediction tools in a rolling horizon framework. We have conducted extensive computational experiments on this platform using real wind data. The results are promising and demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of cost and reliability over existing robust optimization models as well as recent look-ahead dispatch models.

Abstract: A new decentralized approach for solving the economic dispatch problem is presented in this paper. The proposed approach consists of either two or three stages. In the first stage, a flooding-based consensus algorithm is proposed in order to achieve consensus among the agents with respect to the units and system data. In the second stage, a suitable algorithm is used for solving the economic dispatch problem in parallel. For cases in which a nondeterministic method is used in the second stage, a third stage is applied to achieve consensus about the final solution of the problem, with a flooding-based consensus algorithm for sharing the information required during this stage. The proposed approach is highly effective for solving the non-convex formulation of the economic dispatch problem and for incorporating transmission losses accurately in a fully decentralized manner. Three case studies that were examined for validation purposes are described. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach aggregates many of the advantages of both centralized and fully decentralized mechanisms for solving the economic dispatch problem.

Abstract: Dynamic line rating based on real time meteorological data has been shown to be useful in transmission line capacity management. Based on a binary rating forecast, we propose a distributionally robust congestion management model that selectively uses dynamic ratings on critical lines and keeps the risk of thermal overloading below a prescribed level. A case study illustrates that the proposed model can effectively alleviate transmission congestion with a low error rate.

Abstract: Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) and security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problems are necessary tools to system operators for operational planning and near-to-real-time operation. The solution times of these problems are challenging mainly due to their inherent large size. Previous studies have shown that relatively few of those problems' constraints serve to enclose their feasible set of solutions. Therefore, the constraints that do not contribute to the feasible set of solutions could be discarded to decrease the size of these problems and their associated solution times. Umbrella constraint discovery (UCD) has been proposed to identify and rule out redundant constraints in dc-SCOPF problems. In this paper, we propose an improvement over the original UCD formulation that exploits the structure of its parent SCOPF problem. This new partial UCD approach can lead to significant speed-ups in terms of UCD solution time and size. Based on the encouraging results for partial UCD on SCOPF, we apply the technique on SCUC. Alike in SCOPF, partial UCD can efficiently strip out redundant (i. e., non-umbrella) constraints off SCUC. We find, however, that because of its structure, SCUC has a much lower proportion of non-umbrella constraints in comparison to SCOPF.

Abstract: Conventionally, power flow equations are used for distribution systems (DS) analysis to find the nodal voltages. For the particular form of the DS reconfiguration problem, however, a direct formulation in terms of branch flows allows a substantial increase in solution efficiency from an optimization point of view. In this paper, a set of linear current flow (LCF) equations are derived for DS. This formulation is then used within the network reconfiguration problem for loss minimization. A mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) formulation, together with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, are proposed in this paper and assessed through simulations. In these comparisons, the MILP formulation shows computational advantages over the MIQCP version and the preceding literature. The proposed methods are evaluated on several test systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to compute linear sensitivity distribution factors (DFs) in near real time without relying on a power flow model of the system. Specifically, we compute the injection shift factors (ISFs) of a particular line of interest with respect to active power injections at all buses (all other DFs can be determined from ISFs). The proposed ISF estimation method relies on the solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations that arise from high-frequency synchronized measurements obtained from phasor measurement units. We exploit a sparse representation (i.e., one in which many elements are zero) of the vector of desired ISFs via rearrangement by electrical distance and an appropriately chosen linear transformation, and cast the estimation problem into a sparse vector recovery problem. As we illustrate through case studies, the proposed approach provides accurate DF estimates with fewer sets of synchronized measurements than earlier approaches that rely on the solution of an overdetermined system of equations via the least-squares errors estimation method.

Abstract: The analysis of severe blackouts has become an essential part of transmission grid planning and operation. This may include evaluation of rare-event probabilities, which can be difficult to estimate. While simulation offers flexibility to model large complex systems, efficiency remains a big concern when estimating very small probabilities. This paper presents an effective simulation technique to evaluate rare-event probabilities associated with cascading blackouts in an electric grid. We test our technique on an IEEE 118-bus electric network and show that it can dramatically improve simulation efficiency. We also demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively locate vulnerable links. These are links whose failures lead to the highest probabilities of a blackout event.

Abstract: In this paper, the empirical observability Gramian calculated around the operating region of a power system is used to quantify the degree of observability of the system states under specific phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement. An optimal PMU placement method for power system dynamic state estimation is further formulated as an optimization problem which maximizes the determinant of the empirical observability Gramian and is efficiently solved by the NOMAD solver, which implements the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm. The implementation, validation, and the robustness to load fluctuations and contingencies of the proposed method are carefully discussed. The proposed method is tested on WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system and NPCC 48-machine 140-bus system by performing dynamic state estimation with square-root unscented Kalman filter. The simulation results show that the determined optimal PMU placements by the proposed method can guarantee good observability of the system states, which further leads to smaller estimation errors and larger number of convergent states for dynamic state estimation compared with random PMU placements. Under optimal PMU placements an obvious observability transition can be observed. The proposed method is also validated to be very robust to both load fluctuations and contingencies.

Abstract: The problem of imbalance detection in a three-phase power system using a phasor measurement unit (PMU) is considered. A general model for the zero, positive, and negative sequences from a PMU measurement at off-nominal frequencies is presented and a hypothesis testing framework is formulated. The new formulation takes into account the fact that minor degree of imbalance in the system is acceptable and does not indicate subsequent interruptions, failures, or degradation of physical components. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed and shown to be a function of the negative-sequence phasor estimator and the acceptable level of imbalances for nominal system operations. As a by-product to the proposed detection method, a constrained estimation of the positive and negative phasors and the frequency deviation is obtained for both balanced and unbalanced situations. The theoretical and numerical performance analyses show improved performance over benchmark techniques and robustness to the presence of additional harmonics.

Abstract: An adaptive damping control scheme based on classification and regression tree (CART) using wide-area signals is proposed in this paper. Different polytopes are chosen using classification trees. Next, a family of robust polytopic controllers is designed off-line. Finally, using regression trees and PMU data, the desired polytopic controller is identified in real time. A 16-generator, 68-bus system is used as the test system. Remote signals obtained from PMUs are employed for control purposes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control scheme is able to provide adequate damping for the oscillation modes of interest with respect to varying operating conditions without any prior knowledge of the post-disturbance state.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient approach on static spatial power network expansion planning integrated with generation expansion, while considering complicated environments based on the raster map in geographic information systems (GIS). Candidate plants could be built on any cell in the map, which means that terminals of candidate lines connected to candidate plants are not fixed. This is a remarkable difference from the literature in which the terminals of candidate lines are fixed. The objective is to minimize the total system cost, subject to prevailing investment and operation constraints. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem via integer algebra techniques. A two-step approach is proposed to address the computational complexity. The first step searches optimal electric line routes via dynamic programming, while the second step solves a simplified MILP problem for obtaining final optimal generation and transmission planning strategies based on optimal line routes derived from the first step. In most cases, the proposed two-step approach would derive the same global optimal solutions as those by solving the original formulation directly. Thus, the proposed two-step approach can significantly improve the computational efficiency while maintaining the solution optimality. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The challenges power systems engineers are facing today require the development of new system planning tools for analyzing generation and environmental policy options in the transmission-constrained electricity market. The requirements of a power-system equivalent to be used with such tools are very different from those assumed in the traditional network reduction process. To solve this issue, a novel structure-preserving network equivalent is proposed in this paper for modeling large power systems in the context of analyzing policy options and emissions. In the proposed method, a power system is first clustered into zones based on the similarity of the power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs); network reduction is achieved by aggregating buses (generators/loads) on a zonal basis and modeling inter-zonal transactions (power flows) using equivalent transmission lines. The proposed equivalent is superior to existing bus-aggregation-based equivalents in its accuracy under both the base case and change-case operating conditions. In addition, the method is more computationally efficient than other bus aggregation methods proposed heretofore. This paper also examined several classic clustering techniques and identified their performance and computational efficiencies when applied to very large power systems. The proposed network equivalencing approach is tested on an illustrative six-bus system as well as the 62,000-bus and 80,000-branch Eastern Interconnection (EI).

Abstract: While gas turbines are popular in power networks due to reduced emissions and economical operation, their frequency response characteristics are substantially different from other conventional generation technologies; hence, gas turbine dynamics may influence system stability during significant frequency excursions. This study characterizes the impact of gas turbine combustor lean blowout (LBO) while considering large frequency excursions and, in particular, during short-circuit faults. Studies have shown that combined-cycle gas turbines are more vulnerable to an LBO condition during short-circuit events when they operate at rated power output. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out against a number of factors influencing the LBO, revealing that generator loading and rate-of-change-of-frequency are the main contributing factors for the LBO. Furthermore, mitigation strategies are also proposed to alleviate the LBO condition during large frequency excursions.

Abstract: Distribution system reliability, defined by the expected frequency and duration of load service interruptions caused by component failures, is shown to be dependent on the topology of the distribution network, as well as on the relative placement of loads and generators within the system. In a shipboard electrical distribution system, a network topology based on the breaker-and-a-half scheme is shown to confer greater reliability than equivalent distribution topologies based on the ring bus and double bus, double breaker designs. The overall service interruption rate in the breaker-and-a-half topology is 17.8% less than that in the ring bus topology and 40.0% less than that in the double bus, double breaker topology. Further, an optimized equipment placement configuration is algorithmically identified for the loads and generators within the breaker-and-a-half distribution network, further increasing reliability. The optimal equipment placement decreases the overall system interruption rate by 0.54%. The paper also determines an optimal location for additional in-feeds that should be connected to the ship's most critical loads so that maximum benefits to service reliability are obtained.

Abstract: Demand response can be used for providing regulation services in the electricity markets. The retailers can bid in a day-ahead market and respond to real-time regulation signal by load control. This paper proposes a new stochastic ranking method to provide regulation services via demand response. A pool of thermostatically controllable appliances (TCAs) such as air conditioners and water heaters are adjusted using direct load control method. The selection of appliances is based on a probabilistic ranking technique utilizing attributes such as temperature variation and statuses of TCAs. These attributes are stochastically forecasted for the next time step using day-ahead information. System performance is analyzed with a sample regulation signal. Network capability to provide regulation services under various seasons is analyzed. The effect of network size on the regulation services is also investigated.

Abstract: Wind power has had a significant impact on power system stability due to its stochastic nature. In this paper, the impact of stochastic excitation on power-system small-signal stability is investigated based on stochastic differential equation (SDE) theory. The mechanical power input of an asynchronous wind turbine is considered as a stochastic excitation to the system and the system state equation is formulated based on SDE. The mean stability and mean square stability of such a system are demonstrated, and the steady-state expectation and covariance of the system state variables are obtained by mathematical deduction. The numerical simulations are presented on a two-machine infinite bus system and the IEEE 145-bus test system.

Abstract: We present a new methodology to support an energy trading company (ETC) to devise contracting strategies under an optimal risk-averse renewable portfolio. The uncertainty in the generation of renewable energy sources is accounted for by exogenously simulated scenarios, as is customary in stochastic programming. However, we recognize that spot prices largely depend on unpredictable market conditions, making it difficult to capture its underlying stochastic process, which challenges the use of fundamental approaches for forecasting. Under such framework, industry practices make use of stress tests to validate portfolios. We then adapt the robust optimization approach to perform an endogenous stress test for the spot prices as a function of the buy-and-sell portfolio of contracts and renewable energy generation scenarios. The optimal contracting strategy is built through a bilevel optimization model that uses a hybrid approach, mixing stochastic and robust optimization. The proposed model is flexible to represent the traditional stochastic programming approach and to express the ETC's uncertainty aversion in the case where the price distribution cannot be precisely estimated. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated with examples from the Brazilian market, where the proposed approach is contrasted to its stochastic counterpart and both are benchmarked against observed market variables.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal coordinated control methodology based on the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for the multi-area smart generation control (SGC) under the control performance standards (CPS). A new MARL algorithm called correlated Q(lambda) learning (CEQ(lambda)) is presented to form an optimal joint equilibrium strategy for the coordinated load frequency control of interconnected control areas, and a SGC framework is proposed to facilitate information sharing and strategic interaction among multi-areas so as to enhance the overall long-run performance of the control areas. Furthermore, a novel time-varying equilibrium factor is introduced into the equilibrium selection function to identify the optimum equilibrium policies in various power system operation scenarios. The performance of CEQ(lambda) based SGC strategy has been fully tested and benchmarked on a two-area power system and the China Southern Power Grid. Comparative studies have not only demonstrated the superior equilibrium optimization and dynamic performance of the proposed SGC strategy but also confirmed its fast convergence and high flexibility in designing the equilibrium factor for the desirable operating state of correlated equilibria.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the transmission network expansion planning under generalized joint generation and transmission security criteria. The proposed methodology identifies the optimal expansion plan while modeling the power system operation under both normal and contingency states. An adjustable robust optimization approach is presented to circumvent the tractability issues associated with conventional contingency-constrained methods relying on explicitly modeling the whole contingency set. The adjustable robust model is formulated as a trilevel programming problem. The upper-level problem aims at minimizing the investment, operation, and system power imbalance costs. The middle-level problem identifies, for a given expansion plan, the contingency state leading to maximum power imbalance if any. Finally, the lower-level problem models the operator's best reaction for a given contingency and investment plan by minimizing the system power imbalance. The resulting trilevel program is solved by a primal-dual algorithm based on Benders decomposition combined with a column-and-constraint generation procedure. The proposed approach is finitely convergent to the optimal solution and provides a measure of the distance to the optimum. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed methodology over conventional contingency-constrained models.

Abstract: Neatly represented and properly classified load profiles are fundamental to many control optimization techniques of modern power systems, especially in a distribution area. This paper presents a novel load profile management software framework for boosting the efficiency of power systems operation. The proposed framework encodes and classifies load profiles in real-time. Imperfections as well as time-shifts in the input (measured power consumption levels) are tolerated by the suggested system, thus always providing accurate, fast and reliable output. The framework's fully component based structure allows easy customizations of the encoding as well as the classification engines. The default encoding engine is based on an artificial neural network, a variant known as a deep learning auto-encoder comprised from stacked sparse auto-encoders. The default classifier engine is based on an implementation of a locality sensitive hashing algorithm. The developed methodology was tested on the real case of a set of anonymous customers supplied by a power distribution company. The paper also contains an elaboration about the experiences gained during the design, implementation and testing phase of this system as well as a detailed engineering use case of the framework's applicability.

Abstract: Generation capacity expansion planning (GCEP) is the process of deciding on a set of optimal new investments in generation capacity to adequately supply future loads, while satisfying technical and reliability constraints. This paper shows the application of stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) to account for hydrological uncertainty in GCEP for the Chilean Central Interconnected System, using a two-stage SMIP multi-period model with investments and optimal power flow (OPF). The substantial computational challenges posed by GCEP imply compromising between the detail of the stochastic hydrological variables and the detail of the OPF. We selected a subset of hydrological scenarios to represent the historical hydro variability using moment-based scenario reduction techniques. The tradeoff between modeling accuracy and computational complexity was explored both regarding the simplification of the MIP problem and the differences in the variables of interest. Using a simplified OPF model, we found the difference of using a subset of hydro scenarios to be small when compared with using a full representation of the stochastic variable. Overall, SMIP with scenario reduction provided optimal capacity expansion plans whose investment plus expected operational costs were between 1.3% and 1.9% cheaper than using a deterministic approach and proved to be more robust to hydro variability.

Abstract: Severe overloads, caused by the outage of units in multi-transformer substations, may affect transformer life adversely. This paper presents a novel demand response (DR) based optimization model to limit load on healthy transformers during contingencies. The model selects combination of the best remedial actions among DR, load curtailment (LC) and transferring load to a neighboring substation. IEEE standard thermal and aging models are used for transformer loss-of-life (LOL) calculation. For a realistic study, the proposed model is applied to a Finnish residential two-transformer primary substation for case studies of load with and without DR. The load profile and flexibility of the demand are estimated by hourly metered consumption and survey data. Simulations are performed for two situations depending upon availability of connection with a neighboring substation. The results show that the LOL of transformers can be reduced by employing DR following contingency events and the capacity utilization can be increased correspondingly.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new probabilistic method based on chronological Monte Carlo simulation for computing optimal distribution substation spare transformers. The method allows the representation of events such as aging process, load growth, and other conditions not supported by traditional methods based on Poisson and Markov processes. The lifetimes of the transformers are represented by discrete probability distributions, determined by an algorithm that combines the aging of the insulating material, estimated by Arrhenius theory, with the loss of life caused by short-circuits, lightning and switching surges. To illustrate the importance of sizing the inventory based on reliability indices and costs, the proposed method is applied to a group of substations with 177 transformers of 138-13.8 kV, with power rating of 25 MVA. Finally, the proposed methodology is used in combination with a metaheuristic algorithm for determining the optimal timing strategy for composing of the stock of spare transformers over a pre-established planning horizon.

Abstract: Works by Celik and Abur suggest a weighted least absolute value state estimation with transformations (WLAV-T) for attaining insensitiveness of state estimation (SE) to bad measurements by mitigating the effect of leverage points. To further improve its applicability, this letter proposes a systematic approach to compute the optimal rotation angles and scaling factors of the WLAV-T, deriving a robust WLAV estimation approach with optimal transformations (WLAV-OT). The proposed approach has been preliminarily tested with promising results.

Abstract: Utility scale battery storage will soon reach a level of maturity where the modular design of the technology and aggregation will allow custom-built solutions for energy and ancillary service needs of the power system. Several projects are in the demonstration phase worldwide and hold promise for successful incorporation of battery storage into traditional power systems operations. In contrast to thermal generators and pumped hydro stations, there is a strong connection between the short-term operation and life of the battery storage systems. Due to this long-term consequence of short-term decisions for battery technologies, a constant short-term cost model is inadequate. Instead an adaptable short-term cost model is required which reflects the operation of the battery. Such a model of the battery is presented considering battery cycling and depth of discharge. Further, this paper aims to elucidate this relation between short-term and long-term costs of utility scale battery energy storage and presents a mathematical formulation for short-term 24-h scheduling problem in conjunction with thermal generation. The model is illustrated and storage efficacy is examined by scheduling alongside traditional generation with prices typical in Ontario, Canada and battery storage is used to alleviate price spikes caused by ramping requirements.

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of the size and controller settings of an ultracapacitor (UC) on frequency stability. Underfrequency load-shedding (UFLS) schemes play an important role in protecting the system against frequency instability and their performance is used as a measure for the enhancement of frequency stability thanks to the UC. To this end, a simplified but still accurate model of the UC is developed. In addition, a meaningful procedure is proposed to size the UC's power and energy storage capacities in function of the system parameters and operation constraints in order to improve frequency stability. Finally, the impact of the UC on the UFLS scheme is studied for many generation dispatch scenarios and for all possible single generating unit outages of a Spanish isolated power system. An analysis with respect to the UC's control parameters and its size in terms of power and energy storage capacities is carried out, too. Appropriate control parameter settings improve the UC's impact on frequency stability.

Abstract: With the recent development of advanced metering infrastructure, real-time pricing (RTP) scheme is anticipated to be introduced in future retail electricity market. This paper proposes an algorithm for a home energy management scheduler (HEMS) to reduce the cost of energy consumption using RTP. The proposed algorithm works in three subsequent phases namely real-time monitoring (RTM), stochastic scheduling (STS) and real-time control (RTC). In RTM phase, characteristics of available controllable appliances are monitored in real-time and stored in HEMS. In STS phase, HEMS computes an optimal policy using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) to select a set of appliances to be controlled with an objective of the total cost of energy consumption in a house. Finally, in RTC phase, HEMS initiates the control of the selected appliances. The proposed HEMS is unique as it intrinsically considers uncertainties in RTP and power consumption pattern of various appliances. In RTM phase, appliances are categorized according to their characteristics to ease the control process, thereby minimizing the number of control commands issued by HEMS. Simulation results validate the proposed method for HEMS.

Abstract: With the largest installed capacity in the world, wind power in China is experiencing a curtailment during operation. The large portion of the generation capacity from inflexible combined heat and power (CHP) is the major barrier for integrating this variable power source. This paper explores opportunities for increasing the flexibility of CHP units using electrical boilers and heat storage tanks for better integration of wind power. A linear model is proposed for the centralized dispatch for integrated energy systems considering both heat and power, with detailed modeling of the charging processes of the heat storage tanks. The model balances heat and power demands in multiple areas and time periods with various energy sources, including CHP, wind power, electrical boilers, and heat storage. The impact of introducing electrical boilers and heat storage systems is examined using a simple test system with characteristics similar to those of the power systems in Northern China. Our results show that both electrical boilers and heat storage tanks can improve the flexibility of CHP units: introducing electrical boilers is more effective at reducing wind curtailment, whereas heat storage tanks save more energy in the energy system as a whole, which reflect a different heating efficiency of the two solutions.

Abstract: Charging load modeling for electric vehicles (EVs) is a challenge due to its complexity. However, it serves as a foundation for related studies such as the impact assessment of EV charging behaviors on power system and power demand side management for EVs. The decisive factors affecting charging load profile include the power curve, the duration, and the start time of each charging process. This paper introduces the charging traffic flow (CTF) as a discrete sequence to describe charging start events, where CTF contains both spatial and temporal properties of a charging load. A set of equations are proposed to build a probabilistic load model, followed by simulation iteration steps using a flow chart. The parameter identification method based on ant colony (AC) algorithms is then studied in depth, and the pheromone update and the state transition probability are used to implement route finding and city selection, respectively. Finally, an actual case of battery swapping station is applied to verify the proposed model in both identification and simulation. The results show that the model has satisfactory accuracy and applicability.

Abstract: The efficient location identification of multiple line outages is critical to not only cascading failure elimination but also repair cost reduction. Most of existing methods, however, fail to handle location identification well. This failure typically occurs because the methods cannot overcome two challenges: the very limited number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and the high computational complexity. This paper presents an efficient algorithm inspired by the ambiguity group theory to identify the locations of line outages with limited PMUs. Using 14-, 57-, 118-, 300-, and 2383-bus systems, our experimental study demonstrates that the proposed technique successfully identifies the most likely multiple line outages while attaining a 500 speedup when compared to the method of exhaustive search.

Abstract: Natural gas is an important fuel source in the power industry. Electricity and natural gas are both energy that can be directly consumed. To improve the overall efficiency of the energy infrastructure, it is imperative that the expansion of gas power plants, electricity transmission lines and gas pipelines can be co-planned. The co-planning process is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem to handle conflicting objectives simultaneously. We propose a novel model to identify the optimal co-expansion plan in terms of social welfare. To evaluate the robustness of plans under different scenarios, the flexibility criterion is used to identify each plan's adaptation cost to uncertainties, such as demand growth, fuel cost and financial constraints, etc. We developed a systematic and comprehensive planning model to understand, develop and optimize energy grids in order to reach higher social welfare, and is therefore of great importance in terms of supporting and guiding investment decisions for the power and gas industry. Meanwhile, we use the sequential importance sampling (SIS) to perform scenario reduction for achieving a higher computational efficiency. A comprehensive case study on the integrated IEEE 14-bus and a test gas system is conducted to validate our approach.

Abstract: This paper deals with wind power offering strategies in day-ahead markets. A new plan is proposed in which a wind power producer participates in the day-ahead market while employing demand response (DR) to smooth its power variations. In this context, a new DR scheme is presented through which the wind power producer is able to achieve DR by establishing various DR agreements with DR aggregators. The proposed offering plan involves two stages: the first stage clears on the day-ahead market. The wind power producer decides on day-ahead offers as well as DR agreements with the aggregator. The second stage takes place on the balancing market. In a successive approach, the wind power producer determines its energy trading for each period until the whole day is covered. Additionally, proper DR agreements for each period are confirmed here. The proposed plan is formulated in a stochastic programming approach, where its validity is assessed on a case of the Nordic market.

Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative method to determine delay requirements of the information and communication technology (ICT) system supporting wide-area power oscillation damping (WAPOD) controllers. An allowable time delay for the ICT infrastructure named "equivalent time delay (ETD)" is defined. The ETD is calculated by numerically comparing the damping behavior of the system when local input signals (LI) and remote input signals (RI) are used in the damping controller. The use of a WAPOD is only justified when its response outperforms that of a controller using local inputs. Therefore, the total time delay in the control loop must be below the calculated ETD. As such, the ETD serves as a design criteria to determine ICT latency requirements. The selection of an effective RI signal can be carried out by considering the maximum delays (ETDs) of different wide-area measurements. A damping improvement has been proposed using the same methodology indicating a minimum outperformance of the remote signals. The proposed method is demonstrated using the well-known Klein-Rogers-Kundur multi-machine power system and the Vietnamese power system model.

Abstract: Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause half cycle saturation of transformers and consequently affect the power grid with harmonics and reactive power losses. To effectively mitigate the negative GIC impacts in large-scale power systems, the present paper considers the problem of placing blocking devices in transformer neutrals. The placement problem of multiple blocking devices is first considered by analytically quantifying the associated reactive power losses. A linear sensitivity analysis is further provided for the case of blocking a single transformer, and it has been observed that the effects of blocking transformer neutral currents to be mostly local. This motivates us to propose the scheme that selects multiple substations to block all high voltage level transformers therein, based on a linearized approximation model. The effectiveness of such scheme has been demonstrated using both a 20-bus GIC test case and a realistically sized larger power system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new formulation for the corrective security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem with DC power flow constraints. The goal is to produce a generation schedule which has a minimal number of post-contingency corrections as well as a minimal amount of total MW rescheduled. In other words, the new SCOPF model effectively clears contingencies with corrective actions that have a minimal impact on system operations. The proposed SCOPF model utilizes sparse optimization techniques to achieve computational tractability for large-scale power systems. We also propose two efficient decomposition algorithms. Extensive computational experiments show the advantage of the proposed model and algorithms on several standard IEEE test systems and large-scale real-world power systems.

Abstract: Uniform marginal pricing cannot generally support competitive equilibrium solutions in markets with non-convexities, yielding surplus sub-optimality effects. Previous work has identified non-convexities associated with the generation side of electricity markets and proposed different approaches to address surplus sub-optimality. This paper extends this concept to incorporate the demand side. Non-convexities of flexible demand (FD) are identified, including options to forgo demand activities as well as discrete and minimum power levels, and resulting surplus sub-optimality effects are demonstrated through simple examples and a larger case study. Generalized uplift and convex hull pricing approaches addressing these effects are extended to account for FD non-convexities. Concerning the former, generalized uplift functions for FD participants are proposed, and a new rule is introduced for equitable distribution of the total surplus loss compensation among market participants. Regarding the latter, it is demonstrated that convex hull prices are flattened at periods when FD is scheduled to eliminate surplus sub-optimality associated with the FD ability to redistribute energy requirements across time.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint scheduling problem of large-scale smart appliances and batteries (e.g., in a smart building), to minimize electricity payment, user's dissatisfaction and battery loss under kinds of constraints. Due to the binary nature of charge and discharge states of battery, this problem is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. In order to solve it efficiently, a distributed mixed optimization approach is proposed. First, Lagrangian relaxation is applied to decompose the original problem into two sets of subproblems, each of which corresponds to scheduling on appliance/battery. Then, the battery scheduling subproblem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and tackled by Benders decomposition. The main advantages of the proposed approach are the distributed implementation and low computational complexity, as shown by simulations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for the probabilistic risk assessment of rotor angle instability in power systems using fuzzy inference systems (FISs). The novel two-step approach first models the stochastic uncertainties present within the power system to produced probability density functions (pdfs) for stability indicators. These stability indicators are established for both small and large disturbance rotor angle stability analysis. The pdfs produced are subsequently decomposed into regions based on user-specified threshold values. The outputs from this decomposition are analyzed using fuzzy techniques to complete the risk assessment of instability. The methodology is applied to a multi-area test network into which a VSC-MTDC grid has been embedded to support power transfer from a number of large wind farms. This new combination of probabilistic and fuzzy techniques is shown to provide an effective methodology for quantifying the influence of system uncertainties on the risks of rotor angle stability.

Abstract: This paper proposes some methods for the purpose of reactive power and voltage control. Real cases show them as potentially harmful for power systems, since dynamic instability and voltage collapse may appear. Control actions like tap changers, active and reactive power redispatch may help the system voltage stability, but may present reverse results for some operating conditions. This paper is firstly devoted to identify and classify an operating point under the voltage stability point of view. Following this classification, an index to assess the robustness of a bus is proposed. The studies are carried out with the help of the QV curves. Methods to change the region of operation of a bus are then discussed with the help of a real Brazilian system with all limits considered.

Abstract: An on-going debate in the energy economics and power market community raises the question if energy-only power markets are increasingly failing due to growing feed-in shares from subsidized renewable energy sources (RES); the argument being essentially that the merit-order effect of RES production depresses day-ahead spot market prices, which in turn creates a situation where power plant owners cannot recover investment costs (missing-money problem). We argue in short that energy-only power markets are not failing in principle but are rather facing several market distortions that hinder proper market functioning, namely 1) the gap between the electricity volume actually traded at day-ahead spot markets versus the overall electricity consumption, and 2) the regulatory assumption that variable RES generation, i.e., wind and photovoltaic (PV), truly has zero marginal operation and grid integration costs. In this paper, we show that both effects over-amplify the well-known merit-order effect of RES power feed-in, and indirectly also the missing-money problem beyond a level that is explainable by underlying physical realities. We empirically analyze the impacts of wind and PV power feed-in on the day-ahead market for the EPEX German-Austrian market zone, a region that is already today experiencing significant feed-in tariff (FIT)-subsidized RES power feed-in (ca. 20% FIT share). Our analysis shows that, if necessary regulatory adaptations are taken, i.e., increasing the spot market's share of overall load demand and using the true marginal costs of RES units in the merit-order, energy-based power markets remain functional despite high RES power feed-in.

Abstract: The paper presents a methodology for estimation of dynamic response of aggregate load at distribution network buses by taking into account daily variation in demand composition and generic dynamic responses of different types of load. Dynamic load models for different load categories obtained from field or laboratory measurements or through appropriate mathematical modeling are used in combination with hourly load composition at the given bus. The load composition is derived based on past demand surveys, and daily loading curves for different classes of customers. Uncertainties in both dynamic load models/responses of individual loads and load compositions at different times of the day are modeled probabilistically. With established dynamic signatures of different load categories and load compositions at different times of the day, Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate probabilistic real and reactive power responses, including ranges of variation of these responses, for every hour of the day for a given or anticipated mix of demand.

Abstract: The problem of optimally sizing hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) installed in electric railway systems, considering the effect of regenerative braking is studied in this paper. HESSs combine traditional batteries and newly developed ultracapacitors, taking advantage of the high energy capacity of batteries and of the flexibility and ability to capture high power density of ultracapacitors. A novel mixed integer linear programming formulation that includes the counting of battery cycles is presented. Some particularities of battery operation are included in the model, like the dependence of its performance on the number of cycles and the depth of discharge (DOD). Results are reported first for a illustrative case study, allowing us to perform sensitivity studies for several parameters; results are also reported and for a larger case, closely resembling the problem faced by railway energy systems planners and operators.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel profit-based model for multistage distribution network expansion planning. In the proposed model, some capabilities of the distribution automation system are considered to achieve a plan that is more compatible with the strategic plan towards a smart distribution grid. Moreover, a method for reliability evaluation of a distribution network in the planning studies is proposed. The objective function of the planning problem is the net present value of the company's profit. The problem is solved by employing the genetic algorithm approach as a promising technique in solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The proposed method is evaluated on an illustrative test network and the obtained results are presented and discussed.

Abstract: This paper investigates a special class of dynamic power system problem, namely subsynchronous resonance (SSR) resulted from a series-compensated network connecting doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms. A novel two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) control strategy combined with a damping control loop is designed and analyzed for enhancing the system stability and alleviates the SSR that may arise due to the induction generator effect (IGE). The proposed control strategy is tested at different operating conditions of series compensation levels and low wind speeds to ensure the system stability. The doubly-fed induction generator based wind farms without the proposed control strategy leads to overall system instability during high series compensation and low wind speeds. Hence, the mitigation of the SSR and damping enhancement are critical to the entire power system stability. A reliable way of analyzing the system and designing effective control strategies against SSR based on the eigenvalue analysis and impedance based stability criterion is deployed. Moreover, analytical explanations have been elaborated to verify the procedure of the controller design. Fault ride-though capability has also been investigated with the proposed control strategy that is flexible to be integrated with the FRT schemes so as to assist the wind farm in mitigating the SSR during the fault recovery stage. Finally, time domain simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for mitigating the SSR and damping power system oscillations.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are a promising alternative to conventional fuel-based automobiles. However, a large number of PEVs connected to the grid simultaneously with poor charging coordination may impose severe stress on the power system. To allocate the available charging power, this paper proposes an optimal charging rate control of PEVs based on consensus algorithm, which aligns each PEV's interest with the system's benefit. The proposed strategy is implemented based on a multi-agent system framework, which only requires information exchanges among neighboring agents. The proposed distributed control solution enables the sharing of computational and communication burden among distributed agents, thus it is robust, scalable, and convenient for plug-and-play operation which allows PEVs to join and leave at arbitrary times. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulations.

Abstract: Currently, demand response resources can sell load reductions in wholesale energy markets. However, paying for load reductions ultimately results in an unbalanced market, where the amount of resources sold (megawatts) is less than the amount of resources bought (megawatts and "negawatts"). To resolve this imbalance, the ISO must allocate the cost of compensating demand response to those buyers who benefit from reduced LMPs. Current cost allocation methods are quite broad and based on each energy buyer's share of the total load. In an uncongested network, this results in a "fair" allocation of costs, i.e., an allocation proportional to the benefits that each party accrues. However, in a congested network, this is no longer the case, as price separation occurs between nodes. In this paper, we therefore propose a cost allocation method based on LMP sensitivity that accounts for the effect of congestion on the distribution of benefits between nodes with different LMPs. Since this sensitivity-based method only takes into account the cost allocation per node, we also propose a means of allocating costs between individual load serving entities (LSEs) at a single node. Due to this refinement, LSEs are rewarded according to their individual contribution to demand response. Finally, we define a fairness index to evaluate the performance of the proposed method as compared to a load-based allocation. We find that when load reductions are small (1%-3% total load), the fairness index of the proposed method is very close to zero, indicating almost identical benefit to cost ratios for all market participants. Although the fairness index increases with increasing load reductions, results show that even for larger load reductions, the fairness index is still lower for the proposed method than for the load-based allocation method.

Abstract: Adoption of dispersed renewable energy technologies requires transmission network expansion. Besides the transmission system operator (TSO), restructuring of electricity industries has introduced a merchant investor (MI), who earns congestion rents from constructing new lines. We compare these two market designs via a stochastic bi-level programming model that has either the MI or the TSO making transmission investment decisions at the upper level and power producers determining generation investment and operation at the lower level while facing wind power variability. We find that social welfare is always higher under the TSO because the MI has incentive to boost congestion rents by restricting capacities of transmission lines. Such strategic behavior also limits investment in wind power by producers. However, regardless of the market design (MI or TSO), when producers behave a la Cournot, a higher proportion of energy is produced by wind. In effect, withholding of generation capacity by producers prompts more transmission investment since the TSO aims to increase welfare by subsidizing wind and the MI creates more flow to maximize profit.

Abstract: Load modeling is essential for designing and operating power systems. This paper presents an approach for load modeling on smaller power systems that could be "islanded," an approach that preserves the detail of a full differential equation simulation of relevant loads while requiring far less computation by employing behavioral models of important loads. Mixed domain models, e.g., stochastic, finite-state machine, and differential equation models, are employed to provide accuracy in a computationally tractable framework. Where simple load models may not be adequate, particularly for generation-constrained systems (in a paper by Sotiropoulos et al.), and full models are computationally unfavorable, this approach provides excellent results that enable "what-if" studies and flexible re-evaluation during power system design and operational assessment. Naval vessels, particularly warships with relatively large and increasing load power requirements, offer a unique laboratory for understanding isolated power grids. This paper examines the DDG-51 power distribution system as an example.

Abstract: The outage of transmission lines, especially of multiple lines, could cause power network islanding. Traditional line outage distribution factors cannot be directly used for the power flow calculation under network islanding. This letter proposes a direct and fast two-phase method for calculating shift factors under network islanding by leveraging existing shift factors of base case (pre-contingency) network.

A parameterized KKT condition is introduced to characterize the Pareto front. Then Nash's bargain criterion is employed to determine a compromise solution on the Pareto front. The proposed method is applied to the EED of a regional power grid in China. Numerical studies demonstrate that it is valid and promising.

Abstract: The penetration level of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has the potential to be notably increased in the near future, and as a consequence, power systems face new challenges and opportunities. In particular, PEVs are able to provide different types of power system ancillary services. The capability of storing energy and the instantaneous active power control of the fast-switching converters of PEVs are two attractive features that enable PEVs to provide various ancillary services, e.g., primary frequency control (PFC). However, concurrently, PEVs are obliged to be operated and controlled within limits, which curbs the grid support from PEVs. This paper proposes a new model for PEV using a participation factor, which facilitates the incorporation of several PEV fleets characteristics such as minimum desired state of charge (SOC) of the PEV owners, drive train power limitations, constant current and constant voltage charging modes of PEVs. In order to reduce computational complexity, an aggregate model of PEVs is provided using statistical data. In the end, the performance of PEVs for the provision of PFC is evaluated in a power system. Results show that PEV fleets can successfully improve frequency response, once all the operating constraints are respected.

Abstract: We present a parallel implementation of Lagrangian relaxation for solving stochastic unit commitment subject to uncertainty in renewable power supply and generator and transmission line failures. We describe a scenario selection algorithm inspired by importance sampling in order to formulate the stochastic unit commitment problem and validate its performance by comparing it to a stochastic formulation with a very large number of scenarios, that we are able to solve through parallelization. We examine the impact of narrowing the duality gap on the performance of stochastic unit commitment and compare it to the impact of increasing the number of scenarios in the model. We report results on the running time of the model and discuss the applicability of the method in an operational setting.

Abstract: Integration of wind power generation (WPG) is increasing rapidly worldwide. The variability and uncertainty of wind energy may lead to significant load-generation imbalances resulting in large frequency deviations, hence increasing system operational risks, especially in small and isolated power systems with low inertia and limited capabilities of providing frequency responses. This raises the need for investigating alternatives to current power system operation planning approaches to cope with the uncertain nature of the intermittent generation. This paper presents a risk assessment approach to analyze power system security for operation planning under high penetration of wind power generation. The proposed approach deals with not only steady-state voltage and overload evaluations, but also frequency response adequacy. For fast identification of operational limit violations in the proposed risk assessment method, we develop an analytical procedure for approximating frequency response and assessing the consequences of limit violations without performing dynamic simulations. As a result, the frequency response adequacy assessment can be run simultaneously with the steady-state voltage and overload evaluations. The proposed risk assessment approach is illustrated via its application to a model of a power system with high wind power penetration.

Abstract: Static reserve policies are used within security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) to ensure reliability. A common policy is that 10-min reserve must exceed the largest contingency. However, this condition does not guarantee reliability because voltage and thermal limits can hinder reserve deliverability. Many operators use zonal reserve markets to ensure reserves are dispersed across the grid. Such zonal models attempt to anticipate transmission bottlenecks, which is a difficult task when the future system state is uncertain. This paper examines the market implications of dynamic reserve policies used to mitigate uncertainty from renewable resources and contingencies. We study the market implications of policies recently proposed in the literature, such as hourly zones within day-ahead SCUC and an algorithm that formally disqualifies reserves that are expected to be undeliverable. A locational reserve pricing scheme is also proposed in connection with scenario-based reserve disqualification. Analysis on the RTS-96 test case shows that dynamic zones and reserve disqualification, along with the proposed compensation scheme, help direct reserve payments toward resources that more effectively respond to contingencies.

Abstract: All-electric ship power systems include less generation capacity and smaller rotating inertia compared with large power systems. The systems include large portions of nonlinear loads and dynamic loads, which may reduce the stability margin. Moreover, various operational constraints, such as system frequency constraint, motor voltage constraint and dynamic cable constraint, need to be satisfied in operational real time. Further, pulse loads draw very high short-time power in an intermittent way, which may significantly deteriorate the power quality of the system. In this paper, a novel multi-agent system cooperative controller for a medium voltage AC (MVAC) system of all-electric ship power systems is developed to balance load and generation in real time while satisfying system's operational constraints and considering load priorities. The new method coordinates the pulse load and the propulsion load to reduce the impact of pulse load changes on the power quality of all-electric ship power systems. The dynamic behavior of the new method is evaluated using case studies in PSCAD software.

Abstract: As intermittent energy resources become more significant in power production, traditional capacity planning may be insufficient to ensure reliable system operation. A system planner must ensure that flexibility solutions are available to respond to large and uncertain ramping events. These solutions may be operational, such as improved unit commitment and dispatch, curtailment of renewables, or demand response; procurement based, such as new fast ramping resources or batteries; or involve market reform. This paper outlines a new methodology for modeling the economic tradeoffs in implementing flexibility solutions for integrating renewables. The proposed model includes both a stochastic treatment of system states to account for a wide range of operating conditions and an adapted production simulation methodology that weighs the cost of reliability and subhourly flexibility violations against the cost of the operational flexibility solutions available to mitigate them. The model's functionality is demonstrated with a case study of California at a 50% RPS in 2030. The model tests the value of 1088 MW of generic flexible units, relative to the same capacity of must-run resources, finding an expected annual value of $347 +/- 42 million/yr. Potential applications of the model for resource planning and procurement are also discussed.

Abstract: This paper proposes a graphic modeling approach, fault diagnosis method based on fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FDSNP), for power transmission networks. In FDSNP, fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems) with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to model candidate faulty sections and an algebraic fuzzy reasoning algorithm is introduced to obtain confidence levels of candidate faulty sections, so as to identify faulty sections. FDSNP offers an intuitive illustration based on a strictly mathematical expression, a good fault-tolerant capacity due to its handling of incomplete and uncertain messages in a parallel manner, a good description for the relationships between protective devices and faults, and an understandable diagnosis model-building process. To test the validity and feasibility of FDSNP, seven cases of a local subsystem in an electrical power system are used. The results of case studies show that FDSNP is effective in diagnosing faults in power transmission networks for single and multiple fault situations with/without incomplete and uncertain SCADA data, and is superior to four methods, reported in the literature, in terms of the correctness of diagnosis results.

Abstract: Power router technology is maturing to the point of becoming a cost-effective enabler of increased transmission asset utilization. Power routers can enable a desirable increase in control of power systems, especially as infrastructure ages and degrades. This paper presents a formal extension to the traditional security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) algorithm, named flexible security-constrained optimal power flow (FSCOPF), which utilizes power router control in the post-contingency timeframe. The operational improvement is enabled by the fast-response capability of FACTS-based power routers to change setpoints in response to power system contingencies. The FSCOPF algorithm, developed in this paper, allows for power routers to be used as a real-time dispatchable resource. We show that further power system savings are achieved when compared to the traditional SCOPF.

Abstract: With an increasing penetration of wind power, there is likely to be an increasing need for fast-ramping generating units. These generators ensure that no load is lost if supply drops due to the uncertainties in wind power generation. However, it is observed in practice that, in a presence of network constraints, fast-ramping generating units are prone to act strategically and exercise market power by withholding their ramp rates. In this paper we model this gaming behavior on ramp rates. We assume a market operator who collects bids in form of marginal costs, quantities, and ramp rates. He runs a ramp-constrained economic dispatch given the generators' bids, forecasted demand, and contingencies. Following the game-theoretic concepts, we set up a multi-level optimization problem. The lower-level problem is the ramp-constrained economic dispatch and the higher-level represents the profit maximization problems solved by strategic generators. The whole problem is formulated as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). The outcome of the EPEC problem is a set of Nash equilibria. To tackle the multiple Nash equilibria problem, the concept of the extremal-Nash equilibria is defined and formulated. We model the concept of extremal-Nash equilibria as a single-stage mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) and demonstrate the application of this mathematical framework on an illustrative case and on a more realistic case study with tractable results.

Abstract: Copper losses in low voltage distribution circuits are a significant proportion of total energy losses and contribute to higher customer costs and carbon emissions. These losses can be evaluated using network models with customer demand data. This paper considers the under-estimation of copper losses when the spiky characteristics of real customer demands are smoothed by arithmetic mean averaging. This is investigated through simulation and by analysis of measured data. The mean losses in cables and equipment supplying a single dwelling estimated from half-hourly data were found to have significant errors of 40%, compared to calculations using high resolution data. Similar errors were found in estimates of peak thermal loading over a half-hour period, with significant variation between results for each customer. The errors reduce as the demand is aggregated, with mean losses for a group of 22 dwellings under-estimated by 7% using half-hourly data. This paper investigates the relationship between the demand data time resolution and errors in the estimated losses. Recommendations are then provided for the time resolution to be used in future measurements and simulation studies. A linear extrapolation technique is also presented whereby errors due to the use of averaged demand data can be reduced.

Abstract: Integrating wind power into power systems contributes to existing variability in system operations. Current methods to mitigate this variability and uncertainty focus on using conventional generator ramping capability. There is also the option of using wind power itself to mitigate the variability and uncertainty that it introduces into the system. This paper introduces the concept of a flexible dispatch margin as a means for wind to participate in mitigating net variability and net uncertainty. In providing a flexible dispatch margin, wind generators under-schedule in the hour-ahead energy market in order to have additional expected flexibility available for the real-time market. The implementation of the flexible dispatch margin is analyzed in a two-stage optimization model with recourse to the flexible dispatch margin, flexible demand and generator ramping. This modeling framework combines Monte Carlo simulations with AC OPF analysis, using the IEEE 39-bus test system. Results show that use of the flexible dispatch margin decreases the reliance on peaking generators to mitigate net variability and uncertainty, and also decreases the frequency of price spike events, particularly as wind penetration increases from 10% to 30%. The analysis emphasizes the importance of increasing flexible resource capability as power system variability and uncertainty increase.

Abstract: The cycling regime of thermal power plants significantly increases in the presence of intermittent renewables, increasing fuel and operation and maintenance costs from startups. Some regional electricity market operators adopt complex bidding mechanisms to account for nonconvex cost components that are not reflected in the marginal cost of energy, while other markets rely solely on simple bids with revenue sufficiency conditions. This paper compares the impacts of different bidding rules on wholesale prices and on the remuneration of units in power systems with a significant share of renewable generation. We distinguish the effects of bidding rules from the effects of regulatory uncertainty that can unexpectedly increase renewable generation by considering two distinct situations: 1) an "adapted" capacity mix, which is optimized for any given amount of renewable penetration, and 2) a "nonadapted" capacity mix, which is optimized for zero renewable penetration, but operated with different nonzero levels of renewables. We show that, although in the transitory state the impact on remuneration of having a nonadapted system dominates over the effect of the startup remuneration mechanisms explored, in equilibrium, bidding rules play an important role in making power plants whole while impacting on the cost borne by consumers.

Abstract: The variable and uncertain nature of the leading renewable energy resources, such as wind power generation, imposes the development of a sophisticated balance mechanism between supply and demand to maintain the consistency of a power system. In this study, a two stage stochastic programming model is proposed to procure the required load-following reserves from both generation and demand side resources under high wind power penetration. Besides, a novel load model is introduced to procure flexible reserves from industrial clients. Load following reserves from load serving entities (LSE) are also taken into account as well as network constraints, load shedding and wind spillage. The proposed methodology is applied to an illustrative test system, as well as to a 24-node system.

Abstract: Traditional security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) considers only static security criteria, which may however not ensure the ability of the system to survive dynamic transition before reaching a viable operating equilibrium following a large disturbance, such as transient stability. This paper proposes a tractable mathematical model for transient stability-constrained unit commitment (TSCUC) and a practical solution approach. The problem is modeled without explicit differential-algebraic equations, reducing the problem size to one very similar to a conventional SCUC. The whole problem is decomposed into a master problem for UC and a range of subproblems for steady-state security evaluation and transient stability assessment (TSA). Additional constraints including Benders cut and so-named stabilization cut are generated for eliminating the security/stability violations. The extended equal-area criterion (EEAC) is used for fast TSA and analytically deriving the stabilization cut, wherein multiple contingencies having common instability mode can be simultaneously stabilized by one cut. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the New England 10-machine system and the IEEE 50-machine system, reporting very high computational efficiency and high-quality solutions.

Abstract: The paper proposes a scalable and tractable algorithm for dynamic topology optimization of power systems involving changes in branch on/off status, while respecting small-signal stability (SSS) constraints. A procedure for fast updates of the system matrices (in descriptor form) and without additional full matrix inversions is proposed. To additionally reduce the computation time, only critical eigenvalues (right-most or those in a specified damping ratio and frequency range) are calculated. A quadratic optimization approach is proposed for optimized generation re-dispatch to satisfy SSS constraints. The approach is applied to two (medium- and large-scale) real-world test power systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the formulation and solution of an optimal energy storage management problem under risk consideration and transaction costs of trading energy with the power grid. The price evolves as a stochastic process, capable of correctly explaining the seasonality effects as well as the tail fatness and spikiness in its distribution. Transaction costs capture the price impact of the storage operation on the electricity spot price. A risk analysis of an optimal risk neutral deterministic policy as well as the simple myopic policy indicates that the realized operational cost may notably differ from the expected cost by a considerable probability. This difference suggests that we need to consider risk. Using the downside risk measure of conditional value-at-risk, an optimal risk averse conversion and transmission strategy, among the grid, the renewable power generation source, and an energy storage is proposed to fully satisfy the electricity demand and minimize the expected operational cost as well as the risk. Our numerical study using data from NYISO demonstrates the impacts of risk consideration and the transaction cost parameters on the optimal strategy structure, its expected cost, and its risk.

Abstract: Unsatisfiable transmission constraints (UTCs) may lead to failures in look-ahead dispatch. Hence, the detection of UTCs is a critical issue in power systems, and it may also aid in the discovery of unavailable transmission resources in online look-ahead dispatch. The Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm is a rapid and efficient approach to solving look-ahead dispatch (LD) problems; however, it does not readily handle infeasible problems. Here, we describe criteria and procedures for detecting infeasible LD and for locating and addressing UTCs via an LR framework. The proposed procedures for detecting infeasibility and locating unsatisfiability are incorporated into a conventional LR framework to develop an enhanced LR solution framework without affecting the original computational efficiency. Numerical simulations are carried out using an IEEE 24-bus system, 31-bus system, and several large-scale power systems; the results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the methods.

Abstract: Due to the significant variability and uncertainty of wind power over short time scales, high penetration of wind power can be problematic in an electric grid. One of the critical issues is how to keep increasing wind penetration without jeopardizing grid security and reliability. This paper explores the possibility of changing transmission network topology, by transmission switching, to accommodate higher utilization of wind power and reduce the generation costs of thermal units. Considering the uncertainty in wind power output, we use chance constraints to ensure that the wind energy utilized exceeds a minimal usage level at a certain probability. We develop a deterministic approximation approach using sample average approximation and provide a strong extended formulation. Numerical results show the potential benefit the proposed model can achieve.

Abstract: We address the optimal energy storage management and sizing problem in the presence of renewable energy and dynamic pricing associated with electricity from the grid. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program that aims to minimize the long-run average cost of electricity used and investment in storage, if any, while satisfying all the demand. We model storage with ramp constraints, conversion losses, dissipation losses and an investment cost. We prove the existence of an optimal storage management policy under mild assumptions and show that it has a dual threshold structure. Under this policy, we derive structural results, which indicate that the marginal value from storage decreases with its size and that the optimal storage size can be computed efficiently. We prove a rather surprising result, as we characterize the maximum value of storage under constant prices and i.i.d. net-demand processes: if the storage is a profitable investment, then the ratio of the amortized cost of storage to the constant price is less than 1/4. We further perform sensitivity analysis on the size of optimal storage and its gain via a case study. Finally, with a computational study on real data, we demonstrate significant savings with energy storage.

Abstract: Inertial response from remote offshore wind farms (WFs) connected through point-to-point DC links relies on emulation of the onshore AC system frequency variation at each offshore wind turbine generator (WTG). This is not straightforward for a DC grid interconnecting WFs to multiple onshore AC systems. To address this problem, this paper builds up on a communication-less approach previously reported for provision of frequency services from offshore WFs connected through a DC grid. A weighted frequency scheme is adopted which relies on the fiber optic link embedded within the sub-sea cables for fast communication of onshore frequency variations up to the offshore converters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown analytically and also through a case study on a 4-terminal DC grid interconnecting an offshore wind farm and two onshore AC systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the first reliable Newton algorithm for the sequential computation of the set of dominant poles of scalar and multivariable transfer functions of infinite systems. This dominant pole algorithm incorporates a deflation procedure, which is derived from the partial fraction expansion concept of analytical functions of the complex frequency s and prevents the repeated convergence to previously found poles. The pole residues (scalars or matrices), which are needed in this expansion, are accurately computed by a Legendre-Gauss integral solver scheme for both scalar and multivariable systems. This algorithm is effectively applied to the modal model reduction of multivariable transfer functions for two test systems of considerable complexity and containing many distributed parameter transmission lines.

Abstract: The paper presents a unified control framework which allows the responsive end-user devices (REDs) such as inverter-based photovoltaic systems (PVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and domestic controllable loads at residential level to effectively participate in the voltage and frequency control of the smart grid. The presented control framework basically relies on extracting information from active and reactive power sensitivities at different buses. In this framework, for voltage control, two support groups namely the active support group and the reactive support group are dedicated to each transmission bus. However, for frequency control, only one active support group is defined for the entire system. The REDs used for voltage and frequency control are classified based on their controllability degree. The idea of selecting the most effective buses is also presented to minimize the burden of communication commands. Following the detection of voltage or frequency violation in the system, the targeted buses are identified and receive corrective control signals to accordingly change their active and/or reactive powers. To minimize the manipulated active and reactive powers, the whole process is formulated as a multiobjective problem solved by the particle swarm optimization. The control procedure involves a series of commands for which the incident command system is used as a secure communication structure.

Abstract: This letter presents a constraint relaxation optimal power flow (OPF) model to tackle the issues when traditional OPF is infeasible under large variations such as wind generation output. In this model, the original hard constraints are relaxed into soft constraints and the objective function is adjusted for the cost of constraint violations. To guarantee the equivalence to the original OPF model when there are feasible solutions, an exact penalty function method is introduced to justify the selection of penalty factor of constraint violations. By solving an optimization problem, the lower bound of the proper penalty factor is obtained. The results of a 6-bus test system show that the proposed method achieves the same solution when the original OPF has feasible region, and an optimal solution can be obtained with minimum constraint violation when original OPF has no feasible region. Lastly, three large IEEE systems are tested to verify the effectiveness of proposed method.

Abstract: Time varying prices by motivating customers to reduce their consumption in peak periods propel the electricity industry towards a higher efficiency compared to that of common flat prices. Focusing on time-of-use (TOU) sale prices, this paper establishes a stochastic model for the medium-term decision making problem faced by a distribution company (DisCo). The developed model deals with the DisCo's decisions on the level of involvement in forward contracts and in the pool as well as the sale prices offered to customers. The demand response to TOU prices is captured using a price elasticity matrix (PEM). The objective is to maximize the DisCo's profit while the exposure risk imposed by uncertainties is limited to a given level. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem that can be effectively solved via commercial software packages. A typical Finnish 20-kV urban distribution network is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model.

Abstract: This paper is concerned about effective incorporation of a limited number of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements into the state estimation solution in order to enhance the state tracking accuracy and speed. This is particularly important for fast changing system conditions when rapid control action may be necessary based on the onset of voltage instability due to an unexpected event. Under such conditions, SCADA-based state estimators may be too slow in capturing the changes in system state due to the low scan rates of the order of seconds. PMU measurements on the other hand provide refresh rates of milliseconds; however, they may not provide full system observability. In this work, a solution is proposed in order to address the lack of observability by the PMU measurements while maintaining fast tracking capability as well as estimation robustness against pseudo-measurement and PMU errors. Robustness is accomplished via the use of the so-called least absolute value estimator which minimizes L-1 norm of the residuals. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the expected benefits of this implementation on test systems.

Abstract: A phasor measurement unit (PMU) only state estimator is intrinsically superior to its SCADA analogue with respect to speed, performance, and reliability. However, ensuring the quality of the data stream which enters the linear estimator is crucial before establishing it as the front end of an EMS or other network applications. One approach is to pre-process the phasor data before it arrives at the linear estimator. This paper presents an algorithm for synchrophasor data conditioning and repair that fits neatly as a prefix into the existing linear state estimation formulation. The methodology has been tested using field data obtained from PMUs installed in Dominion Virginia Power's (DVP's) EHV network. The results indicate that the proposed technique provides a computationally simple, elegant solution to the synchrophasor data quality problem.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-purpose VAr control strategy for solar PV inverters for voltage support in distribution networks. The proposed strategy can be applied under various PV power generation conditions. The inverters will normally operate in a dynamic VAr compensation mode for voltage support (including low PV and no PV periods). During mid-day when PV has surplus power, the proposed strategy will control the PV inverters to absorb VAr for voltage rise mitigation using a droop characteristic approach. During passing clouds, the strategy will mitigate voltage fluctuations by ramp-rate control of inverter VAr output. A dynamic model of the proposed PV inverter control has been developed to analyze its performance in terms of fast VAr control and voltage support under various PV generation conditions. The results of the analysis performed on an Australian distribution system show that the proposed VAr control strategy can mitigate voltage rise, and improve the voltage profile despite potential vast changes in the sun irradiation during passing cloud and also in the absence of PV output during the evening.

Abstract: Aggregation of diverse wind power sources can effectively reduce their uncertainty, and hence the cost of wind energy integration. A risky power contract is proposed, by which wind power producers (WPPs) can trade uncertain future power for efficient wind aggregation. A two-settlement market with both the risky power contract and a conventional firm power contract is shown to have a unique competitive equilibrium (CE), characterized in closed form. The marginal contribution and diversity contribution of each WPP to the group of all WPPs are fairly reflected in the profit earned by this WPP at the CE. Moreover, the CE achieves the same total profit as achieved by a grand coalition of WPPs. In a coalitional game setting, the profit allocation induced by the CE is always in the core, and is achieved via a non-cooperative risky power market. The benefits of the risky power market are demonstrated using wind generation and locational marginal price data for ten WPPs in the PJM interconnection.

Abstract: We report on the extension of a general stochastic simulation approach for power systems with integrated renewable resources to also incorporate the representation of utility-scale storage resources. The extended approach deploys models of the energy storage resources to emulate their scheduling and operations in the transmission-constrained hourly day-ahead markets. To this end, we formulate a scheduling optimization problem to determine the operational schedule of the controllable storage resources in coordination with the demands and the various supply resources, including the conventional and renewable resources. The incorporation of the scheduling optimization problem into the Monte Carlo simulation framework takes full advantage of the structural characteristics in the construction of the so-called sample paths for the stochastic simulation approach and to ensure its numerical tractability. The extended methodology has the capability to quantify the power system economics, emissions and reliability variable effects over longer-term periods for power systems with the storage resources. Applications of the approach include planning and investment studies and the formulation and analysis of policy. We illustrate the capabilities and effectiveness of the simulation approach on representative study cases on modified IEEE 118 and WECC 240-bus systems. These results provide valuable insights into the impacts of energy storage resources on the performance of power systems with integrated wind resources.

Abstract: Fossil fuel generation companies (GenCos) trade in multiple uncertain energy markets: fuel and carbon markets on upstream side while electricity market on downstream side. Global economic and environmental benefits lead these markets to pursue overlapping goals, making them highly interactive. GenCos may identify optimal trading strategies for upstream and downstream trading in an integrated framework, to manage an overall secure and profitable position. Further, severe unpredictability of energy market prices may necessitate a GenCo to make trading plans which perform better meeting its goals. Under severe uncertainty of involved markets, this paper proposes Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) based approach to select three interrelated trading portfolios, in an integrated framework. Results from a realistic case study provide a comprehensive decision insight to address risk-averse and risk-seeking behavior of GenCo, explicitly highlighting importance of co-variation in prices of interactive markets.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a mathematical model of the multi-objective reactive power optimization (MORPO) problem in an ac-dc hybrid power system. To get an evenly distributed set of Pareto solutions of this MORPO problem throughout a whole day, we propose a piecewise normalized normal constraint (PNNC) method. Based on this method, the Pareto frontier is divided into four arcs so that the fluctuation of angle between the tangent line at each Pareto point and its sub-Utopia line is reduced. By doing so, the original MORPO problem is transformed into four sets of single objective optimization problems, which can be solved efficiently by a nonlinear primal-dual interior-point method. Performance of the PNNC method is tested on a real ac-dc interconnection system. The results demonstrate that it has the capability to generate a more evenly distributed set of Pareto solutions when compared with the normalized normal constraint (NNC) and weighted sum (WS) methods. In addition, a fuzzy-based membership value assignment method is employed to derive 96 optimal compromise solutions corresponding to 96 time periods in a whole day; the numerical outcomes show that a saving in active power loss and an improvement in the voltage profile can be gained simultaneously.

Abstract: In this paper we propose approximate bisimulation relations and functions for reduction of power system dynamic models in differential- algebraic (descriptor) form. The full-size dynamic model is obtained by linearization of the nonlinear transient stability model. We generalize theoretical results on approximate bisimulation relations and bisimulation functions, originally derived for a class of constrained linear systems, to linear systems in descriptor form. An algorithm for transient stability assessment is proposed and used to determine whether the power system is able to maintain the synchronism after a large disturbance. Two benchmark power systems are used to illustrate the proposed algorithm and to evaluate the applicability of approximate bisimulation relations and bisimulation functions for reduction of the power system dynamic models.

Abstract: Decentralized demand control can help to ensure the balance between electricity demand and supply. In this paper, a multi-agent demand control system is proposed where residential demand is controlled to provide spinning reserves. With the proposed control framework, an aggregator of dynamic demand is able to control the consumption and the response on frequency changes of a cluster of loads. The primary frequency support by the cluster of loads can emulate the primary control of a conventional generator. The total customer welfare remains maximal during the frequency support by applying utility functions for each device.

Abstract: A novel integrated scheme based on relationships exploration (RE) is presented for the online estimation of the relative voltage stability margin (VSM). The proposed scheme can select the optimal variables as input features for estimation by detecting the relationship between each operation variable and the relative VSM in a large data set. Each relationship is given scores by the maximal information coefficient (MIC) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). The variables selected for estimation are corresponding to the relationships highly ranked by MIC and PCC, including linear relationships and nonlinear functional ones. Some of the highly ranked relationships are shown, curve fitted and described from the perspective of power system operation. If the data of the selected variables are obtained online from the wide area measurement system (WAMS), the relative VSM can be online estimated based on the explored relationships. The integrated scheme using RE-based process is examined on a 21-bus test system and a practical 1648-bus system provided by the software PSS/E, and it presents acceptable estimation accuracy. The impacts of training set size, selected relationships' types, total number and ranks on estimation accuracy are analyzed. The robustness of the scheme to measurement errors and topology variation is studied.

Abstract: Economic transmission switching has been proposed as a new control paradigm to improve the economics of electric power systems. In practice, the transmission switching operation itself is a disruptive action to the system. Frequently switching lines into or out of service can create undesirable effects on the security and reliability of power systems and may require new investments in the automation and control systems. In this paper, we formulate an economic seasonal transmission switching model where transmission switching occurs once at the beginning of a time period (season) and then the transmission topology remains unchanged during that period. The proposed seasonal transmission switching model is a large-scale mixed integer programming problem. The objective of the optimization model is to minimize the total energy generation cost over the season subject to loads and N-1 reliability requirements. We develop a novel decomposition method that decomposes the seasonal problem into one-hour problems which are then solved efficiently. We demonstrate our model and the decomposition approach on the 14-bus, 39-bus, and 118-bus power systems and show potential cost savings in each case.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generalized approach of the per unit normalization, named complex per unit normalization (cpu), to improve the performance of fast decoupled power flow methods applied to emerging distribution networks. The proposed approach takes into account the changes envisaged and also already faced by distribution systems, such as high penetration of generation sources and more interconnection between feeders, while considering the typical characteristics of distribution systems, as the high R/X ratios. These characteristics impose difficulties on the performance of both backward-forward sweep and decoupled-based power flow methods. The cpu concept is centred on the use of a complex volt-ampere base, which overcomes the numerical problems raised by the high R/X ratios of distribution feeders. As a consequence, decoupled power flow methods can be efficiently applied to distribution system analysis. The performance of the proposed technique and the simplicity of adapting it to existing power flow programs are addressed in the paper. Different distribution network configurations and load conditions have been used to illustrate and evaluate the use of cpu.

Abstract: Natural gas (NG) network and electric network are becoming tightly integrated by microturbines in the microgrid. Interactions between these two networks are not well captured by the traditional microturbine (MT) models. To address this issue, two improved models for single-shaft MT and split-shaft MT are proposed in this paper. In addition, dynamic models of the hybrid natural gas and electricity system (HGES) are developed for the analysis of their interactions. Dynamic behaviors of natural gas in pipes are described by partial differential equations (PDEs), while the electric network is described by differential algebraic equations (DAEs). So the overall network is a typical two-time scale dynamic system. Numerical studies indicate that the two-time scale algorithm is faster and can capture the interactions between the two networks. The results also show the HGES with a single-shaft MT is a weakly coupled system in which disturbances in the two networks mainly influence the dc link voltage of the MT, while the split-shaft MT is a strongly coupled system where the impact of an event will affect both networks.

Abstract: In this work, the author discusses development of the Smart Electric Power System (SEPS) Laboratory at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ). The fully reconfigurable six-bus, three-phase power system hardware operates with ratings of 208 (at 60 Hz) and 0.2 kW. It is composed of various synchronous generators with associated prime movers, induction motors with associated dynamometers, transformers, transmission lines, contactors, constant-impedance loads, renewable generation-emulator modules, battery storage devices, and appropriate power electronic converters. The SEPS lab significantly expands the ability of faculty and students at TCNJ to study energy problems, providing a sound foundation for the institution's small but growing power engineering program. The National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Program provided external funding for the hardware.

Abstract: We present a computationally efficient mixed-integer program (MIP) that determines optimal generator expansion decisions, as well as periodic unit commitment and dispatch. The model is applied to analyze the impact of increasing wind power capacity on the optimal generation mix and the profitability of thermal generators. In a case study, we find that increasing wind penetration reduces energy prices while the prices for operating reserves increase. Moreover, scarcity pricing for operating reserves through reserve shortfall penalties significantly impacts the prices and profitability of thermal generators. Without scarcity pricing, no thermal units are profitable, however scarcity pricing can ensure profitability for peaking units at high wind penetration levels. Capacity payments can also ensure profitability, but the payments required for baseload units to break even increase with the amount of wind power. The results indicate that baseload units are most likely to experience revenue sufficiency problems when wind penetration increases and new baseload units are only developed when natural gas prices are high and wind penetration is low.

Abstract: Due to substantial use of gas turbines and their highly dynamic behavior, they have a profound impact on electrical grid. Although the control philosophies of various turbines are almost the same, there are some nuances in governor systems. As long as these details affect system response in extremely dynamic phenomena such as load rejection, they should be included in models. In this paper, the governor system is subjected to careful scrutiny; tasks of controllers are classified schematically and some special features such as back-tracing and feed-forward are discussed. The turbine is also modeled and a function is developed to calculate turbine exhaust gas temperature. The proposed governor-turbine model is validated by test results and a comparative analysis shows that the back-tracing method prevents wind-up phenomenon and the feed-forward method improves stability and response time.

Abstract: The integration of wind power requires the power system to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate its forecast errors. In the market clearing process, the scheduling of flexibility relies on the manner in which the wind power uncertainty is addressed in the unit commitment (UC) model. This paper presents a novel risk-based day-ahead unit commitment (RUC) model that considers the risks of the loss of load, wind curtailment and branch overflow caused by wind power uncertainty. These risks are formulated in detail using the probabilistic distributions of wind power probabilistic forecast and are considered in both the objective functions and the constraints. The RUC model is shown to be convex and is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem using relaxation and piecewise linearization. The proposed RUC model is tested using a three-bus system and an IEEE RTS79 system with wind power integration. The results show that the model can dynamically schedule the spinning reserves and hold the transmission capacity margins according to the uncertainty of the wind power. A comparison between the results of the RUC, a deterministic UC and two scenario-based UC models shows that the risk modeling facilitates a strategic market clearing procedure with a reasonable computational expense.

Abstract: We investigate group formations and strategic behaviors of renewable power producers in electricity markets. These producers currently bid into the day-ahead market in a conservative fashion because of the real-time risk associated with not meeting their bid amount. It has been suggested in the literature that producers would bid less conservatively if they can form large groups to take advantages of spatial diversity to reduce the uncertainty in their aggregate output. We show that large groups of renewable producers would act strategically to lower the aggregate output because of market power. To maximize renewable power production, we characterize the trade-off between market power and generation uncertainty as a function of the size of the groups. We show there is a sweet spot in the sense that there exists groups that are large enough to achieve the uncertainty reduction of the grand coalition, but are small enough such that they have no significant market power. We consider both independent and correlated forecast errors under a fixed real-time penalty. We also consider a real-time market where both selling and buying of energy are allowed. We validate our claims using PJM and NREL data.

Abstract: Heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can be viewed as elastic load to provide demand response. Existing work usually used HVAC to do the load following or load shaping based on given control signals or objectives. However, optimal external control signals may not always be available. Without such control signals, how to make a tradeoff between the fluctuation of non-renewable power generation and the limited demand response potential of the elastic load, while still guaranteeing user comfort level, is still an open problem. To solve this problem, we first model the temperature evolution process of a room and propose an approach to estimate the key parameters of the model. Second, based on the model predictive control, a centralized and a distributed algorithm are proposed to minimize the fluctuation and maximize user comfort level. In addition, we propose a dynamic water level adjustment algorithm to make the demand response always available in two directions. Extensive simulations based on practical data sets show that the proposed algorithms can effectively reduce the load fluctuation.

Abstract: Real-time load composition knowledge will dramatically benefit demand-side management (DSM). Previous works disaggregate the load via either intrusive or nonintrusive load monitoring. However, due to the difficulty in accessing all houses via smart meters at all times and the unavailability of frequently measured high-resolution load signatures at bulk supply points, neither is suitable for frequent or widespread application. This paper employs the artificial intelligence (AI) tool to develop a load disaggregation approach for bulk supply points based on the substation rms measurement without relying on smart meter data, customer surveys, or high-resolution load signatures. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate the training and validation data. Load compositions obtained by the AI tool are compared with the validation data and used for load characteristics estimation and validation. Probabilistic distributions and confidence levels of different confidence intervals for errors of load compositions and load characteristics are also derived.

Abstract: The impact of electric vehicles on power quality in electric distribution system is evaluated. Voltage deviations such as under/over voltage and voltage imbalance are probabilistically quantified using Monte Carlo. Moreover, distribution transformers overload and unbalance are assessed for different vehicle types (i.e., plug-in hybrid and battery electric), different vehicle penetration (up to 50%) while considering level 1 and level 2 charging. The results of Monte Carlo reveal that battery electric vehicles can cause more overload to distribution transformers compared to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Also level 2 and level 1 can be problematic resulting in secondary bus undervoltage and transformer unbalance, respectively.

Abstract: Modeling and analysis of the output impedance of a grid-connected voltage-sourced converter (VSC)-based system under the recently-developed power synchronization control topology is presented in this paper. The impact of impedance passivity on subsynchronous damping profile of an electrically-nearby synchronous generator is then characterized. The impacts of key factors such as control modes and control parameter are addressed. A comparison with the standard vector control strategy is also presented. The results reveal that under this type of control, a VSC does not have negative impact on sub-synchronous dynamics; on the contrary, it has a positive impact, compared with commonly used vector current control where the latter has a potential to degrade the system damping. Time-domain simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Research on electric power systems has considered the impact of foreseeable plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) penetration on its regulation, planning, and operation. Indeed, detailed treatment of PEV charging is necessary for efficient allocation of resources. It is envisaged that a coordinator of charging schedules, i.e., a PEV aggregator, could exercise some form of load control according to electricity market prices and network charges. In this context, it is important to consider the effects of uncertainty of key input parameters to optimization algorithms for PEV charging schedules. However, the modeling of the PEV aggregator's exposure to profit volatility has received less attention in detail. Hence, this paper develops a methodology to maximize PEV aggregator profits taking decisions in day-ahead and balancing markets while considering risk aversion. Under uncertain market prices and fleet mobility, the proposed two-stage linear stochastic program finds optimal PEV charging schedules at the vehicle level. A case study highlights the effects of including the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) term in the objective function and calculates two metrics referred to as the expected value of aggregation and flexibility.

Abstract: Traditional stochastic programming methods are widely used for solving hydroelectric reservoirs management problems under uncertainty. With these methods, random parameters are described using a scenario tree possessing an unstructured topology. Therefore, traditional methods can potentially handle high-order time-correlation effects, but their computational requirements grow exponentially with the branching level used to represent parameters (e.g., load, inflows, prices). Consequently, random parameters must be discretized very coarsely and, as a result, numerical solutions of mid-term optimization models can be quite sensitive to small perturbations to the tree parameters. In this paper, we propose a new approach for managing high-capacity reservoirs over an extended horizon (1-3 years). We partition the planning horizon in two stages and assume that a memory loss occurs at the end of the first stage. We propose a new Benders decomposition algorithm designed specifically to exploit this simplification. The low memory requirement of our method enables to consider a much higher branching level than would be possible with previous methods. The proposed approach is tested on a 104-week production planning problem with stochastic inflows.

Abstract: The smart grid technology enables an increasing level of responsiveness on the demand side, facilitating demand serving entities-large consumers and retailers-to procure their electricity needs under the best conditions. Such entities generally exhibit a proactive role in the pool, seeking to procure their energy needs at minimum cost. Within this framework, we propose a mathematical model to help large consumers to derive bidding strategies to alter pool prices to their own benefit. Representing the uncertainty involved, we develop a stochastic complementarity model to derive bidding curves, and show the advantages of such bidding scheme with respect to non-strategic ones.

Abstract: Economic dispatch (ED) considering valve-point effect, multiple fuel options, prohibited operating zones of generation units is a more accurate model compared to a conventional ED model. It is non-smooth and thus evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are so far the only feasible approaches for the model. In Part II of the paper, a new method, the dimensional steepest decline method (DSD), is proposed for the ED with non-smooth objectives. The DSD is based on the local minimum analysis of the ED problem presented in Part I of the paper. The fuel cost's decline rate between each two adjacent singular points is utilized to find the optimal solutions in a serial sequence. The computational complexity of the DSD is analyzed. The DSD has been applied to solve different types of ED problems on different test systems, including large-scale systems. The simulation results show that DSD can obtain more accurate solutions and consume much less time and its advantage is more obvious on large-scale systems, in comparison with the state-of-art EAs.

Abstract: Energy storage systems play a significant role in both distributed power systems and utility power systems. Among the many benefits of an energy storage system, the improvement of power system cost and voltage profile can be the salient specifications of storage systems. Studies show that improper size and placement of energy storage units leads to undesired power system cost as well as the risk of voltage stability, especially in the case of high renewable energy penetration. To solve the problem, a hybrid multi-objective particle swarm optimization (HMOPSO) approach is proposed in the paper to minimize the power system cost and improve the system voltage profiles by searching sitting and sizing of storage units under consideration of uncertainties in wind power production. Furthermore, the probability cost analysis is first put forward in this paper. The proposed HMOPSO combines multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm with elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and probabilistic load flow technique. It also incorporates a five-point estimation method (5PEM) for discretizing wind power distribution. The IEEE 30-bus system is adopted to perform case studies. The simulation results for each case clearly demonstrate the necessity for optimal storage allocation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Quantifying the impact of new technologies on a single distribution feeder is a tractable analysis problem. But the analysis of a single distribution feeder does not provide insight into the complexities and variations of a system-wide deployment. The inability to extrapolate system-wide impacts hinders the deployment of many promising new technologies. This paper presents a three-stage method of extrapolating technological impacts, either simulated or from a field demonstration, from a limited number of distribution feeders to the entire system. The size of the system can vary from the service territory of a single utility, to a region, or to an entire country. The paper will include an example analysis using the United States Department of Energy funded Smart Grid Investment Grant projects, extrapolating their benefits to a national level, and an example of a regionalized deployment of Volt-VAR optimization for peak demand reduction. Both of the example analyses utilize the presented three-stage extrapolation method.

Abstract: Economic dispatch with valve-point effect (EDVPE) considered is presented as a more accurate model of the real problem compared to the conventional economic dispatch model. It is basically a non-convex, non-differentiable, and multi-modal optimization model with many local minima. Part I of the paper focuses on the local minimum analysis of the EDVPE. The analysis indicates that a local minimum consists of the singular points, the small convex regions, and the output of a slack unit that is dispatched to balance the load demand. Two types of local minima are identified and the second type could be ignored. To verify the rationality of the analyses, a traverse search has been performed to solve the EDVPE with and without considering the transmission loss on different test systems. All the simulation results support the analysis given in the paper. To effectively solve the EDVPE on a large-scale power system, based on the analysis presented in this paper, a new method, dimensional steepest decline method, is proposed in Part II of the paper.

Abstract: This paper aims to evaluate and improve the usefulness of publicly available electricity market prices for real-time optimal dispatching (RTOD) of a privately owned energy storage system (ESS) in a competitive electricity market. The RTOD algorithm seeks to maximize the revenue by exploiting arbitrage opportunities available due to the inter-temporal variation of electricity prices in the day-ahead market. The pre-dispatch prices, issued by the Ontario independent electricity system operator, and the corresponding ex-post hourly Ontario energy prices are employed as the forecast and the actual prices. A compressed-air ESS is sized and employed for evaluations due to its lower capital expenditure and its ability to be positively influenced by the availability of waste heat. First, the conventional RTOD algorithm is developed by formulating a mixed integer linear programming problem. It is demonstrated that the forecast inaccuracy of publicly available market prices significantly reduces the ESS revenue. Then, a new adaptive algorithm is proposed and evaluated which adapts the objective function of the optimization problem online based on historical market prices available before real-time. The outcomes reveal that the proposed adaptive RTOD can significantly increase the ESS revenue compared to the conventional algorithm as well as the back-casting method proposed in prior studies.

Abstract: Time-shiftable loads have recently received an increasing attention due to their role in creating load flexibility and enhancing demand response and peak-load shaving programs. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: how can a time-shiftable load, that itself may comprise of several smaller time-shiftable subloads, submit its demand bids to the day-ahead and real-time markets so as to minimize its energy procurement cost? Answering this question is challenging because of the inter-temporal dependencies in choosing the demand bids for time-shiftable loads and due to the coupling between demand bid selection and time-shiftable load scheduling problems. Nevertheless, we answer the above question for different practical bidding scenarios and based on different statistical characteristics of practical market prices. In all cases, closed-form solutions are obtained for the optimal choices of the price and energy bids. The bidding performance is then evaluated in details by examining several case studies and analyzing actual market price data.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, a least-cost generation capacity expansion model to control carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is proposed in this paper. The mathematical model employs a decomposed two-stage stochastic integer program. Realizations of uncertain load and wind are represented by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random samples generated via the Gaussian copula method. Two policies that affect CO2 emissions directly and indirectly, carbon tax and renewable portfolio standard (RPS), are investigated to assess how much CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced through those policies.

Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum distributed energy resource (DER) capacity that can be connected to low-voltage (LV) networks without creating voltage-rise problems. That maximum capacity depends on the network characteristics and on the candidate sites for DER connection. When sites are multiple and LV networks are poorly characterized, such maximum capacity cannot be determined with power-flow or other admittance-matrix-based approaches. This paper proposes an approach to estimate voltage rise caused by DER under reduced network characterization. Such approach is built upon customary voltage and impedance measurements to be made at the sites of DER injection and gives sufficiently accurate results under most practical situations. The paper validates the accuracy of the proposed approach against exact power-flow results for well-characterized networks and load situations and provides guidelines for DER connection based on maximum capacity nodal allocation.

Abstract: Spinning reserve (SR) is one of the most important resources used by system operators to respond to unforeseen events. In a low-carbon economy mode, carbon capture plant is an important CO2 abatement option and might constitute a significant proportion of the generation mix. Due to their potential flexibility, such plants might affect the requirement for SR. This paper describes a multi-period optimization model for coordinating the generation, carbon capture and SR provision. In turn, this model is used to optimize the SR requirements, with the objective of minimizing the overall cost. Since this objective function combines the generation production cost, the expected energy not supplied (EENS) cost, SR provision cost and the carbon emission cost, it is better suited to evaluate the SR requirements of power system with carbon capture plants. Numerical results based on a 26-unit test system show that the proposed model is effective and practical.

Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach in the modeling of stand-alone microgrids to predict their operational adequacy performance considering uncertainty of energy storage system (ESS), photovoltaic system (PVS) and conventional generator (CG). Instead of using the daily or hourly time step, operating period a minutely time step is considered to incorporate the effect of fast ramp up/down of system components on microgrid operating adequacy through expected energy not supplied (EENS) and expected energy not used (EENU), due to load and resource variations. A time varying state of charge (SOC) model is proposed to determine power output of an ESS in reliability modeling. The reliability of a PVS is modeled in detail based on the total cross-tied configuration (TCTC) of photovoltaic (PV) cells and arrays. The proposed technique and indices will be useful for system planners to select the type and size of microgrid systems that contain alternative energy sources and storage.

Abstract: In this paper, the interactions between component failures are quantified and the interaction matrix and interaction network are obtained. The quantified interactions can capture the general propagation patterns of the cascades from utilities or simulation, thus helping to better understand how cascading failures propagate and to identify key links and key components that are crucial for cascading failure propagation. By utilizing these interactions a high-level probabilistic model called interaction model is proposed to study the influence of interactions on cascading failure risk and to support online decision-making. It is much more time-efficient to first quantify the interactions between component failures with fewer original cascades from a more detailed cascading failure model and then perform the interaction model simulation than it is to directly simulate a large number of cascades with a more detailed model. Interaction-based mitigation measures are suggested to mitigate cascading failure risk by weakening key links, which can be achieved in real systems by wide-area protection such as blocking of some specific protective relays. The proposed interaction quantifying method and interaction model are validated with line outage data generated by the AC OPA cascading simulations on the IEEE 118-bus system.

Abstract: Distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) is a multi-objective, nonlinear problem. This paper introduces a new, fast, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (FNSGA) for the purpose of solving the DSR problem in normal operation by satisfying all objectives simultaneously with a relatively small number of generations and relatively short computation time. The objectives of the problem are to minimize real power losses and improve the voltage profile and load balancing index with minimum switching operations. Instead of generating several ranks from the nondominated set of solutions, this algorithm deals with only one rank; then the most suitable solution is chosen according to the operator's wishes. If there is no preference and all objectives have the same degree of importance, the best solution is determined by simply considering the sum of the normalized objective values. Also, a guided mutation operation is applied instead of a random one to speed up convergence. Radial system topology is satisfied using graph theory by formulating the branch-bus incidence matrix (BBIM) and checking the rank of each topology. To test the algorithm, it was applied to two widely studied test systems and a real one. The results show the efficiency of this algorithm as compared to other methods in terms of achieving all the goals simultaneously with reasonable population and generation sizes and without using a mutation rate, which is usually problem-dependent.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time data compression and adapted protocol technique for wide-area measurement systems (WAMS). The compression algorithm combines exception compression (EC) with swing door trending (SDT) compression. The compression logic is designed to perform this algorithm in real time. Selection of compression parameters and data reconstruction are presented. An adapted protocol is introduced by improving the format of data frames defined by IEEE standard C37.118 for compressed data packets. The proposed compression technique and protocol were applied to the phasor measurement units (PMUs) of a hydropower plant in Guizhou Power Grid in Southwest China. A low-frequency oscillation incident was recorded by this technique. The raw, compressed and reconstructed data were analyzed to verify the compression and determine the accuracy of the proposed technique. Also, the wavelet-based data compression, the standalone EC and SDT are compared with the proposed compression technique. Our results demonstrated that this compression can reach the compression ratios in the range of 6 to 11. Also, this compression and adapted protocol technique can reduce the size of data packets by approximately 75% with high accuracy in both dynamic and steady states.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new transmission-constrained unit commitment method that combines the cost-efficient but computationally demanding stochastic optimization and the expensive but tractable interval optimization techniques to manage uncertainty on the expected net load. The proposed hybrid unit commitment approach applies the stochastic formulation to the initial operating hours of the optimization horizon, during which the wind forecasts are more accurate, and then switches to the interval formulation for the remaining hours. The switching time is optimized to balance the cost of unhedged uncertainty from the stochastic unit commitment against the cost of the security premium of the interval unit commitment formulation. These hybrid, stochastic, and interval formulations are compared using Monte Carlo simulations on a modified 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System. The results demonstrate that the proposed unit commitment formulation results in the least expensive day-ahead schedule among all formulations and can be solved in the same amount of time as a full stochastic unit commitment. However, if the range of the switching time is reduced, the hybrid formulation in the parallel computing implementation outperforms the stochastic formulation in terms of computing time.

Abstract: A hierarchical decentralized network reconfiguration approach to minimize power losses for smart distribution systems was presented in Part I. In this paper, the proposed approach is applied to four test distribution systems to examine its performance. A demonstration system consisting of the test system and distributed intelligent agents is built using MATLAB/Simulink to illustrate how the decentralized approach is implemented. Simulation results of the proposed approach are then compared with results of a centralized implementation and the harmony search method. It is shown that the decentralized approach can achieve similar results as other methods with significantly reduced computation time. The impacts of time-varying loads and faults are also studied through dynamic network reconfiguration on the 118-bus test system. Simulation results illustrate that dynamic network reconfiguration with time-ahead planning can determine the optimal configuration for each operating period to significantly reduce system energy losses. The enhanced performance of the hierarchical decentralized approach is clearly established.

Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating the cost of a transmission system among load and generator entities. It is a known instance of the classical cooperative game theoretic problem. To solve this problem is a formidable task, as we are dealing with a combinatorial game with transferable utilities. This is an NP hard problem. Therefore, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Marginal pricing is a pragmatic alternative to solve this problem since both Kirchhoff current law and voltage law are strictly adhered to. However, the generic complexity of cooperative game theoretic problems cannot be just wished away. It now manifests as the difficulty in choosing an economic slack bus, which may even be dispersed. We propose the application of min-max fairness policy to solve this problem and give an algorithm which will run in polynomial time. During network cost allocation, min-max fairness policy minimizes the maximum regret among participating entities at each step. Maximum regret is measured in terms of price, and lexicographic application of this principle leads to a fair and unique equilibrium price vector. Results on a large network demonstrate fairness as well as tractability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Most existing carbon emission management strategies only control the total carbon emission without focusing on both the regional carbon emission and the stochastic properties of the system. Correlated regional loads and unpredictable renewable energies in the power system make regional carbon emission management (RCEM) increasingly challenging and necessary. A complex multi-objective RCEM model based on probabilistic power flow (PPF) considering correlated variables is contributed in this paper. The three objective functions to be minimized are 1) the cost of electricity generated, 2) the total carbon emission, and 3) the carbon emission difference among regions which reflects the regional carbon emission imbalance from the supply side. A new clonal selection algorithm (CSA) coupled with a fuzzy satisfying decision method and an extended 2m + 1 point estimate method (PEM) is proposed to solve this multi-objective RCEM model. The proposed method is illustrated through IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 118-bus and simplified Shanghai case studies. The proposed model can help reduce the total carbon emission, control regional carbon emission, prevent probabilistic congested lines from overloading, and choose the most suitable region for wind farms (WFs).

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient method for evaluating composite system reliability via subset simulation. The central idea is that a small failure probability can be expressed as a product of larger conditional probabilities, thereby turning the problem of simulating a rare failure event into several conditional simulations of more frequent intermediate failure events. In existing methods, system states are simply assessed in a binary secure/failure manner. To fit into the context of subset simulation, the adequacy of system states is parametrized with a metric based on linear programming, thus allowing for an adaptive choice of intermediate failure events. Samples conditional on these events are generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed method requires no prior information before imulation. Different models for renewable energy sources can also be accommodated. Numerical tests show that this method is significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo simulation, especially for simulating rare failure events.

Abstract: The paper investigates the effect of age related failure of power transformers on the identification of most critical transformer sites for system reliability. The end-of-life failure model of power transformers is modified first to integrate loading conditions effect. The adopted Arrhenius-Weibull probability distribution, which represents the effect of thermal stress on the transformer's end-of-life failure, was compared with the commonly used Gaussian probability distribution model. The sensitivity of results to the uncertainty in model parameters is thoroughly assessed, and acceptable level of uncertainty is determined. The results demonstrated the importance of integration of loading conditions into the failure model. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the identification of critical transformer sites is not significantly affected by the uncertainty in the failure model parameters and that approximate ranges of parameters can be used instead of accurate values without significant, if any, loss in accuracy. The case studies were performed on a realistic transmission test system with 154 power transformers.

Abstract: We present a new formulation of a hybrid stochastic- robust optimization and use it to calculate a look-ahead, security-constrained optimal power flow. It is designed to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by efficiently accommodating renewable energy sources and by realistically evaluating system changes that could reduce emissions. It takes into account ramping costs, CO2 damages, demand functions, reserve needs, contingencies, and the temporally linked probability distributions of stochastic variables such as wind generation. The inter-temporal trade-offs and transversality of energy storage systems are a focus of our formulation. We use it as part of a new method to comprehensively estimate the operational net benefits of system changes. Aside from the optimization formulation, our method has four other innovations. First, it statistically estimates the cost and CO2 impacts of each generator's electricity output and ramping decisions. Second, it produces a comprehensive measure of net operating benefit, and disaggregates that into the effects on consumers, producers, system operators, government, and CO2 damage. Third and fourth, our method includes creating a novel, modified Ward reduction of the grid and a thorough generator dataset from publicly available information sources. We then apply this method to estimating the impacts of wind power, energy storage, and operational policies.

Abstract: In order to optimize their assets, electrical power distribution companies seek out various techniques to improve system operation and its different variables, like voltage levels, active power losses and so on. A few of the tools applied to meet these objectives include reactive power compensation, use of voltage regulators, and network reconfiguration. One target most companies aim at is power loss minimization; one available tool to do this is distribution system reconfiguration. To reconfigure a network in radial power distribution systems means to alter the topology changing the state of a set of switches normally closed (NC) and normally opened (NO). In restructured electrical power business, a company must also consider obtaining a topology as reliable as possible. In most cases, reducing the power losses is no guarantee of improved reliability. This paper presents a multiobjective algorithm to reduce power losses while improving the reliability index using the artificial immune systems technique applying graph theory considerations to improve computational performance and Pareto dominance rules. The proposed algorithm is tested on a sample system, 14-bus test system, and on Administracion Nacional de Electricidad (ANDE) real feeder (CBO-01 23-kV feeder).

Abstract: This work describes a methodology for informing targeted demand-response (DR) and marketing programs that focus on the temperature-sensitive part of residential electricity demand. Our methodology uses data that is becoming readily available at utility companies-hourly energy consumption readings collected from "smart" electricity meters, as well as hourly temperature readings. To decompose individual consumption into a thermal-sensitive part and a base load (non-thermally-sensitive), we propose a model of temperature response that is based on thermal regimes, i.e., unobserved decisions of consumers to use their heating or cooling appliances. We use this model to extract useful benchmarks that compose thermal profiles of individual users, i.e., terse characterizations of the statistics of these users' temperature-sensitive consumption. We present example profiles generated using our model on real consumers, and show its performance on a large sample of residential users. This knowledge may, in turn, inform the DR program by allowing scarce operational and marketing budgets to be spent on the right users-those whose influencing will yield highest energy reductions-at the right time. We show that such segmentation and targeting of users may offer savings exceeding 100% of a random strategy.

Abstract: We examine the problem of a generator offering generation and ancillary services from a set of cascaded hydroelectric units to a centrally dispatched market that does not account for watershed constraints. By modeling the least-cost dispatch problem and computing the resulting schedules and market prices, we formulate a stochastic bilevel optimization problem that maximizes the generator's expected profits under different demand and supply realizations. To account for potential infeasibilities in the resulting hydroelectric dispatch, we include penalties in the generator's objective function. We propose a simple technique that replaces the lower-level dispatch problem with its linearized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions to convert the problem to a single-level mixed-integer program. We use two numerical case studies, based on actual river systems, to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decentralized agent-based network reconfiguration methodology to minimize power losses for smart distribution systems. A novel formulation of the network reconfiguration problem is given in which the switch states are the decision variables, and a single-loop branch-exchange heuristic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The entire distribution system is decomposed into subsystems based on the connectivity of areas, and an individual agent is assigned to each decomposed subsystem. A two-stage method is defined for coordinating the reconfigurations of decomposed subsystems. The optimal configuration of the entire system results from collaborations of individual agents, and the decentralized approach significantly reduces the computation time. A 118-bus distribution system is used as the example to illustrate the implementation of the method. The development of a demonstration system and more detailed simulation studies are given in Part II to further illustrate the application of the proposed decentralized approach.

Abstract: As a clean fuel source, natural gas plays an important role in achieving a low-carbon economy in the power industry. Owing to the uncertainties introduced by increasing utilization of natural gas in electric power system, gas system and electricity system should be planned in an integrated manner. When considering these two systems simultaneously, there are many emerging difficulties, e.g., increased system complexity and risk, market timeline mismatch, overall system reliability evaluation, etc. In this paper, a novel expansion co-planning (ECP) framework is proposed to address the above challenges. In our approach, the planning process is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem. The best augmentation option is a plan with the highest cost/benefit ratio. Benefits of expansion planning considered are reductions in operation cost, carbon emission cost, and unreliability cost. By identifying several scenarios based on statistical analysis and expert knowledge, decision analysis is used to tackle market uncertainties. The operational and economic interdependency of both systems are well analyzed. Case studies on a three-bus gas and two-bus power system, plus the Victorian integrated gas and electricity system in Australia are presented to validate the performance of the proposed framework.

Abstract: We model post-contingency corrective actions in the security-constrained economic dispatch and consider multiple stages of rescheduling to meet different security constraints. The resulting linear program is not solvable by traditional LP methods due to its large size. We devise and implement a series of algorithmic enhancements based on the Benders' decomposition method to ameliorate the computational difficulty. These enhancements include reducing the number of subproblems, solving the LPs faster by using appropriate solver options, harnessing parallel computing and treating difficult contingencies separately by integrating an independent "feasibility checker" process in the algorithm. In addition, we propose a set of online measures to diagnose and correct infeasibility issues encountered in the solution process. The overall solution approach, coded directly in GAMS, is able to process the "N-1" contingency list in 10 min for all large network cases (e.g., the Polish 2383-bus case) available for experiments.

Abstract: We investigate the potential for aggregations of residential thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as air conditioners, to arbitrage intraday wholesale electricity market prices via non-disruptive load control. We present two arbitrage approaches: 1) a benchmark that gives us an optimal policy but requires local computation or real-time communication and 2) an alternative based on a thermal energy storage model, which relies on less computation/communication infrastructure, but is suboptimal. We find that the alternative approach achieves around 60%-80% of the optimal wholesale energy cost savings. We use this approach to compute practical upper bounds for savings via arbitrage with air conditioners in California's intraday energy market. We investigate six sites over four years and find that the savings range from $2-$37 per TCL per year, and depend upon outdoor temperature statistics and price volatility.

Abstract: This paper explores the impact that different network access arrangements have on the capacity factor of non-firm wind generator connections to distribution networks. Active network management (ANM) projects are increasing in application in distribution networks as the need to integrate distributed generation becomes a more serious challenge. An important aspect of ANM is the contractual arrangement of the participating generation developer and network operator parties. These are sometimes referred to as "Principles of Access" (PoA) and deals with the rights of the generator when curtailment of generation output is required to maintain the network within its limits. Currently, a Last in First Off (LIFO) PoA is implemented in most U.K. ANM deployments and is the prevailing PoA in the Orkney ANM scheme. The Orkney network is used in this paper as a case study to analyze different PoA and compare the renewable energy capacity factor (CF) which result from these arrangements. The archival value of this paper is in the application of optimal power flow (OPF) to the PoA analysis challenge, in the quantification of the impact of previously identified PoA and in the conclusions drawn on the implications of different PoA choices for ANM schemes at the current early stage of ANM deployment.

Abstract: This paper improves the existing Kalman-based technique for detecting electromechanical oscillations using Synchrophasor measurements. The novelty is the utilization of a distributed architecture to extract maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimations of oscillatory parameters. This was achieved by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. To improve initial condition estimation, initial correlation information through a forward backward (FB) Kalman-like particle filter (KLPF) was integrated into the proposed scheme. Performance evaluation was conducted using IEEE New England 39-Bus system and Synchrophasor measurements collected from New Zealand Grid. The proposed method accurately extracted oscillatory parameters when the measurements were contaminated by continuous random small load fluctuations. The method also improved the capability of detecting multiple oscillations with similar frequencies.

Abstract: Information framework of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) and the essential characteristics of coordinated reactive power optimization (RPO) in multi-area large-scale power systems are introduced in this paper. We consider that the change of optimal solutions (control settings) cannot be captured by simply using an equality constraint of the boundary values as which the voltages at boundary buses and power flows in tie lines are referred to. While many previous methods were proposed by using change of the boundary values to evaluate the change of optimal solutions, which might lead to failure in convergence, this paper puts forward a coordination strategy according to the correspondence between optimal solutions and boundary values based on a probing mechanism. This method is applied to a 472-bus power system; the simulation results show that the RPO scheme based on this strategy has strong convergence capability and high efficiency. Moreover, the proposed coordination strategy allows the transmission system operators (TSOs) to choose objective function and optimization algorithm independently.

Abstract: In traditional distribution system, power flow was unidirectional; thus loads were usually aggregated into the substation as an equivalent constant bus in the original risk analysis of transmission system. Detail structures of the distribution system were absolutely ignored. However, distribution system is transformed from passive to active nowadays with more and more distributed generations (DGs) being integrated into it. So, distribution system not only can be considered as loads but also can be considered as virtual power plants to supply power to local loads and even to send power back to the transmission system sometimes. In this paper, a hierarchical method is presented to evaluate the impact of role changing of the distribution system in power system risk assessment. In the study, DGs can supply critical loads in distribution system through re-dispatching after some contingency happens. Discrete probability model is employed to simulate the intermittent output of DGs. Available supply capacity (ASC) is used as a general constraint to guarantee the security level of distribution system that needs high reliability. Also, an iterative calculation between transmission system and distribution network is adopted to derive the risk indices with considering detail structures of the active distribution network. Further, impact of some factors on system risk calculation, such as DGs' capacities, dispersions, locations, and component outage probabilities, are discussed. Finally, correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated by a modified IEEE RTS and RBTS system.

Abstract: Due to the variability of renewable resources, the ISO tries to identify do-not-exceed (DNE) limits, which are the maximum renewable generation ranges that the power system can accommodate without sacrificing system reliability. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is to find the largest operating ranges of variable resources such that the system remains feasible under any generation realizations within the range. Computing the DNE limits can be conceptually translated into finding the largest uncertain set of a robust optimization problem. Depending on the assumptions on how the system responds to the uncertainty of renewable resources, three alternative approaches are developed to convert the nonstandard robust optimization problem into linear programming, bilinear programming and two-stage robust optimization problems, respectively. Although the linear programming problem is easier to solve as compared to the other two alternatives, its resulting DNE limits are the most conservative. Therefore, the trade-off needs to be considered when deciding which approach is the most appropriate in real-time operation. A 5-bus system and the ISO New England power system are used to test the proposed approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of fault tree analysis to calculate the probability of failure of a substation monitoring system based on branch phasor measurement units. Results of the fault tree analysis are used in a reliability-based model for the contingency-constrained phasor measurement units (PMUs) placement to find the minimum number of substations where the branch PMUs must be located for enhancing the wide area monitoring system reliability. The algorithm selects the minimal number of substations to monitor the power system under normal operation and the most credible contingencies. Finally, four indexes will be computed to evaluate the robustness of any monitoring system placement solution. The methodology is tested on the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 57-bus test systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach in estimating important parameters of power system transient stability model such as inertia constant and direct axis transient reactance in real time. It uses a variation of unscented Kalman filter (UKF) on the phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. The accurate estimation of these parameters is very important for assessing the stability and tuning the adaptive protection system on power swing relays. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in a simulated data from 16-machine 68-bus system model. The paper also presents the performance comparison between the UKF and EKF method in estimating the parameters. The robustness of method is further validated in the presence of noise that is likely to be in the PMU data in reality.

Abstract: The series compensation capacitor and HVDC are widely used in Chinese power grids to increase the transmission capability of long distance lines, which might cause subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) between the turbine generators and power systems. The torsional mechanical damping coefficient of a turbine generator reflects the inherent damping level of the shaft and, thus, is a critical factor in SSO analysis. However, the torsional mechanical damping coefficient under practical operating conditions is difficult to obtain from the design parameters. In this paper, a novel approach is developed for online torsional mechanical damping coefficient measurements. The torsional interaction mechanism of identical parallel connected turbine generators is investigated, and then the characteristics of in-phase mode (IPM) and anti-phase mode (APM) are described. From this analysis, an active stimulating method for APM is presented, and a practical scheme for online torsional mechanical damping coefficient measurement is designed. fThis approach takes advantage of the APM features and decouples the generators from the grid. Moreover, the proposed approach has been implemented in the Yimin power plant in Inner Mongolia to realize online measurement of the torsional mechanical damping coefficient. Field test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Owing to wind power inherent characteristics and technical constraints of power systems operation, a considerable amount of wind energy cannot be delivered to load centers and gets curtailed. Transmission congestion together with temporal mismatch between load and available wind power can be accounted as the main reasons for this unpleasant event. This paper aims to concentrate on the wind energy curtailment for which it provides a combinatorial planning model to maximize wind power utilization. Jointly operating the wind power generation system with pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), the planning procedure tries to reach schemes with the minimum level of wind energy curtailment as well as low imposed cost of transmission network reinforcement. In this regard, a well-organized posterior multi-objective (MO) optimization framework is proposed aimed to properly deal with wind energy curtailment cost, total social cost, and also storage units' revenue as some unavoidable factors in planning studies of power systems. The presented method is conducted on the modified IEEE Reliability Test System (IEEE-RTS) and the obtained results introduce its applicability and efficiency in planning procedure of the renewable-based power systems.

Abstract: A novel procedure for estimating the total inertia of the Great Britain (GB) power system is presented. Following an instantaneous in-feed loss, regional variations in the estimate of inertia are obtained from measured frequency transients using installed synchronised phasor measurement units (PMUs). A method is proposed to first detect a suitable event for analysis, and then filter the measured transients in order to obtain a reliable estimate of inertia for a given region of the GB network. The total inertia for the whole system is then calculated as a summation, with an estimate also provided as to the contribution to inertia from residual sources, namely synchronously connected demand and embedded generation. The approach is first demonstrated on the full dynamic model of the GB transmission system, before results are presented from analyzing the impact of a number of instantaneous transmission in-feed loss events using phase-angle data provided by PMUs from the GB transmission network and also devices installed at the domestic supply at 4 GB universities.

Abstract: Without appropriate counteraction, the high amount of installed distributed generators (DG) at the low-voltage distribution level may cause overloading of electrical equipments and violation of voltage limits in many grids. Because of the historically grown low-voltage grids and their local and geographic dependencies, complex grid structures can be found. Thus, the discrimination of grids concerning their DG capacity is a difficult task. We propose a novel three-step classification strategy to distinguish various kinds of low-voltage grids regarding their DG capacity. Our method is based on a stochastic simulation procedure and a subsequent parametric stochastic modeling, which allows for a probability based classification approach. The classification results can be regarded as probabilistic class memberships or, if sharp memberships are required, the class with the maximum probability can be selected. The proposed approach will not only help distribution system operators to face the challenges in future grid planning and focus their work on further enhancement of weak grid structures, but it will also be valuable in choosing relevant grids for detailed surveys. To demonstrate that our approach actually leads to meaningful classification results for real low-voltage grids, we empirically evaluate the results for 300 real rural and suburban grids by comparing them to classification assessments of experts from distribution grid planning practice.

Abstract: Stability is an important constraint in power system operation and the transient stability constrained optimal power flow (OPF) has always received considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, the defects of the existing models and algorithms around this topic are firstly analyzed, on the basis of which, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed. The basic idea of the proposed method is to model transient stability as an objective function rather than an inequality constraint and consider classic transient stability constrained OPF (TSCOPF) as a tradeoff procedure using Pareto ideology. Second, a master-slave parallel elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used to solve the proposed multi-objective optimization problem, the parallel algorithm shows an excellent acceleration effect and provides a set of Pareto optimal solutions for decision makers to select. An innovative weight assigning technique based on fuzzy membership variance is also introduced for a more scientific and objective optimal solution decision. Case study results demonstrate the proposed multi-objective method has many advantages, compared with traditional TSCOPF methods.

Abstract: We prove that the active power through a branch (referred to as branch active power) in a power system is a continuous function of the bifurcation parameter in the closed interval from an initial parameter value to the bifurcation-point value of a saddle-node bifurcation (SNB) or limit-induced bifurcation (LIB) of the power flow equation (PFE). Then we show that generally there is a sequence of branch active powers meeting maxima when the parameters are equal to intermediate values in the closed interval. These results can be used to qualitatively evaluate and classify the state of power system operation conditions in terms of voltage stability. Also, they well explain the limitation of the direct current (DC) power flow methods on stressed power systems. Numerical simulations of the IEEE 118-bus and 57-bus systems are used to illustrate the studies and their applications.

Abstract: Should energy storage buy and sell power at wholesale prices like utilities and generators, or should its physical and financial operation be asynchronyous as with transmission lines? In the first case, storage straightforwardly profits through inter-temporal arbitrage, also known as load shifting and peak shaving. In this paper, the latter case, referred to as passive storage, is examined. Because passive storage does not make nodal price transactions, new mechanisms are necessary for its integration into electricity markets. This issue is addressed by further developing the analogy between energy storage and transmission. Specifically, financial rights are defined for storage, and tracing is extended to multiperiod power flows linked by storage. Like flowgate transmission rights, the new financial storage rights redistribute the system operator's merchandising surplus and enable risk-averse market participants to hedge against nodal price volatility resulting from storage congestion. Simple examples are given demonstrating the implementation of the new mechanisms. Game-theoretic analysis suggests that financial storage rights mitigate gaming when both the generator and load bid strategically.

Abstract: For a successful rollout of electric vehicles (EVs), it is required to establish an adequate charging infrastructure. The adequate access to such infrastructure would help to mitigate concerns associated with limited EV range and long charging times. Battery swapping stations are poised as effective means of eliminating the long waiting times associated with charging the EV batteries. These stations are mediators between the power system and their customers. In order to successfully deploy this type of stations, a business and operating model is required, that will allow it to generate profits while offering a fast and reliable alternative to charging batteries. This paper proposes an optimization framework for the operating model of battery swapping stations. The proposed model considers the day-ahead scheduling process. Battery demand uncertainty is modeled using inventory robust optimization, while multi-band robust optimization is employed to model electricity price uncertainty. The results show the viability of the proposed model as a business case, as well as the effectiveness of the model to provide the required service.

Abstract: As more non-dispatchable renewable resources are integrated into the grid, it will become increasingly difficult to predict the transfer capabilities and the network congestion. At the same time, renewable resources require operators to acquire more operating reserves. With today's deterministic reserve requirements unable to ensure optimal reserve locations, improvements to reserve policies are needed to ensure reserve deliverability while maintaining a reliable system at least cost. This paper proposes a daily reserve zone determination procedure, which is able to reflect system operating conditions by utilizing probabilistic power flows. A statistical clustering algorithm is used to cluster buses together to produce the zones; the algorithm uses a centrality measurement, which is based on weighted power transfer distribution factors. The proposed method is validated by testing it on a modified IEEE 118-bus system for multiple days; the proposed method is compared against existing reserve zone partitioning procedures. While the proposed reserve zone determination method is a heuristic, it is shown to be effective and it is a computationally tractable method. The proposed method can be used on its own and can be used along with stochastic programming techniques that implicitly determine reserves.

Abstract: There is significant interest in building HVDC transmission to carry out transnational power exchange and deliver cheaper electricity from renewable energy sources which are located far from the load centers. This paper presents a market-based approach to solve a long-term TEP for meshed VSC-HVDC grids that connect regional markets. This is in general a nonlinear, non-convex large-scale optimization problem with high computational burden, partly due to the many combinations of wind and load that become possible. We developed a two-step iterative algorithm that first selects a subset of operating hours using a clustering technique, and then seeks to maximize the social welfare of all regions and minimize the investment capital of transmission infrastructure subject to technical and economic constraints. The outcome of the optimization is an optimal grid design with a topology and transmission capacities that results in congestion revenue paying off investment by the end the project's economic lifetime. Approximations are made to allow an analytical solution to the problem and demonstrate that an HVDC pricing mechanism can be consistent with an AC counterpart. The model is used to investigate development of the offshore grid in the North Sea. Simulation results are interpreted in economic terms and show the effectiveness of our proposed two-step approach.

Abstract: The overall performance of emission trading (ET), a market-based emission regulation tool, strongly relies on participants' participation and responses. In order to improve market design, it is important for policy makers to understand the participants' trading behaviors in different market environments. However, human behaviors cannot be easily modeled with conventional analytical methods due to its "bounded rationality" characteristics. In this paper, based on the complementary features between experimental and agent-based computational methods, a hybrid interactive simulation methodology is proposed to solve human behaviors related problems. Human-subjected experiment based on European Union Emissions Trading System price data in 2006 is conducted, the results show that there is no fixed emission trading interval for generation companies, and the strategic behaviors of market participants are observed. Major driving factors of emission trading are categorized into emission price, emission quantity and time related factors, which are in accordance with empirical analysis results on EU ETS 2005-2006 transaction dataset. Furthermore, more human-subjected experiments are conducted under different emission price scenarios to obtain samples for quantitative analysis. Based on thousands of samples obtained, the joint influences of driving factors on emission trading behaviors are analyzed. The quantitative analysis results obtained can reflect the trading patterns of human participants, which provide basis for constructing computer agents that can act as useful substitutes for human participants.

Abstract: Significant uncertainty surrounds the future development of electricity systems, primarily in terms of size, location and type of new renewable generation to be connected. In this paper we assess the potential for flexible network technologies, such as phase-shifting transformers, and non-network solutions, such as energy storage and demand-side management, to constitute valuable interim measures within a long-term planning strategy. The benefit of such flexible assets lies not only in the transmission services provided but also in the way they can facilitate and de-risk subsequent decisions by deferring commitment to capital-intensive projects until more information on generation development becomes available. A novel stochastic formulation for transmission expansion planning is presented that includes consideration of investment in these flexible solutions. The proposed framework is demonstrated with a case study on the IEEE-RTS where flexible technologies are shown to constitute valuable investment options when facing uncertainties in future renewable generation development.

Abstract: This paper presents a new stochastic multi-layer agent-based model to study the behavior of electricity market participants. The wholesale market players including renewable power producers are modeled in the first layer of the proposed multi-agent environment. The players optimize bidding/offering strategies to participate in the electricity markets. In the second layer, responsive customers including plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners and consumers who participate in demand response (DR) programs are modeled as independent agents. The objective of the responsive customers is to increase their benefit while retaining welfare. The interaction between market players in day-ahead and real-time markets is modeled using an incomplete information game theory algorithm. Due to the uncertainties of resources and customers' behavior, the model is developed using a stochastic framework. A case study containing wind power producers (WPPs), PEV aggregators and retailers providing DR is considered to demonstrate the usefulness and proficiency of the proposed multi-layer agent-based model.

Abstract: Reliability analysis of power systems has been attracting increasing attention. Regulatory agencies establish reliability standards that, if infringed, result in costly fines for the utility suppliers. A special concern pertains to the distribution networks on which most failures occur. The allocation of switches is a possible strategy to improve reliability, by allowing network reconfiguration to isolate contingencies and restore power to dark areas. This paper proposes an optimization methodology to allocate switches on radially operated distribution networks. The solution framework considers sectionalizing and tie switches of different capacities, with manual or automatic operation schemes. The approach minimizes the costs of allocation and energy not supplied, under reliability and flow capacity constraints. The solution framework is based on memetic algorithm concepts with a structured population. Case studies with a large network and real-world scenarios were used to evaluate the methodology. The results indicate that significant cost reductions can be achieved using the proposed solutions.

Abstract: This paper discusses the need for the integration of storage systems on transmission networks having renewable sources, and presents a tool for energy storage planning. The tool employs robust optimization to minimize the investment in storage units that guarantee a feasible system operation, without load or renewable power curtailment, for all scenarios in the convex hull of a discrete uncertainty set; it is termed ROSION-Robust Optimization of Storage Investment On Networks. The computational engine in ROSION is a specific tailored implementation of a column-and-constraint generation algorithm for two-stage robust optimization problems, where a lower and an upper bound on the optimal objective function value are successively calculated until convergence. The lower bound is computed using mixed-integer linear programming and the upper bound via linear programming applied to a sequence of similar problems. ROSION is demonstrated for storage planning on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus networks, and the robustness of the designs is validated via Monte Carlo simulation.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can be used to provide regulation reserve to the grid. We first argue that the aggregate flexibility offered by a collection of TCLs can be succinctly modeled as a stochastic battery with dissipation. We next characterize the power limits and energy capacity of this battery model in terms of TCL parameters and random exogenous variables such as ambient temperature and user-specified set-points. We then describe a direct load control architecture for regulation service provision. Here, we use a priority-stack-based control framework to select which TCLs to control at any time. The control objective is for the aggregate power deviation from baseline to track an automatic generation control signal supplied by the system operator. Simulation studies suggest the practical promise of our methods.

Abstract: Simulations of production costs, flows, and prices are crucial inputs to generation and transmission planning studies. To calculate average system performance for many alternatives over long time periods, it is necessary to simulate large numbers of hourly combinations of renewable production and loads across large regions. As this is usually impractical for full network representations of such systems, aggregation of buses and lines is desirable. We propose an improved aggregation method for creating multi-area representations of power systems that yields more accurate estimates of the quantities required by planners. The method is based on partitioning the original large system into smaller areas and making a reduced equivalent for each area. The partitioning is based on available transfer capability (ATC) between each pair of network buses. Because ATC depends on net load conditions, separate partitions are defined for subsets of similar load and wind conditions, significantly enhancing the accuracy of optimal power flow solutions. We test the method on the IEEE 118-bus test system and the Polish 3120-bus system considering 150 load/wind scenarios, comparing the results to those of admittance-based partitioning methods. Accuracy is improved with only a negligible increase in simulation time.

Abstract: With increasingly large scale of intermittent and non-dispatchable resources being integrated into power systems, the power flow problem presents greater uncertainty. In order to obtain the upper and lower bounds of power flow solutions including voltage magnitudes, voltage angles and line flows, Cartesian coordinates-based power flow is utilized in this paper. A quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) model is then established to formulate the interval power flow problem. This non-convex QCQP model is relaxed to linear programming problem by introducing convex and concave enclosures of the original feasible region. To improve the solutions bounds while still encompassing the true interval solution, optimality-based bounds tightening (OBBT) method is employed to find a better outer hull of the feasible region. Numerical results on IEEE 9-bus, 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus test systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The recent deployment of distributed generation has led to a revolution in the use of distribution systems and the emergence of "smart grid" concepts. Smart grids are intended primarily as a means of facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources and of achieving greater system reliability and efficiency. Energy storage systems (ESSs) offer a number of benefits that can help utilities move toward those goals. One of those benefits is the capacity to improve the utilization of network infrastructure by means of proper load management. This paper proposes a methodology for allocating ESSs in distribution systems in order to defer system upgrades, minimize system losses, and take advantage of the arbitrage benefit. The cost and arbitrage benefit of energy storage installation are optimized with respect to system upgrade and energy losses costs. The primary goal of this research is to determine the optimal size and location of storage units to be installed, in addition to their optimal operation, so that total system costs are minimized, while system benefits are maximized. In this paper, a probabilistic load model is adopted instead of utilizing time-series based models, which provide an optimal solution that is valid only for the time-series pattern that is applied.

Abstract: A centralized reactive power compensation system is proposed for low voltage (LV) distribution networks. It can be connected with any bus which needs reactive power. The current industry practice is to locally install reactive power compensation system to maintain the local bus voltage and power factor. By centralizing capacitor banks together, it can help to maintain bus voltages and power factors as well as reduce the power cable losses. Besides, the centralized reactive power system can be easily expanded to meet any future load increase. A reasonably sized centralized reactive power compensation system will be capable of meeting the requirements of the network and the optimization algorithm proposed in this paper can help to find this optimal size by minimizing the expected total cost (ETCH). Different load situations and their respective probabilities are also considered in the proposed algorithm. The concept of the centralized reactive power compensation system is applied to a local shipyard power system to verify its effectiveness. The results show that an optimally sized centralized reactive power system exists and is capable of maintaining bus voltages as well as reducing the power losses in the distribution network. A significant power loss reduction can be obtained at the optimal capacity of the centralized reactive power compensation system in the case study.

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-based advanced distribution network management system (NMS) aimed at maximizing wind energy harvesting while simultaneously managing congestion and voltages. The NMS allows the adoption of multi-minute control cycles so the volume of actions from on-load tap changers (OLTCs) and distributed generation (DG) plants can be reduced while effectively catering for the effects of wind power uncertainties. This work presents the quantification of benefits and impacts from adopting different control cycles as well a comparison with a deterministic approach. The risk-based approach is implemented by adapting and expanding an AC optimal power flow. A risk level is used to determine the extent to which congestion and voltage rise could exist during a control cycle. The proposed NMS is applied to a real-life U.K. MV network from the North West of England to assess its effectiveness in managing high penetration of wind power considering minute-by-minute simulations for one week. The results show that the risk-based approach can effectively manage network constraints better than the deterministic approach, particularly for multi-minute control cycles, reducing also the number of control actions but at the expense of higher levels of curtailment.

Abstract: This letter presents a second-order cone formulation for AC power flow problem. The power flow equations are first derived as functions of more practical variables of power systems and then placed in a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. The proposed conic power flow (CPF) model can be solved efficiently through IPMs, and at the same time, it has a very good accuracy as compared to the full AC power flow model. Also, the proposed CPF can efficiently handle the ill-conditioned networks. The numerical efficiency and good accuracy of the model are shown by simulating various case studies.

Abstract: The medium-term generation planning over a yearly horizon for generation portfolios including hydro generation and non-dispatchable renewables such as wind power and solar photovoltaic generation reveals how the penetration of these technologies reduces the share of other technologies and how it changes the profits and the profit spread in liberalized electricity markets. The matching of the load duration curves in different periods and the forced outages of generation units are here addressed through probabilistic methods and a heuristic is employed to guess which of the load-matching constraints may be active at the solution. There are well-established models for hydro generation in medium-term planning, but specific models are necessary to account for wind power and photovoltaic generation. A proposal for these is made in this work, which is suitable for use in the load duration curve matching through probabilistic methods. Moreover the stochasticity of the renewable sources requires the use of stochastic programming employing scenario trees, here developed using quasi-Monte Carlo techniques. Medium-term pumping schemes are also considered. Several realistic cases will be solved for two behavioral principles of a pure pool market: endogenous cartel and equilibrium.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. We have recently shown that a convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming (SDP) is able to find a global solution of OPF for IEEE benchmark systems, and moreover this technique is guaranteed to work over acyclic (distribution) networks. The present work studies the potential of the SDP relaxation for OPF over mesh (transmission) networks. First, we consider a simple class of cyclic systems, namely weakly-cyclic networks with cycles of size 3. We show that the success of the SDP relaxation depends on how the line capacities are modeled mathematically. More precisely, the SDP relaxation is proven to succeed if the capacity of each line is modeled in terms of bus voltage difference, as opposed to line active power, apparent power or angle difference. This result elucidates the role of the problem formulation. Our second contribution is to relate the rank of theminimum-rank solution of the SDP relaxation to the network topology. The goal is to understand how the computational complexity of OPF is related to the underlying topology of the power network. To this end, an upper bound is derived on the rank of the SDP solution, which is expected to be small in practice. A penalization method is then applied to the SDP relaxation to enforce the rank of its solution to become 1, leading to a near-optimal solution for OPF with a guaranteed optimality degree. The remarkable performance of this technique is demonstrated on IEEE systems with more than 7000 different cost functions.

Abstract: This paper presents the impacts caused by the integration of variable speed wind turbines on long-term voltage stability. The technologies used are fully rated converter (FRC) and doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with two control strategies: grid-side converter (GSC) at unity power factor, which is usually adopted, and GSC controlling reactive power. Also, this paper considers wind turbines capability curves and its variable limits, since they are subject to several limitations that changes with the operating point and wind speed. This study also considers the dynamic models of over excitation limiter (OEL) and on-load tap changers (OLTC) combined with static and dynamic loads using time domain simulations. Different penetration levels of wind generation are analyzed. The results show that long-term voltage stability can be improved when GSC of DFIG is controlling reactive power. Moreover, the capability curve plays an important role in this analysis since reactive power is a key requirement to maintain voltage stability.

Abstract: This paper presents a damping control to mitigate sub-synchronous interactions (SSI) in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines connected to series-compensated lines. This issue has gained attention due to the recent SSI phenomena reported in DFIG wind farms located near series capacitors. Two approaches which add a supplementary damping control signal are compared: one of them, integrated to the grid-side converter, and the other one, to the rotor-side converter. The SSI damping controls are designed using a multi-input multi-output state-space methodology. This allows to easily tune a high performance controller using several measurements and control inputs. Small- and large-signal stability analyses, robustness aspects, impact of the supplementary controls on the system modes, and influence of different operating conditions on the SSI are also discussed. The obtained results show that the supplementary control is able to properly damp the sub-synchronous oscillations of DFIG wind turbines by updating the existing DFIG control systems without the inclusion of expensive additional damping devices, and reducing the risk of wind generation tripping.

Abstract: The expected impact of distributed generation (DG) into Smart Grid represents a great challenge of the future for power systems. In particular, the integration of DG based on renewable energy sources (RESs) in distribution networks, without compromising the integrity of the grid, requires the development of proper control techniques to allow power delivery to customers in compliance with power quality and reliability standards. This paper proposes a coordinated local control approach that allows distribution system operator (DSO) and independent power producers (IPPs) to obtain benefits offering the voltage regulation ancillary service to DSO and maximizing allowable active power production for each RES unit belonging to the same IPP. The control is based on a cooperation of data transfer between DSO and IPPs. In order to realize such cooperation, a nonlinear constrained optimization problem is formulated and solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. The validation of the proposed control technique has been conducted through several time series simulations on a real MV Italian distribution system.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to solve the unit commitment (UC) problem by solving a sequence of increasingly tight continuous relaxations based on the techniques of reformulation and lift-and-project (L&P). After projecting the power output of unit onto [0, 1], the continuous relaxation of the UC problem can be tightened with the reformulation techniques. Then, a tighter model which is called L&P-TMIP is established by strengthening the continuous relaxation of the feasible region of the tight UC problem iteratively using L&P. High-quality suboptimal solutions can be obtained from the solutions of the relaxation for this tight model. The simulation results for realistic instances that range in size from 10 to 200 units over a scheduling period of 24 h show that the proposed tight relaxation method is competitive with general-purpose mixed integer programming solvers based methods for large-scale UC problems due to the excellent performance and the good quality of the solutions it generates.

Abstract: The power grid is becoming more dependent on information and communication technologies. Complex networks of advanced sensors such as phasor measurement units (PMUs) are used to collect real time data to improve the observability of the power system. Recent studies have shown that the power grid has significant cyber vulnerabilities which could increase when PMUs are used extensively. Therefore, recognizing and responding to vulnerabilities are critical to the security of the power grid. This paper proposes a risk mitigation model for optimal response to cyber-attacks to PMU networks. We model the optimal response action as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to prevent propagation of the cyber-attacks and maintain the observability of the power system.

Abstract: With recent developments in the infrastructure of smart meters and smart grid, more electric power data is available and allows real-time easy data access. Modeling individual home appliance loads is important for tasks such as non-intrusive load disaggregation, load forecasting, and demand response support. Previous methods usually require sub-metering individual appliances in a home separately to determine the appliance models, which may not be practical, since we may only be able to observe aggregated real power signals for the entire-home through smart meters deployed in the field. In this paper, we propose a model, named Explicit-Duration Hidden Markov Model with differential observations (EDHMM-diff), for detecting and estimating individual home appliance loads from aggregated power signals collected by ordinary smart meters. Experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate that the EDHMM-diff model and the specialized forward-backward algorithm can effectively model major home appliance loads.

Abstract: Finding a global solution to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is difficult due to its nonconvexity. A convex relaxation in the form of semidefinite programming (SDP) has attracted much attention lately as it yields a global solution in several practical cases. However, it does not in all cases, and such cases have been documented in recent publications. This paper presents another SDP method known as the moment-sos (sum of squares) approach, which generates a sequence that converges towards a global solution to the OPF problem at the cost of higher runtime. Our finding is that in the small examples where the previously studied SDP method fails, this approach finds the global solution. The higher cost in runtime is due to an increase in the matrix size of the SDP problem, which can vary from one instance to another. Numerical experiment shows that the size is very often a quadratic function of the number of buses in the network, whereas it is a linear function of the number of buses in the case of the previously studied SDP method.

Abstract: FERC Order 755 requires each RTO/ISO to use market-based mechanisms to select and compensate frequency regulation resources based on a two-part payment methodology, i.e., a capacity payment to keep the capacity in reserve and a performance payment to reflect the amount of work each resource performs in real-time in response to the system operator's dispatch signal. This paper discusses how MISO enhanced its market rules to implement a market-based regulation performance payment. The market enhancement includes four key areas: quantifying the movement of regulation, modifications to the market clearing processes, performance accuracy measurement, and performance-based two-part regulation compensation.

Abstract: The power grid is a critical infrastructure that must be protected against potential threats. While modern technologies at the center of the ongoing smart grid evolution increase its operational efficiency, they also make it more susceptible to malicious attacks such as false data injection to electronic monitoring systems. This paper presents a game-theoretic approach to smart grid security by combining quantitative risk management techniques with decision making on protective measures. The consequences of data injection attacks are quantified using a risk assessment process where the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure provides an estimate of the defender's loss due to load shed in simulated scenarios. The calculated risks are then incorporated into a stochastic security game model as input parameters. The decisions on defensive measures are obtained by solving the game using dynamic programming techniques which take into account resource constraints. Thus, the formulated security game provides an analytical framework for choosing the best response strategies against attackers and minimizing potential risks. The theoretical results obtained are demonstrated through numerical examples. Simulation results show that different risk measures lead to different defense strategies, but the CVaR measure prioritizes high-loss tail events.

Abstract: In market operations, distributed generators (DGs) and price-sensitive loads participate in a microgrid energy market implemented in JADE. Each DG and each price-sensitive load is represented by the respective agents which perform various functions such as scheduling, coordination and market clearing subject to system, DG and load constraints. Each agent is assigned to one of the several agent objectives which maximizes either DG or load surpluses or both. In simulated operation of a microgrid, hourly power reference signals and load control signals from JADE are passed to DG and load models developed in MATLAB/Simulink using MACSimJX. Simulated operation of DGs and loads are studied by performing simulations under different agent objectives. Results from simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing multi-agent system (MAS) in the distributed management of microgrids.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a long-term planning model of transmission line expansion based on balancing investment cost and reducing consumer cost. We achieve this by formulating a hierarchical framework that is sensitive to different agents operating on different timelines, the relationships of which may be competitive, cooperative or somewhere in between. The advantage of this framework is that while it captures the complexity of long-term decision making, it maintains clarity of information flow between models, agents and timelines. For our purposes, we introduce an equilibrium model that combines grid operational concerns with the short-term competitive behavior of generation firms. An iterative solution technique is proposed to provide a Nash solution where each optimization problem is solved globally. This solution is then used to inform an overarching transmission planning model that we solve using derivative-free optimization. Using a de-congested network as a benchmark, numerical results indicate a non-alignment of the objectives of planning and operational entities, whereby easing line congestion may not offer monetary benefits to the wholesale consumer.

Abstract: The novel cascade-mitigation scheme developed in Part I of this paper is implemented within a receding-horizon model predictive control (MPC) scheme with a linear controller model. This present paper illustrates the MPC strategy with a case-study that is based on the IEEE RTS-96 network, though with energy storage and renewable generation added. It is shown that the MPC strategy alleviates temperature overloads on transmission lines by rescheduling generation, energy storage, and other network elements, while taking into account ramp-rate limits and network limitations. Resilient performance is achieved despite the use of a simplified linear controller model. The MPC scheme is compared against a base-case that seeks to emulate human operator behavior.

Abstract: As climate concerns, low natural gas prices, and renewable technologies increase the electric power sector's dependence on natural gas-fired power plants, operational and investment models for gas and electric power systems will need to incorporate the interdependencies between these two systems to accurately capture the impacts of one on the other. Currently, few hybrid gas-electricity models exist. This paper reviews the state of the art for hybrid gas-electricity models and presents a new model and case study to illustrate a few potential coupling effects between gas and electric power systems. Specifically, the proposed model analyzes the optimal operation of gas-fired power plants in a competitive electricity market taking into consideration gas purchases, gas capacity contracting, and residual demand uncertainty for the generation company due to renewable energy sources.

Abstract: Reserve requirements promote reliability by ensuring resources are available to rebalance the power system following random disturbances. However, reliability is not guaranteed when dispatch is limited by transmission constraints. In this work, we propose a modified form of reserve requirement that identifies response sets for distinct contingency scenarios. The approach disqualifies reserve from counting towards a particular scenario if transmission constraints are likely to render that reserve undeliverable. A decomposition algorithm for security-constrained unit commitment dynamically updates the response sets to address changing conditions. Testing on the RTS 96 test case demonstrates the approach applied in tandem with existing reserve policies to avoid situations where reserve is not deliverable due to transmission constraints. Operational implications of the proposed method are discussed.

Abstract: Interconnection wide electric transmission system has been envisioned to facilitate the growth of renewable energy, enhance reliability, improve system operating efficiency, and reduce emissions. In this paper, we propose an explicit planning approach for transmission design at the national level. It has been applied to the U.S. system to design transmission overlays for multiple future generation scenarios. Associated simulation results suggest that a national transmission overlay provides economic, environmental, and system performance benefits.

Abstract: This paper presented a combined scheduling and bidding algorithm for constructing the bidding curve of an electric utility that participated in the day-ahead energy markets. Day-aheadmarket price uncertainty was modeled using non-probabilistic information gap decision theory (IGDT). The considered utility consisted of generation units and a retailer part; the retailer part of the utility and its demand response program (DRP) could affect the utility's profit, which should be considered in the bidding strategy problem. The bidding strategy algorithm proposed in this paper dispatched units by optimizing the demand response programs of the retailer part. In addition, non-decreasing bidding curve was constructed according to the proposed IGDT-based method. Applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated using an illustrative example with 54 thermal units. Results were verified using after-the-fact actual market data.

Abstract: A study of small signal behavior of power systems including wind generation units and energy capacitor systems (ECSs) is presented in this paper. Modeling of wind units with squirrel-cage induction generators connected to power system through a full-scale AC/AC converter and ECS unit are explained thoroughly. The ECS unit (considered in this paper) consists of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) and DC/AC converter. Small signal behavior of three test systems are studied and compared with one another using digital computer simulations. The three systems are: S1) WSCC 9-bus system with three conventional synchronous generators (SGs), S2) the WSCC system with one of the conventional SGs replaced by a wind energy system, and S3) the same as S2) but with the addition of an ECS unit. The study includes comparing of dominant eigenvalues, the participant state variables, and the related participation factors for the three systems. In addition, the effects of loading on the unstable modes of the system with conventional SG, wind and ECS units (system S3) are studied using the trajectory of these modes as loads are increased.

Abstract: Security enhancement of distribution networks are constrained with multiple causes including limited availability of network resources and high penetration of intermittent distributed generation. In that context, this paper proposes a new methodology to enhance the security of power supply in a distribution network by strategically integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) micro grids based on the nodal criticality. The nodal criticality is assessed by integrating operational uncertainties of events into samples of Monte Carlo simulation and then classifying load interruptions on the basis of their magnitudes and frequencies. The load shedding due to criticality of system stress is classified into arrays of clusters on the basis of magnitudes of interrupted loads. The critical clusters that provide the largest disturbances to nodal loads are used as the reference capacities of PHEV micro grids to mitigate impacts. Case studies are performed by applying the methodology into a realistic model of a distribution network. Results depict that the proposed methodology can improve the system-wide security of supply. There are some nodes of which the security of supply can be improved significantly. The levels of improvement in security of supply of nodes are not consistent and some nodes can also receive marginal improvements.

Abstract: In development studies carried out on large power systems, a need may arise for a reduction in which whole regions are seen as the nodes of a simplified graph whose edges replace the inter-regional links. The property required from this kind of backbone representation may be that reduced load flows stay close to their physical counterpart on the full grid. In the dc approximation, such a model can consist of a set of impedances attached to each edge, along with a flow characterizing a particular state of the system. The identification of the model accommodating best a large sample of flows, representative of all of their possible diversity, is a nonconvex problem for which two partially convex reformulations are proposed. Simple ad hoc algorithms are introduced as a way to find approximate solutions satisfying first-order optimality conditions.

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of an adaptive power oscillation damping (POD) controller for a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) equipped with energy storage. This is achieved using a signal estimation technique based on a modified recursive least square (RLS) algorithm, which allows a fast, selective, and adaptive estimation of the low-frequency electromechanical oscillations from locally measured signals during power system disturbances. The proposed method is effective in increasing the damping of the system at the frequencies of interest, also in the case of system parameter uncertainties and at various connection points of the compensator. First, the analysis of the impact of active and reactive power injection into the power system will be carried out using a simple two-machine system model. A control strategy that optimizes active and reactive power injection at various connection points of the STATCOM will be derived using the simplified model. Small-signal analysis of the dynamic performance of the proposed control strategy will be carried out. The effectiveness of the proposed control method to provide power oscillation damping irrespective of the connection point of the device and in the presence of system parameter uncertainties will be verified through simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: As the amount of distributed generation (DG) is growing worldwide, the need to increase the hosting capacity of distribution systems without reinforcements is becoming nowadays a major concern. This paper explores how the DG hosting capacity of active distribution systems can be increased by means of network reconfiguration, both static, i.e., grid reconfiguration at planning stage, and dynamic, i.e., grid reconfiguration using remotely controlled switches as an active network management (ANM) scheme. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer, nonlinear, multi-period optimal power flow (MP-OPF) which aims to maximize the DG hosting capacity under thermal and voltage constraints. This work further proposes an algorithm to break-down the large problem size when many periods have to be considered. The effectiveness of the approach and the significant benefits obtained by static and dynamic reconfiguration options in terms of DG hosting capacity are demonstrated using a modified benchmark distribution system.

Abstract: A power transmission grid is exposed to numerous weather conditions. One of the critical hazards is icing on structural elements of the overhead high voltage lines. This paper shows the application of extreme value analysis aimed at determining wet snowfall and predicting the occurrence of extreme icing on power lines. We presented the modeling of icing on the basis of metrological measurements and compared them with direct icing measurements. The analysis of the icing size on a given territory can allow us to identify adequate measures to counteract vast power grid failures caused by extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Incentives to encourage the uptake of renewable energy generation have fostered wind energy in many power systems. These incentives usually take the form of market instruments (e.g., feed-in tariff or premium) that are not directly amenable to optimization representations of the market. In this paper, we propose an equilibrium model of the short-term market to address the impact of wind operation under different structural assumptions. The model is formulated for several price taking, risk averse firms in competition. It accounts for wind generation uncertainty and embeds a representation of the day ahead and balancing mechanisms. The consumer is modeled by a linear inverse demand function. We focus on feed-in premium as the incentive to wind as this is the instrument most favored today in European discussions. The model is formulated as a stochastic equilibrium problem where the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions from the optimization problem of each firm are simultaneously solved together with market clearing conditions on energy, capacity for reserve and energy for reserve. The problem for each firm consists of a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with a recourse function based on the conditional value at risk (CVaR(theta)) as a risk measure. Due to price taking assumptions the model is a single stage complementarity problem; it is implemented and solved using the software GAMS. An example based on a stylized simplification of the Spanish power market and motivated by the impact of wind penetration on the revenue of conventional plants is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

Abstract: In traditional power system, economic dispatch and generation control are separately applied. Online generation adjustment is necessary to regulate generation reference for real-time control to realize economic operation of power systems. Since most economic dispatch solutions are centralized, they are usually expensive to implement, susceptible to single-point-failures, and inflexible. To address the above-mentioned problems, this paper proposed a multi-agent system based distributed control solution that can realize optimal generation control. The solution is designed based upon an improved distributed gradient algorithm, which can address both equality and inequality constraints. To improve the reliability of multi-agent system, the N - 1 rule is introduced to design the communication network topology. Compared with centralized solutions, the distributed control solution not only can achieve comparable solutions but also can respond timely when the systemexperiences change of operating conditions. MAS based real-time simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Wind energy is going to be a significant part of electric energy generation in the very near future. However, in addition to its intermittent nature that could lead to major difficulties for power system reliability and stability, the conventional control applied to wind turbines and their generators, usually doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs), does not allow them to participate in frequency regulation, whether short or long term. Moreover, the use of wind generators for autonomous frequency regulation is becoming an essential objective in power grids with reduced inertia and isolatedmicrogrid operation. While droop-control is suggested by many researchers to solve these problems, detailed analysis of droop-controlled DFIG units in microgrids has not been reported. To fill-out this gap, this paper presents torque-and power-droop implementations in DFIG-based units by some simple modifications in the conventional control and then, bymeans of small-signal modeling and eigen-value studies, shows how both techniques influence frequency stability. Sensitivity studies, with respect to the presence of turbine-and inverter-based generators in microgrids; and impacts of pitch-angle controller, wind speed variation and isolated mode operation with only wind-generators, are conducted. Time-domain simulation is utilized to verify the analytical results.

Abstract: This letter investigates the situation that high use-of-system charge (UoSC) might appear for new network users and studies the potential of network investment to avoid the high charge. It proposes a method to strike the trade-off between UoSC and investment cost, in the form of connection charge (CC). It determines the utilization level where UoSC and CC reach equilibrium. Beyond this level, it is more economical to conduct network investment for new users to avoid high UoSC. The trade-off between the two type charges provides effective signals for new network users to manage their connecting size and location. The concept is illustrated on a two-busbar system.

Abstract: A novel model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed for mitigating the effects of severe line-overload disturbances in electrical power systems. A piece-wise linear convex approximation of line losses is employed to model the effect of transmission line power flow on conductor temperatures. Control is achieved through a receding-horizon model predictive control (MPC) strategy which alleviates line temperature overloads and thereby prevents the propagation of outages. The MPC strategy adjusts line flows by rescheduling generation, energy storage and controllable load, while taking into account ramp-rate limits and network limitations. In Part II of this paper, the MPC strategy is illustrated through simulation of the IEEE RTS-96 network, augmented to incorporate energy storage and renewable generation.

Abstract: The increasing uptake of electric vehicles suggests that vehicle charging will have a significant impact on the electricity grid. Finding ways to shift this charging to off-peak periods has been recognized as a key challenge for integration of electric vehicles into the electricity grid on a large scale. In this paper, electric vehicle charging is formulated as a receding horizon optimization problem that takes into account the present and anticipated constraints of the distribution network over a finite charging horizon. The constraint set includes transformer and line limitations, phase unbalance, and voltage stability within the network. By using a linear approximation of voltage drop within the network, the problem solution may be computed repeatedly in near real time, and thereby take into account the dynamic nature of changing demand and vehicle arrival and departure. It is shown that this linear approximation of the network constraints is quick to compute, while still ensuring that network constraints are respected. The approach is demonstrated on a validated model of a real network via simulations that use real vehicle travel profiles and real demand data. Using the optimal charging method, high percentages of vehicle uptake can be sustained in existing networks without requiring any further network upgrades, leading to more efficient use of existing assets and savings for the consumer.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources are here to stay for a number of important reasons, including global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels. We explore in this paper how a thermal-dominated electric energy system can be transformed into a renewable-dominated one. This study relies on a stochastic programming model that allows representing the uncertain parameters plaguing such long-term planning exercise. Being the final year of our analysis 2050, we represent the transition from today to 2050 by allowing investment in both production and transmission facilities, with the target of achieving a renewable-dominated minimum-cost system. The methodology developed is illustrated using a realistic large-scale case study. Finally, policy conclusions are drawn.

Abstract: To handle significant variability in loads, renewable energy generation, as well as various contingencies, (two-stage) robust optimization method has been adopted to construct unit commitment models and to ensure reliable solutions. In this paper, we further explore and extend the modeling capacity of two-stage robust optimization and present two new robust unit commitment variants: the expanded robust unit commitment and the risk constrained robust unit commitment model. We derive structural properties, demonstrate the connection to the popular scenario based stochastic unit commitment models, and present a customized column-and-constraint generation method. Numerical experiments on those models are performed using practical data sets, which illustrate their modeling strength, economic outcomes, and the algorithm performance in solving those models.

Abstract: This paper discusses how fast-response distributed battery energy storage could be used to implement post-contingency corrective control actions. Immediately after a contingency, the injections of distributed batteries could be adjusted to alleviate overloads and reduce flows below their short-term emergency rating. This ensures that the post-contingency system remains stable until the operator has redispatched the generation. Implementing this form of corrective control would allow operators to take advantage of the difference between the short-and long-term ratings of the lines and would therefore increase the available transmission capacity. This problem is formulated as a two-stage, enhanced security-constrained OPF problem, in which the first-stage optimizes the pre-contingency generation dispatch, while the second-stage minimizes the corrective actions for each contingency. Case studies based on a six-bus test system and on the RTS 96 demonstrate that the proposed method provides effective corrective actions and can guarantee operational reliability and economy.

Abstract: Common information model (CIM) in vogue represents transmission and distribution components, and market operations in the perspective of electrical system, as unified modeling language (UML) objects. UML is object centric. CIM can offer interoperability and facilitate model exchange for large systems and is being adopted by many utilities. However, dealing effectively with multiple business processes is the backbone of the restructured power systems. Since CIM lacks chronological process sense, this has to be superimposed on CIM models, which is not easy due to inherent limitations of UML. To overcome this, this paper proposes to utilize business process modeling notation (BPMN) standards as a kind of pre-processor. BPMN is used to represent process centric interoperability requirements as business objects. UML object representation in CIM model is derived subsequently from it. The proposal is illustrated with an application use case-deriving CIM model of day-ahead market (DAM) transaction of distribution company, from its business process representation. Semantic model of DAM transaction using CIM IEC 62325 (Markets) and extensions required are presented with a sample Indian system. DAM models in BPMN and CIM can be utilized to build an efficient software application.

Abstract: When the modern electrical infrastructure is undergoing a migration to the Smart Grid, vulnerability and security concerns have also been raised regarding the cascading failure threats in this interconnected transmission system with complex communication and control challenge. The DC power flow-based model has been a popular model to study the cascading failure problem due to its efficiency, simplicity and scalability in simulations of such failures. However, due to the complex nature of the power system and cascading failures, the underlying assumptions in DC power flow-based cascading failure simulators (CFS) may fail to hold during the development of cascading failures. This paper compares the validity of a typical DC power flow-based CFS in cascading failure analysis with a new numerical metric defined as the critical moment (CM). The adopted CFS is first implemented to simulate system behavior after initial contingencies and to evaluate the utility of DC-CFS in cascading failure analysis. Then the DC-CFS is compared against another classic, more precise power system stability methodology, i.e., the transient stability analysis (TSA). The CM is introduced with a case study to assess the utilization of these two models for cascading failure analysis. Comparative simulations on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus benchmark reveal important consistency and discrepancy between these two approaches. Some suggestions are provided for using these two models in the power grid cascading failure analysis.

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) problem minimizes the power loss in an electrical network by optimizing the voltage and power delivered at the network buses, and is a nonconvex problem that is generally hard to solve. By leveraging a recent development on the zero duality gap of OPF, we propose a second-order cone programming convex relaxation of the resistive network OPF, and study the uniqueness of the optimal solution using differential topology, especially the Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem. We characterize the global uniqueness for different network topologies, e.g., line, radial, and mesh networks. This serves as a starting point to design distributed local algorithms with global behaviors that have low complexity, are computationally fast, and can run under synchronous and asynchronous settings in practical power grids.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation tool for demand-side management of domestic hot water systems in distribution systems. The tool accurately models and predicts potential peak demand reductions through direct load control of domestic hot water systems. It employs a unique multi-layer thermally stratified hot water cylinder model and Monte Carlo simulations to generate hot water load profiles of domestic customers. To meet peak reduction targets set by the tool user, switching programs found via iterative optimizations are applied to hot water systems. The structure and individual components of the tool are described, and case studies are presented. Impacts of different switching programs on customer's comfort are evaluated and discussed.

Abstract: This paper develops a self-coherence method for detecting sustained oscillations using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Sustained oscillations decrease system performance and introduce potential reliability issues. Timely detection of the oscillations at an early stage provides the opportunity for taking remedial reaction. Using high-speed time-synchronized PMU data, this paper details a self-coherence method for detecting sustained oscillation, even when the oscillation amplitude is lower than ambient noise. Simulation and field measurement data are used to evaluate the proposed method's performance. It is shown that the proposed method can detect sustained oscillations and estimate oscillation frequencies with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Comparison with a power spectral density method also shows that the proposed self-coherence method performs better.

Abstract: This paper presents an application of multiple linear regression (MLR) to extract significant correlations between damping of electromechanical modes and system operating conditions and to forecast future damping values, based on existing day-ahead market forecasts for power flows and generation. The presented analysis uses measurements from the Nordic power system. First, a static MLR model is developed to explain the variability of the damping of the 0.35-Hz inter-area mode in the Nordic system. Together with the static model, a dynamic MLR model is used for forecasting the damping 24 hours ahead, using day-ahead market forecasts. Test results indicate the proposed methods are able to correctly predict about 90% of the low damped operating conditions observed during a year, if day-ahead market forecasts are accurate. These results suggest that the methods could be used to issue early warnings about future operating conditions with low damping.

Abstract: Many countries are planning for a large-scale expansion of wind power. This development will have a significant impact on power system operation and economics. One of the challenges is that the difficulty to forecast wind power generation will increase the need for real-time balancing. This paper presents a study of how the impact of wind power forecast errors can be reduced by changes in the market design. The study is based on the conditions in the Nordic electricity market. A characteristic of this market is that there is a large share of flexible hydro generation; hence, ramp and unit commitment constraints rarely constrain dispatch. The need for regulation during real-time is provided in a voluntary real-time balancing market, where players can be compensated for their redispatch costs. Case studies are presented which show that a shift from day-ahead to intraday trading and increased demand response can improve the performance when the share of wind power is increasing.

Abstract: Long-term transmission and generation planning face numerous challenges to accommodate the integration of a high penetration of variable generation (VG). System flexibility, or the ability of a system to meet changes in demand and VG production, is one such issue receiving much attention. This paper presents a methodology to assess the flexibility of a power system while explicitly considering the limitations of the transmission network. By determining only the flexibility available from resources which could be realized in real-time operation due to transmission constraints, a more realistic assessment of a system's flexibility can be made. The flexibility of the IEEE Reliability Test System is assessed using two metrics. Transmission is shown to have a significant effect on the availability of flexibility and the risk posed to the system by net load ramps. The impact is seen to be strongly dependent on the variability of the net load and on the distribution of online resources. A nonlinear relationship between the installed VG and system flexibility is found, with regions of significant inflexibility occurring at certain VG penetrations.

Abstract: IEC 61850 and IEC 61970-301 (CIM) are core standards in the electrical power domain. IEC 61850 is concerned with control and protection in a substation, while CIM addresses power management. There has been a great attention to unifying these standards to support interoperability in smart grids. However, due to their difference natures and independent evolution, the unification of IEC 61850 and CIM has been a great challenge. A prerequisite to their unification is unifying data types. In this paper, we present an approach for unifying data types of IEC 61850 and CIM. In the approach, the semantics of all the data types in the standards are analyzed to identify matching and non-matching types. Based on the analysis, data types are unified by applying a set of unification principles. We demonstrate tool support for transforming IEC 61850 and CIM data types to unified data types using Query/View/Transformation (QVT).

Abstract: Due to the uneven geographical distribution between load and wind power, currently it is difficult to integrate the large-scale wind power into the State Grid in China. There are significant wind curtailments for wind farms due to system restrictions. This paper proposes a new way of utilizing wind power, i.e., in-situ consumption, as an alternative to the costly development of long-distance transmission of large-scale wind power. Electrolytic aluminum load, which is one of the most typical high energy consuming loads, is employed to absorb the excess wind power in western China. An actual isolated industrial power system for aluminum production driven by wind power and coal-fired power is described. The penetration level of wind power in the isolated power system is up to 48.8%. The power imbalance between generation and load demand caused by wind power fluctuation or the tripping of coal-fired generators can dramatically impact the frequency stability of the isolated power system, which is of small inertia. An online identification method of power imbalance based on Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) is presented. According to the characteristics of the electrolytic aluminum load, a system frequency control method by regulating the bus voltages of aluminum loads to eliminate the power imbalance is introduced. The simulation is done in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the results verify the validity of the proposed frequency control method.

Abstract: In this paper, a small signal model has been developed for a grid connected photovoltaic (PV)-diesel engine (DE) system feeding also to an induction motor at the low voltage level. The comprehensive mathematical model of the system has been developed by linearizing the system of equations around an operating point. To analyze the stability of the system, the eigen values and thus the modes of the system have been obtained from the resultant analytical A matrix. Further, to validate this small signal model, a complete nonlinear time-domain analysis of the system has been carried out. In order to enhance the stability of the system, a supplementary controller in the PV control loop has been proposed and its results have been verified both from the eigen values and from the nonlinear analysis.

Abstract: Natural gas pipeline congestion will impact on the fuel adequacy of several natural gas fired generating units at the same time. This letter focuses on the development of a robust optimization methodology for the scheduling of quick start units when considering natural gas resource availability constraints. Natural gas transmission will be approximated by linear constraints, and the linepack capacity of pipelines will be considered in the proposed model. Case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms.

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic model of a variable speed heat pump (VSHP) in a commercial building that responds to direct load control (DLC) signals, updated every 4 s, for the improvement of grid frequency regulation (GFR). The model is simplified for real-time simulation studies with the time horizon ranging from seconds to hours, but still sufficiently comprehensive to analyze the operational characteristics such as the heat rate and coefficient of performance. A variable speed drive-controlled induction motor model is also established for the adjustment of the VSHP input power. A dynamic model of an experimental room is then developed to estimate the effect of the DLC application to the VSHP on its indoor air temperature for two different cooling systems. Furthermore, small signal analysis is performed to evaluate both the transient response of the DLC-enabled VSHP and its contribution to GFR. Finally, with an isolated microgrid implemented with MATLAB/SIMULINK, simulation studies demonstrate that the VSHP can be effectively exploited as the DLC-enabled load while still ensuring building occupant comfort and long-term device performance.
