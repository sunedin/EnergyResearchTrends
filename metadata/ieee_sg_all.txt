Abstract: In this paper, proper scheduling of the operation of multiple storage devices is sought so as to minimize the expected total cost (of conventional generation) in a power network with intermittent renewable generation. Since the power network constraints make it intractable to compute optimal storage operation policies through dynamic programming-based approaches, a Lyapunov optimization-based online algorithm (LOPN) is proposed, which makes decisions based only on the current state of the system (i.e., the current demand and renewable generation). The proposed algorithm is computationally simple and achieves asymptotic optimality (as the capacity of energy storage grows large). To improve the performance of the LOPN algorithm for the case with limited storage capacity, a threshold-based energy storage management (TESM) algorithm is proposed that utilizes the forecast information (on demand and renewable generation) over the next few time slots to make storage operation decisions. Numerical experiments are conducted on IEEE 6- and 9-bus test systems to validate the asymptotic optimality of LOPN, and compare the performance of LOPN and TESM. Numerical results show that TESM significantly outperforms LOPN when the storage capacity is relatively small.

Abstract: A major challenge to implementing residential demand response is that of aligning the objectives of many households, each of which aims to minimize its payments and maximize its comfort level, while balancing this with the objectives of an aggregator that aims to minimize the cost of electricity purchased in a pooled wholesale market. This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of households with a mixture of discrete and continuous energy levels. A distinctive feature of the method in this paper is that the non-convex demand response (DR) problem is decomposed in terms of households as opposed to devices, which allows incorporating more intricate couplings between energy storage devices, appliances, and distributed energy resources. The proposed method is a fast distributed algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The method is tested on systems with up to 2560 households, each with 10 devices on average. The proposed algorithm is designed to terminate in 60 iterations irrespective of system size, which can be ideal for an on-line version of this problem. Moreover, numerical results show that with minimal parameter tuning, the algorithm exhibits a very similar convergence behavior throughout the studied systems and converges to near-optimal solutions, which corroborates its scalability.

Abstract: This paper gives a comprehensive discussion on applying the cloud computing technology as the new information infrastructure for the next-generation power system. First, this paper analyzes the main requirements of the future power grid on the information infrastructure and the limitations of the current information infrastructure. Based on this, a layered cloud-based information infrastructure model for next-generation power grid is proposed. Thus, this paper discussed how different categories of the power applications can benefit from the cloud-based information infrastructure. For the demonstration purpose, this paper develops three specific cloud-enabled power applications. The first two applications demonstrate how to develop practical compute-intensive and data-intensive power applications by utilizing different layered services provided by the state-of-the-art public cloud computing platforms. In the third application, we propose a cloud-based collaborative direct load control framework in a smart grid and show the merits of the cloud-based information infrastructure on it. Some cybersecurity considerations and the challenges and limitations of the cloud-based information infrastructure are also discussed.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for contingency management using smart loads, which are realized through the emerging paradigm of the Internet of things. The framework involves the system operator, the load serving entities (LSEs), and the end-users with smart home management systems that automatically control adjustable loads. The system operator uses an efficient linear equation solver to quickly calculate the load curtailment needed at each bus to relieve congested lines after a contingency. Given this curtailment request, an LSE calculates a power allowance for each of its end-use customers to maximize the aggregate user utility. This large-scale NP-hard problem is approximated to a convex optimization for efficient computation. A smart home management system determines the appliances allowed to be used in order to maximize the user's utility within the power allowance given by the LSE. Since the user's utility depends on the near-future usage of the appliances, the framework provides the Welch-based reactive appliance prediction (WRAP) algorithm to predict the user behavior and maximize utility. The proposed framework is validated using the New England 39-bus test system. The results show that power system components at risk can be quickly alleviated by adjusting a large number of small smart loads. Additionally, WRAP accurately predicts the users' future behavior, minimizing the impact on the aggregate users' utility.

Abstract: Many critical infrastructures are interdependent networks in which the behavior of one network impacts those of the others. Despite the fact that interdependencies are essential for the operation of critical infrastructures, such interdependencies can negatively affect the reliability and fuel the cascade of failures within and across the networks. In this paper, a novel interdependent Markov-chain framework is proposed that enables capturing interdependencies between two critical infrastructures with the ultimate goal of predicting their resilience to cascading failures and characterizing the effects of interdependencies on system reliability. The framework is sufficiently general to model cascading failures in any interdependent networks; however, this paper focuses on the electric-cyber infrastructure as an example. Using this framework it is shown that interdependencies among reliable systems, i.e., systems with exponentially distributed failure sizes, can make the individually reliable systems behave unreliably as a whole with power-law failure-size distributions.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) can be considered as flexible mobile battery storages in microgrids. For multiple microgrids in an area, coordinated scheduling on charging and discharging are required to avoid power exchange spikes between the multi-microgrid system and the main grid. In this paper, a two-stage integrated energy exchange scheduling strategy for multimicrogrid system is presented, which considers EVs as storage devices. Then, several dual variables, which are representative of the marginal cost of proper constraints, are utilized to form an updated price, thereby being a modification on the original electricity price. With this updated price signal, a price-based decentralized scheduling strategy is presented for the microgrid central controller. Simulation results show that the two-stage scheduling strategy reduces the electricity cost and avoids frequent transitions between battery charging/discharging states. With the proposed decentralized scheduling strategy, each microgrid only needs to solve its local problem and limits the total power exchange within the safe range.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transport and heating will introduce uncertain smart appliance growth in the power system, which fundamentally challenges traditional network pricing. In this paper, a new long-term distribution network charging is proposed to accommodate uncertain load growth. Instead of using fixed a load growth rate (LGR), it adopts a fuzzy model, developed based on a set of projected deterministic LGRs and confidence levels. This fuzzy model is incorporated into the pricing model through a-cut intervals. In order to improve computational efficiency, an analytical pricing approach is introduced. The vertex extension approach is used to build charge membership functions. Thereafter, a common defuzzification approach, center of gravity, is employed to defuzzify membership functions in order to generate deterministic charges. The new approach is benchmarked with two existing standard charging methods on a practical U.K. high-voltage distribution system. Results show that it is effective in capturing the uncertainty in load growth.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problems of load scheduling and power trading in systems with high penetration of renewable energy resources (RERs). We adopt approximate dynamic programming to schedule the operation of different types of appliances including must-run and controllable appliances. We assume that users can sell their excess power generation to other users or to the utility company. Since it is more profitable for users to trade energy with other users locally, users with excess generation compete with each other to sell their respective extra power to their neighbors. A game theoretic approach is adopted to model the interaction between users with excess generation. In our system model, each user aims to obtain a larger share of the market and to maximize its revenue by appropriately selecting its offered price and generation. In addition to yielding a higher revenue, consuming the excess generation locally reduces the reverse power flow, which impacts the stability of the system. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the energy expenses of the users. The proposed algorithm also facilitates the utilization of RERs by encouraging users to consume excess generation locally rather than injecting it back into the power grid.

Abstract: A parametric controller is proposed for transient stability of synchronous generators after the occurrence of a disturbance in the power grid. The proposed controller based on feedback linearization control theory relies on receiving timely phasor measurement unit (PMU) information from selected parts of the power grid to employ fast acting flywheels that are situated near synchronous generators. The local storage devices aim to balance a swing equation model of the synchronous generator to drive the associated rotor speed to stability. The advantages of the proposed controller include that it is tunable and integrates well with existing governor controls in contrast to other forms of PMU-based control. Further, a comparison is drawn between the proposed controller and recently proposed nonlinear controllers for transient stabilization. Numerical results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller when applied to the 39-bus 10-generator New England power system.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the impact of cyber attacks on voltage regulation in distribution systems when a number of photovoltaic (PV) systems are connected. We employ a centralized control scheme that utilizes voltage measurements from sectionizing switches equipped with sensors. It is demonstrated that if measurements are falsified by an attacker, voltage violation can occur in the system. However, by equipping the control with a detection algorithm, we verify that the damage can be limited especially when the number of attacked sensors is small through theoretical analysis and simulation case studies. In addition, studies are made on attacks which attempt to reduce the output power at PV systems equipped with overvoltage protection functions. Further discussion is provided on how to enhance the security level of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Monitoring critical infrastructures is highly dependent on the accuracy of the installed sensors and the robustness of estimation algorithms. Data-injection attacks can degrade the operational reliability and security of any cyber-physical infrastructures. An attacker can compromise the integrity of the monitoring algorithms by hijacking a subset of sensor measurements and sending manipulated readings. Such approach can result in wide-area blackouts in power grids. This paper considers several cases of severe data-injections with high probabilities of information loss. To achieve an accurate supervision, a Bayesian-based approximated filter (BAF) has been proposed at each monitoring node using a distributed architecture. To maintain a reduced communication overhead and time complexity, upper and lower bound methods have been developed. The performance of the proposed technique has been demonstrated in a mature synchrophasor application known as the oscillation detection. Two test cases have been generated to examine the immunity of the proposed estimation scheme in New Zealand and Oman power grids. The tests were conducted in the presence of harsh data-injection attacks and multiple system disturbances. Results show the proposed BAF method can accurately extract the oscillatory parameters from the contaminated measurements.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a suite of asynchronous distributed optimization algorithms for wide-area oscillation estimation in power systems using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). We first pose the estimation problem as a real-time, iterative, and distributed consensus problem. Thereafter, we consider a probabilistic traffic model for modeling delays in any typical wide-area communication network, and study how the delays enter the process of information exchange between distributed phasor data concentrators that are employed to execute this consensus algorithm in a coordinated fashion. Finally, we propose four different strategies by which the convergence rate and accuracy of this consensus algorithm can be made immune to the asynchrony resulting from the network traffic. We carry out extensive simulations to show possible numerical instabilities and sensitivities of the ADMM convergence on our proposed strategies. Our results exhibit a broad view of how the convergence of any distributed estimation algorithm in a generic cyber-physical system depends strongly on the uncertainties of the underlying communication models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of algorithms to determine the active- and reactive-power setpoints for photovoltaic (PV) inverters in distribution networks. The objective is to optimize the operation of the distribution feeder according to a variety of performance objectives and ensure voltage regulation. In general, these algorithms take a form of the widely studied ac optimal power flow (OPF) problem. For the envisioned application domain, nonlinear power-flow constraints render pertinent OPF problems nonconvex and computationally intensive for large systems. To address these concerns, we formulate a quadratic constrained quadratic program (QCQP) by leveraging a linear approximation of the algebraic power-flow equations. Furthermore, simplification from QCQP to a linearly constrained quadratic program is provided under certain conditions. The merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated with simulation results that utilize realistic PV-generation and load-profile data for illustrative distribution-system test feeders.

Abstract: This paper focuses on developing an interdisciplinary mechanism that combines machine learning, optimization, and data structure design to build a demand response and home energy management system that can meet the needs of real-life conditions. The loads of major home appliances are divided into three categories: 1) containing fixed loads; 2) regulate-able loads; and 3) deferrable loads, based on which a decoupled demand response mechanism is proposed for optimal energy management of the three categories of loads. A learning-based demand response strategy is developed for regulateable loads with a special focus on home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVACs). This paper presents how a learning system should be designed to learn the energy consumption model of HVACs, how to integrate the learning mechanism with optimization techniques to generate optimal demand response policies, and how a data structure should be designed to store and capture current home appliance behaviors properly. This paper investigates how the integrative and learning-based home energy management system behaves in a demand response framework. Case studies are conducted through an integrative simulation approach that combines a home energy simulator and MATLAB together for demand response evaluation.

Abstract: This paper studies frequency regulation of power systems by using both automatic generation control (AGC) and load-side control. A switched distributed controller is designed for each load bus in a transmission network. The targets of the designed controller are twofold. First, it makes controllable loads work together with generators to restore the system frequency quickly after a real power mismatch occurs in the grid. Second, it restores controllable loads to their nominal working conditions. To achieve the first target, a consensus-based distributed load-side controller is designed. Peer-to-peer communication between loads is used to achieve an average consensus according to which controllable load reacts to the frequency deviation. To achieve the second target, the load-side controller shifts its duties to AGC slowly after the frequency goes back into an ideal region, and hence, controllable loads will restore to their nominal conditions gradually. A switching signal is designed to detect time instants when the load-side controller should work in the mode of frequency restoration or in the mode of load restoration.

Abstract: Domestic energy usage patterns can be reduced to a series of classifications for power system analysis or operational purposes, generalizing household behavior into particular load profiles without noise induced variability. However, with AMI data transmissions over wireless networks becoming more commonplace data losses can inhibit classification negating the benefits to the operation of the power system as a whole. Here, an approach allowing incomplete load profiles to be classified while maintaining less than a 10% classification error with up to 20% of the data missing is presented.

Abstract: Distributed generation is increasingly being integrated into distribution networks worldwide, presenting new challenges for network operators and planners. In particular, the introduction of photovoltaic (PV) generation at the low voltage (LV) level has highlighted the ongoing need for more extensive and detailed modeling to quantify the full extent and nature of potential impacts. While a number of approaches have been developed to address the size of this problem, the most accurate and comprehensive approach is to carry out simulations for the entire network across multiple scenarios. However, this task is computationally complex and requires significant amounts of data. To address this challenge, this paper presents a simplified and computationally efficient methodology based around a two-bus equivalent model, which may be used to estimate the maximum voltage in an LV area due to PV generation over time. The developed model is validated against a full three-phase power flow approach for a real-world distribution network comprising 10 213 LV network areas. Furthermore, to highlight its utility, the model is used in a case study examining the effectiveness of reactive power injection for mitigating overvoltage due to PV generation.

Abstract: This paper studies the physical consequences of a class of unobservable state-and-topology cyber-physical attacks in which both state and topology data for a sub-network of the network are changed by an attacker to mask a physical attack. The problem is formulated as a two-stage optimization problem, which aims to cause overload in a line of the network with limited attack resources. It is shown that unobservable state-and-topology cyber-physical attacks as studied in this paper can make the system operation more vulnerable to line outages and failures.

Abstract: Based on the current practice of charging peak demand, an expectation-oriented stochastic model is established for the demand contracting decision of electricity users. The resultant optimization problem is proved to be nonlinear but convex. Thus, the first-order optimality condition of the proposed model, which leads to an integral equation founded on the probability density function of the peak load, is used to derive the optimal contracting strategy for consumers. Simulation results support the convexity of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the proposed solution method under different demand charging rules and different consumption patterns of customers.

Abstract: Severe peak rebounds are likely in absence of a system-wide coordination among customers participating in demand response programs. This paper aims to establish a decentralized system-wide framework to coordinate demand response of residential customers in a smart grid. The objective of the framework is to modify system load profile provided that customers' payments are minimized, and their comfort and privacy are preserved. Home load management (HLM) modules, embedded in customers' smart meters are autonomous agents of the framework. The energy service provider iteratively exchanges load information with HLM modules in the hope of achieving his desired load profile. In each iteration, the service provider announces system load profile to HLM modules. The modules, keeping in mind their own financial and comfort constraints, nonsequentially send back load reschedule proposals to modify system load profile. The received proposals are judged whether they improve system load profile or not. HLM modules with accepted proposals apply their proposed schedules. The modified system load profile is then released, and HLM modules' new proposals are gathered and judged. This procedure is repeated to the point at which no further improvement in the system load profile can be experienced. Performance of the framework is shown by applying it to a system with 50 customers.

Abstract: The assessment of voltage stability margins is a promising direction for wide-area monitoring systems. Accurate monitoring architectures for long-term voltage instability are typically centralized and lack scalability, while completely decentralized approaches relying on local measurements tend toward inaccuracy. Here we present distributed linear algorithms for the online computation of voltage collapse sensitivity indices. The computations are collectively performed by processors embedded at each bus in the smart grid, using synchronized phasor measurements and communication of voltage phasors between neighboring buses. Our algorithms provably converge to the proper index values as would be calculated using centralized information, but do not require any central decision maker for coordination. Modifications of the algorithms to account for generator reactive power limits are discussed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our designs with a case study of the New England 39 bus system.

Abstract: Transient stability controller design based on an optimality principle is an emerging approach for resolving high order contingencies that can otherwise lead to rotor angle instability. It is difficult to design for high order contingencies due to their complexity. A challenging issue is the nonlinearity of the system, which limits the selection approaches available and results in a potentially large search space to find a suitable control action. Because rotor angle instability evolves rapidly, a fast control response is required. This paper develops a cost-based controller under the constraint of bounded computation. A method to downsize the admissible control search space is developed in a manner that retains controls most likely to provide the best cost. Subsequently, a further reduction in computation is designed through model elimination. A set of common cost metrics is applied for all controllers. Tradeoffs between the model-based and model-free approaches are demonstrated. The effect of computational constraints on the competing goals of control cost and control timeliness for complex contingencies is tested with the New England 39-bus system.

Abstract: Restorative self-healing is one of the most important features of smart grids. The major purpose of a restorative self-healing control strategy is to steer a power system to secure operating states. In this paper, a self-healing transmission network reconfiguration algorithm based on the complex network theory is proposed. The capacities of generators and the amounts of important loads (i.e., the high priority loads), as well as the distribution and importance of each transmission line in the outage area are considered in the proposed method using the presented electrical "betweenness." Next, the optimal restoration paths and the optimal restorative self-healing strategy can be attained automatically. Finally, the New England 10-unit 39-bus system and a part of the actual Guangdong power system in China are employed to illustrate the features of the proposed method.

Abstract: In order to support various innovative demand response programs, smart grid needs a wireless communication network with quality-of-service (QoS) support. This paper studies the issue of providing QoS in terms of packet delay, packet error probability, and outage probability to a large number of sensors and smart meters in a neighborhood area network of a densely populated urban area. We assume the network is based on the IEEE 802.15.4g Standard. Given that bandwidth is limited, we propose to divide smart meters into groups and each group will take a turn to access a shared wireless channel in a time-division-multiplexing manner. Within each allocated time duration, a group of smart meters will compete for channel access using a simple slotted Aloha protocol. We have developed an analytical model to quantify the QoS metrics. Through the analytical model, we can determine the minimum concentrator density that is required to support a given smart meter density. We have verified the analytical model through simulations. The results show that we need less than ten concentrators per km(2) to support a node density of 500 units per km(2), while making sure that packet delay does not exceed 1.0 s, packet error probability is below 0.005 and outage probability is lower than 0.01.

Abstract: Power system topology control through transmission line switching for economic gains and reliability benefits has been recently considered in day to day operations. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation for a more efficient application of topology control strategies in real world scenarios with anticipated increase in the presence of highly variable renewable generation and uncertain loads. Such uncertainties are modeled via the point estimation method embedded into the dc optimal power flow-based formulations for optimal switching solutions. Hourly and daily advantages of the proposed probabilistic framework, compared with the conventional operations and deterministic formulations, are discussed. As the anticipated economic gains would increase through sequential implementation of several switching actions, a new probabilistic decision making approach to identify the optimal number of switching actions at each hour is also proposed. This decision support tool uses the probabilistic reliability cost/value analytics in which not only the financial benefits, but also the costs of reliability risks, are taken into account. The approach is tested through various scenarios on the modified IEEE 118-bus test system, with and without renewables integration, and the results revealed its applicability and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper develops a droop-based distributed cooperative control scheme for microgrids under a switching communication network with non-uniform time-varying delays. We first design a pinning-based frequency/voltage controller containing a distributed voltage observer and then design a consensus-based active/reactive power controller, which are employed into the secondary control stage to generate the nominal set points used in the primary control stage for different distributed generators (DGs). By this approach, the frequencies and the weighted average value of all DGs' voltages can be pinned to the desired values while maintaining the precise active and reactive power sharing. With the proposed scheme, each DG only needs to communicate with its neighbors intermittently, even if their communication networks are local and time-varying, and their variant delays may be non-uniform. Sufficient conditions on the requirements for the network connectivity and the delay upper bound that guarantee the stability and reliability of the microgrid are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by the simulation of a microgrid test system.

Abstract: In the past two decades the frequent occurrences of large scale blackouts and catastrophic events has reduced the reliability of power grid to a great extent. A thorough analysis of the propagation of failures, in terms of line outages, combined with the topological characteristics of the grid aids, has been done to take corrective actions to save the system from complete collapse. It also helps to investigate the progress and understand the nature and intensity of blackouts. This motivates to establish the relationship between the network topological characteristics and cascading failure in the power grid. In this paper, the basic topological characteristics of the power network are studied in detail and the average propagation of failure under varying topological conditions is calculated as a branching process parameter. The variation in the mean propagation is studied in detail using a number of test bed networks with the alternate realistic networks derived from the standard IEEE networks imitating the real network conditions. The results confirm a qualitative agreement between the variations in topological parameter and the failure propagation rate in the cascading regime. Based on the analysis mentioned above, data clearly shows that the average failure propagation factor varies linearly with the variations in the statistical metrics.

Abstract: Data injection attacks have emerged as a significant threat on the smart power grid. By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can manipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic benefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such works assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or defense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with multiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study the interactions between the defender and the attackers, two game models are considered. In the first, a Stackelberg game is proposed in which the defender acts as a leader that can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers, before deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties of the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the equilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited system information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In the second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot anticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, a hybrid satisfaction equilibrium-Nash equilibrium game is proposed. To find the equilibrium of this hybrid game, a search-based algorithm is introduced. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to illustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and defender. The results show that by defending a very small set of measurements, the grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks have no effect on the system. Moreover, the results also show how, at equilibrium, multiple attackers can play a destructive role toward each other by choosing to carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected. In addition, the obtained equilibrium strategies under the Stackelberg and the hybrid models are compared while characterizing the amount of loss that the defender endures due to its inability to anticipate the attackers' actions.

Abstract: Multiple attacker data-injection attack construction in electricity grids with minimum-mean-square-error state estimation is studied for centralized and decentralized scenarios. A performance analysis of the trade-off between the maximum distortion that an attack can introduce and the probability of the attack being detected by the network operator is considered. In this setting, optimal centralized attack construction strategies are studied. The decentralized case is examined in a game-theoretic setting. A novel utility function is proposed to model this trade-off and it is shown that the resulting game is a potential game. The existence and cardinality of the corresponding set of Nash equilibria of the game is analyzed. Interestingly, the attackers can exploit the correlation among the state variables to facilitate the attack construction. It is shown that attackers can agree on a data-injection vector construction that achieves the best trade-off between distortion and detection probability by sharing only a limited number of bits offline. For the particular case of two attackers, numerical results based on IEEE test systems are presented.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the question of efficient allocation of energy, while buying the same from generation companies, to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) by aggregator (electricity utility or load serving entities) through auction mechanisms. Recognizing the practical limitations of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, which would be natural to apply in this context, we investigate two practical mechanisms that can be viewed as extensions of second price auction mechanisms and have limited message (bid) complexity. In the first mechanism, the elastic-supply multi-level second price, each PEV agent submits a number of price bids, one for each of a given set of energy levels (energy quantities). In the second mechanism, the elastic-supply progressive second price, the PEV agents submit a 2-D bid indicating the price as well as the desired energy quantity. Taking into account differences across PEV-owners in terms of their willingness-to-pay values and charging time constraints, we analyze the social optimality and incentive compatibility properties of the two auction mechanisms. We also complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations.

Abstract: The stalling of highly concentrated constant torque induction motor loads due to system faults may result in fault induced delayed voltage recovery. This state can cause significantly depressed local voltage for several seconds after the fault is cleared and can also lead to widely cascaded system failure. Though there is extensive study conducted within the modeling of motor loads, the dynamic connection between the aggregated induction motor loads and the grid still needs further investigation. In this paper, a dynamic performance model is developed for motor stalling and over heat thermal tripping. Specifically, this dynamic model can be constructed with an energy-like Lyapunov function, and can be incorporated as part of power system dynamic cascading model. The simulation examples are carried out in an enhanced version of the IEEE 57 bus test system, as demonstration for feasibility. This model may be beneficial for smart grid monitoring and planning, as well as energy analysis for power system cascading failure.

Abstract: This research directly couples investment decisions on distributed energy resources (DERs) with demand side management (DSM) strategies that can be adopted over time by residential communities. The formulation also takes into account factors that usually contribute to long-term market variations and short-term operational volatilities. This paper uses a high resolution adaptive model (Hi-RAM) for short-term load calculations on a premise that expected dynamical effects due to DSM strategies and their interactions cannot effectively be captured by traditional forecast models. The integration of Hi-RAM into investment formulation allows for certain What-If investment scenario analysis on the use of advanced technologies, new plug-ins, and consumer response to power price fluctuations, and more. To demonstrate the significance of coupling of DER investment decisions and DSM strategies, three scenarios are presented. The base scenario (Mode I) results can be reproduced using traditional forecast models and is included for baseline analysis and benchmarking. In Mode II, new load patterns for plug-in electric vehicles are introduced. Mode III is an extended version of Mode II, where smart devices are used within households. The comparison of investment decisions from the three modes clearly demonstrate that interaction effects of DSM strategies matter.

Abstract: This paper proposed a hierarchical structure for the electricity market to facilitate the coordination of energy markets in distribution and transmission networks. The proposed market structure enables the integration of microgrids, which provide energy and ancillary services in distribution networks. In the proposed hierarchical structure, microgrids participate in the energy market at the distribution networks settled by the distribution network operator (DNO), and load aggregators (LAs) interact with microgrids and generation companies (GENCOs) to import/export energy to/from the distribution network electricity markets from/to the wholesale electricity market. The proposed approach addressed the synergy of energy markets by introducing dynamic game with complete information for GENCOs, microgrids, and LAs. The proposed hierarchical competition is composed of bi-level optimization problems in which the respective upper-level problems maximize the individual market participants' payoff, and the lower-level problems represent the market settlement accomplished by the DNO or the independent system operator. The bi-level problems are solved by developing sensitivity functions for market participants' payoff with respect to their bidding strategies. A case study is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We propose a framework for the analysis of cyber switching attacks and control-based mitigation in cyber-enabled power systems. Our model of the switching attack is simple, only requiring knowledge of the sign of the local relative rotor speed, which may be estimated. The controller is modeled to be resource constrained, choosing to act only during select intervals of time. We make use of an iterated game-theoretic formulation to describe the interactions of the parties and its effect on system stability. Analytic results indicate the potential of the constrained controller to achieve transient stabilization over time using zero-determinant strategies. Numerical results of the New England 39-bus power system demonstrate the potential for such a controller to increase system resilience during cyber-attacks.

Abstract: The electric power grid is owned and operated by many competing providers who do not want to reveal their sensitive information to other providers. This competitive environment motivates the use of a third-party (cloud-computing) platform that combines information from each provider and jointly optimizes resources in the entire grid. Since the power system structure and component values are confidential, the third-party computing platform must be either absolutely secure or information needs to be masked before sharing with the third party. In this paper, we propose an approach to obfuscate the sensitive information and solve the multi-party AC optimal power flow problem in a shared computing platform. The initial obfuscation is separately performed by each party so that sensitive information is masked from the third party and all other participants.

Abstract: Major power grid blackouts in various parts of the world are characterized by voltage collapse. This paper studies the blackout case in the Indian power grid due to voltage collapse in the inter-regional corridor. First, the computer simulation models are tuned to match responses from the phasor measurement units at various locations in the grid. The inter-area mode with the frequency of 0.3 and 0.5 Hz with reduced damping were observed and resulted due to switching actions that occurred during the disturbance. This paper simulates the complex power grid network for various loading conditions of Northern region using power system simulator for engineering. Further, the system variables are analyzed using Prony method to estimate the inter-area mode for different NR loading conditions. The eigen values associated with the 0.3 Hz mode depict the movement from open left half plane into open right half plane with a slight increase in the parameter indicating "hopf bifurcation." This paper also discusses the maximum loading capacity for the inter-regional lines in-order avoid loss of small signal stability, and highlights the use of real time phasor measurement unit measurements in-order to estimate and track the oscillatory modes.

Abstract: Electric system operators rely on regulation services to match the total system supply to the total system load in quasi real-time. The regulation contractual framework requires that a regulation unit declares its regulation parameters at the beginning of the contract, the operator guarantees that the regulation signals will be within the range of these parameters, and the regulation unit is rewarded proportionally to what it declares and what it supplies. We study how this service can be provided by a unit with a non-ideal storage. We consider two broad classes of storage technologies characterized by different state of charge evolution equations, namely batteries and flywheels. We first focus on a single contract, and obtain formulas for the upward and downward regulation parameters that a unit with either a battery or a flywheel should declare to the operator to maximize its reward. We then focus on a multiple contract setting and show how to analytically quantify the reward that such a unit could obtain in successive contracts. We quantify this reward using bounds and expectation, and compare our analytical results with those obtained from a dataset of real-world regulation signals. Finally, we provide engineering insights by comparing different storage technologies in terms of potential rewards for different contract durations and parameters.

Abstract: Isolated regions and islands are facing imported fossil-fuel dependency, higher electricity prices, and vulnerability to climate change. At the same time, they are increasing their renewable penetration and, therefore, risk for electric utilities. Integrating stochastic energy resources in noninterconnected systems may take advantage of an intelligent and optimized risk-averse unit commitment (UC) model. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic UC model with high renewable penetration including reserve requirements for the efficient management of uncertainty. In order to account for the uncertainty around the true outcomes of load, wind, and photovoltaic (PV) generation, a minimum conditional value at risk term has been included in the model formulation. A stochastic measure of the value of the stochastic solution is used to evaluate the benefits of using stochastic programming. The model considers the need for reserves dependent on the forecasting horizon and the amount of renewable generation. Active power demand, and wind and PV generations are considered as probability distribution functions. The model is applied to the Lanzarote-Fuerteventura system in the Canary Islands, Spain, and Crete, Greece.

Abstract: Introduction of distributed generation (DG) to the power system may lead to nonselective protection actions. For every future DG installation, the relay settings need to be modified to guarantee protection coordination that can lead to numerous changes in relay settings. This paper presents a novel approach to plan relay protection coordination considering future DG installations. Thus, this paper aims at proposing a method capable of optimally identifying one set of relay settings valid for all possible future DG planning scenarios. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a linear programming problem and the simplex algorithm is utilized to solve it. The proposed approach is tested on the distribution part of the modified meshed IEEE 14-bus system and the IEEE 13-bus radial test system. Comparative studies have been conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach under various planning scenarios considering application of fault current limiters.

Abstract: In this paper, a new method is presented to simultaneously identify parameters of synchronous generator and its excitation system (EXS) using measurement data. These measurements could be provided by metering devices such as data acquisition system or fault recorders of the power plant. Since a smart grid is capable of providing synchronized measurements using phasor measurement units, the desired data could also be provided by these devices. In the proposed method, the reference voltage of the EXS is considered as the input signal, while the terminal voltage and output active power of the machine are considered as output signals. The desired parameters are classified into three categories using a sensitivity analysis: 1) the parameters that affect the terminal voltage; 2) the parameters that affect the active power; and 3) the parameters that do not considerably affect either. A multistage genetic algorithm optimization is used to iteratively identify the parameters. To show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, it is applied to a single machine with a dc-type EXS connected to an infinite bus. Using the proposed method, 19 parameters of synchronous generator and its EXS are identified within four stages.

Abstract: Large-scale lithium-ion battery packs are widely adopted in systems such as electric vehicles and energy backup in power grids. Due to factors such as manufacturing difference and heterogeneous discharging conditions, cells in the battery pack may have different statuses, such as diverse voltage levels. This cell diversity is commonly known as the cell imbalance issue. For the charging of battery packs, the cell imbalance not only early on terminates the charging process before all cells are fully charged, but also leads to different desired charging currents among cells. In this paper, based on the advancement in reconfigurable battery systems, we demonstrate how to utilize system reconfigurability to mitigate the impact of cell imbalance on an efficient charging process. With the proposed reconfiguration-assisted charging (RAC), cells in the system are categorized according to their real-time voltages, and the charging process is performed in a category-by-category manner. To charge cells in a given category, a graph-based algorithm is presented to charge cells with their desired charging currents, respectively. We evaluate RAC through both experiments and simulations. The results demonstrate that the RAC increases the capacity charged into cells by about 25% and yields a dramatically reduced variance.

Abstract: The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the smart grid provides real-time information to both grid operators and customers, exploiting the full potential of demand response (DR). However, it introduces new privacy threats to customers. Prior works have proposed privacy-preserving methods in the AMI, such as temporal or spatial aggregation. A main assumption in these works is that fine-grained data do not need to be attributable to individuals. However, this assumption does not hold in incentive-based demand response (IDR) programs where fine-grained metering data are required to analyze individual demand curtailments, and hence, need to be attributable. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for IDR programs in the smart grid, which enables the DR provider to compute individual demand curtailments and DR rewards while preserving customer privacy. Moreover, a customer can reveal his/her identity and prove ownership of his/her power usage profile in certain situations, such as legal disputes. We achieve both privacy and efficiency in our scheme through a combination of several cryptographic primitives, such as identity-committable signatures and partially blind signatures. As far as we know, we are the first to identify and address privacy issues for IDR programs in the smart grid.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar have received much attention in recent years, and large amounts of renewable generation are being integrated into electricity networks. A fundamental challenge in power system operation is to handle the intermittent nature of renewable generation. In this paper, we present a stochastic programming approach to solve a multiperiod optimal power flow problem under renewable generation uncertainty. The proposed approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, operating points of the conventional power plants are determined. The second stage realizes generation from the renewable resources and optimally accommodates it by relying on the demand-side flexibilities. The proposed model is illustrated on a 4-bus and a 39-bus system. Numerical results show that substantial benefits in terms of redispatch costs can be achieved with the help of demand side flexibilities. The proposed approach is tested on the standard IEEE test networks of up to 300 buses and for a wide variety of scenarios for renewable generation.

Abstract: Utilizing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is growing fast and booming nowadays. These vehicles, as portable loads and energy sources, may be connected to standard sockets at home. As a result, those extra electrical loads, grid to vehicle, generations, and vehicle to grid, have several impacts on distribution networks, e.g., network energy loss. This paper presents a two-stage optimization method to minimize the energy loss of microgrid with different penetration levels of PHEVs. In the first stage, a novel convex quadratic objective function for active power management of PHEVs is proposed, and daily required energy of PHEVs is calculated based on stochastic model of PHEV owners' behavior. It is supposed that PHEVs can be employed as distributed capacitors. Therefore, reactive power of PHEVs is specified in the second stage. Afterward, the proposed methodology is applied to a realistic distribution network. It will be illustrated that network energy loss is likely to rise considerably in the case of increasing penetration level of PHEVs without smart charging strategy; in order to minimize network energy loss, a smart management scheme will have to be considered. Also, the significant impact of PHEVs' active and reactive power management on energy loss reduction will be demonstrated.

Abstract: The potential economic impact of transmission line rating (TLR) attacks in two-settlement electricity markets is studied in this paper. We show that nodal prices in real-time markets can be manipulated via a TLR attack, which can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. Several acceleration techniques are developed to reduce the computational burden of solving the bi-level problem. A heuristic strategy is proposed to deal with the issue of multiplicity in pricing. The uncertainties in load are also considered in the proposed TLR model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that well-designed TLR attacks can manipulate the profits of market participants in the two-settlement markets. Benchmark testing shows that the proposed acceleration techniques can reduce computation time tremendously, and the proposed heuristic strategy can mitigate the issue of multiplicity in pricing.

Abstract: The envisaged de-carbonization of power systems poses unprecedented challenges enhancing the potential of flexible demand. However, the incorporation of the latter in system planning has yet to be comprehensively investigated. This paper proposes a novel planning model that allows co-optimizing the investment and operating costs of conventional generation assets and demand flexibility, in the form of smart-charging/discharging electric vehicles (EV). The model includes a detailed representation of EV operational constraints along with the generation technical characteristics, and accounts for the costs required to enable demand flexibility. Computational tractability is achieved through clustering generation units and EV, which allows massively reducing the number of decision variables and constraints, and avoiding non-linearities. Case studies in the context of the U.K. demonstrate the economic value of EV flexibility in reducing peak demand levels and absorbing wind generation variability, and the dependence of this value on the required enabling cost and users' traveling patterns.

Abstract: Information and communication infrastructure will be extensively deployed to monitor and control electric power delivery components of today's power grid. While these cyber elements enhance a utility's ability to maintain physical stability, if a subset are compromised by adversaries, disruption may occur. In this paper, a novel framework based on the principles of differential games is proposed that demonstrates stealthy worst-case strategies for attackers to disrupt transient stability by leveraging control over distributed energy resources. We demonstrate that if the electric power utility is able to identify uncompromised components, countermeasures can exist that effectively reduce the impact of attack for a fixed time interval. Based on our results, we develop insights to construct safety margin recommendations for cyber-physical smart grid actuation elements that promote system resilience during a cyber attack.

Abstract: Microgrids have emerged as an alternative to alleviate increasing energy demands. However, because microgrids are primarily based on nonconventional energy sources (NCES), there is high uncertainty involved in their operation. The aim of this paper is to formulate a robust energy management system (EMS) for a microgrid that uses model predictive control theory as the mathematical framework. The robust EMS (REMS) is formulated using a fuzzy prediction interval model as the prediction model. This model allows us to represent both nonlinear dynamic behavior and uncertainty in the available energy from NCES. In particular, the uncertainty in wind-based energy sources can be represented. In this way, upper and lower boundaries for the trajectories of the available energy are obtained. These boundaries are used to derive a robust formulation of the EMS. The microgrid installed in Huatacondo was used as a test bench. The results indicated that, in comparison with a nonrobust approach, the proposed formulation adequately integrated the uncertainty into the EMS, increasing the robustness of the microgrid by using the diesel generator as spinning reserve. However, the operating costs were also slightly increased due to the additional reserves. This achievement indicates that the proposed REMS is an appropriate alternative for improving the robustness, against the wind power variations, in the operation of microgrids.

Abstract: This paper proposes three-phase steady-state models for a distributed generator (DG) interfaced to a main system via a three-wire current-controlled voltage-source converter. In order to represent the DG in a realistic manner, the three major factors that determine the steady-state phase outputs under unbalanced operating conditions are considered: 1) the power control strategy; 2) output filter; and 3) voltage and current sensor positions. Based on these factors, the DGs are classified into various types. According to the position of the voltage sensor, two equivalent circuit models including an equivalent three-phase current source (ETCS) are proposed. For each type of DG, the output current of the ETCS is formulated as a function of the voltage of the ETCS-connected node, the filter impedances, and the active and reactive power references. To verify the accuracy of the proposed models, the results of the power flow incorporating them are compared with those obtained from the PSCAD simulation using detailed dynamic models of the DG.

Abstract: This paper proposes a transform-based compression algorithm for waveforms associated with power quality and transient phenomena in power systems. This method uses the wavelet transform, a dynamic bit allocation in the transform domain through estimation of the spectral shape, as well as entropy coding in order to minimize residual redundancy. Five distinct approaches for estimating the spectral shape are proposed. Four of them are based on analytical models that seek to describe the decreasing behavior of the transformed coefficients: 1) decreasing linear bit allocation shape; 2) decreasing quadratic bit allocation shape; 3) decreasing exponential bit allocation shape; 4) rotated sigmoid bit allocation shape; and 5) the fifth approach-the neural shape estimator (NSE)-is an adaptive model that uses an artificial neural network to map the changes in the spectrum shape. Results with databases of real signals and a performance evaluation using objective measures are reported. The results indicate that the NSE approach outperforms the other proposed solutions that use spectral shape estimation for coding, as well as other compression contributions reported in the literature.

Abstract: Regulation service (RS) reserves, a critical type of bi-directional capacity reserves, are provided today by expensive and environmentally unfriendly centralized fossil fuel generators. This paper investigates provision of RS reserves by the demand side. We consider a smart building operator that is capable of modulating the aggregate consumption of the building loads via price signals in response to an unanticipated RS signal that an independent system operator broadcasts. We first model the RS signal and load behavior, and formulate the related stochastic dynamic programming (DP) problem. Then, in order to deal with the complexity of the DP problem resulting from the uncountably infinite allowable price set, we characterize certain key properties of the DP dynamics, solve the DP problem for a discretized price policy to observe the structure of the optimal policy and re-capture the continuous price policy in an analytic approximate policy iteration (API) algorithm using the above properties and structure. We finally provide numerical evidence that the novel API algorithm converges to a continuous dynamic price policy that outperforms optimal discretized price policies in both computational effort and average cost.

Abstract: This paper discusses the influence of unintended reactive power flow caused by photovoltaic (PV) inverter systems with a power factor specification of one on the grid voltage and grid loss. In theory, the apparent power feed-in of these PV systems should be equal to the active power feed-in. Observations in distribution grids have shown a reactive power flow caused by these systems. The main purpose is, if this influence has to be considered in grid planning and power system management in smart grids. Therefore, measurement data of several low voltage grids is used. Three different scenarios for the unintended reactive power are simulated. Under normal operating conditions, the unintended reactive power is not relevant. Nevertheless, if voltage or overload problems are not explainable, they can be a result of the unintended reactive power flow. This approach is very helpful for network operators to locate and understand the reasons for grid problems.

Abstract: Inspired by induction machines working principles, this paper presents the idea of phase-locked-loop-less (PLL-less) operation of grid-connected voltage source converters (VSCs) under new concept of inducverter. The proposed controller eliminates the need for a dedicated synchronization process and the related PLL, and therefore it offers a simpler and more reliable control strategy compared to the conventional methods. In addition, it represents an improved performance, as it provides real and true auto-start and auto-synchronization with a grid without the need for grid voltage information. A current damping/synchronization unit enables grid auto-synchronization by using local current information and can track grid voltage frequency, angle, and amplitude variations while feeding constant amount of power, which is of high-interest in frequency varying grids and also in the case of grid voltage angle jump. Another advantage of the inducverter is that it introduces virtual inertia to the grid to regulate frequency, which enhances frequency dynamics of smart grids. Beside the current synchronization unit, the proposed strategy has a single-loop controller core with control over both power and current, which is implemented in a hybrid dq and abc frame using a virtual adaptive lead or lag impedance. The controller also offers stable and high-performance synchronization and operation under unbalanced and/or distorted grid conditions. The work beside synchronous current converters gives a bird's eye view to research in the new area of PLL-less and virtual inertia-based operation of VSCs and fulfill a unified set of controllers for the smart grid integration. Simulation, hardware-in-loop, and experimental results are presented to validate effectiveness of the controller.

Abstract: Due to the high-measuring cost, the monitoring of power quality (PQ) is nontrivial. This paper is aimed at reducing the cost of PQ monitoring in power network. Using a real-world PQ dataset, this paper adopts a learn-from-data approach to obtain a device latent feature model, which captures the device behavior as a PQ transition function. With the latent feature model, the power network could be modeled, in analogy, as a data-driven network, which presents the opportunity to use the well-investigated network monitoring and data estimation algorithms to solve the network quality monitoring problem in power grid. Based on this network model, algorithms are proposed to intelligently place measurement devices on suitable power links to reduce the uncertainty of PQ estimation on unmonitored power links. The meter placement algorithms use entropy-based measurements and Bayesian network models to identify the most suitable power links for PQ meter placement. Evaluation results on various simulated networks including IEEE distribution test feeder system show that the meter placement solution is efficient, and has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty of PQ values on unmonitored power links.

Abstract: Demand-side participation is now widely recognized as being extremely critical for satisfying the growing electricity demand in the U.S. The primary mechanism for demand management in the U.S. is demand response (DR) programs that attempt to reduce or shift demand by giving incentives to participating customers via price discounts or rebate payments. Utilities that offer DR programs rely on automated DR devices (ADRs) to automate the response to DR signals. The ADRs are faulty, but the working state of the ADR is not directly observable; one can, however, attempt to infer it from the power consumption during DR events. The utility loses revenue when a malfunctioning ADR does not respond to a DR signal; however, sending a maintenance crew to check and reset the ADR also incurs costs. In this paper, we show that the problem of maintaining a pool of ADRs using a limited number of maintenance crews can be formulated as a restless bandit problem, and that one can compute a near-optimal policy for this problem using Whittle indices. We show that the Whittle indices can be efficiently computed using a variational Bayes procedure even when the load-shed magnitude is noisy, and when there is a random mismatch between the clocks at the utility and at the meter. The results of our numerical experiments suggest that the Whittle-index-based approximate policy is within 4% of the optimal solution for all reasonably low values of the signal-to-noise ratio in the meter readings.

Abstract: A faithful distributed mechanism is proposed in this paper for sharing the cost of electricity among a large number of strategic and distributed household agents that have private information, and discrete and continuous energy levels. In contrast to mechanisms in prior works, which charge the agents based on their day-ahead allocation, the proposed mechanism charges the agents based on their day-ahead allocation and their actual consumption. The mechanism is proven to be asymptotically dominant strategy incentive compatible, weakly budget balanced, and fair in charging the agents. However, the proposed mechanism's payment function, which requires computing a marginal allocation problem for each agent, renders the mechanism intractable for a large number of household agents if it is computed centrally. Thus, a distributed implementation of the mechanism is proposed, in which the agents share the computational burden with the aggregator. The distributed implementation is based on a penalty/reward scheme inspired by the prisoner's dilemma that brings faithful computation to a dominant strategy equilibrium.

Abstract: The use of distributed generators (DGs) has increased in the past decade and projections indicate that penetration will further increase. In this scenario, with the improvements in power-electronics-based converters, the DG units have the potential to effectively resolve voltage/current control issues in low-voltage distribution systems. In this paper, a new probabilistic index is defined to measure the controllability of voltages and currents in the buses and lines of distribution systems. Using this index greatly facilitates the analysis and measurement of voltage/current controllability levels of distribution systems. Different types of DGs are allocated in the system to optimize the voltage/current controllability by using the defined index. The results are compared with those obtained through the conventional approach of DG allocation, which is based on the minimization of energy losses. A new combined index is defined to include both V-I controllability and energy losses. Several sensitivity studies are then performed to show the effect of the penetration level of different types of DGs on the proposed indices.

Abstract: Distributed control methods based on consensus algorithms have become popular in recent years for microgrid (MG) systems. These kind of algorithms can be applied to share information in order to coordinate multiple distributed generators within a MG. However, stability analysis becomes a challenging issue when these kinds of algorithms are used, since the dynamics of the electrical and the communication systems interact with each other. Moreover, the transmission rate and topology of the communication network also affect the system dynamics. Due to discrete nature of the information exchange in the communication network, continuous-time methods can be inaccurate for this kind of dynamic study. Therefore, this paper aims at modeling a complete dc MG using a discrete-time approach in order to perform a sensitivity analysis taking into account the effects of the consensus algorithm. To this end, a generalized modeling method is proposed and the influence of key control parameters, the communication topology, and the communication speed are studied in detail. The theoretical results obtained with the proposed model are verified by comparing them with the results obtained with a detailed switching simulator developed in Simulink/Plecs.

Abstract: Utilizing battery storage devices in plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) for grid support using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept is gaining popularity. With appropriate control strategies, the PEV batteries and associated power electronics can be exploited for solar photovoltaic (PV) impact mitigation and grid support. However, as the PEV batteries have limited capacity and the capacity usage is also constrained by transportation requirements, an intelligent strategy is necessary for an effective utilization of the available capacity for V2G applications. In this paper, a strategy for an effective utilization of PEV battery capacity for solar PV impact mitigation and grid support is proposed. A controllable charging/discharging pattern is developed to optimize the use of the limited PEV battery capacity to mitigate PV impacts, such as voltage rise during midday or to support the evening load peak. To ensure an effective utilization of the available PEV battery capacity when used for travel (which is the main usage of the PEVs) or when interventions in the charging operation is caused by passing clouds, a strategy for dynamic adjustments in PEV charging/discharging rates is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is tested using a real distribution system in Australia based on practical PV and PEV data.

Abstract: In this paper, an energy consumption management is considered for households (users) in a residential smart grid network. In each house, there are two types of demands, essential and flexible demands, where the flexible demands are further categorized into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant demands. The delay-sensitive demands have higher priority to be served than the delay-tolerant demands. Meanwhile, in order to decrease the delay of delay-tolerant demands, such demands are allowed to be upgraded to the high-priority queue (i.e., the same queue that serves the delay-sensitive demands) with a given probability. An optimization problem is then formulated to minimize the total electricity cost and the operation delay of flexible demands by obtaining the optimal energy management decisions. Based on adaptive dynamic programming, a centralized algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In addition, a distributed algorithm is designed for practical implementation and the neural network is employed to estimate the pricing or demands when such system information is not known. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can provide effective management for household electricity usage and reduce the operation delay for the flexible demands.

Abstract: Distributed optimization techniques in electric power systems have drawn increased attention as they provide a scalable way to handle the increasingly complex and large-scale optimization problems associated with the optimal operation of the system. However, little effort has been reported on how to optimally partition the overall optimization problem into subproblems, which significantly affects the efficiency and convergence speed of distributed methods. To address this issue, this paper focuses on how to determine the optimal partition for a given system and optimization problem, and quantify the improvement obtained with the optimal partition in terms of number of iterations and convergence time for solving the ac optimal power flow problem. The proposed approach is based on spectral clustering using a combination of the Hessian matrix of the optimization problem and the admittance matrix as the affinity matrix. Simulation results for the IEEE test systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning method, and the robustness of the performance of a certain partition with respect to the operating point of the system.

Abstract: As microgrids evolve, it is reasonable to expect that a variety of energy storage systems (ESSs) with different operational characteristics will be used simultaneously. Because each storage system has different capabilities and capacities, they will complement each other, and be able to achieve more efficient and reliable results than if only a single type of system were used. However, integrating multiple types of storage comes with several implementation challenges. Existing control techniques used to charge and discharge different technologies are not sufficient to accommodate the electrochemical (or mechanical) differences. In this paper, we propose an interconnection topology and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize the coordination of different ESSs in a microgrid.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a profit-maximizationbased pricing optimization model for the demand response (DR) management with customer behavior learning in the context of smart grids. By recognizing the different consumption patterns between shiftable and curtailable appliances, two different and distinguished behavior models are proposed. For shiftable appliances whose energy consumption can be shifted from high price periods to low price periods but total energy consumption is fixed, a probabilistic behavior model and its learning algorithm are proposed to model an individual customer's shifting probabilities dependent on different hourly prices. For curtailable appliances whose energy consumption cannot be shifted but total energy consumption can be adjusted, a regression model is proposed to model an individual customer's usage patterns dependent on prices and temperatures. After proposing the learning algorithms to identify these proposed behavior models, this paper further develops a genetic algorithm-based distributed pricing optimization algorithm for DR management with the aim to maximize the retailer's profit. Numerical results indicate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed models and their benefits to the retailer by improving its profit.

Abstract: In this paper, a real-time smart metering approach is proposed that reduces the reporting frequency for a given maximum error constraint. The proposed scheme employs an adaptive change detection filter that tracks the mean trend of the local power consumption, and load estimates are reported only when the estimation error exceeds a prescribed magnitude bound. The run-length of the proposed scheme is analyzed and expressions for the average time to a report are derived. Simulation results with both simulated and real-measurement data are provided to illustrate the tracking performance, and the reductions in the reporting rate. The results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the reporting rate in exchange for a small bounded tracking error.

Abstract: Energy storage systems (ESSs) are essential in future power systems because they can improve power usage efficiency. In this paper, a novel coordinated control algorithm is proposed for distributed battery ESSs (BESSs). The neighboring BESSs of a simulation system are grouped and controlled by a main control center. The main control center sends charging or discharging operation signals to each BESS. The primary objective of the proposed coordinated control scheme is to mitigate voltage and frequency deviations. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, the BESSs are connected to a distribution system of the Korea Electric Power Corporation. The results are compared with those obtained using uncoordinated control scheme with on-load tap changer considering aspects of power quality (voltage and frequency variation). The simulation results show that the voltage and frequency deviations are reduced with the proposed coordinated control algorithm.

Abstract: This paper develops a novel energy trading system with a community energy storage (CES) device for demand-side load management within a neighborhood area network. The energy users in the proposed system that have their own photovoltaic power generation are allowed to trade energy from their personal surplus with the grid and the CES device. We adopt a dynamic noncooperative repeated game with Pareto-efficient pure strategies as the decentralized approach for the users to determine optimal energy trading amounts for the next day. This decentralized model needs minimal information exchange or communication between users. Simulation results show that our system is able to provide peak load leveling for the grid, while providing financial benefits to users. Moreover, the performance benefits of our system are robust to both inaccuracy in day-ahead power forecasts and CES battery inefficiencies.

Abstract: This paper addresses a two-stage framework for the economic operation of a microgrid-like electric vehicle (EV) parking deck with on-site renewable energy generation (roof-top photovoltaic panel). This microgrid-like EV parking deck is a localized grouping of distributed generation (solar), energy storage (EV batteries), and load (EV charging load). Although EV parking decks can enable greater adoption of renewable energy sources by scheduling charging loads to coincide with periods of strong sun, the inherent intermittency of renewable energy resources and variable EV parking behaviors complicates the economic operation. In this paper, the proposed first stage of this framework provides the parking deck operators with a stochastic approach for dealing with the uncertainty of solar energy so as to make an optimal price decision (marginal electricity sale price and parking fee rebate) at the day-ahead time scale. The second stage introduces a model predictive control-based operation strategy of EV charging dealing with the uncertainty of parking behaviors within the real-time operation. Case studies demonstrate the better performance of the proposed framework, offering an effective day-ahead marginal electricity price for tomorrow's operation and increasing the microgrid-like EV parking deck's revenue during the real-time operation.

Abstract: In smart grid, customers have access to the electricity consumption and the price data via smart meters; thus, they are able to participate in the demand response (DR) programs. In this paper, we address the interaction among multiple utility companies and multiple customers in smart grid by modeling the DR problem as two noncooperative games: the supplier and customer side games. In the first game, supply function bidding mechanism is employed to model the utility companies' profit maximization problem. In the proposed mechanism, the utility companies submit their bids to the data center, where the electricity price is computed and is sent to the customers. In the second game, the price anticipating customers determine optimal shiftable load profile to maximize their daily payoff. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the mentioned games are studied and a computationally tractable distributed algorithm is designed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DR method in increasing the utility companies' profit and customers' payoff, as well as in reducing the peak-to-average ratio in the aggregate load demand. Finally, the algorithm performance is compared with a DR method in the literature to demonstrate the similarities and differences.

Abstract: Smart grids have attracted increasing interest in the field of industrial research. These systems allow electricity consumers to communicate with electrical systems using bidirectional communications. However, these bidirectional channels may introduce privacy threats to consumers. Considerable research has been conducted with the aim of resolving these threats. Unfortunately, a practical smart grid design with adequate efficiency and security functionalities has not yet been produced. In this paper, we propose lightweight privacy preserving metering protocols by designing a distributed authentication method to further increase the speed of the message authentication process. We confirmed the efficiency and security of our method by performing a detailed analysis.

Abstract: This paper documents the effort to perform dynamic model validation for the U.S. Eastern Interconnection (EI) by modeling the governor deadband. The Western Electricity Coordinating Council-modified 1981 IEEE type 1 turbine governor model (WSIEG1) was added to the EI model. A frequency response sensitivity study is conducted to look at the impacts of a few major factors. The significance of modeling governor dead band is evident. Simulated frequency responses are adjusted and validated against the measurements collected by the frequency monitoring network. Two actual events are replicated in a 16 000-bus EI dynamic model. This paper demonstrates the need for a comprehensive effort on governor dead band modeling by the industry.

Abstract: In order to reduce the energy cost of data centers, recent studies suggest distributing computation workload among multiple geographically dispersed data centers by exploiting the electricity price difference. However, the impact of data center load redistribution on the power grid is not well understood yet. This paper takes the first step toward tackling this important issue by studying how the power grid can take advantage of the data centers' load distribution proactively for the purpose of power load balancing. We model the interactions between power grid and data centers as a two-stage problem where the utility company chooses proper pricing mechanisms to balance the electric power load in the first stage and the data centers seek to minimize their total energy cost by responding to the prices in the second stage. We show that the two-stage problem is a bilevel quadratic program, which is NP-hard and cannot be solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We introduce benchmark problems to derive upper and lower bounds for the solution of the two-stage problem. We further propose a branch and bound algorithm to attain the globally optimal solution, and propose a heuristic algorithm with low computational complexity to obtain an alternative close-to-optimal solution. We also study the impact of background load prediction error using the theoretical framework of robust optimization. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can not only improve the power grid reliability, but also reduce the energy cost of data centers.

Abstract: Microgrids are emerging as an important constituent of large-scale smart grids. They are equipped with the controls necessary for managing the operation in islanded or grid connected mode and serve the loads with clean, reliable, and uninterruptible power. Microgrid must be equipped with a robust grid synchronization (GS) algorithm so as to allow a smooth transfer from islanded mode to grid tied mode. This gets even more critical when the availability of the power grid is irregular or the power grid is weak. This paper proposes a simple yet highly reliable GS technique based on controller area network (CAN) communication. The grid synchronizer block senses the three phase grid voltages, derives the phase angle (theta) using synchronously rotating reference frame-based phase lock loop, and transmits this information on the CAN network to all microsources (MS). The local controller associated with each MS receives the data with small but known and definite time latencies. This allows each MS to energize simultaneously in synchronization with the grid, facilitating easy GS of all the MS, minimizing the time required for GS of the complete microgrid. All the analytical, simulation, and hardware results related to this paper are presented.

Abstract: While enabling prominent growth of renewable-based distributed generation (DG) and matching energy harvesting, nonfirm connection policy requires accompanying active and reactive power dispatch control. Centralized control often implies comprehensive communication infrastructure and notable capital investment. Hence, DG planning models tailored for decentralized management of thermal and voltage constraints are found wanting. This paper presents a DG planning methodology, which successfully incorporates a new decentralized active power curtailment control and also includes decentralized voltage control. It optimizes autonomous control settings for each generator individually, such that the net energy export from the distribution to transmission level, per unit of installed capacity, is maximized. Comparative time series analysis validates the methodology.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider modeling and prediction of power loads due to fast charging stations for plug-in electric vehicles (EV). The first part of this paper is to simulate work of a fast charger activity by exploiting empirical data that characterize EV user behavior. The second part describes the time series obtained by this simulator and its properties. We show that the power load aggregated over a number of fast chargers (after deseasonalizing and elimination of the linear trend) is a self-similar process with the Hurst parameter 0.57 < H < 0.67, where H varies depending on the multiplexing level. The main contribution of this paper is empirical evidence that a fitted fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (fARIMA) model taking into account self-similarity of the load time series can yield high-quality short-term forecasts when H is large enough. Namely, the fitted fARIMA model uniformly outperforms regular ARIMA algorithms in terms of root-mean-square error for predictions with time horizon up to 120 min for H >= 0.639. Moreover, we show that the fARIMA advantage on average grows as a function of the Hurst exponent H. Computational experiments demonstrate that this edge is stably greater than 1.1% and can be as high as 5-7% for some scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates electric vehicle (EV) participation in the flexible ramp market. We take into account EV stochastic mobility, and evaluate impact on power system reliability and flexibility. Based on dynamic programming, the model deals with uncertainties and variations of net load, as well as EV charging requirements. Markov process is utilized in estimating the aggregated power capacity of EVs. Two participation modes are analyzed: 1) EV direct provision of the ramp product; and 2) EV cooperation with the conventional generator. Moreover, we propose new indices to evaluate power system flexibility. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach and illustrate how EV involvement into the ramp market can improve power system reliability and flexibility.

Abstract: Increased non-linear residential loads in today's distribution system is a concern due to the harmonics related power quality issues. The situation gets worsened by the harmonic resonance introduced by the installation of power factor correction (PFC) capacitor banks in the distribution network. At the same time, more and more renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG) units are being installed in the residential area. These DG systems can be used as an effective way to mitigate the harmonic related power quality problems introduced by the nonlinear residential loads. In literature, very limited work has been done to identify harmonic compensation priorities that should be assigned to different DGs operating at different locations of the distribution system for improved compensation performance. This issue is addressed in this paper. A selective harmonic compensation scheme based on modal analysis is developed to assign compensation priorities on DGs operating at different distribution system nodes for improved compensation performance. A modeled residential distribution system containing distribution components such as distribution line, PFC capacitors, transformers, and household appliances along with DG units is used to verify the improvement of compensation performance. Experimental verification of the proposed method is also provided.

Abstract: To realize the synergy between plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and wind power, this paper presents a hierarchical stochastic control scheme for the coordination of PEV charging and wind power in a microgrid. This scheme consists of two layers. Based on the non-Gaussian wind power predictive distributions, an upper layer stochastic predictive controller coordinates the operation of PEV aggregator and wind turbine. The computed power references are sent to the lower layer PEV and wind controllers for execution. The PEV controller optimally allots the aggregated charging power to individual PEVs. The wind controller regulates the power output of wind turbine. In this way, a power balance between supply and demand in a microgrid is achieved. The main feature of this scheme is that it incorporates the non-Gaussian uncertainty and partially dispatchability of wind power, as well as the PEV uncertainty. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage charging scheme for the electric vehicle aggregator to minimize the charging cost of each individual participator, while taking uncertain renewable generation and aggregator's capacity into account. The charging problem is formulated as a generalized Nash game with shared global constraints, where the congestion constraint and renewable energy utility constraint that couple all participators' strategies serve as the global constraints and should be satisfied for all possible outcomes of uncertainty. The normalized Nash equilibrium (NNE) is used to characterize a fair charging decision among the participants. It is shown that when the commission fee charged by the aggregator is a convex function and proportionally shared by the consumers, the NNE can be efficiently computed from a particular convex optimization problem, and is noninferior if the commission fee function is separable in players. An adaptive scenario generation algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model in a tractable manner. A dynamic real-time bidding scheme is suggested for practical implementations in a receding horizon fashion, accounting for tackling various kinds of uncertainties. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the proposed technique.

Abstract: Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) deployment has been widely promoted in recent years to improve the accuracy of billing information as well as to facilitate implementation of demand response. Information integrity and availability of the devices is crucial to the billing information that should reflect accurately on how much the household energy is consumed. The IP-based smart metering devices may exist with unknown vulnerabilities that can introduce back-doors to enable worm propagation across AMI network. The infected devices can be attack agents that would largely disable the metering functionalities or manipulate control variables of each meter. This paper proposes an optimal frequency of on-site investigation and the number of monitoring verification to investigate potential anomalies of malware footprinting by applying the decision process framework of Markovian. The proposed method determines the best inspection strategies based on the observation from the existing anomaly detectors deployed in the network. The considerations include malware propagation characteristics, accuracy of anomaly detectors, and investigation and diagnosis costs. Four scenarios are simulated using the proposed method, demonstrating the effectiveness of investigation on potentially infected electronic meters within an AMI network.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal reconfiguration-based dynamic tariff (DT) method for congestion management and line loss reduction in distribution networks with high penetration of electric vehicles. In the proposed DT concept, feeder reconfiguration (FR) is employed through mixed integer programming when calculating the DT, leading to minimized energy cost and reduced DT as compared with the DT concept without FR. This paper further demonstrates that the line losses can be taken into account during the calculation of DT. As a result, the line loss reduction can be realized in a decentralized manner through the DT framework. Three case studies were conducted to validate the optimal reconfiguration-based DT method for congestion management and line loss reduction in distribution networks.

Abstract: One of the well-known methods to share active and reactive power in microgrids (MGs) is droop control. A disadvantage of this method is that in steady state the frequency of the MG deviates from the nominal value and has to be restored using a secondary control system (SCS). The signal obtained at the output of the SCS is transmitted using a communication channel to the generation sources in the MG, correcting the frequency. However, communication channels are prone to time delays, which should be considered in the design of the SCS; otherwise, the operation of the MG could be compromised. In this paper, two new SCSs control schemes are discussed to deal with this issue: 1) a model predictive controller (MPC); and 2) a Smith predictor-based controller. The performance of both control methodologies are compared with that obtained using a conventional proportional integral-based SCS using simulation work. Stability analysis based on small signal models and participation factors is also realized. It is concluded that in terms of robustness, the MPC has better performance.

Abstract: With ever increasing deployment of automation and communication systems in smart grids, distribution network reconfiguration is becoming a viable solution for improving the operation of power grids. A novel hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper that determines Pareto frontiers, as the candidate solutions, for multiobjective distribution network reconfiguration problem. The proposed hybrid optimization algorithm combines the concept of fuzzy Pareto dominance with shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) to recognize optimal nondominated solutions identified by SFLA. The local search step of SFLA is also customized for power systems application so that it automatically creates and analyzes only the feasible and radial configurations in its optimization procedure, which significantly increases the convergence speed of the algorithm. Moreover, an adaptive reliability-based frog encoding is introduced that supervises the algorithm to concentrate on more reliable network topologies. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on a 136-bus electricity distribution network.

Abstract: This paper is concerned about real-time modeling and identification of dynamically changing loads in power systems. An exponential dynamic load model was proposed earlier and was well accepted by several investigators who worked on this paper. This paper considers this model and identifies its parameters in real-time based on synchronously sampled measurements. An unscented Kalman filter is used to track the unknown parameters of the exponential dynamic load model. This paper first implements and tests the proposed method using simulated measurements. The method is then applied to actual recorded utility measurements to identify and track the bus load of the utility. The results are found to be promising, suggesting viability of tracking dynamic load models for online applications.

Abstract: Grid security and open markets are two major smart grid goals. Transparency of market data facilitates a competitive and efficient energy environment. But it may also reveal critical physical system information. Recovering the grid topology based solely on publicly available market data is explored here. Real-time energy prices are typically calculated as the Lagrange multipliers of network-constrained economic dispatch; that is, via a linear program (LP) typically solved every 5 min. Since the grid Laplacian matrix is a parameter of this LP, someone apart from the system operator could try inferring this topology-related matrix upon observing successive LP dual outcomes. It is first shown that the matrix of spatio-temporal prices can be factored as the product of the inverse Laplacian times a sparse matrix. Leveraging results from sparse matrix decompositions, topology recovery schemes with complementary strengths are subsequently formulated. Solvers scalable to high-dimensional and streaming market data are devised. Numerical validation using synthetic and real-load data on the IEEE 30-bus grid provide useful input for current and future market designs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a distributed economic dispatch (ED) strategy based on projected gradient and finite-time average consensus algorithms for smart grid systems. Both conventional thermal generators and wind turbines are taken into account in the ED model. By decomposing the centralized optimization into optimizations at local agents, a scheme is proposed for each agent to iteratively estimate a solution of the optimization problem in a distributed manner with limited communication among neighbors. It is theoretically shown that the estimated solutions of all the agents reach consensus of the optimal solution asymptomatically. This scheme also brings some advantages, such as plug-and-play property. Different from most existing distributed methods, the private confidential information, such as gradient or incremental cost of each generator, is not required for the information exchange, which makes more sense in real applications. Besides, the proposed method not only handles quadratic, but also nonquadratic convex cost functions with arbitrary initial values. Several case studies implemented on six-bus power system, as well as the IEEE 30-bus power system, are discussed and tested to validate the proposed method.

Abstract: In a residential area where many households have installed rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units, there is a reverse power flow from the households to the substation when the power generation from PV units is larger than the aggregate load of the households. This reverse power flow causes the voltage rise problem. In this paper, we study the use of demand side management to mitigate the voltage rise problem. We propose an autonomous energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which schedules the operation of deferrable loads to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse power flow. The proposed algorithm shifts the operation of deferrable loads from peak consumption hours to hours with high-power generation from the PV units. We use stochastic programming to formulate an energy consumption scheduling problem, which takes into account the uncertainty related to the amount of power generation from PV units. The formulated cost function comprises a monetary cost for energy consumption, the revenue from energy export, and an external cost for the voltage rise. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can mitigate the voltage rise problem in areas with high penetration of PV units and reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load.

Abstract: This paper studies the solution of joint energy storage (ES) ownership sharing between multiple shared facility controllers (SFCs) and those dwelling in a residential community. The main objective is to enable the residential units (RUs) to decide on the fraction of their ES capacity that they want to share with the SFCs of the community in order to assist them in storing electricity, e.g., for fulfilling the demand of various shared facilities. To this end, a modified auction-based mechanism is designed that captures the interaction between the SFCs and the RUs so as to determine the auction price and the allocation of ES shared by the RUs that governs the proposed joint ES ownership. The fraction of the capacity of the storage that each RU decides to put into the market to share with the SFCs and the auction price are determined by a noncooperative Stackelberg game formulated between the RUs and the auctioneer. It is shown that the proposed auction possesses the incentive compatibility and the individual rationality properties, which are leveraged via the unique Stackelberg equilibrium solution of the game. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: The emergence of smart grid technology is offering a unique opportunity to improve power management in intelligent buildings through the integration and optimization of distributed energy resources and loads. In this paper, the interactions of multiple intelligent buildings in the context of energy market, as well as distributed energy generation and storage facilities, is considered. Within a time horizon divided into multiple periods in which generations and loads are forecasted, each building in a certain period may experience power surplus or deficit. While any deficit can be obtained from the market, buildings may consider selling their unused power back to the market. A dynamic pricing model based on differential game theory is set up in order to study the interactions of these players and how they maximize their profit. We also propose algorithms to implement and operate the system over the time horizon considered. Furthermore, numerical studies are performed to validate the model and algorithms.

Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for coordination of flywheel energy storage matrix system (FESMS) cooperated with wind farm. A simple and distributed ratio consensus algorithm is proposed to solve FESMS dispatch problem. The algorithm is based on average consensus for both undirected and unbalanced directed graphs. Average consensus is guaranteed in unbalanced digraphs by updating the weight matrix with both its row sums and column sums being 1. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Abstract: Accelerated development of eco-friendly technologies such as renewable energy, smart grids, and electric transportation will shape the future of electric power generation and supply. Accordingly, the power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible, which impact the system sizing. However, integrating these considerations into the design stage can be complex. Under these terms, this paper presents a novel model based on mixed integer linear programming for the optimization of a hybrid renewable energy system with a battery energy storage system in residential microgrids in which the demand response of available controllable appliances is coherently considered in the proposed optimization problem with reduced calculation burdens. The model takes into account the intrinsic stochastic behavior of renewable energy and the uncertainty involving electric load prediction, and thus proper stochastic models are considered. This paper investigates the effect of load flexibility on the component sizing of the system for a residential microgrid in Okinawa. Also under consideration are different operation scenarios emulating technical limitations and several uncertainty levels.

Abstract: Integration of a large number of flexible consumers in a smart grid requires a scalable power balancing strategy. We formulate the control problem as an optimization problem to be solved repeatedly by the aggregator in a model predictive control framework. To solve the large-scale control problem in real-time requires decomposition methods. We propose a decomposition method based on Douglas-Rachford splitting to solve this large-scale control problem. The method decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, e.g., locally by each unit connected to an aggregator. The total power consumption is controlled through a negotiation procedure between all cooperating units and an aggregator that coordinates the overall objective. For large-scale systems, this method is faster than solving the original problem and can be distributed to include an arbitrary number of units. We show how different aggregator objectives are implemented and provide simulations of the controller including the computational performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized energy management system for the coordinated operation of networked microgirds (MGs) in a distribution system. In the grid-connected mode, the distribution network operator and each MG are considered as distinct entities with individual objectives to minimize their own operation costs. It is assumed that both dispatchable and renewable energy source-based distributed generators (DGs) exist in the distribution network and the networked MGs. In order to coordinate the operation of all entities, we apply a decentralized bi-level algorithm to solve the problem with the first level to conduct negotiations among all entities and the second level to update the non-converging penalties. In the islanded mode, the objective of each MG is to maintain a reliable power supply to its customers. In order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumption, we formulate the problems as two-stage stochastic programs. The first stage is to determine base generation setpoints based on the forecasts and the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based on the realized scenarios. Case studies of a distribution system with networked MGs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in both grid-connected and islanded modes.

Abstract: Hybridization of energy storages (ESs) with different ramp rates helps minimization of system bus voltage variation and extension of ESs lifetime in dc microgrids. Hybrid ES system (HESS) control is normally realized with centralized coordination. In this paper, HESS distributed control, which is independent of the communication link, is proposed to enhance system reliability. All ESs are configured as slack terminals to regulate system bus voltage with droop control. System net power decomposition and ESs power sharing are realized with localized low-pass filter (LPF) applied to ESs with low-ramp rates. The relationship between LPF cut-off frequency and ES ramp rate is elaborated in detail. However, bus voltage deviation and power tracking errors are the main drawbacks of HESS distributed control. Multilevel energy management system (EMS) is thus proposed to enhance system control accuracy. HESS distributed control is scheduled as the primary control. Bus voltage restoration and power sharing compensation are applied in secondary control to eliminate the voltage deviation and power tracking errors, respectively. In tertiary control, autonomous state of charge (SoC) recovery is implemented to limit SoC variation of ES with high-ramp rate. A lab-scale dc microgrid is developed to verify the proposed multilevel EMS for HESS control.

Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal bidding strategy problem of a commercial virtual power plant (CVPP), which comprises of distributed energy resources (DERs), battery storage systems (BSS), and electricity consumers, and participates in the day-ahead (DA) electricity market. The ultimate goal of the CVPP is the maximization of the DA profit in conjunction with the minimization of the anticipated real-time production and the consumption of imbalance charges. A three-stage stochastic bilevel optimization model is formulated, where the uncertainty lies in the DA CVPP DER production and load consumption, as well as in the rivals' offer curves and real-time balancing prices. Demand response schemes are also incorporated into the virtual power plant (VPP) portfolio. The proposed bi-level model consists of an upper level that represents the VPP profit maximization problem and a lower level that represents the independent system operator (ISO) DA market-clearing problem. This bi-level optimization problem is converted into a mixed-integer linear programing model using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and the strong duality theory. Finally, the risk associated with the VPP profit variability is explicitly taken into account through the incorporation of the conditional value-atrisk metric. Simulations on the Greek power system demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: This paper presents an energy scheduling algorithm for a small-scale microgrid serving small to medium size commercial buildings (the building microgrid) that includes conventional and renewable distributed generation resources, energy storage, and both linear and nonlinear loads. An essential study objective is to mitigate power quality issues through coordinating the operating schedules of sensitive devices in the building microgrid. The proposed energy scheduling algorithm is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem where power quality requirements are modeled in the constraints. The algorithm also involves validation with the harmonics and dynamic event simulations. Case studies have been performed with realistic model parameters to verify the performance of the algorithm. This paper results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in managing voltage and frequency deviations, as well as harmonic distortions. In the transaction-based control framework, the proposed algorithm can be used to aggregate device transaction bids and facilitate the buildings-to-grid integration.

Abstract: Time-of-use electricity pricing is touted as one of the solutions toward optimal load distribution in the future of smart grid. However, the benefits of such an approach are limited as human electricity usage can often be described as inelastic in nature, or not sensitive to pricing in economic theory. Water heating constitutes one of the largest components of such usage. This paper proposes technology to enable residential water heating to be converted from an inelastic to an elastic demand, which would respond to pricing incentives. This is accomplished by utilizing consumer hot water use patterns combined with thermal storage to calculate a user-specific temperature profile. Results demonstrated that such an approach could not only reduce electrical water heating costs significantly and allow for realization of large-scale grid benefits, but also improve customer experience as thermal storage capability would enable more hot water to be delivered at times of peak consumption.

Abstract: An energy management system for stand-alone microgrid consisting of a wind turbine (WT) generator, a diesel generator, an energy storage system (ESS), and a sea water desalination system is proposed in this paper. The coordinated control of the distributed generations and ESS is researched with two operation modes. Then, a real-time rolling horizon energy management method is presented based on hour-ahead wind speed forecast. The operation mode of the microgrid system and the reference output power of WT generator are determined according to the forecasted wind speed and state of charge of the ESS, which can achieve the goal of maximizing utilization of wind energy and minimizing utilization of diesel generator on the basis of system stable operation. The proposed energy management method has been tested on the real-time digital simulator system. The results clearly verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate how network tariffs, such as the traditional energy-based network tariff (EBT) and power-based network tariffs (PBT), would affect the distribution system and the customers' incentives to schedule their demand under an hourly electricity pricing scheme. For this purpose, a mixed integer linear programming model has been developed and used in a case study to schedule the load demand for 100 residential customers with the objective being minimization of their electricity cost. The results have shown that by scheduling the flexible loads, customers could save up to (sic)119/year under EBT and (sic)127/year under PBT. If more than 25% of the customers were price-responsive under the EBT, the peak demand could be increased, while it could be reduced by 4% if all customers were responsive under the PBT. With plug-in electric vehicles, the possible benefits were found to be higher for both customers and the distribution system operator for the case with PBT compared with EBT.

Abstract: A spatio-temporal method for producing very-shortterm parametric probabilistic wind power forecasts at a large number of locations is presented. Smart grids containing tens, or hundreds, of wind generators require skilled very-short-term forecasts to operate effectively and spatial information is highly desirable. In addition, probabilistic forecasts are widely regarded as necessary for optimal power system management as they quantify the uncertainty associated with point forecasts. Here, we work within a parametric framework based on the logit-normal distribution and forecast its parameters. The location parameter for multiple wind farms is modeled as a vector-valued spatio-temporal process and the scale parameter is tracked by modified exponential smoothing. A state-of-the-art technique for fitting sparse vector autoregressive models is employed to model the location parameter and demonstrates numerical advantages over conventional vector autoregressive models. The proposed method is tested on a dataset of 5 min mean wind power generation at 22 wind farms in Australia. Five-min ahead forecasts are produced and evaluated in terms of point, and probabilistic forecast skill scores and calibration. Conventional autoregressive and vector autoregressive models serve as benchmarks.

Abstract: Microgrids can provide the most promising means of integrating large amounts of distributed sources into the power grid and can supply reliable power to critical loads. A generalized control framework is required to regulate microgrid voltage and frequency, maintain system stability, maintain power quality, and manage distributed generations. A microgrid control framework for power management and voltage and frequency regulation is proposed in this paper. The proposed method, virtual droop control, is described and formulated and compared with the existing natural droop control technique. Unit commitment algorithm has also been implemented to manage nonrenewable sources to improve the system efficiency. The proposed technique operates the microgrid at a constant voltage and frequency, and uses communication for power sharing. It also provides the means to operate the microgrid in case of lost communication and sabotage on communication network. The proposed method has been applied to Fort Sill microgrid and the modeling results have been compared with natural droop control technique. A laboratory setup, which consists of a 100 kW natural gas generator, 56 kWh Li-ion based battery with 250 kW inverter, and 100 kW load bank, has been built and tested. The results of the setup have been provided, which confirms the viability of the proposed technique.

Abstract: This paper proposes multiagent supervisory control for precise power management in isolated dc microgrids. Two power management aspects are considered: 1) equal power sharing, which is realized via a proposed distributed equal power sharing algorithm; and 2) optimal power dispatch, which is achieved through a proposed distributed equal incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional advantage of the ability to restore the average system voltage to its nominal value. The proposed algorithms are based on the application of the average consensus theory along with voltage sensitivity analysis. Each distributed generation (DG) unit exchanges information with its neighbors, thus locally updating its no-load voltage setting to achieve the supervisory control objectives. The incorporation of DG droop-based control renders the proposed algorithms fully distributed with a reduced number of agents. The stability of the proposed algorithms is addressed, as well as the convergence of the proposed DEIC algorithm. Real-time OPAL-RT simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in a hardware-in-the-loop application.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an advanced battery management system (BMS). The basic concept is to divide each series battery array into sub-arrays where each battery is individually monitored and managed. The proposed BMS continuously monitors the voltage, current, and energy of each battery. Based on these measurements, the BMS can calculate individual state of charge (SoC) levels and C-rates. Furthermore, the system has the capability to isolate each individual battery to apply different charging profiles and advanced diagnostics to detect the correct problems. Pulsed charging is deployed using different duty cycles for SoC balancing. The isolated battery is bypassed to maintain uninterrupted supply to the load despite reduced series array voltage. An unidirectional dc-dc boost converter maintains a constant output voltage level to the load, regardless of the number of batteries connected, until the problem is corrected. A hardware implementation of the proposed BMS is explained in detail. The performance of the system is tested experimentally under different loading conditions, including heavy pulsed loads.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel measurement procedure for load flow analysis in medium voltage (MV) smart grids. The new approach is based on power measurements at low voltage (LV) side of MV/LV distribution substations. Such measurements are carried out by means of power quality analyzers. If compared with the load flow methods based on measurements at the MV side, the proposed approach has a lower cost and it offers an equally reliable measurement system. The proposed algorithm takes the basic concept of the current summation backward/forward method; some modifications are introduced to use LV load powers measurements. To this aim, the MV/LV power transformer is properly modeled and taken into account in the algorithm. The proposed approach is validated by means of both simulations and experimental measurements; the test system is the MV distribution grid of Ustica Island, Italy. First, the proposed algorithm is compared with the MATLAB/Simulink load flow tool, which is based on the traditional Newton-Raphson method. Second, a comparison is carried out between the proposed method and the measurement data collected in the actual MV network of Ustica. Such comparison takes into account the uncertainties of both proposed method, and experimental active and reactive MV power measurements.

Abstract: The proliferation of technologies such as combine heat and power systems has accelerated the integration of energy resources in energy hubs. Besides, the advances in smart grid technologies motivate the electricity utility companies toward developing demand response (DR) programs to influence the electricity usage behavior of the customers. In this paper, we modify the conventional DR programs in smart grid to develop an integrated DR (IDR) program for multiple energy carriers fed into an energy hub in smart grid, namely a smart energy (S. E.) hub. In our model, the IDR program is formulated for the electricity and natural gas networks. The interaction among the S. E. hubs is modeled as an ordinal potential game with unique Nash equilibrium. Besides, a distributed algorithm is developed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results show that in addition to load shifting, the customers in the S. E. hubs can participate in the IDR program by switching the energy resources (e.g., from the electricity to the natural gas) during the peak hours. Moreover, the IDR program can increase the S. E. hubs' daily payoff and the utility companies' daily profit.

Abstract: To fully support information management among various stakeholders in smart grid domains, how to establish secure communication sessions has become an important issue for smart grid environments. In order to support secure communications between smart meters and service providers, key management for authentication becomes a crucial security topic. Recently, several key distribution schemes have been proposed to provide secure communications for smart grid. However, these schemes do not support smart meter anonymity and possess security weaknesses. This paper utilizes an identity-based signature scheme and an identity-based encryption scheme to propose a new anonymous key distribution scheme for smart grid environments. In the proposed scheme, a smart meter can anonymously access services provided by service providers using one private key without the help of the trusted anchor during authentication. In addition, the proposed scheme requires only a few of computation operations at the smart meter side. Security analysis is conducted to prove the proposed scheme is secure under random oracle model.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully distributed control strategy for the management of micro-storage devices that perform energy arbitrage. For large storage populations, the problem can be approximated as a differential game with infinite players (mean field game). Through the resolution of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs), it is possible to determine, as a fixed point, the optimal feedback strategy for each player and the resulting price of energy if that strategy is applied. Once this price is calculated, it can be communicated to the devices, which are able to independently determine their optimal charge profile. Simulation results are provided, calculating the fixed point through numerical integration of the PDEs. The original model is then extended in order to consider additional elements, such as multiple population of devices and demand uncertainty.

Abstract: This paper aims to set up a probabilistic framework to assess the value of a portfolio of demand response (DR) customers under both operational (short-term) and planning (long-term) uncertainties through real options (ROs) modeling borrowed from financial theory. In an operational setting, DR is considered as an RO contract allowing an aggregator seeking to maximize its revenue to sell flexible demand in the day-ahead market and balance its energy portfolio in the balancing markets. Sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS) are used to value DR activation decisions based on market price evolutions. These decisions combine DR physical characteristics and portfolio scheduling optimization, whereby the aggregator chooses to exercise only the contracts probabilistically leading to a profit, also considering the physical payback effects of load recovery. Sensitivity of profits to changing market conditions and payback characteristics is also assessed. In an investment setting, subject to long-term uncertainties, the value of an investment in DR-enabling technology is quantified through the Datar-Mathews RO approach that applies hybrid SMCS and scenario analysis. The results show how the flexibility value of DR can be highlighted by modeling it as RO, particularly in high volatile markets, and how realistic inclusion of payback characteristics significantly decrease the benefits estimated for DR. In addition, the proposed RO framework generally allows hedging of the risks incurred under long-term and short-term uncertainties.

Abstract: We present goal-seeking obstacle and collision evasion, an approach to resilient multicast routing for smart grid applications based on principles from robust flocking theory. We assert that analogies exist between the flocking principles of goal seeking, obstacle evasion, collision avoidance and behavioral transitions, and the routing goals of low latency, buffer overflow management, and adaptability in the presence of changing network conditions. Our multicast routing framework employs an underlying dynamical systems model convenient for integration with representations of power system dynamics to produce an overall cyber-physical smart grid description. Through simulations and comparisons with prior art we demonstrate how our approach provides insight on effective multicast routing principles to promote resilience in faulted power systems in the presence of congestion and denial-of-service attacks on communications infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper aims at minimizing economical cost of a microgrid by jointly scheduling various devices, e.g., appliances, batteries, thermal generators, and wind turbines. To properly model the system, the characteristics of all devices is fully investigated; in particular, the chance constraint is introduced to capture the randomness of power generation of wind turbines. Then, this problem is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer program with coupling constraints. In order to solve this problem efficiently, it is decoupled via dual decomposition into a set of sub-problems to be solved distributedly on each appliance, battery, and generator. While the scheduling of generator is well studied in literature, this paper specially proposes an efficient method for appliance scheduling, and then employs Benders' decomposition for battery scheduling. The performance of the proposed approach is verified by numerical simulations.

Abstract: Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is a precious operation strategy that can improve the system from different aspects including total cost, reliability, and power quality. Nevertheless, the high complexity of the new smart grids has resulted in much uncertainty in the DFR problem that necessities the use of a sufficient stochastic framework to deal with them. In this way, this paper proposes a new stochastic framework based on cloud theory to account the uncertainties associated with multiobjective DFR problem from the reliability point of view. Cloud theory is constructed based on fuzzy theory and probability idea. In comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation method, cloud models can give more information on the uncertainties associated with the problem. This special aspect of cloud models makes it possible to integrate the fuzziness and randomness of qualitative concepts through the cloud drops and then transforms them to the quantitative model. In order to solve the proposed problem, a fast and powerful optimization technique is required. To deal with this issue, a new optimization algorithm designated as theta-bat algorithm is proposed in this paper. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method are examined on the 32-bus and 69-bus IEEE distribution test system.

Abstract: A framework for real-time (RT) charging management of an electric vehicle aggregator (EVA) participating in electric energy and regulation markets is proposed. The developed models, which assign charging set points to the electric vehicles (EVs) based on evolving EV charging priorities, are formulated as linear programs that can be solved very fast. A model of the most common (constant current-constant voltage) battery charging method is also presented. A case study is examined, where an EVA representing 1000 EVs participates in the day-ahead and RT energy and regulation markets, and manages the RT charging of the EVs in his fleet based on the developed framework. Through this approach, conclusions on the impact of the charging priority parameterization for the RT EV charging management, the value of the dynamic regulation signal on the reliable EV participation in the regulation market, and the impact of the detailed battery modelling are derived.

Abstract: In this paper, stochastic optimization of economic dispatch (ED) and interruptible load management is investigated using short-term distributional forecast of wind farm generation. Specifically, using the statistical information of wind farm generation extracted from historical data, a Markov chainbased distributional forecast model for wind farm generation is developed in a rigorous optimization framework, in which the diurnal nonstationarity and the seasonality of wind generation are accounted for by constructing multiple finite-state Markov chains for each epoch of 3 h and for each individual month. Based on this distributional forecast model, the joint optimization of ED and interruptible load management is cast as a stochastic optimization problem. Additionally, a robust ED is formulated using an uncertainty set constructed based on the proposed distributional forecast, aiming to minimize the system cost for worst cases. The proposed stochastic ED is compared with four other ED schemes: 1) the robust ED; 2) deterministic ED using the persistence wind generation forecast model; 3) scenario-based stochastic ED; and 4) deterministic ED, in which perfect wind generation forecasts are used. Numerical studies, using the IEEE Reliability Test System-1996 and realistic wind measurement data from an actual wind farm, demonstrate the significant benefits obtained by leveraging the Markov chain-based distributional forecast and the interruptible load management.

Abstract: We study the demand response (DR) of geo-distributed data centers (DCs) using smart grid's pricing signals set by local electric utilities. The geo-distributed DCs are suitable candidates for the DR programs due to their huge energy consumption and flexibility to distribute their energy demand across time and location, whereas the price signal is well-known for DR programs to reduce the peak-to-average load ratio. There are two dependencies that make the pricing design difficult: 1) dependency among utilities; and 2) dependency between DCs and their local utilities. Our proposed pricing scheme is constructed based on a two-stage Stackelberg game in which each utility sets a real-time price to maximize its own profit in Stage I and based on these prices, the DCs' service provider minimizes its cost via workload shifting and dynamic server allocation in Stage II. For the first dependency, we show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium. For the second dependency, we propose an iterative and distributed algorithm that can converge to this equilibrium, where the "right prices" are set for the "right demands." We also verify our proposal by trace-based simulations, and results show that our pricing scheme significantly outperforms other baseline schemes in terms of flattening the power demand over time and space.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fault location method for single-phase microgrids. In order to locate a fault, a feature specific to the fault location is found, namely the maximum oscillation magnitude of the transient voltage signal induced by the fault. Our theoretical study and extensive simulations demonstrate that there is an approximated linear relationship between the maximum magnitude of the transient signal observed by a sensor, and the distance between the sensor and the fault location. Based on the discovered relationship, microgrid topology and sensor location information, we have designed an algorithm capable of locating the fault in the single-phase microgrids. The proposed fault location method has been implemented and validated through simulations in Electro-Magnetic Transients Program and MATLAB. The average localization error is less than 10% in the evaluation results, which manifests the significance of the novel method, as there is little research done for fault location in single-phase microgrids.

Abstract: A time-delay switch (TDS) attack on a control system is caused by adversaries that strategically imbed time delays into such systems. TDS attacks can make a control system, or more specifically a distributed power control system, unstable. Time delays can be introduced in the sensing loop (SL) or control lines. This paper describes a novel, simple, and effective method to thwart TDS attacks on SL. The proposed method works by augmenting the controller with a time-delay estimator to estimate any time delays. The modified controller controls the system under TDS attack. Also, the time-delay estimator will track time delays introduced by an adversary using a modified model reference control with an indirect supervisor and a modified least mean square minimization technique.

Abstract: In this paper, the design of an event-driven middleware for general purpose services in smart grid (SG) is presented. The main purpose is to provide a peer-to-peer distributed software infrastructure to allow the access of new multiple and authorized actors to SGs information in order to provide new services. To achieve this, the proposed middleware has been designed to be: 1) event-based; 2) reliable; 3) secure from malicious information and communication technology attacks; and 4) to enable hardware independent interoperability between heterogeneous technologies. To demonstrate practical deployment, a numerical case study applied to the whole U.K. distribution network is presented, and the capabilities of the proposed infrastructure are discussed.

Abstract: A salient feature of a renewable energy power supply system (REPSS) on islands is the high level of uncertainties caused by high penetration of volatile power sources, such as wind and solar photovoltaic farms. This creates large forecast errors under some conditions and makes the fixed time-scale dispatch impotent in maintaining system reliability. To tackle this challenge, a time-scale adaptive dispatch method is developed in this paper. The time-scale for dispatch REPSS on islands is adjusted online according to the confidence interval of forecast error predicted by neural network. Extensive tests have validated the effectiveness of the presented method in offsetting the uncertainties in the system and improving the system reliability.

Abstract: The problem of dynamic pricing of electricity in a retail market is considered. A Stackelberg game is used to model interactions between a retailer and its customers; the retailer sets the day-ahead hourly price of electricity and consumers adjust real-time consumptions to maximize individual consumer surplus. For thermostatic demands, the optimal aggregated demand is shown to be an affine function of the day-ahead hourly price. A complete characterization of the tradeoffs between consumer surplus and retail profit is obtained. The Pareto front of achievable tradeoffs is shown to be concave, and each point on the Pareto front is achieved by an optimal day-ahead hourly price. Effects of integrating renewables and local storage are analyzed. It is shown that benefits of renewable integration all go to the retailer when the capacity of renewable is relatively small. As the capacity increases beyond a certain threshold, the benefit from renewable that goes to consumers increases.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time price (RTP)-based demand-response (DR) algorithm for achieving optimal load control of devices in a facility by forming a virtual electricity-trading process, where the energy management center of the facility is the virtual retailer (leader) offering virtual retail prices, from which devices (followers) are supposed to purchase energy. A one-leader, N-follower Stackelberg game is formulated to capture the interactions between them, and optimization problems are formed for each player to help in selecting the optimal strategy. The existence of a unique Stackelberg equilibrium that provides optimal energy demands for each device was demonstrated. The simulation analysis showed that the Stackelberg game-based DR algorithm is effective for achieving the optimal load control of devices in response to RTP changes with a trivial computation burden.

Abstract: The smart grid is driving the deployment of networked components within the traditional power grid to achieve greater reliability and control. However, those cyber components are creating new security vulnerabilities that could lead to significant disruptions if exploited maliciously. We propose a comprehensive cost model designed to assist in the selection of responses to malicious attacks on an advanced metering infrastructure. The cost model reflects the costs of response actions due to outages in the distribution grid, disruptions of the electricity market, and violations of contractual agreements among stakeholders. We also present a realistic implementation of the cost model using ArcGIS for topology generation and GridLAB-D for grid simulation. The cost model is a step forward toward achievement of automated resilience in the smart grid. It also provides comprehensive modeling for system dynamics and operation costs, while relieving utilities from the burden of manually assigning costs for response actions and modeling attacker steps.

Abstract: The integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources requires increased flexibility in the operation of the electric grid. Storage, broadly speaking, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over time; network, on the other hand, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over geographical locations. The optimal control of storage networks in stochastic environments is an important open problem. The key challenge is that, even in small networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control problems on continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality and are intractable in general settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is known to give optimal or provably near-optimal performance for this problem. This paper provides an efficient algorithm to solve this problem with performance guarantees. We study the operation of storage networks, i.e., a storage system interconnected via a power network. An online algorithm, termed online modified greedy algorithm, is developed for the corresponding constrained stochastic control problem. A sub-optimality bound for the algorithm is derived and a semidefinite program is constructed to minimize the bound. In many cases, the bound approaches zero so that the algorithm is near-optimal. A task-based distributed implementation of the online algorithm relying only on local information and neighborhood communication is then developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical examples verify the established theoretical performance bounds and demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm.

Abstract: Wide-area monitoring and control (WAMC) systems based on synchrophasor data streams are becoming more and more significant to the operation of the smart power grid. Reliable and secure communication, and higher quality of service (very low latency, high availability, etc.) of data are crucial to the success of WAMC systems. However, the IEEE standard for synchrophasor data communication (IEEE Standard C37.118.2-2011) does not place any restrictions on the choice of transport layer protocols. In light of this, we examine the communication between synchrophasors [phasor measurement units (PMUs)] and phasor data concentrators to analyze potential security vulnerabilities present at the transport layer, and investigate the advantages and disadvantages of both the TCP and UDP protocols, respectively, with an emphasis on security issues. Demonstrations of attacks related to these security vulnerabilities are shown in lab environment and underlying mechanisms are

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for a dc distribution system for power system integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The dc distribution system is intended to integrate electric vehicles in a parking lot with an ac grid through bidirectional dc-dc converters (battery chargers) and a central voltage-sourced converter. Using an online constrained optimization algorithm, the proposed EMS manages the power flow within the dc system. Thus, the PEV owners can charge or discharge their batteries based on the state-of-charge of the batteries and their upcoming trip plans. The EMS offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: 1) the fast energy exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange time; and 2) the optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues through selling their stored energy. The proposed EMS seamlessly handles all charging/discharging requests from the PEV owners with different options and, at the same time, it takes into account the power demand and power generation limits of the ac grid to preclude under-voltage, over-voltage, and reverse power flow issues. Various energy exchange scenarios are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS.

Abstract: In the restructured power industry, demand responsiveness is a key factor whose importance will be boosted due to the impetus provided by the development of smart grids. Within the context of pool-based electricity markets, this paper addresses the incorporation of price-responsive demand in multiperiod energy scheduling driven by consumer payment minimization. Although consumer payment minimization has drawn considerable attention mainly in an operational setting and also recently under a planning framework, available models and solution approaches typically neglect demand-side participation. The proposed scheduling model considers a marginal pricing scheme as well as the effects of both network constraints and intertemporal constraints associated with generation operation. Modeling demand-side participation leads to bilinear payment terms that significantly increase the mathematical complexity of the optimization process. The resulting problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel program for which no exact solution technique is currently available. This paper presents a novel methodology by which the original bilevel and bilinear problem is converted into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear program suitable for efficient off-the-shelf software. This transformation is based on the application of duality theory of linear programming, integer algebra, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions. The proposed approach has been successfully applied to the IEEE 118-bus system.

Abstract: Price-based management of distributed energy resources within microgrids is continuously gaining ground due to scalability and privacy limitations of centralized architectures. However, the concentration of flexible loads' response to the lowest-priced periods yields inefficient solutions. A previously proposed measure imposing a flexibility restriction on flexible loads might raise acceptability and feasibility concerns by the users. This paper develops a novel fully price-based approach where this hard restriction is replaced by a soft nonlinear price signal. This signal is customized to the operating properties of the different flexible load types by penalizing the square of the demand and the duration of cycle delay of loads with continuously adjustable power levels and deferrable cycles, respectively. This approach is shown to produce more efficient solutions than the flexibility restriction measure for both types of loads. For the latter type, randomization of the nonlinear prices brings additional benefits, especially in low operating diversity cases. These contributions are supported by case studies on a microgrid test system with electric vehicles and wet appliances used as representative examples of the above flexible load types.

Abstract: Droop control strategy enables the microgrid switch between grid-connected and islanded mode flexibly, and easily realizes the "plug and play" function of distributed generation and loads, which has recently aroused great concerns. However, small disturbances may occur during the changing process and eventually yield transient oscillation, thus the focus of microgrid control is how to switch smoothly within different operation modes. In order to improve the dynamic characteristics of an inverter-based microgrid, this paper derived a precise small-signal state-space model of the whole microgrid including droop controller, network, and loads. The key control parameters of the inverter and their optimum ranges, which greatly influence the damping frequency of oscillatory components in the transient response, can be obtained through eigenvalue analysis. In addition, genetic algorithm is introduced to search for optimal settings of the key parameters during time-domain simulation in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed small-signal dynamic model and optimization algorithm, and enhanced the dynamic performance of the microgrid, which can be the reference for parameter design of droop control in low voltage microgrids.

Abstract: This paper proposes an interactive control framework for microgrid interconnections to achieve effective load sharing and guaranteed system-wide small signal stability. In the proposed framework, hierarchical control is performed at three levels operating in different time frames. A model reference control-based scheme is implemented for primary level power sharing, through which the interface inverter of each microgrid is controlled to track a designed reference model. At the secondary level, an interactive droop management scheme is proposed to manage the reference model droop gains based on a distributed stability criterion. At the tertiary level, an ac power flow-based supervisory control strategy is utilized to dispatch the nominal setting to each microgrid central controller (MGCC) for the primary level reference tracking, and broadcast an interaction coefficient to each MGCC so that the droop gains can be managed to guarantee system-wide stability. Numerical analysis of a study system designed based on the IEEE 123-node test feeder demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed interactive control framework.

Abstract: In this paper, the overvoltage problems that might arise from the integration of photovoltaic (PV) panels into low-voltage (LV) distribution networks is addressed. A distributed scheme is proposed that adjusts the reactive and active power output of inverters to prevent or alleviate such problems. The proposed scheme is model-free and makes use of limited communication between the controllers in the form of a distress signal only during emergency conditions. It prioritizes the use of reactive power, while active power curtailment is performed only as a last resort. The behavior of the scheme is studied using dynamic simulations on a single LV feeder and on a larger network composed of 14 LV feeders. Its performance is compared with a centralized scheme based on the solution of an optimal power flow (OPF) problem, whose objective function is to minimize the active power curtailment. The proposed scheme successfully mitigates overvoltage situations due to high PV penetration and performs almost as well as the OPF-based solution with significantly less information and communication requirements.

Abstract: In electric power systems, multiple entities are responsible for ensuring an economic and reliable way of delivering power from producers to consumers. With the increase of variable renewable generation it is becoming increasingly important to take advantage of the individual entities' (and their areas') capabilities for balancing variability. Hence, in this paper, we employ and extend the approximate Newton directions method to optimally coordinate control areas leveraging storage available in one area to balance variable resources in another area with only minimal information exchange among the areas. The problem to be decomposed is a model predictive control problem including generation constraints, energy storage constraints, and AC power flow constraints. Singularity issues encountered when formulating the respective Newton-Raphson steps due to intertemporal constraints are addressed and extensions to the original decomposition method are proposed to improve the convergence rate and required communication of the method.

Abstract: Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are being increasingly deployed to improve monitoring and control of the power grid due to their improved data synchronization and reporting rates in comparison with legacy metering devices. However, one drawback of their higher data rates is the associated increase in bandwidth (for transmission) and storage requirements (for data archives). Fortunately, typical grid behavior can lead to significant compression opportunities for phasor angle measurements. For example, operation of the grid at nearnominal frequency results in small changes in phase angles between frames, and the similarity in frequencies throughout the system results in a high level of correlation between phasor angles of different PMUs. This paper presents several methods for preprocessing of phasor angles that take advantage of these system characteristics, including a new method-frequency compensated difference encoding-that is able to significantly reduce angle data entropy. After the preprocessor stage, the signal is input to an entropy encoder, based on Golomb-Rice codes, that is ideal for high-throughput signal compression. The ability of the proposed methods to compress phase angles is demonstrated using a large corpus of data-over 1 billion phasor angles from 25 data sets-captured during typical and atypical grid conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, an agent-based decentralized control model for islanded microgrids (MGs) is proposed, which consists of a two-layer control structure. The bottom layer is the electrical distribution MG, while the top layer is the communication network composed of agents. An agent is regarded as a local control processor together with communication devices, so agents can collect present states of distributed generators (DGs) and loads when communication lines are added between two layers. Moreover, each agent can also exchange information with its neighboring agents of the network. After information is processed according to control laws, agents adjust the production of DGs to which they connect. Further, a systematic method is presented, which can be used to derive a set of control laws for agents from any given communication network, after the rules to establish the communication network are given. Furthermore, it has been seen that the output power supplied by DGs satisfies the load demand in the MG when agents use the proposed control laws. Finally, the simulation results show that frequency and voltage fluctuations are small and meet the requirements.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time distributed voltage security monitoring framework for large power systems using synchrophasor measurements. The method distributes its major computations among substations and collects results from each substation at the control center to provide a comprehensive voltage security index. At the substation level, two Q-V sensitivity-based voltage security indices, namely, a positive index and a negative index, are calculated from ambient synchrophasor measurements. The indices are estimated using two new algorithms, namely, fast bidirectional sensitivities calculation and bidirectional linearization approximation, using local measurements. These local sensitivities from different substations are collected at the control center level, where wide-area voltage security assessment is carried out to estimate the system proximity to voltage collapse, as well as to identify voltage insecure subareas if any exist. Simulations and numerical studies of the IEEE 118-bus test power system and validated large-scale model of the July 2, 1996 Western American blackout are used to illustrate that the proposed algorithm can detect voltage insecurity effectively in large power systems.

Abstract: In smart grid, residential consumers adopt different load scheduling methods to manage their power consumptions with specific objectives. The conventional load scheduling methods aim to maximize the consumption payoff or minimize the consumption cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of cost efficiency-based residential load scheduling framework to improve the economical efficiency of the residential electricity consumption. The cost efficiency is defined as the ratio of consumer's total consumption benefit to its total electricity payment during a certain period. We develop a cost-efficient load scheduling algorithm for the demand-side's day-ahead bidding process and real-time pricing mechanism by using a fractional programing approach. Results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can effectively reflect and affect user's consumption behavior and achieve the optimal cost-efficient energy consumption profile. For practical consideration, we also take into account the service fee and distributed energy resources (DERs) in our framework, and analyze their impacts on the cost efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly improves consumer's cost efficiency. It is shown that a higher service fee will decrease the cost efficiency, while the integration of DERs can effectively improve the cost efficiency.

Abstract: As the power demand becomes higher all over the world, transmission lines are often carrying electric power near their limits, which can cause power systems to be operated under serious stress. Voltage collapse is one of the more critical problems that impacts power system operational security and many of the recent major blackouts were caused, at least partially, by voltage collapse. Therefore, a fast and accurate voltage stability monitor is necessary for the modern system, together with a fast calculation of possible remedial actions. The development and application of wide-area measurement systems established the foundation of online assessment of voltage stability in large-scale power systems. In this paper, a voltage stability (QV) index based on phasor measurements is used to identify the weak buses and a new parallel optimization method that increases this voltage stability margin is introduced. Results on the IEEE standard systems show the accuracy and efficiency of the methods.

Abstract: The use of distributed generation (DG) resources is seen as a key important factor in improving technical and economic aspects of distribution systems. However, little research exists concerning the optimal location and operation of DGs. This paper proposes a novel method to find simultaneously the optimal location and operation of DGs. The method is developed in two phases, namely Phase 1 and 2. Phase 1 deals with the optimal location of DGs using a multiobjective optimization problem in which active power loss reduction, voltage profile improvement, and voltage regulation are the objectives. A Pareto frontier differential evolution (PDE) algorithm is developed to solve the multiobjective problem. Phase 2 copes with the optimal income of the DGs' owners along with the optimal total payment of the distribution company by adopting a bi-level optimization method with two agents. Game theory is employed to assist in finding optimal contract prices. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using two IEEE, 33-bus, and 69-bus, standard distribution networks. This paper concludes that the proposed method can serve as an accurate tool for practitioners in finding the optimal location and operation strategy of DGs.

Abstract: With sustained growth of intermittent power supplies connected to grid, the randomness and volatility of intermittent power supplies will bring new challenges to power system optimization dispatch. For dealing with the uncertainty of large-scale intermittent power supply, this paper introduces robust optimization theory into optimization dispatch for hybrid wind/photovoltaic/hydro/thermal power systems. Meanwhile in order to make an ideal compromise between reliability and economy of system dispatch, this paper also introduces concept of uncertainty to cover shortcoming of conventional robust optimization which is conservative. A flexible robust optimization with adjustable uncertainty budget dispatch model is built for hybrid power system to achieve coordination between reliability and economy, and then the uncertainty budget decision methods are studied to reduce blindness of uncertainty budget decisions. Moreover, a new compound differential evolution (CDE) algorithm is designed in this paper. The diversity of individuals and convergence speed are taken into account in process of differential evolution (DE) calculation by introducing a series of operations into DE algorithm, such as individual ranking, population dividing, CDE, and population restructuring. Finally, a sample application is carried out to verify the validity and practicability of the model and the method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for enabling the reliability-differentiated services in a residential distribution network with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). A reliability-differentiated pricing mechanism is developed to satisfy the different reliability requirements of the customers while encouraging the customers to consume electricity in such a way that the reliability of the overall distribution system can be enhanced. A dynamic spinning reserve pricing scheme is developed to stimulate PHEVs to participate in spinning reserve by providing economic benefits when the state of the distribution system becomes risky. Based on the formulated reliability-differentiated system, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to coordinate the charging process of PHEVs in a decentralized fashion. At the upper level of the hierarchical game, an evolutionary game is formulated to optimize the management of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity of each PHEV. Under the V2G strategies obtained from the evolutionary game, a noncooperative game is formulated at the lower level to coordinate the charging sequences of PHEVs. Various simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical game approach. The simulation results show that the hierarchical game approach is effective in enhancing both reliability of the distribution system and economic profits of the PHEVs.

Abstract: By intruding on the substations and control center of the supervisory control and data acquisition system, trip commands can be sent to intelligent electronic devices that control the power system breakers. Reliability of the power system can be impacted through the cyberattacks. In this paper, a modified semi-Markov process (SMP) model is used to describe the procedures of normal and penetration attacks against the intrusion tolerant system. By modeling the transition probabilities between the SMP states and sojourn time of each SMP state, the mean times to compromise the normal and penetration attacks are calculated. With increased probabilities of breaker trips resulted from the cyberattacks, the loss of load probabilities are evaluated based on IEEE reliability test system 79. When the level of attack increases or the level of defense in the system decreases, the simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable.

Abstract: Cooperation between the controllable load, such as electrical vehicles (EVs) and the generation, provides the power system new operating strategies. A novel hierarchical charge control framework is proposed based on the Benders decomposition for large populations of EVs. The grid, unit, and accurate EV constraints can be considered. On the upper level, the cooperative dispatch scheme between the generation and the EV aggregators is obtained. On the lower level, the feasibility of the scheme is checked with EV constraints considered. The levels are coordinated by the Benders cuts. In addition, the distributed approximate Benders cuts is also proposed, which helps to protect user privacy and a three-level framework is developed based on the decentralized control. The case studies on IEEE Reliability Test System have verified the proposed framework and method is valid and feasible. The charge control based on it can minimize the grid operation cost and improve the unit operating efficiency.

Abstract: Smart impedance is a new way to look at hybrid active power filters. As originally proposed in the literature, hybrid active filters were presented to improve the physical limitation of tuned passive filters. A new conditioner named smart impedance is proposed to eliminate the need of passive filter tuning procedure, the whole tuning process is performed electronically. The proposed topology is able to manipulate the displacement power factor and perform multiple frequency harmonic current mitigation at the same time. In weak systems, where the source impedance is not negligible, like in smart grids, smart impedance guaranties the voltage regulation and stability. The smart impedance control strategy uses proportional resonant controller, which allows phase-locked loop-less power system synchronization. Smart impedance system is composed of an active converter, a coupling transformer, and a capacitive unit, arranged as three phase or single phase equipment.

Abstract: The modern railway system is a massive grid connected complex system with distributed active loads (trains), sources (particularly distributed renewable sources), and storage (wayside or on-board storage systems). Its energy management therefore requires the concepts and techniques used for managing energy in the smart grid (SG). Accordingly, the new railway energy management system (REM-S) is developed to integrate on-board, wayside, and coordination services. REM-S is driven by the idea that regeneration, loads, storage, and volatile distributed energy resources should be coordinated dynamically to achieve optimal energy usage. This paper presents the proposed REM-S architecture, which is based on a hybrid centralized-decentralized concept and developed according to SG architecture model framework.

Abstract: This paper describes the application of advanced metering infrastructure data for developing energy forecasting and operational planning services in distribution networks with significant distributed energy resources. This paper describes development of three services designed for use in distribution network energy management systems. These are comprised of a demand forecasting service, an approach for constraint management in distribution networks, and a service for forecasting voltage profiles in the low voltage network. These services could be applied as part of an advanced distribution network management system in order to improve situational awareness and provide early warning of potential network issues. The methodology and its applicability is demonstrated using recorded supervisory control and data acquisition and smart meter data from an existing medium voltage distribution network.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully distributed reactive power optimization algorithm that can obtain the global optimum solution of nonconvex problems for distribution networks (DNs) without requiring a central coordinator. Second-order conic relaxation is used to achieve exact convexification. A fully distributed second-order cone programming solver (D-SOCP) is formulated corresponding to the given division of areas based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which is greatly simplified by exploiting the structure of active DNs. The problem is solved for each area with very little interchange of boundary information between neighboring areas. D-SOCP is extended by using a varying penalty parameter to improve convergence. A proof of its convergence is also given. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated via numerical simulations using the IEEE 69-bus, 123-bus DNs, and a real 1066-bus distribution system.

Abstract: This paper addresses robust frequency control in an islanded ac microgrid (MG). In an islanded MG with renewable sources, load change, wind power fluctuation, and sun irradiation power disturbance as well as dynamical perturbation, such as damping coefficient and inertia constants, can significantly influence the system frequency, and hence the MG frequency control problem faces some new challenges. In response to these challenges, in this paper, H-infinity and mu-synthesis robust control techniques are used to develop the secondary frequency control loop. In the proposed control scheme, some microsources (diesel engine generator, micro turbine, and fuel cell) are assumed to be responsible for balancing the load and power in the MG system. The synthesized H-infinity and mu-controllers are examined on an MG test platform, and the controllers' robustness and performance are evaluated in the presence of various disturbances and parametric uncertainties. The results are compared with an optimal control design. It is shown that the mu-synthesis approach due to considering structured/parametric uncertainties provides better performance than the H-infinity control method.

Abstract: The responses of multiple distributed generation (DG) units and voltage regulating devices, such as tap changers and capacitor banks, for correcting the voltage may lead to operational conflicts and oscillatory transients, where distribution systems are subjected to network reconfiguration and availability of the DG units. Therefore, coordinated voltage control is required to minimize control interactions, while accounting for the impact of structural changes associated with the network. This paper proposes a strategy for coordinating the operation of multiple voltage regulating devices and DG units in medium voltage (MV) distribution systems, under structural changes and DG availability, for effective voltage control. The proposed strategy aids to minimize the operational conflicts by allowing voltage regulating devices to operate in accordance with the priority scheme designed based on the electrical-distance between voltage regulating devices and DG units, while maximizing the voltage support by the DG units. The proposed coordination scheme is designed to enact with an aid of a substation centered distribution management system for online voltage control. The control actions of proposed coordination strategy are tested on a MV distribution system, derived from the state of New South Wales, Australia, through simulations, and results are reported.

Abstract: Internode line impedance values are essential information for achieving coordinated voltage regulation with distributed energy devices. However, in a low-voltage distribution system, these values are difficult to acquire, especially when the devices are installed in an ad hoc manner by individual users. This paper proposes a novel method for automated impedance estimation based on practically available parameters at the terminal nodes. The distributed energy devices measure and transmit the terminal parameters to a host device. Then, the host device estimates the line impedances based on its impedance model and the collected parameters. For practical implementation, the proposed method is built under several assumptions. For example, it is assumed that the phases of terminal voltages are not synchronized owing to communication latency. Instead, only the magnitude value is incorporated during the impedance estimation. The proposed method is verified via a simulation that assumes a realistic environment.

Abstract: The increasing impact of electric vehicles on distribution networks can be alleviated by smart charging-the shifting of electric vehicle load to times when there is available capacity in the network. This work presents a market mechanism for smart charging that optimally allocates available charging capacity in a way that ensures network stability, while at the same time allowing vehicles to express individual preferences regarding their charging rates. Those who want higher rates can receive these, but must pay a higher price. The mechanism takes into account network-specific constraints such as total network load, voltage drop, and phase unbalance. However, since vehicles have differing impacts on these constraints, this leads to unequal access to the available resources (i.e., charging capacity), resulting in an unfair market. An additional constraint can be introduced to level the playing field for all users, but it leads to a reduction in aggregate performance. The mechanism is shown to be efficient and strategy-proof, so users cannot gain an unfair advantage by misrepresenting their preferences. A series of simulations demonstrate the mechanism's behavior and properties. The results open the door to multi-tiered user plans by demand response aggregators.

Abstract: A scenario-based robust energy management method accounting for the worst-case amount of renewable generation (RG) and load is developed in this paper. The economic and robust model is formulated to maximize the total exchange cost while getting the minimum social benefits cost at the same time. Uncertainty of RG and load is described as an uncertain set produced by interval prediction. Then, the Taguchi's orthogonal array (OA) testing method is used to provide possible testing scenarios. A simple, but practical, search strategy based on OA is designed for solving the optimization problem. By optimizing the worst-case scenario, the energy management solution of the proposed model is robust against most of the possible realizations of the modeled uncertain set by Monte Carlo verification. Numerical cases on the typical microgrid system show the effectiveness of the model and solution strategy. In addition, the influence of exchange electricity price and other parameters are also discussed in the cases.

Abstract: Microgrids with distributed generation (DG) provide a resilient solution in the case of major faults in a distribution system due to natural disasters. This paper proposes a novel distribution system operational approach by forming multiple microgrids energized by DG from the radial distribution system in real-time operations to restore critical loads from the power outage. Specifically, a mixed-integer linear program is formulated to maximize the critical loads to be picked up while satisfying the self-adequacy and operation constraints for the microgrids formation problem by controlling the ON/OFF status of the remotely controlled switch devices and DG. A distributed multiagent coordination scheme is designed via local communications for the global information discovery as inputs of the optimization, which is suitable for autonomous communication requirements after the disastrous event. The formed microgrids can be further utilized for power quality control and can be connected to a larger microgrid before the restoration of the main grids is complete. Numerical results based on modified IEEE distribution test systems validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

Abstract: State estimation (SE) for bulk power systems is traditionally formulated and executed as one integrated problem in a control center energy management system. This simultaneous approach may present challenges when the concerned network consists of different types of systems operated by different entities (independent system operator, transmission system operator, or utility). A leading example is provided by hybrid ac/high voltage dc (HVDC) grids. We propose a distributed solution method where the system network is decomposed into several subsystems on which SE problems are executed separately and are iteratively coordinated through updated boundary information. Hybrid ac/HVDC grids naturally decompose into ac and HVDC subsystems. The proposed method uses a Lagrangian relaxation-based approach and block-wise Gauss-Seidel solution technique to arrive at a solution. The paper describes the method in the context of HVDC grids based on voltage source converter (VSC) technology. It presents a unified modeling framework for monopole/bipole converter configurations, parallel converters, converter-less dc buses, and wind farm connections. Illustrations and test cases are drawn using hybrid ac/HVDC grids formed by IEEE 39 and 300 bus ac grid networks along with monopole and bipole VSC HVDC grids.

Abstract: High penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) as moving loads in power system have drawn increasing concerns about their negative impacts. Due to the spatial-temporal random dynamics of EVs, it is a challenge for identification and positioning of the space and time varying impacts. Most previous studies investigated system-wide EV charging demand based on data analysis with deterministic charging location and time. In this circumstance, this paper proposes a probabilistic model for nodal charging demand based on the spatial-temporal dynamics of moving EVs. Following the introduction to the integrated system with graph theory, a spatial-temporal model of moving EV loads is established based on random trip chain and Markov decision process (MDP). The nodal EV charging demands are derived from the charging probabilities of single and multiple EVs. The system studies show that this model is capable to assess the nodal charging demand due to the spatial-temporal distribution of moving EVs.

Abstract: Microgrid control practice has been dominated by droop control for over a decade. The main reason is that droop control can ensure voltage and frequency stability, and proper sharing of the load among distributed generation units without communication links. However, droop control causes undesirable voltage and frequency deviations. Using a dynamic feedback incorporating washout filters, this letter proposes a novel approach to perform power sharing without any communication links, and without compromising voltage and frequency regulation. Simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC environment validate the performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: In this paper, a new and completely distributed algorithm for integrated volt/var control is presented. The algorithm is based on a multiagent system, which provides distributed intelligence to smart grid. The voltage regulator and shunt capacitor controlled by intelligent agents collaborate to determine the optimal setting for the entire system. The optimization objectives include maintaining the system voltage profile within a specified range, minimizing system loss, and reducing the switching of shunt capacitors. To achieve these objectives, an updated agent-based distributed power flow solver is used. The proposed algorithm is validated through the modified IEEE 34 node test feeder.

Abstract: During the holidays, the power load of the East China Grid dropped significantly, resulting in excess capacitive reactive power, which makes the grid voltage increase significantly. For ultra-high voltage alternating current/direct current (UHVAC/DC) hybrid system, restricted by the minimum input number of the alternating current filter (ACF) in the dc converter stations, multiple dc stations that operate at a low-power transmission mode will inject a large capacitive reactive power to 500 kV ac grid, leading to a dramatic voltage rise. In addition, the 1000 kV UHVAC system may also transport a large capacitive reactive power to 500 kV ac grid during the holidays. In this paper, an optimal reactive power control strategy based on multi-dc power modulation has been proposed. It includes two steps. First, the minimized reactive power interchange control strategy which minimizes the reactive power interchange (RPI) between the UHVAC grid and the 500 kV ac grid has been executed. After that, if the grid voltage still exceeds the upper limit, the multi-dc power modulation is used to minimize the RPI between the dc converter stations and the 500 kV ac grid. The example analysis shows that the proposed optimal reactive power control strategy can effectively optimize the reactive power distribution in the UHVAC/DC hybrid system, thus reasonably controling the grid voltage.

Abstract: Characterization of electric loads provides opportunities to incorporate detailed energy usage information into applications such as protection, efficiency certification, demand response, and energy management. This paper proposes a low computational cost, but yet accurate method, to extract signatures for load classification and characterization. Instead of utilizing digital signal processing and frequency-domain analysis, this paper abstracts the similarity of voltage-current (V-I) trajectories between loads and proposes to map V-I trajectories to a grid of cells with binary values. Graphical signatures can then be extracted for many applications. The proposed method significantly reduces the computational cost compared with existing frequency-domain signature extraction methods. Test results show that an average of over 99% of success rate can be achieved using the proposed signatures.

Abstract: This paper investigates the coordinated voltage control problem for smart distribution grid with the integration of distributed generation (DG). By actively participating in voltage control together with under-load tap changer and shunt capacitors, DG can operate more effectively in the distribution network. The objective of the proposed control method is to minimize the active power loss in the distribution system and to decrease the number of switching device operations while maintaining the grid voltage within the allowable range. Nondispatchable and dispatchable DG are both considered in the control method. To solve the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, the trust region sequential quadratic programming method is integrated with the branch and bound approach to iteratively approximate the optimization with trust region guidance. Numerical tests on a standard 10-kV distribution system, a real 10-kV distribution system in the Sichuan province of China, and the IEEE 13-bus demonstrate the applicability of the proposed coordinated voltage control method.

Abstract: Bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) is normally configured as the slack terminal to regulate system bus voltage for dc microgrid operation in grid-tied state. In case of utility grid fault, BIC is disabled and the system changes to operate in islanded state. Localized battery energy storage (BES) voltage regulation mode (VRM) operation is activated to maintain system power balance. Operating mode changes of BES and BIC during islanding and reconnection might result in system voltage fluctuations and undesirable inrush current. Detailed transition procedure, which is crucial, has seldom been discussed in literature. In this paper, multiple-slack-terminal dc microgrid, in which both BIC and BES operate in VRM with droop control, is implemented to ensure smooth transitions between grid-tied and islanded states. BES operating mode change is eliminated, and thus, system bus voltage is actively regulated throughout the transitions. Contactor is installed at BIC dc side to decouple BIC operating mode change and grid connection. A counter is used to ensure bus voltages at both sides of contactor have been matched stably to minimize inrush current. To enhance system control accuracy, multilevel energy management system is carried out. A lab-scale dc microgrid has been developed for experimental verifications.

Abstract: This paper examines operation models of multiple virtual power plants (multiVPPs), aiming at unified management of the multiVPP through VPP central controller, which reveals the controllability of the VPP as source and load in general. Two operation models will be introduced in this paper: 1) VPP dispatch model; and 2) the game theoretic model for multiVPP dispatch. In the VPP dispatch model, considering interactive coordination between VPP and energy consumers, a demand response model based on time-of-use pricing mechanism and interruptible loads is employed. And then the optimal results of VPP dispatch model are applied in the game theoretic model for multiVPP dispatch. During the process of market competition, the bidding strategy of each VPP is determined by its affordable power output and fuel cost. To solve the inherent variability and unpredictability of the renewable generation sources, the multi-time scale rolling scheduling strategy is adopted. Finally, taking the multiVPP, which consists of various distributed generations and battery storage devices, as an example, variables including transferred load, compensation capacity, optimal bidding strategy, and profits for each VPP are obtained. From the analysis of the results, the method serves as a foundation for dispatch of multiVPP.

Abstract: In this paper, a two-stage procedure is proposed in order to solve the centralized self-healing scheme for electrical distribution systems. The considered self-healing actions are the reconfiguration of the distribution grid and, if needed, node and zone load-shedding. Thus, the proposed procedure determines the status of the switching devices in order to effectively isolate a faulty zone and minimize the number of de-energized nodes and zones, while ensuring that the operative and electrical constraints of the system are not violated. The proposed method is comprised of two stages. The first stage solves a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem in order to obtain the binary decision variables for the self-healing scheme (i.e., the switching device status and energized zones). In the second stage, a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem is solved in order to adjust the steady-state operating point of the topology found in the first stage (i.e., correction of the continuous electrical variables and load-shedding optimization). Commercial optimization solvers are used in the first stage to solve the MILP problem and in the second stage to solve the NLP problem. A 44-node test system and a real Brazilian distribution system with 964-nodes were used to test and verify the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Based on fuzzy mathematics theory, this paper proposes a fuzzy multi-objective optimization model with related constraints to minimize the total economic cost and network loss of microgrid. Uncontrollable microsources are considered as negative load, and stochastic net load scenarios are generated for taking the uncertainty of their output power and load into account. Cooperating with storage devices of the optimal capacity controllable microsources are treated as variables in the optimization process with the consideration of their start and stop strategy. Chaos optimization algorithm is introduced into binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to propose chaotic BPSO (CBPSO). Search capability of BPSO is improved via the chaotic search approach of chaos optimization algorithm. Tests of four benchmark functions show that the proposed CBPSO has better convergence performance than BPSO. Simulation results validate the correctness of the proposed model and the effectiveness of CBPSO.

Abstract: Deployment of data generation devices such as sensors and smart meters have been accelerating toward the vision of smart grid. The volume of data to be collected increases tremendously. Secure, efficient, and scalable data collection becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we present a secure and scalable data communications protocol for smart grid data collection. Under a hierarchical architecture, relay nodes [also known as data collectors (DCs)] collect and convey the data securely from measurement devices to the power operator. While the DCs can verify the integrity, they are not given access to the content, which may pave the way for third party providers to deliver value-added services or even the data collection itself. We further present optimization solutions for minimizing the total data collection time.

Abstract: In recent years, power utilities have been designing and implementing wide area measurement system (WAMS) to provide more intelligent monitoring, control, and protection for the power grid. In this paper, a new method is presented for the optimization of the cost of different parts of the WAMS. In this method, the cost of optimal placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and a phasor data concentrator (PDC), as well as their associated communication infrastructure (CI) are simultaneously considered and minimized. For this purpose, the binary imperialistic competition algorithm is used for the optimal placement of PMUs. Dijkstra's single-source shortest-path algorithm is used to obtain the minimum CI cost. It is also used for optimal placement of PDC. Because of the good adaptability of the proposed methodology to understudy problem, the proposed method is implemented in different conditions of the power network such as N - 1 contingency condition (e.g., a single-line outage or a single-PMU outage), and some important and practical considerations are provided. Practical considerations are the availability of preinstalled PMUs in some buses and the availability of the communication links in some parts of the power network. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on different IEEE standard test systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical system model that captures the decision making processes involved in a network of multiple providers and a large number of consumers in the smart grid, incorporating multiple processes from power generation to market activities and to power consumption. We establish a Stackelberg game between providers and end users, where the providers behave as leaders maximizing their profit and end users act as the followers maximizing their individual welfare. We obtain closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game and prove that a unique equilibrium solution exists. In the large population regime, we show that a higher number of providers help to improve profits for the providers. This is inline with the goal of facilitating multiple distributed power generation units, one of the main design considerations in the smart grid. We further prove that there exist a unique number of providers that maximize their profits, and develop an iterative and distributed algorithm to obtain it. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the solutions and to corroborate the results.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel direct load control model for scheduling the air conditioner loads (ACLs) in the Southern China region. The model has two objectives: 1) to minimize the total deviations between the total scheduled and instructed shed ACLs over the entire dispatch horizon; and 2) to minimize the disturbance of the residents' thermal comfort. The primary contribution of this paper is to employ an International Organization of Standard thermal comfort model to precisely estimate the residents' thermal comfort degree. The secondary contribution of this paper is to propose a new optimization algorithm called fuzzy adaptive imperialist competitive algorithm to effectively solve the model. A case study including three major cities in Southern China is conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: The charging load of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is usually modeled with statistic methods such that the internal physical relationship among the charging factors is ignored. In this paper, a diffusion model for charging power of PEVs is proposed. The proposed model considers the interactions among the charging factors in a mathematical way using the physically-based modeling method. The area control error (ACE) correction problem is studied by applying charging power control of PEVs with the proposed model. By considering the practical conditions, a controller is designed to make efficient use of the distributed charging power of PEVs to meet the requirement of ACE correction. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion model and ACE correction method.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal bidding strategy in the day-ahead market of a microgrid consisting of intermittent distributed generation (DG), storage, dispatchable DG, and price responsive loads. The microgrid coordinates the energy consumption or production of its components, and trades electricity in both day-ahead and real-time markets to minimize its operating cost as a single entity. The bidding problem is challenging due to a variety of uncertainties, including power output of intermittent DG, load variation, and day-ahead and real-time market prices. A hybrid stochastic/robust optimization model is proposed to minimize the expected net cost, i.e., expected total cost of operation minus total benefit of demand. This formulation can be solved by mixed-integer linear programming. The uncertain output of intermittent DG and day-ahead market price are modeled via scenarios based on forecast results, while a robust optimization is proposed to limit the unbalanced power in real-time market taking account of the uncertainty of real-time market price. Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a photovoltaic panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator, a battery, and a responsive load show the advantage of stochastic optimization, as well as robust optimization.

Abstract: A key feature of smart grids is the use of demand side resources to provide flexibility to the energy system and thus increase its efficiency. Multienergy systems where different energy vectors such as gas, electricity, and heat are optimized simultaneously prove to be a valuable source of demand side flexibility. However, planning of such systems may be extremely challenging, particularly in the presence of long-term price uncertainty in the underlying energy vectors. In this light, this paper proposes a unified operation and planning optimization methodology for distributed multienergy generation (DMG) systems with the aim of assessing flexibility embedded in both operation and investment stages subject to long-term uncertainties. The proposed approach reflects real options thinking borrowed from finance, and is cast as a stochastic mixed integer linear program. The methodology is illustrated through a realistic U.K.-based DMG case study for district energy systems, with combined heat and power plant, electric heat pumps, and thermal energy storage. The results show that the proposed approach allows reduction in both expected cost and risk relative to other less flexible planning methods, thus potentially enhancing the business case of flexible DMG systems.

Abstract: Conventional overcurrent protection schemes for radial distribution systems usually attempt to coordinate a recloser at the beginning of the feeder with the fuses on the laterals. The integration of distributed generation in distribution systems leads to problems related to protection coordination that are difficult to be solved by applying conventional protection techniques. This paper proposes an efficient communication-based protection scheme that implements common directional overcurrent relays instead of reclosers at the line, assisted by intertripping and blocking transfer functions. The proposed protection strategy guarantees selectivity regardless of whether the generating units are connected to the network or not, and can be designed retaining either the fuse-blowing or fuse-saving philosophy. Meaningful conclusions are derived from the application of the scheme on a test distribution system.

Abstract: Self-healing is a key characteristic and goal of smart grid, which is based on the classification of the operating states of the power system. With views to the differences between the distribution and transmission system in terms of the operation model and structural features, an essential difference can appear in the classification of operating states between these two systems. According to the characteristics of distribution system with distributed generations (DGs), a new method based on hierarchical classification is proposed to classify the operating states of distribution system with DGs. In this method, several important performances reflecting the operating conditions of distribution system are regarded as critical attributes, including external stability, reliability, integrity, and economy. Moreover, different transition paths and control targets in different states are proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the classification method, which aim at the safety and reliability of the distribution system operation. Finally, a control strategy based on state classification is presented to support the decision-making for the self-healing distribution system. A case study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the classification method for the operating states of distribution system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a transformative architecture for the normal operation and self-healing of networked microgrids (MGs). MGs can support and interchange electricity with each other in the proposed infrastructure. The networked MGs are connected by a physical common bus and a designed two-layer cyber communication network. The lower layer is within each MG where the energy management system (EMS) schedules the MG operation; the upper layer links a number of EMSs for global optimization and communication. In the normal operation mode, the objective is to schedule dispatchable distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems (ESs), and controllable loads to minimize the operation costs and maximize the supply adequacy of each MG. When a generation deficiency or fault happens in an MG, the model switches to the self-healing mode and the local generation capacities of other MGs can be used to support the on-emergency portion of the system. A consensus algorithm is used to distribute portions of the desired power support to each individual MG in a decentralized way. The allocated portion corresponds to each MG's local power exchange target, which is used by its EMS to perform the optimal schedule. The resultant aggregated power output of networked MGs will be used to provide the requested power support. Test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper describes a fully distributed power dispatch method that can achieve fast frequency recovery and minimal generation cost for autonomous microgrids. The method is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, a subgradient-based consensus algorithm is used to recover frequency. The equal increment rate criteria is incorporated into this algorithm to achieve a minimal regulating cost, obtained by economically distributing power among distributed energy resources. Control signals updated with latest local measurements are executed in each iteration step to speed up the frequency recovery procedure. In the second stage, an average consensus algorithm is applied to resolve frequency oscillations caused by measurement errors. Numerical tests are described to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method and its applicability in the presence of communication time delay is discussed.

Abstract: Microgrid is a new concept for future energy distribution system that enables renewable energy integration. It generally consists of multiple distributed generators that are usually interfaced to the grid through power inverters. For the islanding operation of ac microgrids, two important tasks are to share the load demand among multiple parallel connected inverters proportionately, and maintain the voltage and frequency stabilities. This paper reviews and categorizes various approaches of power sharing control principles. Simultaneously, the control schemes are graphically illustrated. Moreover, various control approaches are compared in terms of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, this paper presents the future trends.

Abstract: This paper presents a new concept based on wavelet design and machine learning applied to nonintrusive load monitoring. The wavelet coefficients of length-6 filter are determined using procrustes analysis and are used to construct new wavelets to match the load signals to be detected, unlike previous work which used previously designed wavelet functions that are special cases of Daubechies filters to suit other nonpower system applications such as communications and image processing. The results of applying the new concept to a test system consisting of four loads have shown that the newly designed wavelet can improve the prediction accuracy compared with that obtained using Daubechies filter of order three while keeping the prominent features of the pattern in the detail levels.

Abstract: Due to various green initiatives, renewable energy will be massively incorporated into the future smart grid. However, the intermittency of the renewables may result in power imbalance, thus adversely affecting the stability of a power system. Frequency regulation may be used to maintain the power balance at all times. As electric vehicles (EVs) become popular, they may be connected to the grid to form a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. An aggregation of EVs can be coordinated to provide frequency regulation services. However, V2G is a dynamic system where the participating EVs come and go independently. Thus, it is not easy to estimate the regulation capacities for V2G. In a preliminary study, we modeled an aggregation of EVs with a queueing network, whose structure allows us to estimate the capacities for regulation-up and regulation-down separately. The estimated capacities from the V2G system can be used for establishing a regulation contract between an aggregator and the grid operator, and facilitating a new business model for V2G. In this paper, we extend our previous development by designing a smart charging mechanism that can adapt to given characteristics of the EVs and make the performance of the actual system follow the analytical model.

Abstract: Integration of centralized wind farms may induce cascading tripping incidents, which brings about critical challenges to secure operation of power grid. One of the major risks is the lack of coordinated voltage/reactive power control for multiple wind farms. Therefore, a robust master-slave two-level coordinated static voltage security region (VSR) is proposed in this paper, along with detailed modeling of the network topology and wind farms to achieve coordination among wind farms. The slave VSR on the wind-farm-side is designed to guarantee the operation of each wind unit within a secure range in order to protect wind units from serious over-voltage and low-voltage problems, whereas the master system-wide VSR aims to coordinate centralized wind farms to ensure security both under normal operating conditions and N - 1 contingency conditions. Furthermore, a hierarchically iterative coordination method is introduced to compute the voltage security range of each wind farm through the iteration process. A modified six-bus system with two wind farms, a real system from Northern China, and a large system with 972 wind units are studied, and results verify the effectiveness of the proposed two-level VSR and the hierarchically iterative coordination method.

Abstract: Clustering methods are increasingly being applied to residential smart meter data, which provides a number of important opportunities for distribution network operators (DNOs) to manage and plan low-voltage networks. Clustering has a number of potential advantages for DNOs, including the identification of suitable candidates for demand response and the improvement of energy profile modeling. However, due to the high stochasticity and irregularity of household-level demand, detailed analytics are required to define appropriate attributes to cluster. In this paper, we present in-depth analysis of customer smart meter data to better understand the peak demand and major sources of variability in their behavior. We find four key time periods, in which the data should be analyzed, and use this to form relevant attributes for our clustering. We present a finite mixture model-based clustering, where we discover ten distinct behavior groups describing customers based on their demand and their variability. Finally, using an existing bootstrap technique, we show that the clustering is reliable. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time in the power systems literature that the sample robustness of the clustering has been tested.

Abstract: Nonlinear preprocessors, including conventional clipping, blanking, joint blanking/clipping, and deep clipping, have been employed to mitigate the impulsive noise in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based power-line communications. Those nonlinear preprocessors are characterized by one or two thresholds, which are optimized to achieve an optimum output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we aim to further improve the output SNR by linearly combining two nonlinear preprocessors. Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed method yields better output SNR and symbol/bit error rate performance than the individual ones.

Abstract: A novel technique for loss of mains (LOM) detection using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data is described in this paper. The technique, known as the peak ratio analysis method (PRAM), improves both sensitivity and stability of LOM protection when compared with prevailing techniques. The technique is based on a rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) measurement from M-class PMUs, but the key novelty of the method lies in the fact that it employs a new "peak-ratio" analysis of the measured ROCOF waveform during any frequency disturbance to determine whether the potentially-islanded element of the network is grid connected or not. The proposed technique is described and several examples of its operation are compared with three competing LOM protection methods that have all been widely used by industry and/or reported in the literature: standard ROCOF phase offset relay and phase angle difference methods. It is shown that the PRAM technique exhibits comparable performance to the others, and in many cases improves upon their abilities, in particular for systems where the inertia of the main power system is reduced, which may arise in future systems with increased penetrations of renewable generation and high voltage dc (HVDC) infeeds.

Abstract: A decentralized and self-optimizing control strategy is proposed for the frequency-power droop type distributed generators (DGs). The main characteristics of the proposed control strategy are the following: 1) it is hierarchical and fully decentralized, i.e., the functions of primary, secondary and tertiary frequency control can be realized locally, with the microgrid centralized controller making communication networks unnecessary and 2) it can make DGs share loads according to the equal incremental principle. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

Abstract: The integration of distributed generation (DG) sources can cause significant impacts on distribution networks, particularly the changes in magnitudes and directions of short circuit currents that may lead to false tripping or fail to trip over-current protection relays in the system. It is expensive and technically challenging to redesign/reconfigure and/or to replace the original protection system for a distribution network. If not appropriately handled, this issue can be a big hurdle before the wide use of DG. Based on the impact analysis of the number of DGs, their locations and capacities upon short circuit currents, this paper presents an optimal DG placement method to maximize the penetration level of DG in distribution networks without changing the original relay protection schemes. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal locations and sizes of DG in distribution networks. Simulation studies have been carried out on a three-feeder test distribution network and a widely used 33-node test system to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Stochastic time delay is a new challenge for communication networks in wide-area damping control (WADC) systems. Uncertainties introduced by stochastic time delays increase the difficulty of modeling, analyzing the stability, and designing the controller. In this paper, a new approach for stability analysis and controller design through expectation modeling is proposed to solve for the uncertainty in wide-area controlled power systems introduced by the effect of a stochastic time delay. In the proposed method, the expectation model that considers the detailed stochastic time delay distribution is derived to accurately model the effect of a communication network on the wide-area control performance. Through a matrix transformation of the expectation model, the eigenvalue of the WADC system that considers time delay can then be calculated; this eigenvalue can be used for analyzing the system stability. A novel expectation model-based controller design procedure is established, through which traditional methods can be applied in the controller design of a power system with a stochastic time delay. Finally, the effectiveness of the stability analysis and controller design methods are validated through simulations in a power system of four generators and two areas with an HVDC link, and a power system with eight generators and 36 buses.

Abstract: Accurate real-time states provided by the state estimator are critical for power system reliable operation and control. This paper proposes a novel phasor measurement unit (PMU)-based robust state estimation method (PRSEM) to real-time monitor a power system under different operation conditions. To be specific, an adaptive weight assignment function to dynamically adjust the measurement weight based on the distance of big unwanted disturbances from the PMU measurements is proposed to increase algorithm robustness. Furthermore, a statistical test-based interpolation matrix H updating judgment strategy is proposed. The processed and resynced PMU information are used as priori information and incorporated to the modified weighted least square estimation to address the measurements imperfect synchronization between supervisory control and data acquisition and PMU measurements. Finally, the innovation analysis-based bad data (BD) detection method, which can handle the smearing effect and critical measurement errors, is presented. We evaluate PRSEM by using IEEE benchmark test systems and a realistic utility system. The numerical results indicate that, in short computation time, PRSEM can effectively track the system real-time states with good robustness and can address several kinds of BD.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) technology has drawn increasing amounts of attention in the last decade. As the world's largest automotive market, China has recently made the electrification of transportation central to its national strategic plan. Because of the unique nature of the vertically regulated power industry, China's massive deployment of PEVs has to face unique challenges that may not be encountered by any other country/region. Therefore, a comprehensive coordinated PEV charging scheme is urgently needed to facilitate the smooth grid integration of PEVs at all levels (e.g., transmission systems, distribution systems, and charging stations). This paper presents detailed mathematical modeling of a novel hierarchical framework for coordinated PEV charging at multiple timescales (i.e., day-ahead and real-time). The proposed three-level (e.g., provincial level, municipal level, and charging station level) PEV charging strategy jointly optimizes system load profile and charging costs while satisfying customer charging requirements. The interrelationships between various levels in terms of energy transaction and information exchange are clearly identified. Case studies on Guangdong Province, China, are carried out and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed hierarchical control framework in reducing system peak demand and charging costs.

Abstract: Current regulation is crucial for operating single-phase grid-connected inverters. The challenge of the current controller is how to fast and precisely track the current with zero steady-state error. This paper proposes a novel feedback mechanism for the conventional proportional integral controller. It allows the steady-state error suppression with no need of additional complex control algorithms such as the synchronous reference frame transformation. Five alternative implementation methods are comparatively evaluated from the viewpoint of the steady-state and dynamic responses. Further, the theoretical analysis done indicates that the widely used P+Resonant control is just a special case of the proposed control solution. The time-domain simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results from a TMS320F2812 DSP-based laboratory prototypes are in good agreement, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed generalized method.

Abstract: A microgrid (MG) can operate in both grid-tied and autonomous mode. Without the support from the public utility, the control of an autonomous MG is more complex due to its poor system inertia. Though energy storage system (ESS) can act as a main power source to maintain system frequency and voltage stability, traditional droop control is usually invalid in practice due to the resistive line of low/medium voltage MG. Virtual impedance control can be a solution to decouple the active and reactive power allocations among ESSs. However, the control bandwidth is reduced since it requires low-pass filters with reduced bandwidth to calculate the average active and reactive power. In this paper, a novel ESSs control method is proposed with V/f droop control (VFDC) and P/Q droop control (PQDC) combined. It can distribute the active and reactive power precisely since the interference of line parameters uncertainty is prevented and system stability is enhanced. The comparison between traditional droop and the hybrid VFDC/PQDC is analyzed based on equivalent circuits. A hybrid VFDC/PQDC-based MG control scheme is proposed and its small-signal stability is analyzed. The proposed method is verified through experimental test on a MG platform with two 100 kVA ESS prototypes.

Abstract: An ultra high voltage (UHV) ac and dc interconnection will become the foundation of China's future smart grid. Due to the wide spread of interconnected regions, the distance between control stations will increase dramatically. Therefore, the communication system's reliability and real-time performance will become increasingly crucial. However, failures of the communication system, such as interruptions, latency, and bit error, are inevitable. This paper uses the UHV grid security and stability defense system (SSDS) as an example to analyze its requirements for communication and the impact of communication failure on the system's performance. The effect of communication latency on the power system's stability is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Based on this analysis, a framework of an UHV grid SSDS considering the risk of the communication system is proposed. A preliminary power system and communication system co-simulation tool is developed to perform a case study. The case study demonstrates that communication latency in the UHV grid changes the control strategy's effectiveness due to a delay in executing the control strategy. Furthermore, communication latency will negatively affect the power grid's stability.

Abstract: This paper presents a load frequency control scheme using electric vehicles (EVs) to help thermal turbine units to provide the stability fluctuated by load demands. First, a general framework for deriving a state-space model for general power system topologies is given. Then, a detailed model of a four-area power system incorporating a smart and renewable discharged EVs system is presented. The areas within the system are interconnected via a combination of alternating current/high voltage direct current links and thyristor controlled phase shifters. Based on some recent development on functional observers, novel distributed functional observers are designed, one at each local area, to implement any given global state feedback controller. The designed observers are of reduced order and dynamically decoupled from others in contrast to conventional centralized observer (CO)-based controllers. The proposed scheme can cope better against accidental failures than those CO-based controllers. Extensive simulations and comparisons are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: New generation of loads and the power factor correction devices of these loads provides an opportunity for distribution system operators to use them as reactive power support. In this paper, the integration of these end-user reactive-power-capable devices is investigated to provide voltage support to the grid. Due to the limitation on the number of smart homes, at first, the effective locations for injecting the reactive power into the distribution system is determined (i.e., Q-C buses) and showed how reactive power resources connected at those buses can be controlled. For control purposes, centralized support distributed voltage control (CSDVC) algorithm is proposed and the distribution system is decomposed into different areas by using e-decomposition. Then Q-C buses, as the candidate buses, for providing reactive power are obtained. Optimum reactive power injection in every candidate bus in each area and tap position of the regulator, if necessary, is calculated by using genetic algorithm. The CSDVC is proposed to cover the inaccuracy of the loads forecasting and the control area centers faults, and also to provide secure reactive power control. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 33 and 69 buses distribution test systems.

Abstract: Development of distributed energy resources introduces high level of interdependency and the need for integrated models in a multienergy system (MES). Moreover, highlighting environmental aspects facilitates electrification in the transportation sector and integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). In this paper, aggregation of PEVs' batteries in parking lots (PL) is considered as a bulk electric storage in MES. The energy hub approach is employed for modeling MES considering PL. Due to the profitable behavior of PL in the reserve market, the energy hub model is modified to consider the reserve sources as ancillary services in the output energy vector. Moreover, the uncertain traffic pattern of PEVs' owners in PL is modeled by a stochastic approach. The numerical results demonstrate the proficiency of the proposed model, determining the changes in the behavior of other MESs elements in the presence of PL.

Abstract: The distribution network operator is usually responsible for increasing the efficiency and reliability of network operation. The target of active loss minimization is in line with efficiency improvement. However, this approach may not be the best way to decrease the losses payments in an unbundled market environment. This paper investigates the differences between loss minimization and loss payment minimization strategies. It proposes an effective approach for decreasing the losses payment considering the uncertainties of electricity prices in a day ahead energy market using energy storage systems and demand response. In order to quantify the benefits of the proposed method, the evaluation of the proposed technique is carried out by applying it on a 33-bus distribution network.

Abstract: As one of the key components of the smart grid, advanced metering infrastructure brings many potential advantages such as load management and demand response. However, computerizing the metering system also introduces numerous new vectors for energy theft. In this paper, we present a novel consumption pattern-based energy theft detector, which leverages the predictability property of customers' normal and malicious consumption patterns. Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate. Therefore, the proposed method does not invade customers' privacy. Extensive experiments on a real dataset of 5000 customers show a high performance for the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an electricity load scheduling problem in a residence. Compared with previous works in which only limited sets of appliances are considered, we classify various appliances into five sets considering their different energy consumption and operation characteristics, and provide mathematical models for them. With these appliance models, we propose an electricity load scheduling algorithm that controls the operation time and energy consumption level of each appliance adapting to time-of-use pricing in order to maximize the overall net utility of the residence while satisfying its budget limit. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is in general, difficult to solve. In order to solve the problem, we use the generalized Benders decomposition approach with which we can solve the MINLP problem easily with low computational complexity. By solving the problem, we provide an algorithm to obtain the optimal electricity load scheduling of various appliances with different energy consumption and operation characteristics in a unified way.

Abstract: The implementation of smart grid permits different system participants (e.g., distributed generations and loads) to interact in a rational and independent behavior to improve the distribution system (DS) performance. Each participant is recognized as a selfish decision maker that selects actions that improve its own payoff leading to conflicts with others. Therefore, further investigations are required to improve the decision making process outcomes. In this paper, a decentralized cooperative algorithm is developed to manage the multiparticipants DS operation. The proposed algorithm has been developed based on a correlated equilibrium game-theoretic approach. The outcomes of the proposed algorithm were compared with the traditional existing "best response" (BR) game-theoretic approach, which was utilized in similar multiparticipants DSs that converge to Nash equilibrium. The proposed algorithm is tested with two different case studies that were selected by the DS operator. The proposed algorithm was verified using a modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder. The test results showed a superior system performance compared with traditional BR techniques.

Abstract: A new multiagent system (MAS) design for fault location, isolation, and restoration in power distribution systems (PDSs) is presented. When there is a fault in the PDS, MAS quickly isolates the fault and restores the service to the fault-free zones. Hierarchical coordination strategy is introduced to manage the agents, which integrate the advantages of both centralized and decentralized coordination strategies. Proposed MAS is composed of zone agents (ZAs), feeder agents (FAs), and substation agents. In this framework, ZA locate and isolate the fault based on the locally available information, and assist the FA for reconfiguration and restoration. FA can solve the restoration problem using the existing algorithms for the 0-1 knapsack problem. A novel Q-learning mechanism is also introduced to support the FA in decision making for restoration. The design is illustrated by the use of case studies of fault location, isolation, and restoration on West Virginia super circuit. The results from the case studies indicate the performance of proposed MAS design.

Abstract: With the development of smart grid, demand-side resources (DSR) will play an increasingly important role in the power balance of supply and demand. In addition, the requirement of a low-carbon smart grid means some policy backgrounds, such as carbon emissions trading (CET), should not be ignored. Under these circumstances, it is a good idea to construct a novel unit commitment (UC) model. This paper proposes a model that not only takes advantage of various resources on the demand side, such as electric vehicles, demand response, and distributed generation, but also reflects the effects of CET on generation schedule. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is applied to solve the problem. In numerical studies, we analyze the impacts of DSR and CET on the results of UC, respectively. In addition, two meaningful experiments are conducted to study the approaches to allocate emission quotas and the effects of price transmission mechanism.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of multitype renewable energy (RE) sources (intermittent energy sources) has become an important feature in smart grid development all over the world. It is internationally recognized that the island (or weak-tie connected) power grids are the best platforms for intermittent energy integration test and demonstration because of their abundant RE resources, scarcity of conventional energy, and technical difficulty with accommodation of intermittent energy. The ongoing research on Hainan (the second biggest island in China) power grid will achieve a comprehensive breakthrough in power grid planning, analysis, scheduling, operation, relay protection, security control, disaster prevention, and other key areas in multitype RE source integration. To be specific, this paper focuses on the key part of the research project-optimal scheduling and complementary operation and a new framework of multitime-frame robust scheduling/dispatch system is first proposed, which is different from most other robust approaches and lays special emphasis on the engineering characteristics of power system operation. Simulation results based on the real data of Hainan power grid show that the approach presented is effective and will be put into online operation in the near future.

Abstract: Since the origin of energy management systems, state estimation applications have aided in automatic power system operations, mainly for transmission systems. Currently, however, smart grid concepts are modifying the behavior of distribution systems through a rapid increase of controllable distributed generators, demand response, and electric vehicles. Consequently, the advanced metering infrastructure is providing a large amount of synchronized metering data with high accuracy and resolution, which favors the development of state estimation procedures to sustain distribution management systems. Therefore, this paper presents the formulation of a novel algorithm for state estimation solution in distribution networks using the Hamiltonian cycle theory, where the network states are quickly obtained through a calculation scheme under the normal operating conditions.

Abstract: With the increased environmental concern, the photovoltaic (PV) generation capacity is growing in today's power systems. As the PV penetration rate increases, the intermittency and uncertainty of PV systems will cause frequency regulation issues. When rapid fluctuations take place, the system requires fast responding regulation to recover the frequency within a short period of time. Traditional power plants with slow dynamics are less capable of tracking the fast-changing regulation signal. In this context, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered as an effective regulation source to respond immediately to frequency deviations. This paper addresses the sizing issue of an aggregated BESS by a series of system level performance tests with different BESS penetration rates. The evaluation criteria are the control performance standards 1 and 2. Response effectiveness of the BESS with different levels of disturbances is also analyzed, with comparison to that of the traditional power plants. The proposed BESS aggregation controller is also validated using software simulations and a hardware testbed.

Abstract: In this paper, an improved control method for multiple bidirectional power converters is proposed to reduce the circulating current and power-sharing deviation among converters when the hybrid ac/dc microgrid operated in island mode, which can enhance the security of parallel converters. First, a unified detection method for circulating current and power-sharing deviation is described. Then, the improved control method for bidirectional converters in hybrid microgrid operated in island mode is presented to reduce circulating current and power-sharing deviation, which includes the droop controller used to achieve automatic power sharing and the improved virtual impedance controller used to further reduce circulating current and power-sharing deviation. At last, simulation and experiment results verified that the proposed control method can simultaneously achieve circulating current reduction and automatic power sharing, and does not decrease the output power capability of converter. The proposed control method is suitable for the configuration that has a specific bus between bidirectional power converters, and the ac bus connected to ac loads and the host grid.

Abstract: Intensive research is being directed at microgrids because of their numerous benefits, such as their ability to enhance the reliability of a power system and reduce its environmental impact. Past research has focused on microgrids that have predefined boundaries. However, a recently suggested methodology enables the determination of fictitious boundaries that divide existing bulky grids into smaller microgrids, thereby facilitating the use of a smart grid paradigm in large-scale systems. These boundaries are fixed and do not change with the power system operating conditions. In this paper, we propose a new microgrid concept that incorporates flexible fictitious boundaries: "dynamic microgrids." The proposed method is based on the allocation and coordination of agents in order to achieve boundary mobility. The stochastic behavior of loads and renewable-based generators are considered, and a novel model that represents wind, solar, and load power based on historical data has been developed. The PG&E 69-bus system has been used for testing and validating the proposed concept. Compared with the fixed boundary microgrids, our results show the superior effectiveness of the dynamic microgrid concept for addressing the self-adequacy of microgrids in the presence of stochastically varying loads and generation.

Abstract: Direct or centralized loading shaping in smart grid has been heavily investigated. However, it is usually not clear how the users are compensated by providing load shaping services. In this paper, we will discuss indirect load shaping in a distributed manner. On one hand, we aim to reduce the users' energy cost by investigating how to fully utilize the battery pack and the water tank for the combined heat and power (CHP) systems. We first formulate the queueing models for the CHP systems and then propose an algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization technique, which does not need any statistical information about the system dynamics. The optimal control actions can be obtained by solving a nonconvex optimization problem. We then discuss when it can be converted into a convex optimization problem. Since the CHP battery pack queue and water tank queue are correlated, the capacity relationship between them is further explored considering different queue weights. On the other hand, based on the users' reaction model, we propose an algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n) to determine the real-time price for the power company to effectively coordinate all the CHP systems and provide distributed load shaping services.

Abstract: This paper aims to model interdependencies between power systems and dispatching data networks, and to analyze the intricate impacts on cascading failures. The functions of communication networks are embedded into dispatching data networks in China, thus we use dispatching data networks in the paper. The structures of dispatching data networks are generally categorized into two types: 1) double-star; and 2) mesh. The correlation of nodes in double-star networks and power systems is "degree to degree,"whereas "degree to betweenness" is the correlation for mesh networks. Furthermore, the interactive model between power grids and dispatching data networks is presented by a dynamic power flow model. Taking the IEEE 39-bus system and China's Guangdong 500-kV system as examples, in the case of random attacks on the interdependent system, simulation results show that the power grid coupled with double-star dispatching data networks has lower probability of catastrophic failures than with the mesh structure, because the double-star dispatching data network has outstanding capability of delivering information even though some communication nodes are out of order. In contrast, under intentional attacks, the decrement of the transmission performance of the double-star network is more serious than that in the mesh network. Therefore, the power system exhibits much higher vulnerability when coupled with the double-star network.

Abstract: When conducting the wind power (WP) planning, it is very important for electric power companies to evaluate the penetration limit of the grid-accommodable WP. This paper proposes a probabilistic method for determining grid-accommodable WP capacity based on the multiscenario analysis. Typical power system operation scenarios are generated from the combination of different WP scenarios and demand scenarios. A power system operation simulation model is proposed and implemented to the generated scenarios. The operation results are further used as the basis of the proposed probabilistic method. The validity and effectiveness of the new method are demonstrated in two cases, i.e., the IEEE 39-bus test system and a real large power system in China, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents an extended state estimation method which allows the identification of unexpected power injections at multiple points of common coupling (PCCs) of power distribution grids. The developed state estimator makes use of a three-phase network modeling where active and reactive power injection levels at PCCs are estimated and checked in real time with the values expected by the system operator. The estimation algorithm applies a sparse tableau formulation in which equality constraints are employed to model power injection assumptions at PCCs. The identification of unexpected power injections is then performed using a methodology based on normalized Lagrange multipliers and geometric tests. Simulations conducted on a modified version of the IEEE 34-node test feeder illustrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach, fostering discussions regarding the future of real-time monitoring on power distribution systems.

In this letter, both single and multiple state variables attacks are considered.

Abstract: A method for the coordination of multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is proposed for voltage control in low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs). The main objective of this method is to solve over-voltage problems with multiple suitably sized energy storage systems. The performance of coordinated control is compared with noncoordinated control using both a real-time digital simulator and a MATLAB model of a real U.K. LVDN with a high installed capacity of solar photovoltaics. This is used to show that coordinated control is robust and effective at preventing voltage rise problems in LVDNs. The proposed coordinated control scheme is able to use the BESSs more evenly, and therefore reduces the costs of battery replacement to the storage operator in terms of both number of batteries and maintenance visits.

Abstract: With introducing demand response provider (DRP) in smart grid paradigm, small consumers can actively participate in various demand response programs, especially price-based programs. This newly important matter can significantly affect the power system problems, such as expansion planning. Accordingly, consideration of small consumers via DRP in long-term market equilibrium can be notably useful. This paper proposes a bi-level game framework with iterating between master and slave level to find the long-term market equilibrium in the pool-based market, including opponent generation companies (GenCos), DRP, and independent system operator (ISO). In the master level, a set of investment decisions are generated. Then, the system information is updated and the market is cleared in the slave level. After evaluating all decision-making options, the ISO selects the best option based on a tradeoff analysis. The proposed method is examined on a system with one DRP and two GenCos under ISOs supervision.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method, called wavelet scale decomposition, for modal analysis of ambient synchrophasor data using orthogonal wavelet bases. Wavelet formulation of the problem enables reliable estimation results even with short data analysis windows that are a few minutes long. Also, in addition to finding the mode frequency and damping ratio of oscillatory modes, the proposed method is able to estimate their mode shapes as well. The method is tested on some archived real phasor measurement unit data sets and on simulations from Kundur two area system. The results show that the proposed method is able to track damping ratio variations in power systems effectively with short analysis windows.

Abstract: A new numerical algorithm for the analysis of single line to ground faults on short overhead transmission lines is presented in this paper. It is based upon synchronized sampling at two line ports, and an accurate fault model including the arcing phenomena and tower footing resistance at the fault point. The core of the algorithm is an efficient nonrecursive parameter estimation method. A dynamic arc model is included in the fault model to represent the arc's interaction with the external power network. The algorithm accurately estimates the arc voltage amplitude, tower footing resistance, and the fault location, simultaneously. The algorithm is derived in the time domain, and is based on the synchronized acquisition of currents and voltages at both line terminals. Case studies based on simulated data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. In particular, the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to synchronization errors, harmonics, line capacitance, and fault resistance were explored with lumped, distributed, transposed, and untransposed line models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a distributed economic dispatch strategy for microgrids with multiple energy storage systems. This strategy overcomes the challenges of dynamic couplings among all decision variables and stochastic variables in a centralized dispatching formulation. The proposed strategy can be implemented in the microgrid central controller as multiple problems with simplified and decomposed formulations. It can also be implemented in the local controllers and managed by the central controller. Numerical studies and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed dispatching systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of various technologies and applications in smart grid implementation, demand response has attracted growing research interests because of its potentials in enhancing power grid reliability with reduced system operation costs. This paper presents a new demand response model with elastic economic dispatch in a locational marginal pricing market. It models system economic dispatch as a feedback control process, and introduces a flexible and adjustable load cost as a controlled signal to adjust demand response. Compared with the conventional "one time use" static load dispatch model, this dynamic feedback demand response model may adjust the load to a desired level in a finite number of time steps and a proof of convergence is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation and boundary calculation using interval mathematics are applied for describing uncertainty of end-user's response to an independent system operator's expected dispatch. A numerical analysis based on the modified Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland power pool five-bus system is introduced for simulation and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. System operators may use the proposed model to obtain insights in demand response processes for their decision-making regarding system load levels and operation conditions.

Abstract: The traditional neutral voltage problem in low-voltage (LV) four-wire multigrounded distribution networks can be aggravated due to an unbalanced allocation of one-phase photovoltaic (PV) units. Inherent limitations restrict the performance of the traditional strategies to mitigate the combined effect of load and PV unbalance. To overcome the shortcoming of traditional approaches, a new dynamic mitigation approach using community energy storage (CES) is proposed in this paper. A power balancing algorithm is developed to perform the balancing operation while minimizing power drawn from the CES. A charge/discharge control strategy is developed that will continuously balance and dynamically adjust the power exchange with the grid in a real time, and mitigate the neutral current and neutral voltage rise. To investigate the applicability of the proposed approach under physical time delays associated with battery and PV systems, a suitable dynamic model is developed. An Australian LV distribution system is used to verify the proposed approach under daylong variations of load and PV, and also during short-term variations of PV output caused by cloud passing.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study the effectiveness of customer engagement plans that clearly specify the amount of intervention in customer's load settings by the grid operator for peak load reduction. We suggest two different types of plans, including constant deviation plans (CDPs) and proportional deviation plans (PDPs). We define an adjustable reference temperature for both CDPs and PDPs to limit the output temperature of each thermostat load and to control the number of devices eligible to participate in demand response program. We model thermostat loads as power throttling devices and design algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan parameters on peak load reduction. Based on the simulation results, we recommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable thermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with similar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple power throttling states, customer engagement plans with less temperature deviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical ON/OFF control, higher temperature deviations are required to achieve similar amount of peak load reduction. Several other interesting tradeoffs and useful guidelines for designing mutually beneficial incentives for both the grid operator and customers can also be identified.

Abstract: This paper addresses the transparent and realistic optimum day-ahead (DA) scheduling for a hybrid power system by explicitly considering the uncertainties. The basic components of the hybrid power system include conventional thermal generators, wind farm, and solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. A set of batteries is available for energy storage and/or discharge. The most critical problem in operating a wind farm or solar PV module is that these renewable energy resources cannot be dispatched in the same manner as conventional plants, because they involve climatic factors such as wind velocity and solar irradiation. This paper proposes the optimal scheduling strategy taking into account the impact of uncertainties in wind, solar PV, and load forecasts, and provides the best-fit DA schedule by minimizing both DA and real-time adjustment costs including the revenue from renewable energy certificates. This strategy consists of a genetic algorithm (GA)-based scheduling and a two-point estimate-based probabilistic real-time optimal power flow. The simulation for the IEEE 30-bus system with the GA and two-point estimate method, and the GA and Monte Carlo simulation have been obtained to test the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategy.

Abstract: Demand response is an essential issue in smart grid. The central problem is balancing the user cost and the social utility. We focus on the multi-objective energy consumption scheduling problem based on the third-party management. The aim is to provide diverse, uniformly-distributed, and accurate solutions to the third-party decision-maker. The novel contribution of this paper is that it provides an exact choice in energy consumption scheduling. First, we investigate the mathematical model, which dispatches the power consumption for different users in different time slots considering the users' preferences. Then, we propose a matrix-encoding scheme. The energy matrix and the demand matrix are the key factors. The constraints are handled based on the dot product of the two matrixes. In addition, we adopt a scheduling algorithm based on Tchebycheff decomposition. We define several metrics to evaluate the quality of the solutions for the decision-maker. The neighbor generation distance is proposed to reflect the convergence. The metric S and the metric C are used to represent the diversity and coverage, respectively. The metric HV is used to give a comprehensive evaluation. The simulation illustrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II in convergence, diversity, and coverage. It obtains a wider search region at a faster search speed than the NSGA-II algorithm.

Abstract: The design of communication infrastructure in cyber physical system (CPS) is of vital importance for proper operations of physical dynamics. In this paper, the scheduling of packet transmission over wireless communication networks in CPS is studied for the purpose of system state stabilization. To measure the effective information amount of different packets, the concept of virtual queue (VQ) is defined based on the delay-tolerant Kalman filtering. VQ-based back pressure algorithm is proposed for the distributed data traffic scheduling. The impact of transmission delays on VQ lengths is also studied for the formulation of distributed scheduling strategy. The scheduling method is then applied in the context of voltage control in microgrid and is demonstrated to achieve better performance than general scheduling algorithm without the awareness of dynamics state. Further numerical simulations of data traffic scheduling considering transmission delay are carried out to demonstrate the validity of the scheduling algorithm, which is established according to VQ lengths affected by transmission time delays.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized multiagent system (MAS) approach for service restoration using controlled distributed generator (DG) islanding. Furthermore, it investigates the impacts of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) facility of the electric vehicles (EVs) for service restoration. Service restoration is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem considering maximization of priority load restored and minimization of switching operations as the multiple objectives and solved using the proposed decentralized MAS approach. Extensive case studies are conducted on 38, 69, and 119 bus distribution systems, and the following advantages of the proposed MAS approach are observed: 1) flexibility-to perform under different DG and EV penetration levels; 2) scalability-to restore service for different size test systems, small as well as large; and 3) robustness-ability to perform efficiently for both single as well as multiple-fault situations. The simulation results also highlight the benefits of V2G feature of EVs for service restoration.

Abstract: Droop control by means of virtual resistance (VR) control loops can be applied to paralleled dc-dc converters for achieving autonomous equal power sharing. However, equal power sharing does not guarantee an efficient operation of the whole system. In order to achieve higher efficiency and lower energy losses, this paper proposes a tertiary control level including an optimization method for achieving efficient operation. As the efficiency of each converter changes with the output power, VR values are set as decision variables for modifying the power sharing ratio among converters. A genetic algorithm is used in searching for a global efficiency optimum. In addition, a secondary control level is added to regulate the output voltage drooped by the VRs. However, system dynamics is affected when shifting up/down the VR references. Therefore, a secondary control for system damping is proposed and applied for maintaining system stability. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method. The results show that the system efficiency is improved by using tertiary optimization control and the desired transient response is ensured with system damping secondary control.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy has become a critical issue in recent years. The future power system is foreseen to depend on distributed energy resource (DER) excessively for continuous load support. Yet, DER providers are also facing limited choices in their produced renewable energy. Massive information and complicated cooperation emerging from involvers intensify issues in terms of efficiency, reliability, and scalability. In this paper, a cloud-based framework is proposed to provide a customer-oriented energy management as a service (EMaaS) for green communities, which are formed as virtual retail electricity providers (REPs) by involved DERs providers. It can be adopted by existing REPs or utilities. For each green community, the multiperiod global cost is minimized to promote renewable energy, and renewable energy consumption is stabilized to enhance integration. A solvable linear programming model is formulated for EMaaS. The case studies results reveal the proposed EMaaS retains satisfactory performances.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a centralized electric vehicles (EVs) recharge scheduling system for parking lots using a realistic vehicular mobility/parking pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We consider two different types of EV based on their mobility/parking patterns: 1) regular EVs; and 2) irregular EVs. An extensive trace-based vehicular mobility model collected from the Canton of Zurich is used for the regular EVs, and a probabilistic pattern built on top of this trace is used for modeling the behavior of irregular EVs. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first EV charging scheduling study in the literature that takes into account a realistic vehicular mobility pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We compare the performance of our proposed system with two well-known basic scheduling mechanisms, first come first serve and earliest deadline first, with regard to two objective functions: 1) maximizing the total parking lot revenue; and 2) maximizing the total number of EVs fulfilling their requirements. Comparison results show that our proposed system outperforms well-known basic scheduling mechanisms with regards to both objectives. Parking lots managing the recharging of a high number of EVs will greatly benefit from using such recharge scheduling systems in the context of smart cities.

Abstract: Microgrids are an effective way to increase the penetration of distributed generation into the grid. They are capable of operating either in grid-connected or in islanded mode, thereby increasing the supply reliability for the end user. This paper focuses on achieving seamless transitions from islanded to grid-connected and vice versa for a single phase microgrid made up from voltage controlled voltage source inverters (VC-VSIs) and current controlled voltage source inverters (CC-VSIs) working together in both modes of operation. The primary control structures for the VC-VSIs and CC-VSIs is considered together with the secondary control loops that are used to synchronize the microgrid as a single unit to the grid. Simulation results are given that show the seamless transitions between the two modes without any disconnection times for the CC-VSIs and VC-VSIs connected to the microgrid.

Abstract: We consider the sequential (i.e., online) detection of false data injection attacks in smart grid, which aims to manipulate the state estimation procedure by injecting malicious data to the monitoring meters. The unknown parameters in the system, namely the state vector, injected malicious data and the set of attacked meters pose a significant challenge for designing a robust, computationally efficient, and high-performance detector. We propose a sequential detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio to address this challenge. Specifically, the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a variety of attacking strategies, and load situations in the power system, and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection delay and robustness to various attacking strategies. For wide-area monitoring in smart grid, we further develop a distributed sequential detector using an adaptive sampling technique called level-triggered sampling. The resulting distributed detector features single bit per sample in terms of the communication overhead, while preserving the high performance of the proposed centralized detector.

Abstract: High levels of penetration of distributed generation and aggressive reactive power compensation may result in the reversal of power flows in future distribution grids. The voltage stability of these operating conditions may be very different from the more traditional power consumption regime. This paper focuses on the demonstration of multistability phenomenon in radial distribution systems with reversed power flow where multiple stable equilibria coexist for the given set of parameters. The system may experience transitions between different equilibria after being subjected to disturbances such as short-term losses of distributed generation or transient faults. Convergence to an undesirable equilibrium places the system in an emergency or in extremis state. Traditional emergency control schemes are not capable of restoring the system if it gets entrapped in one of the low voltage equilibria. Moreover, undervoltage load shedding may have a reverse action on the system and can induce voltage collapse. We propose a novel pulse emergency control strategy that restores the system to the normal state without any interruption of power delivery. The results are validated with dynamic simulations of IEEE 13-bus feeder performed with SystemModeler software. The dynamic models can also be used for characterization of the solution branches via a novel approach, so-called the admittance homotopy power flow method.

Abstract: Micro-grids require active control to maintain quality of service and to interface with the power grid in a bi-directional manner. Further, micro-grids must be justified by environmental, governmental, and economic viability. We present a programmable architecture for active, optimal distributed control of elements of the grid to achieve desired behavior. A unique aspect of this architecture is to include a distributed inductive engine for learning the local dynamics of generators and loads in the micro-grid. It generates feedback laws that are adapted to the current status of the micro-grid, and responds to anomalous events in a resilient manner. An important novelty is that control laws are extracted online for bidirectional discontinuous nonlinear loads by mean field methods from physics outside the standard design methodologies for piecewise linear quadratic controls.

Abstract: Distribution systems are undergoing many enhancements and developments to enable the future smart grid, and distribution system state estimation (DSSE) provides the control centers with the information necessary for several of its applications and operational functions. However, the quality of DSSE typically suffers from a lack of adequate/accurate measurements. Recently, many electric utilities have started to install fairly accurate smart meters throughout their distribution networks, which create an opportunity to achieve higher quality DSSE. However, the signals provided by smart meters are generally not synchronized and the difference between the measurement times of smart meters can be significant. Therefore, a complete snapshot of the entire distribution system may not be available. This paper proposes a method to deal with the issue of nonsynchronized measurements coming from smart meters based on the credibility of each available measurement and appropriately adjusting the variance of the measurement devices. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two IEEE benchmark systems are used. The results show that the proposed method is robust and improves the accuracy of DSSE compared with the traditional DSSE approach.

Abstract: Smart grid, as the next generation of power grid characterized by "two-way" communications, has been paid great attention to realizing green, reliable, and efficient electricity delivery for our future lives. In order to support the two-way communications in smart grid, a large number of smart meters (SMs) should be deployed to customers to report their near real-time data to control center for monitoring purpose. However, this kind of real-time report could disclose users' privacy, bringing down the users' willingness to participate in smart grid. In order to address the challenge, in this paper, by considering the lifetime of SMs as exponential distribution, we propose a diverse grouping-based aggregation protocol with error detection (DG-APED), which employs differential privacy technique into grouping-based private stream aggregation for secure smart grid communications. DG-APED can not only achieve privacy-preserving aggregation, but also perform error detection efficiently when some SMs are malfunctioning. Detailed security analysis shows that DG-APED can guarantee the security and privacy requirements of smart grid communications. In addition, extensive performance evaluation also verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DG-APED.

Abstract: Recent investigations have revealed the susceptibility of phasor measurement units (PMUs) to the time synchronization attack by spoofing its global positioning system (GPS). This paper proposes a cross-layer detection mechanism to fight against simultaneous attacks toward multiple PMUs. In the physical layer, we propose a GPS carrier-to-noise ratio (C/No) based spoofing detection technique. We apply the patch-monopole hybrid antenna to two GPS receivers and compute the difference between the standard deviation of each receiver's C/No. The priori probability of spoofing is calculated from the distributions of the difference. A counter is embedded in the physical layer to identify the most suspicious PMU. In the upper layer, the spoofing attack is considered similarly to the bad data injection toward the power system. A trustworthiness evaluation, which is based on both the physical layer information and power grid measurements, is applied to identify the PMU being attacked. An experiment has been carried to validate the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, a community microgrid with multiple ac and dc microgrids is introduced and analyzed. Individual microgrids with different frequency and voltage requirements would operate as self-controlled entities, which could also cooperate with neighboring microgrids for providing backup operations in the community microgrid. A hierarchical coordination strategy with primary, secondary, and tertiary coordination is proposed for the economic operation of an islanded community microgrid. The hierarchical strategy is also applied to a grid-connected community microgrid and the results are discussed. The simulation results verify that the proposed hierarchical coordination strategy is an effective and efficient way for coordinating microgrid flows in an islanded community microgrid, while maintaining the rated frequency and voltage with each microgrid. The simulation results also demonstrate the economic operation of a grid-connected community microgrid in which individual microgrids operate as autonomous agents, while satisfying the community objectives.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) algorithms manipulate the energy consumption schedules of controllable loads so as to satisfy grid objectives. Implementation of DR algorithms using a centralized agent can be problematic for scalability reasons, and there are issues related to the privacy of data and robustness to communication failures. Thus, it is desirable to use a scalable decentralized algorithm for the implementation of DR. In this paper, a hierarchical DR scheme is proposed for peak minimization based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD). In addition, a time weighted maximization option is included in the cost function, which improves the quality of service for devices seeking to receive their desired energy sooner rather than later. This paper also demonstrates how the DWD algorithm can be implemented more efficiently through the calculation of the upper and lower cost bounds after each DWD iteration.

Abstract: A low-voltage islanded dc microgrid contains a number of renewable energy sources, local loads, and energy storage systems (ESS). To avoid the over-charging and over-discharging situations of ESS, a coordinated control strategy should be used in islanded dc microgrids. In this paper, a novel bus-signaling method (BSM) is proposed to achieve autonomous coordinated performance of system according to different state of charge conditions. Additionally, a secondary coordinated control is introduced to restore the voltage deviation produced by primary control level without decaying coordinated performance. The proposed control algorithm and controller implementation based on BSM are also presented. Finally, real-time simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach by presenting the operation of an islanded dc microgrid in different testing scenarios.

Abstract: To reduce their operational costs, datacenter (DC) operators can schedule large jobs at DCs in different geographical locations with time- and location-varying electricity and bandwidth prices. We introduce a framework and algorithms to do so that minimize electricity and bandwidth cost subject to job indivisibility, deadlines, priorities, and DC resource constraints. In doing so, we provide a way for DC operators to predict their operational costs for different DC placements and capacities, and thus make informed decisions about how to expand their DC network. Our distributed algorithm uses estimated job arrivals and day-ahead electricity prices to optimize over sliding time windows. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a Google DC trace and investigate the effects of different cost and performance criteria. The algorithm leverages heterogeneous job resource requirements and routing and scheduling flexibility: even deadline and indivisibility constraints yield little cost increase, though they significantly improve job completion times and localization at only one DC, respectively. We show that our algorithm reduces the cost much more than optimizing only electricity, only bandwidth, or a combination of resource costs and job completion times.

Abstract: In this paper, a converter-based dc microgrid is studied. By considering the impact of each component in dc microgrids on system stability, a multistage configuration is employed, which includes the source stage, interface converter stage between buses, and common load stage. In order to study the overall stability of the above dc microgrid with constant power loads (CPLs), a comprehensive small-signal model is derived by analyzing the interface converters in each stage. The instability issue induced by the CPLs is revealed by using the criteria of impedance matching. Meanwhile, virtual-impedance-based stabilizers are proposed in order to enhance the damping of dc microgrids with CPLs and guarantee the stable operation. Since droop control is commonly used to reach proper load power sharing in dc microgrids, its impact is taken into account when testing the proposed stabilizers. By using the proposed stabilizers, virtual impedances are employed in the output filters of the interface converters in the second stage of the multistage configuration. In particular, one of the virtual impedances is connected in series with the filter capacitor, and the other one is connected at the output path of the converter. It can be seen that by using the proposed stabilizers, the unstable poles induced by the CPLs are forced to move into the stable region. The proposed method is verified by the MATLAB/Simulink model of multistage dc microgrids with three distributed power generation units.

Abstract: Microgrids can operate in both grid-connected and islanded modes. In order to seamlessly transfer from islanded to grid-connected modes, it is necessary to synchronize microgrid voltage and frequency, and phase to the main grid. However, since the microgrid is often based on power electronic converters, the synchronization process is quite different compared with the quasi-synchronism control in conventional power systems. First, in order to address this concern, the microgrid synchronization criteria are derived. Based on these criteria, a novel distributed active synchronization strategy is proposed, which takes into account not only the fundamental component, but also positive and negative sequences of the harmonic components. This way, a seamless reconnection to the main grid can be performed. The proposed method is implemented in the secondary control level of a hierarchical control structure. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop results show the feasibility of the proposed technique.

Abstract: Proliferation of private distributed energy resources (DERs) necessitates devising effective energy management frameworks. This paper aims at establishing a decentralized model for the optimal dispatch of DERs in smart grids. The objective function is to minimize expected procurement cost of demand while profit of private DER owners is not sacrificed. Unit management modules (UMMs) embedded in private DERs and a central agent are autonomous agents of the model. The approach is iterative. In each iteration, the central agent announces to UMMs its procurement strategy, which contains purchased powers and their prices. Then, UMMs optimize and send back their output power and selling price proposals in the hope of achieving higher profits. The energy service provider (ESP) gathers the bids and modifies the procurement strategy whenever bids are in line with the cost minimization objective. The service provider releases the last procurement strategy in response to which UMMs synchronously update and send back their bids. The mutual interaction between UMMs and ESP is continued to the point in which no further modification in ESP's procurement strategy is experienced. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by its implementation in a system with a few DERs from different types.

Abstract: This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to design a distributed real-time electricity pricing mechanism. Our approach is novel in that it guarantees individual rationality, meaning that it provides suppliers and consumers with a guaranteed incentive to participate in the real-time pricing market. Such an incentive is devised by offering a time-varying, situation-dependent subsidy that guarantees that a supplier/consumer profits by switching from a fixed-price contract to the real-time pricing contract. Although we assume that suppliers and consumers decide supply and demand quantities in a fully distributed manner to maximize their own profit, the proposed mechanism guarantees under moderate conditions that the market converges through an iterative process to a Nash equilibrium that maximizes social welfare. Furthermore, in order to guarantee safe operation of an electrical grid, our pricing mechanism increases stability of load frequency control, and at the same time, achieves supply-demand equilibrium by explicitly taking into account an equality constraint through dual decomposition method. We empirically demonstrate by simulations the individual rationality of the proposed mechanism as well as the convergence to supply-demand equilibrium.

Abstract: It is known that the choice of gain (K) in the Sandia frequency shift (SFS) scheme has direct impacts on the stability of a system with grid-connected distributed generations (DGs). In this paper, a scheduled perturbation technique is proposed to reduce the stability impact of K. In the proposed technique, chopping fraction (cf) is used to compensate for reduction in the value of K, where higher cf values are used to achieve zero nondetection zone (NDZ) under low gain SFS. It is shown by analysis that theoretical reduction of NDZ can be always achieved for a nonzero value of cf. Simulations for single-and multi-DGs systems are performed to verify the analytical analysis. It is shown that an appropriate design of scheduled signal duty cycle (d) is of critical importance to realize the proposed reduction in NDZ. While close synchronization of perturbation signals for multi-DG system is required, a delay of 0.33 s is shown to be tolerated for a two-DG system. Synchronization can be achieved either through locally synchronized timers or by limited communication among DGs. The proposed technique provides an attractive option for systems with high DG penetration by reducing the negative impact of K on stability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of control bandwidth on the stability of loads, which are interfaced through power electronic converters and are fed from a dc power source. When tightly regulated, these loads exhibit a constant power load (CPL) behavior. It is shown here that the ideal CPL assumption, prevalent in literature, may not represent the worst case in real-life applications. If the control bandwidth of the load is sufficiently high, the load behaves like a CPL, and the system stability margin decreases with the increase in output power. However, in a practical range, with a lower control bandwidth, the system stability margin is influenced critically by the converter's characteristic impedance, as well as its output power. Under these conditions, the minimum stability margin may occur at a low-power range.

Abstract: With the bidirectional power flow provided by the Energy Internet, various methods are promoted to improve and increase the energy utilization between Energy Internet and main grid (MG). This paper proposes a novel distributed coordinated controller combined with a multiagent-based consensus algorithm, which is applied to distributed generators in the Energy Internet. Then, the decomposed tasks, models, and information flow of the proposed method are analyzed. The proposed coordinated controller installed between the Energy Internet and MG keeps voltage angles and amplitudes consensus, while providing accurate power-sharing and minimizing circulating currents. Finally, the Energy Internet can be integrated into the MG seamlessly if necessary. Hence, the Energy Internet can be operated as a spinning reserve system. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in an Energy Internet.

Abstract: In this paper, simultaneous control of active power and volt/var is explored with photovoltaic (PV) generators in distribution systems. The PV active power output can be controlled in the load-following mode when sufficient solar power is available to supply a local load, or the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode when a local load is large or injection to the system is allowed. Two selected control approaches, P-Q control in the load-following mode and P-V control in the MPPT mode, are investigated in this paper. The P-Q control is implemented with a relatively simple approach, while the P-V control demands an extra MPPT logic, which is solved based on a power balance between the dc and ac sides in a two-stage PV configuration. The control algorithms are tested with the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder with various system conditions like the presence of multiple PV generators, imbalance, harmonics, and faults. The MATLAB and SimPowerSystems simulation results clearly demonstrate the capability of the proposed control in maintaining the P/V bus as either a P-Q or P-V bus depending on different applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer second-order cone programing (MISOCP) model to solve the optimal operation problem of radial distribution networks (DNs) with energy storage. The control variables are the active and reactive generated power of dispatchable distributed generators (DGs), the number of switchable capacitor bank units in operation, the tap position of the voltage regulators and on-load tap-changers, and the operation state of the energy storage devices. The objective is to minimize the total cost of energy purchased from the distribution substation and the dispatchable DGs. The steady-state operation of the DN is modeled using linear and second-order cone programing. The use of an MISOCP model guarantees convergence to optimality using existing optimization software. A mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) formulation for the original model is also presented in order to show the accuracy of the proposed MISOCP model. An 11-node test system and a 42-node real system were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MISOCP and MILP models.

Abstract: This paper presents the mathematical formulation and control architecture of a stochastic-predictive energy management system for isolated microgrids. The proposed strategy addresses uncertainty using a two-stage decision process combined with a receding horizon approach. The first stage decision variables (unit commitment) are determined using a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming formulation, whereas the second stage variables (optimal power flow) are refined using a nonlinear programming formulation. This novel approach was tested on a modified CIGRE test system under different configurations comparing the results with respect to a deterministic approach. The results show the appropriateness of the method to account for uncertainty in the power forecast.

Abstract: Consumer demand profiles and fluctuating renewable power generation are two main sources of uncertainty in matching demand and supply. This paper proposes a model of the electricity market that captures the uncertainties on both the operator and user sides. The system operator (SO) implements a temporal linear pricing strategy that depends on real-time demand and renewable generation in the considered period combining real-time pricing with time-of-use pricing. The announced pricing strategy sets up a noncooperative game of incomplete information among the users with heterogeneous, but correlated consumption preferences. An explicit characterization of the optimal user behavior using the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution concept is derived. This explicit characterization allows the SO to derive pricing policies that influence demand to serve practical objectives, such as minimizing peak-to-average ratio or attaining a desired rate of return. Numerical experiments show that the pricing policies yield close to optimal welfare values while improving these practical objectives.

Abstract: We illustrate the potential of applying population games in two key related problems in microgrids management: 1) economic dispatch of active and reactive power; and 2) demand response. For the dynamic economic dispatch problem, we present a hierarchical microgrid energy management algorithm able to dispatch active and reactive power dynamically. In the second case, we use an opinion dynamics model, including the market in which the network agents interact. Opinion dynamics considers individuals who shape their beliefs based on information they receive from a subset of the society and offers tools to analyze the outcome of collective decision processes, which apparently can be considered arbitrary. We propose an opinion dynamics model including some desired characteristics, such as prominent agents and environmental incentives.

Abstract: Price-directed demand in smart grids operating within deregulated electricity markets calls for real-time forecasting of the price of electricity for the purpose of scheduling demand at the nodal level (e.g., appliances, machines, and devices) in a way that minimizes energy cost to the consumer. In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naive forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid methodology over the other tested methods with regard to mean absolute error for electricity signal pricing forecasting.

Abstract: Grid integration of wind generation is challenging in view of wind uncertainties and possible transmission congestions. Without considering transmission, a stochastic unit commitment problem was solved in our previous work by modeling aggregated wind as a Markov chain instead of scenarios for reduced complexity. With congestion, wind generation at different locations cannot be aggregated and is modeled as a Markov chain per wind node, and the resulting global states are a large number of combinations of nodal states. To avoid explicitly considering all such global states, interval optimization is synergistically integrated with the Markovian approach in this paper. The key is to divide the generation level of a conventional unit into a Markovian component that depends on the local state, and an interval component that manages extreme nonlocal states. With appropriate transformations, the problem is converted to a linear form and is solved by using branch-and-cut. Numerical results demonstrate that the over conservativeness of pure interval optimization is much alleviated, and the new approach is effective in terms of computational efficiency, simulation cost, and solution feasibility. In addition, solar generation shares a similar uncertain nature as wind generation, and can thus be modeled and solved similarly.

Abstract: As we transition toward a power grid that is increasingly based on renewable resources like solar and wind, the intelligent control of distributed energy resources (DERs) including photovoltaic (PV) arrays, controllable loads, energy storage, and plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) will be critical to realizing a power grid that can handle both the variability and unpredictability of renewable energy sources as well as increasing system complexity. Realizing such a decentralized and dynamic infrastructure will require the ability to solve large scale problems in real-time with hundreds of thousands of DERs simultaneously online. Because of the scale of the optimization problem, we use an iterative distributed algorithm previously developed in our group to operate each DER independently and autonomously within this environment. The algorithm is deployed within a framework that allows the microgrid to dynamically adapt to changes in the operating environment. Specifically, we consider a commercial site equipped with on-site PV generation, partially curtailable load, EV charge stations and a battery electric storage unit. The site operates as a small microgrid that can participate in the wholesale market on the power grid. We report results for simulations using real-data that demonstrate the ability of the optimization framework to respond dynamically in real-time to external conditions while maintaining the functional requirements of all DERs.

Abstract: Active networks require modifications of control logic and fast load/generator shedding actions to preserve system stability in case of the creation of islands. Today, industrial networks are designed to run both in parallel with the grid (if is present) and in islanded mode. The transmission system operator in public networks, on the other hand, does not allow islands. This will change as the detection of separated areas with generation capacity and loads will become crucial for the activation of the required control actions in public networks. Here, we describe an algorithm that automatically selects the events that may cause the system islanding, recognizes the island configuration, and calculates the amount of power to shed (when required). This algorithm is the very core of a power management system both for industrial applications today and for future public networks. It can be used to start all the required reactions to islanding, e.g., frequency control and load-shedding. The algorithm is for general-purpose and it does not require any customization for a specific network. The algorithm is based only on the network topology and it does not require data on the network parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, a strategy that employs an adaptive voltage droop control to achieve accurate reactive power sharing is investigated. Instead of controlling the output voltage of the inverter directly, the voltage droop slope is tuned to compensate for the mismatch in the voltage drops across feeders by using communication links. If the communication channel is disrupted, the controller will operate with the last tuned droop coefficient, which is shown to still outperform the controller with the initial fixed droop coefficient. Also, the net control action of the adaptive droop terms is demonstrated to have a negligible effect on the microgrid bus voltage. Since communication is not used within the tuning control loop, the strategy is inherently immune to delays in communication links. A small-signal model of the proposed controller is presented, and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on a 1.2 kVA prototype microgrid.

Abstract: Designing fair compensation mechanisms for demand response (DR) is challenging. This paper models the problem in a game theoretic setting and designs a payment distribution mechanism based on the Shapley value (SV). As exact computation of the SV is in general intractable, we propose estimating it using a reinforcement learning algorithm that approximates optimal stratified sampling. We apply this algorithm to a DR program that utilizes the SV for payments and quantify the accuracy of the resulting estimates.

Abstract: Of the numerous types of distributed generators (DGs), synchronous DGs represent the most substantial contribution to fault currents and, consequently, have the greatest effect on the operation of the protection system. On the other hand, many types of DGs require power electronic (PE) interfaces at the points where they connect to the grid, which are normally left idle during fault conditions. This paper presents a novel idea for employing the PE interfaces of inverter-based DGs (IBDGs) as a means of managing the fault current contribution of synchronous DGs through the modification of the IBDG current phase angle during fault conditions. This operation enables synchronous DGs and IBDGs to be kept connected to the system during fault conditions but with their contribution to the current having no effect on the magnitude of the fault current. Constraints related to DG locations and capacities are thus relieved. More interestingly, it is demonstrated that larger-capacity IBDGs are more effective for managing the fault current contribution of synchronous DGs, which means that for systems that include synchronous DGs, the availability of more numerous IBDGs would be beneficial.

Abstract: Synchrophasor systems provide an immense volume of data for wide area monitoring and control of power systems to meet the increasing demand of reliable energy. The construction of traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that use manually created rules based upon expert knowledge is knowledge-intensive and is not suitable in the context of this big data problem. This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs. As a proof of concept, an IDS prototype was implemented and validated. The IDS prototype accurately classifies disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks for the distance protection scheme for a two-line three-bus power transmission system.

Abstract: Power-line communication (PLC) has been the main enabler for modernizing the aging electrical power grid. As such, PLC systems have been the subject of intensive research in the community. One of the major aspects of PLC is the link interface, for which orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely adopted. In this paper, we propose the application of orthogonal poly-phase-based multicarrier code division multiple access (OPP-MC-CDMA) due to its inherent better flexibility and signal-envelope properties which can be utilized to further enhance the reliability of PLC signals. The proposed OPP-MC-CDMA system is implemented with a minimum mean square error equalizer and nonlinear preprocessing to overcome the effects of bursty noise and multipath frequency-selective fading commonly experienced in PLC channels. We study the performance of this system in terms of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate with various constellation sizes of OPP codes under different noise scenarios and nonlinear processor's thresholds. For comparison-sake, the performance of the OFDM scheme is included. The results reveal that the proposed approach always provides superior performance over the OFDM one with a maximum output SNR gain of up to 5.25 dB. It is also shown that the performance of the OPP-MC-CDMA technique improves when increasing the constellation size of the OPP codes, which consequently enhances the reliability of PLC.

Abstract: This paper proposes a three-layer optimization and an intelligent control algorithm for a microgrid with multiple renewable resources. A dual heuristic dynamic programming-based system control layer is used to ensure the dynamic performance and voltage dynamics of the microgrid as the system operation conditions change. A local layer maximizes the capability of the photovoltaic (PV) wind power generators and battery systems, and a model predictive control-based device layer increases the tracking accuracy of the converter control. The proposed control scheme, system wide adaptive predictive supervisory control (SWAPSC) smooths the output of PV and wind generators under intermittencies, maintains bus voltage by providing dynamic reactive power support to the grid, and reduces the total system losses while minimizing degradation of battery life span. Performance comparisons are made with and without SWAPSC for an IEEE 13 node test system with a PV farm, a wind farm, and two battery-based energy storage systems.

Abstract: In this paper, an integrated maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller system using a ZigBee wireless communication module is proposed for multimodal power converters as a concept of an intelligent photovoltaic (PV) module of PV power conditioning systems. The proposed scheme can integrate all information under a single host controller to realize low-cost manufacturing. It can also simplify the monitoring and supervision processes through machine-to-machine communications for the smart-grid. The voltage and current information for each module are periodically sampled and transferred to the central inverter (or another host server) through the ZigBee module. After the transmission process, the MPPT control algorithm derives each of the PV voltage reference parameters to return to each PV module accordingly. The technical benefits of the proposed approach is the configuration of a PV-controller system composed of a single digital-signal processor (DSP), low-cost analog controllers, and some mandatory communication peripherals used to monitor the distributed multimodules. Also, the method is quite desirable for supervision and monitoring of the overall system due to its centralized control structure. For the experimental validation of the proposed MPPT control, multiple ZigBee (XBee-PRO series) modules, as well as a DSP, dualmodule solar simulators, and a couple of 50 W dc-dc power conversion hardware prototypes were utilized.

Abstract: This paper presents exact solution methods for analyzing vulnerability of electric power networks to a certain kind of undetectable attacks known as false data injection attacks. We show that the problems of finding the minimum number of measurement points to be attacked undetectably reduce to minimum cut problems on hypergraphs, which admit efficient combinatorial algorithms. Experimental results indicate that our exact solution methods run as fast as the previous methods, most of which provide only approximate solutions. We also present an algorithm for enumerating all small cuts in a hypergraph, which can be used for finding vulnerable sets of measurement points.

Abstract: Utilities are rapidly deploying smart meters that measure electricity usage in real-time. Unfortunately, smart meters indirectly leak sensitive information about a home's occupancy, which is easy to detect because it highly correlates with simple statistical metrics, such as power's mean, variance, and range. To prevent occupancy detection, we propose using the thermal energy storage of electric water heaters already present in many homes. In essence, our approach, which we call combined heat and privacy (CHPr), modulates a water heater's power usage to make it look like someone is always home. We design a CHPr-enabled water heater that regulates its energy usage to thwart a variety of occupancy detection attacks without violating its objective-to provide hot water on demand-and evaluate it in simulation using real data. Our results show that a standard 50-gal CHPr-enabled water heater prevents a wide range of state-of-the-art occupancy detection attacks.

Abstract: Frequency-dependent loads inherently contribute to primary frequency response. This paper describes additional contribution to primary frequency control based on voltage-dependent noncritical (NC) loads that can tolerate a wide variation of supply voltage. By using a series of reactive compensators to decouple the NC load from the mains to form a smart load (SL), the voltage, and hence the active power of the NC load, can be controlled to regulate the mains frequency. The scope of this paper focuses primarily on reactive compensators for which only the magnitude of the injected voltage could be controlled while maintaining the quadrature relationship between the current and voltage. New control guidelines are suggested. The effectiveness of the SLs in improving mains frequency regulation without considering frequency-dependent loads and with little relaxation in mains voltage tolerance is demonstrated in a case study on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution network. Sensitivity analysis is included to show the effectiveness and limitations of SLs for varying load power factors, proportion of SLs, and system strengths.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) not only in high-voltage transmission, but in lower-voltage distribution systems. For a distributed generation (DG) grid, this would require deployment of PMUs at critical locations, which implies accurate phase measurement with the support of a low delay, highly reliable network infrastructure. In the absence of such a network, the most cost-effective solution would be to consider a wireless network to support centralized control for situational awareness in the transmission, as well as the DG grid environment. Therefore, the main objective in this paper is to design and implement a scalable synchrophasor network using wireless LAN technology to assess network performance and requirements under real-world conditions. To achieve this, we have designed an emulation platform that can support physical and medium access control layers. The data communication at the application is based on the IEEE C37.118-2011-2 Standard. By considering a hierarchical network architecture for our testbed implementation, we propose an efficient method to reduce bandwidth, as well as provide capabilities for control and management at each hierarchical level. In addition, an efficient tree-based multihop routing protocol has been designed to match a specific distribution feeder structure. The testbed is then used to access different network configurations under various test conditions.

Abstract: In the smart grid, a neighborhood area network (NAN) is a part of the cyber-physical system that achieves two-way communications between smart meters and meter data management system (MDMS). In this paper, we study the energy efficiency issue for uplink transmissions from NAN gateways to the concentrator connecting the MDMS. Classical power control schemes targeting pure bits/joule energy efficiency for multiaccess wireless networks do not fit in well due to the stringent data rate reliability requirement caused by the massive amount of smart meter data. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical uplink transmission power control scheme for a NAN using a two-level Stackelberg game approach. Focusing on linear receivers, the Stackelberg equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves both data rate reliability and energy efficiency.

Abstract: A wireless data communication system for future microgrids (MGs) is presented in this paper. It is assumed that each MG has a central controller and each distributed generation unit in the MG has a local controller. The communication system is responsible for transmitting and receiving data amongst these controllers. This communication system is based on ZigBee technology, which is a low cost and low power consumption device. However, its main limitation is the low data transfer rate. To reduce the number of data transactions, a data management scheme is presented in this paper. The required data to be transferred are defined and a suitable coding is proposed. Finally, the number of transmitted symbols and the processing time of the proposed data management scheme are numerically analyzed. In addition, the dynamic operation of an MG is evaluated considering the delays that are imposed by this communication system.

Abstract: With the proposition to install a large number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the future power grid, it is essential to provide robust communications infrastructure for phasor data across the network. We make progress in this direction by devising a simple time division multiplexing scheme for transmitting phasor data from the PMUs to a central server. Time is divided into frames and the PMUs take turns to transmit to the control center within the time frame. The main contribution of this paper is a scheduling policy based on which PMU transmissions are ordered during a time frame. The scheduling scheme is independent of the approach taken to solve the PMU placement problem, and unlike strategies devised for conventional communications, it is intended for the power network since it is fully governed by the measure of electrical connectedness between buses in the grid. To quantify the performance of the scheduling scheme, we couple it with a fault detection algorithm used to detect changes in the susceptance parameters in the grid. Results demonstrate that scheduling the PMU transmissions leads to an improved performance of the fault detection scheme compared to PMUs transmitting at random.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming model for provision of flexible demand response (DR) based on thermal energy storage in the form of hot water storage and/or storage in building material. Aggregated residential electro-thermal technologies (ETTs), such as electric heat pumps and (micro-) combined heat and power, are modeled in a unified nontechnology specific way. Day-ahead optimization is carried out considering uncertainty in outdoor temperature, electricity and hot water consumption, dwelling occupancy, and imbalance prices. Building flexibility is exploited through specification of a deadband around the set temperature or a price of thermal discomfort applied to deviations from the set temperature. A new expected thermal discomfort (ETD) metric is defined to quantify user discomfort. The efficacy of exploiting the flexibility of various residential ETT following the two approaches is analyzed. The utilization of the ETD metric to facilitate quantification of the expected total (energy and thermal discomfort) cost is also demonstrated. Such quantification may be useful in the determination of DR contracts set up by energy service companies. Case studies for a U.K. residential users' aggregation exemplify the model proposed and quantify possible cost reductions that are achievable under different flexibility scenarios.

Abstract: Estimating power system states accurately is crucial to the reliable operation of power grids. Traditional weighted least square (WLS) state estimation methods face the rising threat of cyber-attacks, such as false data injection attacks, which can pass the bad data detection process in WLS state estimation. In this paper, we propose a new detection method to detect false data injection attacks by tracking the dynamics of measurement variations. The Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) is used to calculate the distance between two probability distributions derived from measurement variations. When false data are injected into the power systems, the probability distributions of the measurement variations will deviate from the historical data, thus leading to a larger KLD. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 14 bus system using load data from the New York independent system operator with different attack scenarios. We have also tested our method on false data injection attacks that replace current measurement data with historical measurement data. Test results show that the proposed approach can accurately detect most of the attacks.

Abstract: This paper studies iterative distributed algorithms for real-time available transfer capability (ATC) assessment in energy management systems of multiarea power systems. Since ATC calculations can be modeled as a special nonlinear optimal power-flow problem, iterative decomposition-coordination approaches based on constrained augmented Lagrangian methods can be applied. One special distributed scheme, called the auxiliary problem principle method, will be studied for distributed ATC assessment in this paper. A computation framework of this distributed algorithm is investigated. System partition with nonoverlapping and boundary sub-systems will also be studied. Simulations of several IEEE test systems will be conducted to validate the feasibility and the correctness of this distributed ATC. In addition, the real-time monitoring and reaction mechanism of this distributed algorithm will also be demonstrated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the electric vehicle charging coordination (EVCC) problem in unbalanced electrical distribution systems (EDSs). Linearization techniques are applied over a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to obtain the proposed MILP formulation based on current injections. The expressions used to represent the steady-state operation of the EDS take into account a three-phase representation of the circuits, as well as the imbalance of the loads, leading to a more realistic model. Additionally, the proposed formulation considers the presence of distributed generators and operational constraints such as voltage and current magnitude limits. The optimal solution for the mathematical model was found using commercial MILP solvers. The proposed formulation was tested in a distribution system used in the specialized literature. The results show the efficiency and the robustness of the methodology, and also demonstrate that the model can be used in the solution of the EVCC problem in EDSs.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) for residential and small commercial buildings is estimated to account for as much as 65% of the total energy savings potential of DR, and previous work shows that a fully automated energy management system (EMS) is a necessary prerequisite to DR in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel EMS formulation for DR problems in these sectors. Specifically, we formulate a fully automated EMS's rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and argue that this RL problem can be approximately solved by decomposing it over device clusters. Compared with existing formulations, our new formulation does not require explicitly modeling the user's dissatisfaction on job rescheduling, enables the EMS to self-initiate jobs, allows the user to initiate more flexible requests, and has a computational complexity linear in the number of device clusters. We also demonstrate the simulation results of applying Q-learning, one of the most popular and classical RL algorithms, to a representative example.

Abstract: Smart grid users and standardization committees require that utilities and third parties collecting metering data employ techniques for limiting the level of precision of the gathered household measurements to a granularity no finer than what is required for providing the expected service. Data aggregation and data perturbation are two such techniques. This paper provides quantitative means to identify a tradeoff between the aggregation set size, the precision on the aggregated measurements, and the privacy level. This is achieved by formally defining an attack to the privacy of an individual user and calculating how much its success probability is reduced by applying data perturbation. Under the assumption of time-correlation of the measurements, colored noise can be used to even further reduce the success probability. The tightness of the analytical results is evaluated by comparing them to experimental data.

Abstract: Because of the rapid growth of small-scale solar electricity generation over the past few years, forecasting solar power output is becoming more important. However, changes in weather conditions cause solar power generation to be highly volatile. This paper analyses the challenges of solar power forecasting and then presents a similar day-based forecasting tool to do 24-h-ahead forecasting for small-scale solar power output forecasting.

Abstract: Aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have been shown to hold promise as demand response resources. However, the evaluation of these promises has relied on simulations of individual TCLs that make important assumptions about the thermal dynamics and properties of the loads, the end-user's interactions with individual TCLs and the disturbances to their operation. In this paper, we first propose a data-driven modeling strategy to simulate individual TCLs-specifically, household refrigeration units (HRUs)-that allows us to relax some of these assumptions and evaluate the validity of the approaches proposed to date. Specifically, we fit probability distributions to a year-long dataset of power measurements for HRUs and use these models to create more realistic simulations. We then derive the aggregate system equations using a bottomup approach that results in a more flexible [linear time invariant (LTI)] system. Finally, we quantify the plant-model mismatch and evaluate the proposed strategy with the more realistic simulation. Our results show that the effects of invalid assumptions about the disturbances and time-invariant properties of individual HRUs may be mitigated by a faster sampling of the state variables and that, when this is not possible, the proposed LTI system reduces the plant-model mismatch.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power systems into smart grid infrastructures constitutes secure data acquisition to prevent widely explored false data injection attacks. In this paper, we design, implement, and deploy a trusted sensing base (TSB) that enhances the security capabilities of traditional commodity power system sensors via enabling them to encrypt analog ac signals at data acquisition points. Nowadays, data encryption occurs at phasor measurement units (PMUs) after the measurements are sampled and digitalized at the analog-to-digital devices. Through pushing the encryption to within the sensors, TSB reduces the size of trusted computing base for the whole smart grid infrastructure and hence increases its trustworthiness. We have developed a hardware working prototype of TSB in a real-world power system test-bed, including PMUs and energy management systems. Results are very promising for practical real-world deployments. TSB encrypts analog signals on the sensor side and retrieves a very accurate estimate of them on the global positioning system-synchronized control center side with minimal latency.

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to design a market operator (MO) and a distribution network operator (DNO) for a network of microgrids in consideration of multiple objectives. This is a high-level design and only those microgrids with nondispatchable renewable energy sources are considered. For a power grid in the network, the net value derived from providing power to the network must be maximized. For a microgrid, it is desirable to maximize the net gain derived from consuming the received power. Finally, for an independent system operator, stored energy levels at microgrids must be maintained as close as possible to storage capacity to secure network emergency operation. To achieve these objectives, a multiobjective approach is proposed. The price signal generated by the MO and power distributed by the DNO are assigned based on a Pareto optimal solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. By using the proposed approach, a fair scheme that does not advantage one particular objective can be attained. Simulations are provided to validate the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Online closed-loop hierarchical control systems (HCSs) are widely used in power-system operation. Like typical cyber-physical systems, the contingencies on the cyber side of an HCS may lead to inappropriate control commands, which will influence the physical power system. To evaluate the degree to which these inappropriate control commands influence the power system, we propose a cyber-physical equivalent model for HCSs. In this model, the HCS cyber network is abstracted to a directed graph consisting of data nodes and directed branches, and connectivity is described by using a node-branch incidence matrix. Using this strategy, we can describe the general information flow in an HCS using mathematical equations on the basis of which quantitative evaluation can be carried out. Furthermore, by using existing operation records, several kinds of typical cyber-contingencies are also modeled on the basis of which cyber-contingency assessment (cyber-CA) can be implemented by using a model-based approach. Considering the computational efficiency, such an approach keeps only key characteristics of the information flow rather than all features of the cyber network. In the case study, a coordinated secondary-voltage control system is studied as an example. The physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies on different data transmission and processing modules are compared. The results show that the model-based method provides improved efficiency compared with conventional simulation-based methods while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) in power systems poses many research challenges. Research shows that the RES output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Consequently, the direction of the power flow on distribution lines can be reversed during some periods. As the voltage regulator is normally designed for unidirectional power flow, this may cause voltage violations on the distribution feeder. Therefore, most utilities try to set a penetration level (PL) limit for safe operation. On the other hand, time varying and unbalanced loading are the main characteristics of distribution systems. Moreover installation of intermittent and nondispatchable photovoltaic (PV) devices increases the control problems of distribution system. This paper presents an impedance-based monitoring method for detection of distribution system current behavior. It will be shown that by utilizing this monitoring technique, not only the small variation of PV PL can be easily detected, but also some fast transients such as the effect of cloud movement on PV system can be monitored. This monitoring technique employs only local measurements of bus voltages and line current to measure the apparent impedance seen at the installation point. The practical application of measured impedance as a monitoring technique shows its effectiveness for distribution system monitoring in presence of various PV PL.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the effect of integrating battery-based energy storage transportation (BEST) by railway transportation network on power grid operation and control. A time-space network model is adopted to represent transportation constraints. The proposed model integrates the hourly security-constrained unit commitment with vehicle routing problem. The BEST solution provides the locational and hourly charging/discharging schedule of the battery storage system. The mobility of BEST will be of particular interest for enhancing the power system resilience in disaster areas where the transmission grid is congested or on outrage. Two cases are used to simulate the BEST including a six-bus power system linking with a three-station railway system, as well as the IEEE 118-bus systems linking with an eight-station railway system. The results show that under certain conditions, the mobility of battery storage system can economically relieve the transmission congestion and lower the operation costs.

Abstract: Distributed generators (DGs) are being widely deployed in today's power grid. These energy sources are highly variable posing practical challenges for deployment and grid management. In this paper, a novel scalable distributed power dispatch strategy is proposed to effectively manage DGs at the distribution substation level, capitalizing on the recent push to cyber-enable power grid operations. We demonstrate how the inherent separability of the power dispatch problem allows the use of dual decomposition that enables every participating DG to locally compute its dispatch strategy based on simple broadcast data by the utility. Results and comparisons indicate that the DGs are able to rapidly converge to an optimal economical dispatch vector with significantly less concentrated computational effort and communication overhead, promoting security and privacy.

Abstract: Communications network plays a key role in the next-generation microgrid protection schemes, as the protective relays need to communicate with each other to dynamically track their tripping currents due to the time-varying nature of the loads and the distributed generation (DG) outputs. Hence, communications cost and reliability are some of the key factors that need to be considered before deploying a microgrid protection scheme. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a hybrid microgrid protection system, which implements traditional differential protection scheme along with an adaptive microgrid protection scheme. While the differential scheme is more sensitive, yet relies on extensive communications, the adaptive scheme is less sensitive but has low communications load. The joint deployment of these two schemes has the potential to increase the accuracy and precision of the whole protection scheme, while reducing the overall communications cost. Moreover, we propose a preemptive switching algorithm for the microgrid relays, which ensures a seamless transition from differential protection to adaptive protection based on the bit error rate of the communications links. Some illustrative results are provided based on an IEEE 802.16/WiMAX network to justify the proposed hybrid protection scheme.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a set of distributed algorithms for estimating the electro-mechanical oscillation modes of large power system networks using synchrophasors. With the number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the North American grid scaling up to the thousands, system operators are gradually inclining toward distributed cyber-physical architectures for executing wide-area monitoring and control operations. Traditional centralized approaches, in fact, are anticipated to become untenable soon due to various factors such as data volume, security, communication overhead, and failure to adhere to real-time deadlines. To address this challenge, we propose three different communication and computational architectures by which estimators located at the control centers of various utility companies can run local optimization algorithms using local PMU data, and thereafter communicate with other estimators to reach a global solution. Both synchronous and asynchronous communications are considered. Each architecture integrates a centralized Prony-based algorithm with several variants of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We discuss the relative advantages and bottlenecks of each architecture using simulations of IEEE 68-bus and IEEE 145-bus power system, as well as an Exo-GENI-based software defined network.

Abstract: As the current power grid system is upgrading to the smart grid, it becomes more vulnerable to security attacks on its communication subsystem such as the denial-of-service attack. Jamming, as a kind of denial-of service attack, can be applied to interfere the real-time communication in smart grid. In this paper, we analyze the scenario in which the attacker can jam a reduced number of signal channels carrying measurement information in order to manipulate the locational marginal price and create the opportunity for gaining profit, and the defender is able to guarantee a limited number of channels in information delivery. Based on the electricity marketing model, we propose a multiact dynamic game between the attacker and defender, in which the optimal strategies are taken by the two sides to maximize their own profits. We study the gaming process and discuss the prosperities of the outcome. Simulation results present the affect of jamming attack on the electricity prices and the gained profits of the two sides. Moreover, they confirm the optimality of the proposed scheme in pursuing profit.

Abstract: Clarification of the responsibility for carbon emission is fundamental in a carbon-constrained world. Existing statistical methods for carbon emission estimation usually attribute the emission responsibility to the generation side. However, a growing number of analysis across different sectors has pointed out that "consumers" rather than "producers" should be responsible for the CO2 emitted during the production. In power system, it is consumers that create the need for the combustion of fossil fuels and cause substantial carbon emission. In order to account carbon emission from the consumption-based perspective, carbon emission generated by various generators can be seen as a virtual attachment to the power flow and accumulated at the consumer's side. A novel analytical model for carbon emission flow (CEF) is proposed in this paper to quantify the carbon emission accompanying the power delivery process. The newly developed model of CEF can take into account the operational characteristics and the network features of power system, and elaborately characterize the relationship between power delivery and CEF. Some basic concepts of CEF in power networks are defined, and the fundamental characteristics and distribution principles of CEF are analyzed. Furthermore, a novel calculation model for CEF in power networks is proposed. A case study is conducted based on the IEEE 118 bus system to illustrate the calculation process and result of CEF in power system.

Abstract: Critical systems require zero recovery time when a failure occurs in a communications network. The soon to be implemented standard IEC 62439-3 defines the only two protocols, parallel redundancy protocol and high-availability seamless redundancy, which fulfill this requirement and ensure no frame loss in the presence of an error. These protocols also provide a hot-plugging capability, which allows elements to be added to or removed from the network without interrupting communications and the operation of the plant. The electricity sector has adopted these for power utility automation in the recently published IEC 61850-90-4. The challenge is to obtain an efficient approach for use in electronic devices, capable of managing the characteristic duplicates, and circulating frames of these protocols, coupled with agile architectures capable of dealing with real-time processing requirements, fast switching times, high throughput, and deterministic behavior. The main contribution of this paper is the in-depth analysis it makes of network parameters imposed by the application of the protocols to power utility automation, and the proposition of a frame management system based on a segmented memory system that improves frame detecting time and uses the smallest memory required in order to resolve all the issues dealt with.

Abstract: This paper proposed a methodology to identify the vulnerable components, and ensure the resilient operation of coordinated electricity and natural gas infrastructures considering multiple disruptions within the microgrid. The microgrid demands, which consist of electricity and heat demands, are served by the interdependent electricity and natural gas supplies. The proposed approach addressed the vulnerability of multiple energy carrier microgrids against various interdictions, which is used to apply preventive reinforcements to increase the resilience of energy supply and decrease the operation cost. The proposed methodology is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem to address the optimal and secure operation of multiple energy carrier microgrids. The interdependence between natural gas and electricity infrastructures is addressed to show the effectiveness of the presented methodology in improving the resilience of generation and demand scheduling against deliberate actions causing disruptions in the interdependent energy infrastructures in multiple energy carrier microgrids.

Abstract: With ongoing smart grid activities, advancements in information and communication technology coupled with development of sensors are utilized for better situational awareness, decision support, and control of the power grid. However, it is critical to understand the complex interdependencies between cyber and power domains, and also the potential impacts of cyber events on the power grid. In this paper, the impact of three different possible cyber events on physical power grid have been analyzed using an integrated cyber-power modeling and simulation testbed. Real-time modeling of end-to-end cyber-power systems have been developed with hardware-in-the-loop capabilities. Real-time digital simulator, synchrophasor devices, DeterLab, and network simulator-3 are utilized in this developed testbed with a wide-area control algorithm and associated closed-loop control. DeterLab can be used to model real-life cyber events in the developed cyber-physical testbed. Man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service attacks have been modeled as specific cases for the IEEE standard test cases. Additionally, communication failure impact on the power grid has been analyzed using the testbed.

Abstract: In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) for the optimal power exchanges in a smart network of power microgrids (MGs) is presented. The main purpose is to present an innovative control strategy for a cluster of interconnected MGs to maximize the global benefits. A MPC-based algorithm is used to determine the scheduling of power exchanges among MGs, and the charge/discharge of each local storage system. The MPC algorithm requires information on power prices, power generation, and load forecasts. The MPC algorithm is tested through case studies with and without prediction errors on loads and renewable power production. The operation of single MGs is simulated to show the advantage of the proposed cooperative framework relative to the control of a single MG. The results demonstrate that the cooperation among MGs has significant advantages and benefits with respect to each single MG operation.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal expansion planning model for an energy hub with multiple energy systems. Energy hub represents a coupling among various energy infrastructures for supplying electricity, natural gas, and heating loads. Combined heat and power (CHP) and natural gas furnaces are considered within the energy hub to convert energy into other forms. The multiple energy system planning problem would optimally determine appropriate investment candidates for generating units, transmission lines, natural gas furnaces, and CHPs that satisfy electricity and heating load forecasts and hub system constraints. The system performances associated with reliability, energy efficiency, and emission matrices is evaluated for the identified planning schedules. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiple energy system expansion planning approach based on energy hub.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of rooftop solar power generation is transforming traditionally passive power distribution systems into active ones. High penetration of such devices creates new dynamics for which the current power distribution systems are inadequate. The changing paradigm of power distribution system requires it to be operated as cyber-physical system. A goal-based holonic multiagent system (HMAS) is presented in this paper to achieve this objective. This paper provides details on design of the HMAS for operation of power distribution systems. Various operating modes and associated goals are discussed. Finally, the role of HMAS is demonstrated for two applications in distribution systems. The first one is associated with control of reactive power at solar photovoltaic installations at individual homes for optimal operation of the system. The second deals with the state estimation of the system leveraging different measurements available from smart meters at homes.

Abstract: We develop a graph-theoretic algorithm for localizing the physical manifestation of attacks or disturbances in large power system networks using real-time synchrophasor measurements. We assume the attack enters through the electromechanical swing dynamics of the synchronous generators in the grid as an unknown additive disturbance. Considering the grid to be divided into coherent areas, we pose the problem as to localize which area the attack may have entered using relevant information extracted from the phasor measurement data. Our approach to solve this problem consists of three main steps. We first run a phasor-based model reduction algorithm by which a dynamic equivalent of the clustered network can be identified in real-time. Second, in parallel, we run a system identification in each area to identify a transfer matrix model for the full-order power system. Thereafter, we exploit the underlying graph-theoretic properties of the identified reduced-order topology, create a set of localization keys, and compare these keys with a selected set of transfer function residues. We validate our results using a detailed case study of the two-area Kundur model and the IEEE 39-bus power system.

Abstract: Smart meters are inherent components in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the smart power grid. They are serving as the crucial interfaces through which the cyber, physical, and social domains of the smart grid can interact with each other. Due to the complicated interactions, smart meters may face a large variety of threats. In this paper, we exploit the colored Petri net to describe the information flows among units in a smart meter. Then, we propose a threat model for smart meters. Considering the constrained computation and storage resources of a smart meter, we present a collaborative intrusion detection mechanism against false data injection attack. The proposed scheme can work regardless of changes in a smart meter's software. Numerical results demonstrate the low cost and effectiveness of our proposed intrusion detection mechanism.

Abstract: The integration of cyber communications and control systems into the power grid infrastructure is widespread and has a profound impact on the operation, reliability, and efficiency of the grid. Cyber technologies allow for efficient management of the power system, but they may contain vulnerabilities that need to be managed. One important possible consequence is the introduction of cyber-induced or cyber-enabled disruptions of physical components. In this paper, we propose an online framework for assessing the operational reliability impacts due to threats to the cyber infrastructure. This framework is an important step toward addressing the critical challenge of understanding and analyzing complex cyber-physical systems at scale.

Abstract: Microgrids are a key component in the evolution of the power grid. Microgrids are required to operate in both grid connected and standalone island mode using local sources of power. A major challenge in implementing microgrids is the communications and control to support transition from grid connected mode and operation in island mode. Here, we propose a secure communication architecture to support microgrid operation and control. A security model, including network, data, and attack models, is defined and a security protocol to address the real-time communication needs of microgrids is proposed. The implementation of the proposed security scheme is discussed and its performance evaluated using theoretical and co-simulation analysis, which shows it to be superior to existing protocols.

Abstract: Public-key cryptography (PKC) is widely used in smart grid (SG) communications to reduce the overhead of key management. However, PKC comes with its own problems in terms of certificate management. Specifically, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) need to be maintained and distributed to the smart meters (SMs) in order to ensure security of the communications. The size of CRLs may grow over time and eventually may introduce additional delay, bandwidth, and storage overhead when various applications are run on SG. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for creating customized CRLs with reduced size for IEEE 802.11s-based advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Rather than maintaining a huge-size single CRL that introduces unnecessary search time and storage, the idea is to cluster/group SMs within the AMI network and create CRLs based on these groups. The grouping is mainly done in such a way that they bring together the SMs that will be very likely to communicate so that the CRLs will be kept local to that group. To this end, we propose two novel grouping algorithms. The first algorithm is a bottom-up approach, which is based on the existing routes from the SMs to the gateway. Since the SMs will be sending their data to the gateway through the nodes on the route, this forms a natural grouping. The second approach is a top-down recursive approach, which considers the minimum spanning tree of the network and then divides it into smaller subtrees. Via grouping, the length of the CRL for each SM and the corresponding distribution overhead can be reduced significantly. Simulation results have shown that our approach can maintain a balance between the size of the CRL and the number of signatures generated by CAs while guaranteeing security of the communications.

Abstract: The number of inverter-based distributed power generators connected to the power network has rapidly grown in recent years. The consequence of this phenomenon is an increasingly complex distribution grid requiring advanced and intelligent monitoring and observation tools in order to guarantee satisfactory power quality and reliability. This paper describes a novel power line impedance estimation method implementing an innovative technique based on modifications of the pulse width modulator's pulse pattern on the inverters in order to generate pseudo-random binary sequence-based pilot signals. The stimuli are generated at different locations in the distribution grid and detected at the transformer sub-station, through cross correlation between the received distorted signal and the sequence, the parameters of the propagation channel can be estimated. Simulations in typical grid situations verify that the proposed algorithm is robust to a realistic environment, and would represent a promising grid monitoring and diagnostic tool.

Abstract: Demand response systems in the electricity grid, which rely on two way communication between the consumers and utility, require the transmission of instantaneous energy consumption to utilities. Perfect knowledge of a user's power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. It has been shown that an in-home energy storage system (such as a battery/inverter) that provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without inconvenience can also be used to hide a user's power usage pattern. A fundamental tradeoff exists between the costs saved and the degree of privacy achievable, and in this paper, the tradeoff achievable by a finite capacity battery assuming a zero tolerance for activity delay is studied using a Markov process model for user's demands and instantaneous electricity prices. Due to high computational complexity (continuous state-action space) of the stochastic control model, inner and upper bounds are presented on the optimal tradeoff. In particular, a class of battery charging policies based on minimizing revealing states is proposed to derive achievable privacy-cost savings tradeoff. The performance of this algorithm is compared with lower bounds derived using a greedy heuristic and upper bounds derived using an information theoretic rate distortion approach. The framework proposed is shown to be applicable even when users only desire partial information protection, such as presence/absence of activity or specific appliances they wish to hide. Numerical results based on real electricity and pricing data show that the proposed algorithm performs close to the upper bound demonstrating its efficacy.

Abstract: Large penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) can have a negative impact on the power grid, e.g., increased peak load and losses, that can be largely mitigated using coordinated charging strategies. In addition to shifting the charging process to the night valley when the electricity price is lower, this paper explicitly considers the EV owner convenience that can be mainly characterized by a desired state of charge at the departure time. To this end, the EV charging procedure is defined as an uninterruptible process that happens at a given discrete charging rate and the coordinated charging is formulated as a scheduling problem. The scalable real-time greedy (S-RTG) algorithm is proposed to schedule a large population of EVs in a decentralized fashion, explicitly considering the EV owner criteria. Unlike the majority of existing approaches, the S-RTG algorithm does not rely on iterative procedures and does not require heavy computations, broadcast messages, or extensive bi-directional communications. Instead, the proposed algorithm schedules one EV at a time with simple computations, only once (i.e., at the time the EV connects to the grid), and only requires low-speed communication capability making it suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations with significant EVs penetration and comparative analysis with scheduling policies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Deregulation of the electric power industry has created both wholesale markets and retail markets. Most load forecasting studies in the literature are on the wholesale side. Minimal research efforts have been devoted to tackling the challenges on the retail side, such as limited data history and high customer attrition rate. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to long-term retail energy forecasting in order to feed the forecasts to a conservative trading strategy. We dissect the problem into two sub-problems: 1) load per customer forecasting; and 2) tenured customer forecasting. Regression analysis and survival analysis are applied to each sub-problem respectively. The proposed methodology has been implemented at a fast growing retailer in the U.S., showing superior performance in terms of mean absolute percentage error of hourly demand and daily and monthly energy over a common industry practice that assumes constant customer attrition rate.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive and general optimization-based home energy management controller, incorporating several classes of domestic appliances including deferrable, curtailable, thermal, and critical ones. The operations of the appliances are controlled in response to dynamic price signals to reduce the consumer's electricity bill whilst minimizing the daily volume of curtailed energy, and therefore considering the user's comfort level. To avoid shifting a large portion of consumer demand toward the least price intervals, which could create network issues due to loss of diversity, higher prices are applied when the consumer's demand goes beyond a prescribed power threshold. The arising mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem is solved in an iterative manner rolling throughout the day to follow the changes in the anticipated price signals and the variations in the controller inputs while information is updated. The results from different realistic case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in minimizing the household's daily electricity bill while preserving comfort level, as well as preventing creation of new least-price peaks.

Abstract: Many utilities have the data quality problem with the geographical information system (GIS) records at distribution level. This affects many business functions of a utility, including asset management, outage response, and workforce safety. For correcting connectivity errors in the GIS representation of the distribution network topology, BC Hydro has developed an in-house algorithm. The algorithm leverages smart meter interval measurements and identifies the neighboring meters by voltage profile correlation analysis. It also predicts customers' upstream and downstream location relationship by voltage magnitude comparisons. The output of the algorithm is then compared with the existing GIS records to correct any errors in it. This paper presents in detail the algorithm and the promising testing results within the practical BC Hydro system. Challenges for underground services are demonstrated. The algorithm's potential use for phase detection by collectively leveraging smart meter and feeder meter data is explored. It shows encouraging results when applied in a downstream section of a large feeder.

Abstract: A new open source mapping of IEC 61850-7-2 to web services has been defined and implemented. This letter describes work which is useful for rapidly implementing user interfaces-particularly web-based interfaces-for monitoring and controlling intelligent electronic devices from multiple vendors. The web service mapping has been implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, with a message format in JavaScript Object Notation. This approach requires a simple and ubiquitous software stack for its implementation, which is a significant advantage over existing client-server communications mappings. The use of an open source paradigm allows for the rapid iteration and refinement of the design, implementation, and testing of the internal details of the proposed protocol stack in a collaborative manner. These developments are of immediate interest to users of IEC 61850, and are particularly relevant to the IEC 61850 standardization process.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for planning and investment studies pertaining to the implementation of system-wide conservation voltage reduction (CVR). In the CVR paradigm, optimal voltage profiles at the load buses are determined so as to yield load reductions and hence energy conservation. The system modifications required to operate at such voltages is known to be capital intensive, which is not desirable by investors. Hence, the proposed model determines the system savings and the appropriate price incentives to offer industries such that a minimum acceptable rate of return is accrued. In this model, the industrial facilities are represented by a combination of constant impedance, constant current, and constant power loads. A detailed case study for Ontario, Canada, is carried out considering that industrial loads are investing in voltage optimization to reduce their energy costs. The optimal incentives that need to be offered by the system planner, over a long-term horizon, and across various zones of Ontario, are determined using the presented mathematical model. Furthermore, a comprehensive risk analysis comprising sensitivity studies and Monte Carlo simulations is carried out considering the variations in the most uncertain model parameters.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present methods on real-time event detection and data archival reduction based on synchrophasor data produced by phasor measurement unit (PMU). Event detection is performed with principal component analysis and a second order difference method with a hierarchical framework for the event notification strategy on a small-scale microgrid. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method is more practical and efficient in the combined use of event detection and data archival reduction. The proposed method on data reduction, which is an "event oriented auto-adjustable sliding window method,"implements a curve fitting algorithm with a weighted exponential function-based variable sliding window accommodating different event types. It works efficiently with minimal loss in data information especially around detected events. The performance of the proposed method is shown on actual PMU data from the Illinois Institute of Technology campus microgrid, thus successfully improving the situational awareness of the campus power system network.

Abstract: The many new distributed energy resources being installed at the distribution system level require increased visibility into system operations that will be enabled by distribution system state estimation (DSSE) and situational awareness applications. Reliable and accurate DSSE requires both robust methods for managing the big data provided by smart meters and quality distribution system models. This paper presents intelligent methods for detecting and dealing with missing or inaccurate smart meter data, as well as the ways to process the data for different applications. It also presents an efficient and flexible parameter estimation method based on the voltage drop equation and regression analysis to enhance distribution system model accuracy. Finally, it presents a 3-D graphical user interface for advanced visualization of the system state and events. We demonstrate this paper for a university distribution network with the state-of-the-art real-time and historical smart meter data infrastructure.

Abstract: As the penetration of renewable energy sources is increasing, the long-term voltage stability (LTVS) of fixed-speed induction generators (FSIGs) has raised a major concern for distribution power networks since they will always consume reactive power. When either the voltage profile of the FSIG severely declines due to the load consumption increasing in the nearby area, or the mechanical power of the wind turbine increases owing to the wind speed increasing, the loss of the stable equilibrium point will result in this class of long-term voltage instability problems. Although this problem is a local phenomenon, it may spread to the rest of the system and cause the cascaded blackout. Meanwhile, with massive deployment of synchrophasor technology, it is possible to improve system awareness and enable early warning to detect this class of LTVS problems in real-time. In this paper, a measurement-based algorithm for synchrophasor long-term voltage stability indicator (SLVSI) will be proposed. First, qualitative analysis of this class of LTVS problems is conducted by corresponding bifurcation diagrams and hysteretic curves. Secondly, a measurement- based FSIG equivalent model is proposed by utilizing real-time phasor measurements from synchrophasors. The above concept can be extended to distribution power networks with multiple FSIGs. The entire distribution power grid will be considered as a modified coupled single-port network. By exploring the concept of reactive power response factor, the corresponding Thevenin equivalent parameter of each individual FSIG branch is adjusted based on real-time phasor measurements. Thus, a SLVSI for each individual FSIG can be defined by modifying the conventional L-index. Simulation experiments on two IEEE test systems are performed to validate the accuracy of the proposed SLVSI.

Abstract: The presence of distributed generation (DG) in distribution networks may seriously affect accuracy of the voltage sag based fault location method. An approach toward quantifying the adverse effect of DG on the fault location calculation is described. A series of realistic scenarios is used to illustrate how DG impacts synchrophasor measurements during disturbances. Alternative Transients Program-Electromagnetic Transients Program models are used to obtain steady-state solutions in the time domain, while Sobol's approach to sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the effect of DG and imperfections of measuring instruments on fault location. Various test cases reveal that DG may adversely affect the voltage characteristic and therefore the accuracy of voltage sag based fault location.

Abstract: Modern power grids are becoming more prone to cyberattacks. Even worse, an attacker without the full topology and parameter information of a power grid can still execute a false data injection attack without being detected by the state estimator. This paper proposes an efficient strategy for determining the optimal attacking region that requires reduced network information. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through extensive simulations. This paper introduces a new front in the study of smart grid cyber security: determination of a feasible attacking region by obtaining less network information. This paper is also essential and significant for finding effective protection strategies against false data injection attacks based on the deep understanding of the mechanisms and strategies of the attacks.

Abstract: In order to foster electric vehicle (EV) adoption, there is a strong need for designing and developing charging stations that can accommodate different customer classes distinguished by their charging preferences, needs, and technologies. By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes more congested and, therefore, controlling charging requests should be carefully aligned with the available resources. This paper focuses on an EV charging network equipped with different charging technologies and proposes two frameworks. In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV population is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty fleets. This necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to prevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This framework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer request rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality of service (QoS). The second framework, on the other hand, is more appropriate for smaller networks, in which the objective is to compute the minimum amount of resources required to provide certain levels of QoS to each class. The results show that the proposed frameworks ensure grid reliability and lead to significant savings in capacity planning.

Abstract: The development of distributed generation system and electric vehicles is bound to strain the distribution network. A typical radial distribution feeder suffers from voltage fluctuation and feeder overload in the presence of a large amount of variable renewable generation. This paper presents a concept of enhancing the power handling capacity of distribution networks using dc grid interconnections. Control of both the active and reactive power exchange between the ac feeder and the interconnecting power converter has been proposed for the voltage regulation at the ac feeder terminal. Besides, the dc grid interconnection also allows the introduction of a common storage system that can be shared by the connected ac feeders and the dc grid connection to other renewable energy resources. The increased power handling capacity and improved voltage profile of the ac distribution feeder using the proposed system is shown through time domain simulations on a test system.

Abstract: Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) method requires only one set of voltage and current sensors to be installed at the electrical service entry for load disaggregation and has attracted considerable research interests. NIALM's identity accuracy is closely related to power signatures (PSs) of loads. The current waveform (CW) is a PS which is frequently used. In order to improve CW's discrimination, this letter uses power theory to decompose CW to active and nonactive current. The experimental results indicate that the similarity between different appliances of the proposed PS is lower, compared with the CW and other PSs, leading to better load disaggregation.

Abstract: We utilize a for-profit aggregator-based residential demand response (DR) approach to the smart grid resource allocation problem. The aggregator entity, using a given set of schedulable residential customer assets (e.g., smart appliances), must set a schedule to optimize for a given objective. Here, we consider optimizing for the profit of the aggregator. To encourage customer participation in the residential DR program, a new pricing structure named customer incentive pricing (CIP) is proposed. The aggregator profit is optimized using a proposed heuristic framework, implemented in the form of a genetic algorithm, that must determine a schedule of customer assets and the CIP. To validate our heuristic framework, we simulate the optimization of a large-scale system consisting of 5555 residential customer households and 56 642 schedulable assets using real-pricing data over a period of 24-h. We show that by optimizing purely for economic reasons, the aggregator can enact a beneficial change on the load profile of the overall power system.

Abstract: The evolution toward emerging active distribution networks (ADNs) can be realized via a real-time state estimation (RTSE) application facilitated by the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs). A critical challenge in deploying PMU-based RTSE applications at large scale is the lack of a scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely (i.e., sub-second) delivery of the high volume of synchronized and continuous synchrophasor measurements. We address this challenge by introducing a communication platform called C-DAX based on the information-centric networking (ICN) concept. With a topic-based publish-subscribe engine that decouples data producers and consumers in time and space, C-DAX enables efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery, as well as flexible and scalable (re) configuration of PMU data communication for seamless full observability of power conditions in complex and dynamic scenarios. Based on the derived set of requirements for supporting PMU-based RTSE in ADNs, we design the ICN-based C-DAX communication platform, together with a joint optimized physical network resource provisioning strategy, in order to enable the agile PMU data communications in near real-time. In this paper, C-DAX is validated via a field trial implementation deployed over a sample feeder in a real-distribution network; it is also evaluated through simulation-based experiments using a large set of real medium voltage grid topologies currently operating live in The Netherlands. This is the first work that applies emerging communication paradigms, such as ICN, to smart grids while maintaining the required hard real-time data delivery as demonstrated through field trials at national scale. As such, it aims to become a blueprint for the application of ICN-based general purpose communication platforms to ADNs.

Abstract: Robust control and management of the grid relies on accurate data. Both phasor measurement units and remote terminal units are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is crucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of tampered data-both for preventing attacks that may lead to blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control of current and future grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme based on the Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the conditional covariance test CMIT to learn the structure of the grid. Using the dc power flow model, we show that, under normal circumstances, the Markov graph of the voltage angles is consistent with the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between the calculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Our method can detect the most recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge of the bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state estimator; hence damaging power network control, monitoring, demand response, and pricing scheme. Specifically, under the stealthy deception attack, the Markov graph of phase angles changes. In addition to detecting a state of attack, our method can detect the set of attacked nodes. To the best of our knowledge, our remedy is the first to comprehensively detect this sophisticated attack and it does not need additional hardware. Moreover, it is successful no matter the size of the attacked subset. Simulation of various power networks confirms our claims.

Abstract: The circulating current among the paralleled solid state transformers (SSTs) originated by the line parameter and mismatched output impedance comes into appearance in the islanded operation of the novel microgrid, the future renewable electric energy delivery and management system. In this regard, the aggregated control strategy of both virtual inductance and external inductance is proposed in this paper to suppress circulating current. The "matching concept" regarding the parameter selection of virtual and external inductance is proposed to ensure the reliable operation of the system through constructing the complete small-signal model of SST. On the basis of aggregated control strategy and small-signal model, the adaptive virtual impedance control strategy is finally proposed by introducing the feedback of circulating current into the conventional virtual impedance control. The virtual impedance is adjusted adaptively according to the judgment algorithm to regulate the equivalent output impedance of SST. With this modification, the adjustment ability of virtual impedance control against sudden disturbance is improved and the circulating current is further reduced. The simulation results with nonlinear loading are presented to prove that the proposed control strategy, and the parameters determined by the matching concept substantially reduce the circulating current among SSTs and improve the accuracy of load sharing among SSTs.

Abstract: The active nature of next generation distribution systems requires a highly accurate real-time monitoring for state estimation and situational awareness. This paper considers the problem of robust placement of a limited number of voltage magnitude meters and phasor measurement units for state estimation in an active distribution system comprising topological reconfigurations. The trace of the inverse of the Fisher information matrix is chosen as criterion for the estimation accuracy. For meter placement in a single configuration distribution system, the greedy approach provides a near-optimal solution as well as a theoretical approximation guarantee. However, for meter placement in an active distribution system, a robust approach is required to optimize the worst case estimation accuracy among all possible configurations of the system. In this paper, a simple robust algorithm, called submodular saturation algorithm, for meter placement in active distribution systems is proposed. Numerical results on three different active distribution systems show that the submodular saturation algorithm outperforms the greedy algorithm and the genetic algorithm in most cases, and provides competitive results in other cases.

Abstract: Nowadays, it is a common concern for modern electrical networks and energy management systems to derive an optimal operation management considering energy costs, pollutant emissions, and security, of the system in the presence of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). In this paper, a multiobjective optimization problem is solved to schedule power sources in a typical microgrid, while PEVs are viewed as a stochastic factor. PEVs residing in a city are considered as probable loads and/or generations depending on how they interact with the utility grid. A novel stochastic methodology is used to calculate the 24 h expected power demand and generation of vehicles aggregated in municipal parking lots. The objective functions of the problem are voltage security margin to be maximized and the total power losses, the total electrical energy costs, and the total emissions of power sources, which should be minimized. Based on different scenarios, the impact of PEVs penetration on base load, voltage profile, and also the value of objective functions, are assessed. Numerical results show the effect of different fleets of PEVs, as well as on the operation of future microgrids.

Abstract: A microgrid (MG) is a local energy system consisting of a number of energy sources (e.g., wind turbine or solar panels among others), energy storage units, and loads that operate connected to the main electrical grid or autonomously. MGs provide flexibility, reduce the main electricity grid dependence, and contribute to changing large centralized production paradigm to local and distributed generation. However, such energy systems require complex management, advanced control, and optimization. Moreover, the power electronics converters have to be used to correct energy conversion and be interconnected through common control structure is necessary. Classical droop control system is often implemented in MG. It allows correct operation of parallel voltage source converters in grid connection, as well as islanded mode of operation. However, it requires complex power management algorithms, especially in islanded MGs, which balance the system and improves reliability. The novel reactive power sharing algorithm is developed, which takes into account the converters parameters as apparent power limit and maximum active power. The developed solution is verified in simulation and compared with other known reactive power control methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of defining a day-ahead consumption plan for charging a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs), and following this plan during operation. A challenge herein is the beforehand unknown charging flexibility of EVs, which depends on numerous details about each EV (e.g., plug-in times, power limitations, battery size, power curve, etc.). To cope with this challenge, EV charging is controlled during opertion by a heuristic scheme, and the resulting charging behavior of the EV fleet is learned by using batch mode reinforcement learning. Based on this learned behavior, a cost-effective day-ahead consumption plan can be defined. In simulation experiments, our approach is benchmarked against a multistage stochastic programming solution, which uses an exact model of each EVs charging flexibility. Results show that our approach is able to find a day-ahead consumption plan with comparable quality to the benchmark solution, without requiring an exact day-ahead model of each EVs charging flexibility.

Abstract: Traditionally, distribution network monitoring has been focused on primary substations (i.e., high voltage/medium voltage level), whereas low voltage (LV) network has not been monitored at all. With rapid growth and penetration of distributed energy resources in LV grids, there is growing interest in extending the real-time monitoring to LV level. The framework program FP7 European Project INTEGRIS proposes an integrated real-time LV network monitoring solution and implements it in a cost-efficient way. This solution integrates smart metering data with secondary substation measurements to get a more accurate and real-time view about LV grid, uses "decentralized" distribution management architecture to optimize data flow, and uses International Electrotechnical Commission 61850 Standard-based interfaces to improve interoperability. This paper focuses on information and communications technology perspective, explains the implementation details of this monitoring solution, and presents its functionality/performance testing results from two distribution system operator field trials and from real-time digital simulator laboratory.

Abstract: Recent technological advancements have facilitated the evolution of traditional distribution grids to smart grids. In a smart grid scenario, flexible devices are expected to aid the system in balancing the electric power in a technically and economically efficient way. To achieve this, the flexible devices' consumption data are theoretically recorded, elaborated, and their upcoming flexibility is bid to flexibility markets. However, there are many cases where explicit flexible device consumption data are absent. This paper presents a way to circumvent this problem and extract the potentially flexible load of a flexible device, namely a heat pump (HP), out of the aggregated energy consumption of a house. The main idea for accomplishing this is a comparison of the flexible consumer with electrically similar nonflexible consumers. The methodology is based on machine-learning techniques, probability theory, and statistics. After presenting this methodology, the general trend of the HP consumption is estimated and an hour-ahead forecast is conducted by employing seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average modeling. In this manner, the flexible consumption is predicted, establishing the basis for bidding flexibility in intraday markets, even in the absence of explicit device measurements.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources and demand-side management are expected to become more prevalent in the future electric power system. Coordinating the increased number of grid participants in an efficient and reliable way is going to be a major challenge. A potential solution is the employment of a distributed energy management approach, which uses intelligence distributed over the grid to balance supply and demand. In this paper, we specifically consider the situation in which distributed resources and loads form microgrids within the bulk power system in which the load is supplied by local generation. A distributed energy management approach based on the consensus + innovations method is presented and used to coordinate local generation, flexible load, and storage devices within the microgrid. The approach takes advantage of the fact that, at the optimal allocation settings, the marginal costs given as a function of the power output/consumption need to be equal for all nonbinding network resources. Solutions for single time step, as well as multitime step optimization including intertemporal constraints, are presented.

Abstract: With the spotlight on smart grid development around the world, it is critical to recognize the key factors contributing to changing power system characteristics. This is more apparent in distribution systems with the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and microgrid development. Utilities are also focusing on the reliability and resiliency of the grid. These activities require distribution automation (DA) strategies that take advantage of available technologies while promoting newer solutions. It is necessary to create a roadmap for holistic DA strategies in a smarter grid. Sustainable and resilient grid development is a paradigm shift requiring a new line of thinking in the engineering, operation, and maintenance of the power system. International perspectives on DA are also addressed, with the understanding that one solution will not fit all. Integrating technical, business, and policy decisions into the challenges will generate the development of technologies, standards, and implementation of the overall solution. The challenges in the development of industry standards are also discussed. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities in the changing landscape of the distribution systems. Evolution of technologies and the business case for infrastructure investment in distribution systems are covered in another paper by the same authors.

Abstract: For dc fast charging stations (FCS), short charging time duration is its main advantage over other ac charging stations. However, due to the characteristics of internal resistance of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, if charging request of an EV is near the full state of charge (SoC), its charging time increases significantly. In this paper, considering the impact of requested SoC on charging time, we propose an operation analysis of FCS, where operators of FCS can set a limit on the EVs' requested SoC to obtain maximized revenue. We model the FCS operation as an M/G/S/K queue and incorporate the dc fast charging model into the queuing analysis, as well as the revenue model of FCS. Simulation results indicate that limiting the requested SoC in an overloaded condition at FCS can increase total charged energy and revenue of FCS, as well as decrease the probability of blocking arriving EVs.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the response of an individual consumer with a flexible demand for electricity to exogenous and stochastic electricity prices. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we propose a comprehensive model for which the optimal policy can be explicitly computed. The proposed consumer model features a time varying bound on power consumption, the presence of a nondeferrable load profile, the presence of a load profile that can be deferred up to a deadline, and the possibility of curtailment. Second, we describe the algorithm that, via explicit backward iterations of the Bellman equation, returns the optimal response of such consumer in a very general energy market scenario featuring a correlated/nonstationary price process and multiple energy procurement sources.

Abstract: In this paper, future distribution network operation is discussed under assumption of multimicrogrids (MMGs) concept. The economic operation of MMGs is formulated as an optimization problem. A stochastically and probabilistic modeling of both small-scale energy resources (SSERs) and load demand at each microgrids (MGs) is done to determine the optimal economic operation of each MGs with minimum cost based on the power transaction between the MGs and main grids. The balance between the total power generation in each MGs and the load demand is determined regarding the sold or purchase power either by MG or by main grid. Based on the results, the mean, standard deviation, and probability density function of each generated power with SSERs is determined considering optimization constraints. A statistical analysis for generated power and costs is given. The power interchange between MGs is considered. The particle swarm optimization is applied to minimize the cost function as an optimization algorithm. Results show that it is possible to regulate the power demand and power transaction between each MGs and the main grid. Moreover, it is indicated that the power sharing between MGs with main grid can reduce the total operation cost of the future distribution network.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient noniterative method for distribution state estimation using conditional multivariate complex Gaussian distribution (CMCGD). In the proposed method, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the state variables is obtained in one step considering load uncertainties, measurement errors, and load correlations. In this method, first the bus voltages, branch currents, and injection currents are represented by MCGD using direct load flow and a linear transformation. Then, the mean and SD of bus voltages, or other states, are calculated using CMCGD and estimation of variance method. The mean and SD of pseudo measurements, as well as spatial correlations between pseudo measurements, are modeled based on the historical data for different levels of load duration curve. The proposed method can handle load uncertainties without using time-consuming approaches such as Monte Carlo. Simulation results of two case studies, six-bus, and a realistic 747-bus distribution network show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of speed, accuracy, and quality against the conventional approach.

Abstract: The recent rapid uptake of residential solar photovoltaic installations provides many challenges for electricity distribution networks designed for one-way power flow from the generator to residential customers via transmission and distribution networks. For grid-connected installations, large amounts of generation during low load periods or intermittent generation can lead to a difficulty in balancing supply and demand, maintaining voltage and frequency stability, and may even result in outages due to overvoltage conditions tripping protection circuits. In this paper, we present four control methodologies to mitigate these difficulties using small-scale distributed battery storage. These four approaches represent three different control architectures: 1) centralized; 2) decentralized; and 3) distributed control. These approaches are validated and compared using data on load and generation profiles from customers in an Australian electricity distribution network.

Abstract: Arc faults have always been a concern for electrical systems, as they can cause fires, personnel shock hazard, and system failure. Existing commercialized techniques that rely on pattern recognition in the time domain or frequency domain analysis using a Fourier transform do not work well, because the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the arc signal is not periodic. Instead, wavelet transform (WT) provides a time and frequency approach to analyze target signals with multiple resolutions. In this paper, a new approach using WT for arc fault analysis in dc systems is proposed. The process of detecting an arc fault involves signal analysis and then feature identification. The focus of this paper is on the former. Simulation models are synthesized to study the theoretical results of the proposed methodology and traditional fast Fourier transform analysis on arcing faults. Experimental data from the dc system of a photovoltaic array is also shown to validate the approach.

Abstract: Microgrid allows high penetration of renewable energy sources, and provides technical foundation for the grid connection and operation of distributed generations (DGs). The negative impacts caused by DGs should be reduced inside the microgrid. Photovoltaic (PV) generation is one of the major distributed energy sources, and the performance of PV generation systems connected to microgrid directly affects power quality and other technical indexes of the microgrid. Thus, the research of flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation system has both theoretical significance and practical value. This paper makes a concise exposition on the H-infinity control theory and applies this theory to the flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation systems. This paper focuses on the specific situation where the microgrid is grid tied to the main power grid. We establish the mathematical model of PV generation system and adopt the H-infinity control theory to design a voltage tracking controller. Theoretical analysis proved that our control system is internally stable. Simulations under six different conditions are performed using MATLAB/Simulink, and the results demonstrate that the grid-tied PV generation system using H-infinity controller has high control accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a combination method for the classification of power quality complex disturbances based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and multilabel learning. EEMD is adopted to extract the features of complex disturbances, which is more suitable to the nonstationary signal processing. Rank wavelet support vector machine (rank-WSVM) is proposed to apply in the classification of complex disturbances. First, the characteristic quantities of complex disturbances are obtained with EEMD through defining standard energy differences of each intrinsic mode function. Second, after the optimization of rank-SVM, based on wavelet kernel function, the ranking function, and multilabel function are, respectively, constructed. Lastly, rank-WSVM is applied to classify the complex disturbances. Simulation results and real-time digital simulator tests show that for different signal to noise ratio, the rank-WSVM classification performance of complex disturbances including hamming loss, ranking loss, one-error, coverage, and average precision, is generally better than the other three methods, namely rank-SVM, multilabel naive Bayes, and multilabel learning with backpropagation.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an abstract market model for demand response where a supply function bidding is applied to match power supply deficit or surplus. We characterize the resulting equilibria in competitive and oligopolistic markets and propose distributed demand response algorithms to achieve the equilibria. We further show that the equilibrium in competitive market maximizes social welfare, and the equilibrium in oligopolistic market has bounded efficiency loss under certain mild assumptions. We also propose distributed demand response algorithms to achieve the equilibria.

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust optimization (RO) model for bidirectional dispatch coordination of large-scale plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in a power grid in which the PEVs are aggregated to manage. The PEV aggregators are considered as a type of dispatchable demand response and energy storage resource with stochastic behaviors, and can supply load or provide ancillary services such as regulation reserve to the grid. The proposed RO model is then reformulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming model, which can be solved efficiently. Computer simulations are performed for a power grid with ten generators and three PEV aggregators to validate the economic benefit of the RO model for bidirectional dispatch coordination of the PEVs and the robustness of the RO model to the uncertainty of the PEVs' stochastic mobility behaviors.

Abstract: Distribution system states have become more dynamic due to the integration of intermittent distributed generation/load and bi-directional power flows. The availability of close to real-time distribution system models will help the controls and customer participations in the active distribution networks. A framework using on-line and off-line computing power and data in existing distribution management system to work together and build distribution feeder models for operation purposes is proposed. Simulations and evaluation results of the synergy of big heterogeneous topological and measurement data from systems that have different data formats, polling cycles, and accuracy to establish immediate past and future feeder models are presented. Archived customer meter interval and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data with the same time stamp are used to build quasi dynamic models off-line, and to forecast the states and measurements at the feeder buses. The results are then used in the on-line quasi dynamic state estimations (DySEs). The state tracking capability of two DySE techniques in conjunction with a static state estimator under various data accuracy assumptions is evaluated. Numerical results demonstrate the benefit of data synergy in the improvement of system operation models and network efficiency.

Abstract: Robust-index method is proposed to tackle the challenges of uncertainties caused by customer behavior in order to minimize comfort violation in household load scheduling. Robust indexes for different kinds of loads are developed and integrated into the load scheduling optimization problems in the form of additional constraints, and thus the obtained load schedules are able to reach the expected robust level. The robust-index method is simple in modeling, independent of historical data, and with low additional computational burden. Simulation results verified the validity of the proposed method and demonstrated their application in load scheduling.

Abstract: With the spotlight on smart grid development around the world, it is critical to recognize the key factors contributing to changing power-system characteristics. This is more apparent in distribution systems with the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and microgrid development. Source and load control at the distribution level is a key requirement of the evolving system. These activities require distribution automation (DA) strategies that take advantage of available technologies, while promoting newer solutions. It is necessary to create a roadmap for holistic DA strategies in a smarter grid. Sustainable and resilient grid development is a paradigm shift requiring a new line of thinking in the engineering, operation, and maintenance of the power system. Distributed control architectures based on dynamic load and source data should be explored as a possible solution. This paper discusses a novel approach that integrates protection, control, and monitoring using high-performance computing at the primary distribution substation level. The business case for infrastructure investment in the distribution systems is also discussed. This paper concludes with a discussion on emerging and future technologies for DA to improve the resiliency of a sustainable grid.

Abstract: With anticipated proliferation of electric vehicles and distributed generations in near future, dynamic thermal rating (DTR) as a tool for unlocking network capacities, is becoming critical for distribution network operators. DTR is gaining a great and still growing focus of attention in today's power industries. However, potential benefits of DTR, although have been envisioned to be significant, have not yet been studied quantitatively. This paper intends to comprehensively assess the potential impacts of DTR on the performance of a realistic Finnish distribution network. For doing so, first a step-by-step procedure is devised. Then, weather data and loading information of circuits in the network are gathered by advanced metering infrastructure available in the network. Thereafter, the gathered data are fed to mathematical models provided by the IEEE Standard 738-2006 and component dynamic thermal models to give thermal rating of circuits. The ratings are then used in reliability analysis where likely system states are simulated. This paper is performed for several cases and the results are discussed.

Abstract: There has been an ongoing effort to increase the number of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) devices to improve system observability. When deployed across distribution secondary networks, AMI provides building-level load and consumption information, which can be used to improve grid management strategies. A barrier to implementation is the significant upgrade costs associated with retrofitting existing meters with network-capable sensing. One economic way is to use image processing methods to extract usage information from images of the existing meters. This paper presents a solution that uses online data exchange of power consumption information to a cloud server without modifying the existing electromechanical analog meters. In this framework, a systematic approach to extract energy data from images is applied to replace the manual reading process. A case study is presented where the digital imaging approach is compared to the averages determined by visual readings over a one-month period.

Abstract: Wind energy is highly location-dependent. Many desirable wind resources in North America are located in rural areas without direct access to the transmission grid. By connecting megawatt-scale wind turbines to the distribution system, the cost of building transmission facilities can be avoided and wind power supplied to consumers can be greatly increased; however, integrating megawatt-scale wind turbines on distribution feeders will impact the distribution feeder stability, especially voltage stability. Distributed wind turbine generators (WTGs) have the capability to aid in grid stability if equipped with appropriate controllers, but few investigations are focusing on this. This paper investigates the potential of using real-time measurements from distribution phasor measurement units for a new WTG control algorithm to stabilize the voltage deviation of a distribution feeder. This paper proposes a novel auxiliary coordinated-control approach based on a support vector machine (SVM) predictor and a multiple-input and multiple-output model predictive control on linear time-invariant and linear time-variant systems. The voltage condition of the distribution system is predicted by the SVM classifier using synchrophasor measurement data. The controllers equipped on WTGs are triggered by the prediction results. The IEEE 13-bus distribution system with WTGs is used to validate and evaluate the proposed auxiliary control approach.

Abstract: This paper studies a novel transformer-based solid state fault current limiter (TBSSFCL) for radial distribution network applications. The proposed TBSSFCL is capable of controlling the magnitude of fault current. In order to control the fault current, primary winding of an isolating transformer is connected in series with the line and the secondary side is connected to a reactor, paralleled with a bypass switch which is made of anti-parallel insulated gate bipolar transistors. By controlling the magnitude of ac reactor current, the fault current is reduced and voltage of the point of common coupling is kept at an acceptable level. Also, by this TBSSFCL, switching overvoltage is reduced significantly. The proposed TBSSFCL can improve the power quality factors and also, due to its simple structure, the cost is relatively low. Laboratory results are also presented to verify the simulation and theoretical studies. It is shown that this TBSSFCL can limit the fault current with negligible delay, smooth the fault current waveform, and improve the power quality.

Abstract: Distribution utilities are becoming increasingly aware that their networks may struggle to accommodate a large number of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), especially at times of peak loading. In this paper, a centralized scheduling scheme is formulated to coordinate charging of a heterogeneous PEV fleet, which is then divided into load groups, each with a set of local objectives, constraints, and a decentralized control algorithm. Realistic energy tariffs are used to formulate probable "real-world" objectives for each load group, and a distributed dynamic program is used to regulate the net load of each load group. It is shown that charging coordination not only reduces peak network loads, but can also significantly reduce the customer's PEV charging cost. Potential improvements from the perspective of communication and modeling are also highlighted by adopting a systematic approach to divide the PEV fleet into load groups.

Abstract: Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) initiatives are a popular tool to incorporate changes for modernizing the electricity grid, reduce peak loads, and meet energy efficiency targets. There is the looming issue of how to communicate and handle consumer data collected by electric utilities and manage limited communication network resources. Several data relay points are required to collect data distributedly and send them through a communication backhaul. This paper studies the smart meter message concatenation (SMMC) problem of how to efficiently concatenate multiple small smart metering messages arriving at data concentrator units in order to reduce protocol overhead and thus network utilization. This problem needs to deal with the added constraint that each originating message from its source may have its own stated deadline that must be taken into account during the concatenation process. This paper provides hardness results for the SMMC problem, and proposes six heuristics and evaluates them to gain a better understanding of the best data volume reduction policies that can be applied at data concentrators of AMI infrastructures. These results are further tested for feasibility under practical settings based on aspects, such as network and processing delays, tightness of application deadlines, and lossy backhaul links.

Abstract: This paper discusses the design and simulation of an integrated load forecasting and state estimation tool for distribution system operations. A predictive database is created and applied to forecast future network states in order to allow short-term (e.g., hours/days ahead) planning to be carried out. The predictive database is based on adaptive nonlinear auto-regressive exogenous (NARX) load estimation and forecasting models, which are continuously updated using feedback from the state estimator. This creates a closed-loop information flow designed to continuously monitor and improve the system state estimation performance by updating and retraining models where appropriate. The aim of this methodology is to improve situational awareness and help to provide network operators with early warning of potential issues, in medium voltage (MV) networks where the number of on-line measurements is limited, and state estimation relies heavily on estimates of power injections. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated through simulation using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and smart meter measurements recorded from an actual MV distribution network.

Abstract: One of the important aspects of smart grid is to make the best use of existing assets. One way (among others) to achieve this objective is by scheduling effective maintenance routines. Abnormal conditions, including short circuits or overloads, would affect not only the exposed components, but also those farther away from the fault locations. This exposure may cause some of the components fail right away or at a later time. Therefore, the severity, frequency, and timings of system faults are important factors in planning maintenance programs. In this paper, the impact of increased current flows, in the form of short circuits and overloads, on component failure rates are studied and a maintenance scheduling model taking into account such impacts is developed. Using the developed model, the optimum mean time to preventive maintenance is derived and used to maximize the components availability. Results of this paper would help in preventing damage to the equipment by optimally scheduling maintenance programs based on short circuit current levels of the system.

Abstract: The development of state estimation (SE) tools for distribution networks is receiving increased attention as the traditionally passive distribution systems have become far more active. The high dimensionality of a distribution system model may lead to very high computation times. This paper addresses these issues and proposes an SE algorithm that analyzes a network which has been split into overlapping zones, enabling parallel application of the algorithm. The algorithm is developed to provide compatibility with distribution system requirements. The novelty of the algorithm lies in its capability to generate feasible solutions for the voltage estimation with a much smaller number of real measurements. The proposed algorithm is referred to as an overlapping zone approach, and has been tested on 356 and 711 node networks.

Abstract: We describe the general concept and practical feasibility of a dc-based open energy system (OES) that proposes an alternative way of exchanging intermittent energy between houses in a local community. Each house is equipped with a dc nanogrid, including photovoltaic panels and batteries. We extend these nanogrids with a bidirectional dc-dc converter and a network controller so that power can be exchanged between houses over an external dc power bus. In this way, demand-response fluctuations are absorbed not only by the local battery, but can be spread over all batteries in the system. By using a combination of voltage and current controlled units, we implemented a higher-level control software independent from the physical process. A further software layer for autonomous control handles power exchange based on a distributed multiagent system, using a peer-to-peer like architecture. In parallel to the software, we made a physical model of a four-node OES on which different power exchange strategies can be simulated and compared. First results show an improved solar replacement ratio, and thus a reduction of ac grid consumption thanks to power interchange. The concept's feasibility has been demonstrated on the first three houses of a full-scale OES platform in Okinawa.

Abstract: High penetrations of photovoltaic (PV) systems within load pockets in distribution grids have changed pure consumers to prosumers. This can cause technical challenges in distribution and transmission grids, such as overvoltage and reverse power flow. Embedding voltage support schemes into PVs, such as standard cos phi(P) characteristic proposed by the German grid codes, may cause more changes in the steady-state behavior of distribution grids and, in turn, the transmission side. Accordingly, it is important to properly model active distribution grids to analyze the system impacts of these changes to plan and operate future smart power grids. However, due to the high dimension of distribution grids, considering a detailed distribution grid to study the transmission side or a fraction of the distribution grid is either cumbersome or impractical. Therefore, it is required to develop a reasonable equivalent that can fairly capture the dominant behavior of the distribution grids. The aim of this paper is to use gray-box modeling concepts to develop a static equivalent of distribution grids comprising a large number of PV systems embedded with voltage support schemes. In the proposed model, the PV systems are aggregated as a separate entity, and not as a negative load, which is traditionally done. The results demonstrate the superior quality of the proposed model compared with the model with PV systems as the negative load.

Abstract: In a multienergy system, there are different types of dependencies among the energy carriers. Internal dependencies refer to possible changes in the energy source in the presence of energy converters and storage, and are managed by the system operator through the control strategies applied to the equipment. External dependencies (EDs) are due to the choice of the energy supply according to customer preferences when alternative solutions are available. This paper introduces a new model of EDs within a multigeneration representation based on energy hubs. EDs are addressed through a stochastic model in order to take into account the possible uncertainty in the customers' decisions. This model is then used to introduce carrier-based demand response (DR) in which the user participates in DR programs aimed at promoting the shifting among different energy sources by preserving the service provided to the end users. The results obtained from the new model in deterministic and stochastic cases indicate the appropriateness and usefulness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h. Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation, the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data. We also find that the parameter values chosen by evolution often provide insights into the interplay between the different datasets and forecast models. Software is available online.

Abstract: Weak grids/microgrids are gaining considerable attention due to the installation of renewable power generation resources in areas that are remote from load centers. This paper presents a multivariable-droop synchronous current converter control strategy for current management of weak grid/microgrid applications, and offers a systematic and straightforward design approach using the loop shaping technique. The controller integrates current regulation, management, and limitation that are applicable to weak grids and microgrids (MGs). The multivariable synchronous current converter enables superior decoupling of d- and q-axis currents in weak grids and/or resistive grids where these control variables are highly coupled due to converter operation at large load-angles. Therefore, stable connection of weak (high impedance) resistive MGs to utility grids is feasible. The multivariable droop concept also realizes real power sharing by simultaneous drooping of both frequency and voltage amplitude, which enhances load sharing accuracy in resistive and/or weak grids. Similar to its predecessor, synchronous converters, the controller can eliminate phase-locked loop (PLL) and provides a unified controller, PLL, and load manager in one simple control methodology. This can facilitate grid auto-synchronization, which can improve the stability of voltage source converters in weak grid applications. Also, the controller can participate in the power system frequency, and voltage regulation and control. To evaluate the performance of the controller, several simulations are conducted under various typical scenarios and conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an event-based protection scheme for a multiterminal dc power system, which includes hybrid energy resources and various loading schemes. The proposed protection scheme transfers less data when compared with commonly used data-based protection methods, and does not require high-speed communication and synchronization. Each protection unit is able to autonomously identify the type of event using the current derivative fault identification method, employing an artificial inductive line impedance. In order to accurately set the protection relays, detailed fault current analysis considering low pass resistor capacitor filter effects are presented. The decision for fault isolation is made based on the unit judgment and the data received through high-level data communication from other interconnected units. The performance of the proposed protection scheme was evaluated under different dc feeder and bus faults. The results show that this scheme is able to accurately identify the type of fault, isolate the faulted area, and restore the system quickly while limiting the load voltage drop to its preset limit.

Abstract: Over the past several years, distribution utilities have invested heavily in installations of "smart-meter" advanced metering initiative (AMI) systems. Among the anticipated benefits of these systems, utilities with smart-meter deployments are generally able to quickly assess which portions of their systems are operating normally and which customers are experiencing an outage. Projects at multiple utilities have focused on integrating AMI information, along with traditional supervisory control and data acquisition data sources, into utility distribution management systems to improve situational awareness on distribution feeders. Despite the clear benefits each of these systems offer, their ability to provide utilities with broad awareness of events affecting the health and status of the distribution system is limited, and often reactive in nature. This paper presents never-before-published cases observed in real-world field trials, detailing how integration of waveform analytics into utility operational practice leads to improved situational awareness.

Abstract: Nowadays, electricity energy demands requested from down-stream sectors in a smart grid constantly increase. One way to meet those demands is use of home energy management systems (HEMS). By effectively scheduling major household appliances in response to demand response (DR) schemes, residents can save their electricity bills. In this paper, an advanced HEMS facilitated by a nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique with an automated nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism is proposed. The NILM as an electricity audit is able to nonintrusively estimate power consumed by each of monitored major household appliances at a certain period of time. Data identified by the NILM are very useful for DR implementation. For DR implementation, the NSGA-II-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism autonomously and meta-heuristically schedules monitored and enrolled major household appliances without user intervention. It is based on an analysis of the NILM with historical data with past trends. The experimental results reported in this paper reveal that the proposed advanced HEMS with the NILM assessed in a real-house environment with uncertainties is workable and feasible.

Abstract: The integration of distributed generation (DG) in distribution grids is one of the pillars of smart grid deployment. However, an increasing amount of DG connected to distribution grids is likely to affect the operation of the grids themselves, e.g., changing the magnitude, and in some cases the direction, of power flows. In order to perform the transition to a smart grid, it is therefore essential to have the distribution system operators (DSOs) involved in the process. However, being that the DSOs' business is controlled by regulators, regulation has a fundamental impact on the speed and the actual performance of DSOs' involvement in the transition toward a smart grid. Therefore, a method is needed to assess network regulation impact on DSOs' incentive to integrate DG into their grids. This paper proposes a new method for the calculation of such incentive, and the method has been applied on a case study to the Portuguese, Danish, and Swedish regulations for different scenarios of DG penetration. The focus is on DSOs' operational costs and revenues. The analyses indicate that DG has a different impact on DSOs business, depending on the different regulations, the most relevant aspects being the structure of customer tariffs and the regulatory treatment of network losses.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm for coordinated control of the distributed generators integrated to a dc microgrid (DCMG), in islanded and grid connected modes of operation. The proposed DCMG connects various types of nonconventional energy sources, storage system to the dc, and three-phase, as well as single-phase ac loads. A control strategy for three-phase voltage source inverter to integrate the three-phase load, as well as utility grid into the DCMG, under various operating scenarios, has also been proposed. The proposed control strategy uses a combination of the feed-back and feed-forward control loops. Dual proportional integral controllers for ac voltage regulation and inner current control have been suggested in two rotating direct-and quadrature-axis synchronous reference frames for controlling the respective positive and negative sequence components. Simulations are carried out to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm and control strategy under different operating conditions including fault scenario and its effectiveness in maintaining the dc voltage of the microgrid.

Abstract: Real-time situational awareness tools are of critical importance to power system operators, especially during emergencies. The availability of electric power has become a linchpin of most post-disaster response efforts, because public and private sector services depend upon it. Knowledge of the scope and extent of facilities impacted, as well as the duration of their dependence on backup power, enables emergency response officials to plan for contingencies and provide a better overall response. Based on the measurement data acquired by the frequency disturbance recorders deployed in the North American power grids, an off-grid detection method is proposed and implemented. This method monitors the critical electrical loads and detects the transition of these loads from an on-grid operation to an off-grid operation, during which the loads are fed by an uninterrupted power supply or a backup generation system. The details of the detection algorithm are presented, and some case studies and off-grid detection scenarios are also provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness. This paper also presents the real-time implementation of this method and several effectively detected off-grid situations. Moreover, two visualization tools are developed to display the real-time system operation condition in an intuitive manor.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for estimating synchronized phase and frequency at the distribution level under both steady-state and dynamic conditions. The discrete Fourier transform-based method is widely used for phasor and frequency estimation, thanks to its low computational burden. However, errors arise when the power system is operating at off-nominal frequency, especially under dynamic conditions such as phase modulation. Additionally, the power grid signal at the distribution level contains more noise and harmonics, which cause phase and frequency estimation errors. In this paper, a synchronized phase and frequency estimation algorithm suitable for measurement at the distribution level is proposed and tested under noise and harmonic conditions, as well as various conditions in the phasor measurement unit Standard (C37.118.1-2011 and C37.118.1a-2014), to verify its measurement accuracy at the distribution level.

Abstract: As information and communication networks are highly interconnected with the power grid, cyber security of the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has become a critical issue in the electric power sector. By exploiting the vulnerabilities in cyber components and intruding into the local area networks of the control center, corporation, substations, or by injecting false information into communication links, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data, reconfigure devices, and send trip commands to the intelligent electronic devices that control the system breakers. Reliability of the power system can thus be impacted by various cyber attacks. In this paper, four attack scenarios for cyber components in networks of the SCADA system are considered, which may trip breakers of physical components. Two Bayesian attack graph models are built to illustrate the attack procedures and to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks. A mean time-to-compromise model is modified and adopted considering the known and zero-day vulnerabilities on the cyber components, and the frequencies of intrusions through various paths are estimated. With increased breaker trips resulting from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities in the IEEE reliability test system 79 are estimated. The simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks on the cyber components increases and the skill levels of attackers increase.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from utility-scale customer segmentation research initiatives, a new set of metrics is introduced that serve as quantitative measures of building occupant energy efficiency and energy-use predictability. Building occupant energy-use data is segmented to facilitate the construction of independent energy-use profiles for workdays, nonworkdays, work hours, and nonwork hours, which in turn enable further classification of building occupants according to their energy-use patterns. The three new metrics, building occupant energy-use efficiency, entropy, and intensity enable the design of more targeted energy conservation campaigns. Building occupants with relatively low energy-use efficiency scores can be individually targeted for behavioral interventions aimed at increasing the efficiency of their energy-use. Furthermore, building occupants with relatively low energy-use entropy scores can be sent timely behavior intervention notifications based on predictions of their future energy-use. Finally, building occupants with relatively high energy-use intensity scores can be targeted for equipment upgrades in order to reduce their overall energy consumption. We present the methodology behind the construction of these metrics and demonstrate how they can be applied to classify commercial building occupants based on their energy-use.

Abstract: There is a growing need for accurate and efficient real-time state estimation with increasing complexity, interconnection, and insertion of new devices in power systems. In this paper, a massively parallel dynamic state estimator is developed on a graphic processing unit (GPU), which is especially designed for processing large data sets. Within the massively parallel framework, a lateral two-level dynamic state estimator is proposed based on the extended Kalman filter method, utilizing both supervisory control and data acquisition, and phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. The measurements at the buses without PMU installations are predicted using previous data. The results of the GPU-based dynamic state estimator are compared with a multithread CPU-based code. Moreover, the effects of direct and iterative linear solvers on the state estimation algorithm are investigated. The simulation results show a total speed-up of up to 15 times for a 4992-bus system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel adaptive wide area backup protection scheme for transmission lines. In the proposed scheme, both the faulted line and fault location are determined by a limited number of synchronized phasor measurements. Based on phasor measurement unit placement and network topology, subsets of lines and buses called backup protection zones (BPZs) are formed. After a fault occurs in the transmission network, the sum of zero- and/or positive-sequence currents entering the faulted BPZ highly increases, and hence, the faulted BPZ can be determined. The linear least squares method is then used to determine the faulted line, as well as the fault location by voltage and current phasors of the faulted BPZ. Accordingly, the proposed scheme provides a closed-form and noniterative solution for the faulted line and fault location identification problem. On the other hand, it readily determines the faulted line regardless of the fault type, fault resistance, and measurement errors. To show the effectiveness of the method, it is applied to the WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems. Simulation results verify successful identification of the faulted BPZ as well as the faulted line within the faulted BPZ with limited measurement points.

Abstract: This paper deals with the selection of feedback signal(s) that retain the modal behavior of power system electromechanical dynamics under varying operating circumstances. The approach seeks signals that have relatively large magnitude of residue, less variation of the magnitude and phase angle, sufficient gap between the critical pole-zeros, and least sensitive to other modes. The methodology is tested in a 16-machine interconnected power system model with multiple wind farms.

Abstract: Coordinated operation of microgrids requires that energy management system takes into account both the available power in renewable energy sources (RES) and storage capacity of energy storage systems (ESS). In this paper, a coordinated architecture of islanded ac microgrids with smooth switching droop control (SSDC) is derived. Based on the proposed SSDC approach, flexible power control of each ESS/RES unit can be obtained with seamless modes changes. Furthermore, decentralized power management can be achieved by executing frequency bus-signaling. The power management principle based on different operational modes is explained in detail and small-signal analysis is carried out for SSDC. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop results of an islanded microgrid are provided under several scenarios to validate the proposed coordinated control strategy.

Abstract: Energy management in microgrids is typically formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Solving it in a centralized manner does not only require high computational capabilities at the microgrid central controller (MGCC), but may also infringe customer privacy. Existing distributed approaches, on the other hand, assume that all generations and loads are connected to one bus, and ignore the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flow and system operational constraints. Consequently, the schedules produced by those algorithms may violate those constraints and thus are not feasible in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the design of a distributed energy management strategy (EMS) for the optimal operation of microgrids with consideration of the distribution network and the associated constraints. Specifically, we formulate microgrid energy management as an optimal power flow problem, and propose a distributed EMS where the MGCC and the local controllers jointly compute an optimal schedule. We also provide an implementation of the proposed distributed EMS based on IEC 61850. As one demonstration, we apply the proposed distributed EMS to a real microgrid in Guangdong Province, China, consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, and a battery energy storage system. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and fast convergence of the proposed distributed EMS.

Abstract: With the recent rapid development of smart grid technology, the distribution grids become more active, and the interaction between transmission and distribution grids becomes more significant. However, in traditional power flow calculations, transmission and distribution grids are separated, which is not suitable for such future smart grids. To achieve a global unified power flow solution to support an integrated analysis for both transmission and distribution grids, we propose a global power flow (GPF) method that considers transmission and distribution grids as a whole in this paper. We construct GPF equations, and develop a master-slave-splitting (MSS) iterative method with convergence guarantee to alleviate boundary mismatches between the transmission and distribution grids. In our method, the GPF problem is split into a transmission power flow and a number of distribution power flow sub-problems, which supports on-line geographically distributed computation. Each sub-problem can be solved using a different power flow algorithm to capture the different features of transmission and distribution grids. An equivalent method is proposed to improve the convergence of the MSS-based GPF calculation for distribution grids that include loops. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in particular when the distribution grid has loops or distributed generators.

Abstract: So-called smart technologies are at the forefront of modern energy research. Many existing works focus on the effects of smart technologies, with scales ranging from a single household to an entire city. One area that is less studied is the adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we extend our prior work to develop a more robust framework for exploring the diffusion of basic smart grid technologies using a social-network-based model to study demand response adoption. This network is based around considering an end-user as a node, and any relationship where mutual trust and communication exists as an edge. In addition, we have incorporated mathematical representations of user personality traits in the decision-making progress to better simulate real-world actions. We observe greater usage of demand response when conventional electricity is high, when conscientiousness is high, and when the network is densely connected; all of these are reasonable results given logical behavior of the individual agents. Our model includes many tunable parameters in the update stages, of which the effects of only a few are included in this paper. This quantity of potential parameters, as well as the broad nature of the model and algorithm, makes our model a candidate for future improvement and development based on including different parameters.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage two-level model for the energy pricing and dispatch problem faced by a smart grid retailer who plays the role of an intermediary agent between a wholesale energy market and end consumers. Demand response of consumers with respect to the retail price is characterized by a Stackelberg game in the first stage, thus the first stage has two levels. A risk-aversive energy dispatch accounting for market price uncertainty is modeled by a linear robust optimization with objective uncertainty in the second stage. The proposed model is transformed to a mixed integer linear program (MILP) by jointly using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, the disjunctive constraints, and the duality theory. We propose a heuristic method to select the parameter in disjunctive constraints based on the interpretation of Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, we suggest solving an additional linear program (LP) to acquire a possible enhanced bidding strategy that guarantees a Pareto improvement on the retailer's profit over the entire uncertainty set. Case studies demonstrate the proposed model and method is valid.

Abstract: Demand-side management (DSM) plays a key role in the future of smart grids. Recently, DSM researchers have developed various mathematical models to optimize the demand response. Most of these works ignore the channel impairments' impact on the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a new noncooperative game theoretic model for the management of smart grid's demand considering the packet error rate in our formulation. We set the Nash equilibrium conditions for the proposed model. Under an assumption on the form of the utility functions, we develop a 0-1 mixed linear programming approach to compute nondominated extreme Nash equilibria. Results on a numerical example are provided and some useful insights are presented. Under some assumptions and a fully proven proposition, a feasible nondominated Nash equilibrium solution is found. Finally, we report and comment on computational experiments on randomly generated smart grid DSM game instances with different characteristics.

Abstract: A renewable energy-based dc micro-grid with hybrid energy storage, consisting of battery and ultracapacitor, is investigated. To achieve high penetration depth of renewable sources into the utility grid, a novel system operation strategy and the corresponding energy management method is proposed. In the operation strategy, the ultracapacitor unit works as the sole voltage source of the micro-grid to support the dc link in both connected and islanding mode. The micro-grid is controlled to deliver/absorb predefined amount of power to/from the utility grid during connected mode and zero during islanding mode. This design will certainly simplify the power dispatching algorithm of the power system and increase the possibility of including large quantities of micro-grids into the utility grid. The energy management method is dedicated to conducting the net power of the micro-grid effectively. The net power is separated into high-and low-frequency components. The high-frequency power is suppressed by the ultracapacitor automatically and the low frequency power is shared by the battery and an adjustment unit. A small-scale dc micro-grid structure with a single dc link is considered for investigation. MATLAB/Simulink simulation results are presented to validate the proposed system operation strategy and the energy management method.

Abstract: Recently, microgrids (MGs) have attracted considerable attention as a high-quality and reliable source of electricity. In this paper, energy management in MGs is addressed in the light of economic efficiency, environmental restrictions, and reliability improvement via: 1) optimizing the type and capacity of distributed generation (DG) sources, as well as the capacity of storage devices (SD); and 2) developing an operational strategy (OS) for energy management in MGs. A master-slave objective function based on net present value (as an economic indicator) is proposed. Such objective function is solved using a hybrid optimization method. This method includes two steps. In the first step, 2-D slave object functions (SOFs), operating costs, and consumer outage cost (as a reliability index) are minimized by quadratic programming and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, respectively. Then Pareto curve is drawn for SOF and fuzzy logic is employed to select the best SOF solution, OS, from Pareto curve. In the second step, using the best OS from step one for any iteration, PSO algorithms employed to solve master objective function, and to determine the optimum capacity and type of DGs and SDs. The results show that the proposed framework can be considered as an efficient tool in planning and energy management of MGs.

Abstract: This paper deals with the service restoration problem in renewable-powered microgrids that are driven islanded by an unscheduled breakdown from the main grid. The objective is to determine the maximum of the expected restorative loads by choosing the best arrangement of the power network configurations immediately from the beginning of the breakdown all the way to the end of the island mode. The intermittency nature of the renewable power, as well as the uncertainty of the duration of the breakdown pose new challenges to this classic optimization scheduling task. The proposed two scenario-splitting methods can be solved in a two-step solving procedure, in which a Lagrangian technique and dynamic programming are utilized to provide an analytical sub-optimal yet efficient solution to the original problem. Simulation results demonstrate that both methods can find solutions very close to optima effectively; the scheduling plan should be adjusted when the time evolves, especially when the renewable power generation takes a large portion in the power supply; and the energy storage system plays a significant role to reduce the risk of unreliability in the wind power forecasting, even with a small amount of capacity. Finally, the proposed approach can be applied to radially configured systems with other types of distributed generators.

Abstract: The emergence of microsources holds promise to reduce the carbon emissions and exploit more renewables in order to meet the worldwide growing electrical energy demands. However, there exist several challenges, such as optimizing the tradeoff between the use of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, to leverage affordable electric power while minimizing carbon emissions. Game theoretic approaches have been widely used in various scientific domains and have recently also increasingly been used in smart grids, whereby evolutionary paradigms have been widely deployed as a popular heuristic search method to solve and optimize complex real-life scientific problems. A promising approach is the development of such evolutionary algorithms and game theoretic approaches in the context of open energy markets. In this paper, we develop an analytic model of a multileader and multifollower Stackelberg game approach and propose a bi-level hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to find optimal strategies that maximize the profit of utilities, and minimize carbon emissions in an open energy market among interconnected microsources.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for contactless measurement of instantaneous voltage and waveform reconstruction for use in a medium voltage (MV) indoor substation. Voltage waveforms are reconstructed by artificial neural network (ANN) using the signals originating from electric field sensors located under MV bus. The method is validated by the experiment in a typical indoor MV substation. Depending on the selection of ANN architecture and data used for training the root mean squared error of waveforms, reconstruction as low as 0.3% to 2.1% can be achieved in a steady state. The practical advice on the application of the proposed measurement method in a production environment is also given.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic demand scheduling (D2S) scheme-an effort toward cost-effective energy consumption at customers' end. The theory of optimal portfolio selection is adopted to generate customers' expected day-ahead energy demand graph called the weight graph, based on past days' history-energy demand, profit return, and corresponding risk. In such a scenario, the weight graph of energy ensures that the expected profit return and the corresponding risk to the customers are optimized. Consequently, we evaluate the dynamic scheduling scheme for optimizing the energy cost to the customers using the weight graph. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also assists in relieving the peak-demand on the grid, which, in turn, implies that the grid is capable of providing service to the scheduled appliances. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated with different performance metrics-peak-demand, demand variation, energy-cost, and utility of the customers. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic scheduling scheme, D2S, yields improved performance than that with the existing ones-no scheduling and static scheduling. It also shows that the utility of the customers increases approximately 28.2% over the existing ones.

Abstract: This paper introduced a decentralized voltage control strategy for dc microgrids that is based on the droop method. The proposed distributed secondary voltage control utilizes an average voltage sharing scheme to compensate the voltage deviation caused by the droop control. Through nonexplicit communication, the proposed control strategy can perform precise terminal voltage regulation and enhance the system reliability against system failures. The distributed voltage compensators that resemble a centralized secondary voltage controller are implemented with the bi-proper anti-wind-up design method to solve the integration issues that necessarily lead to the saturation of the controller output efforts. The proposed concept of pilot bus voltage regulation shows the possibility of managing the terminal voltage without centralized structure. Moreover, the network dynamics are illustrated with a focus on cable resonance mode based on the eigenvalue analysis and small-signal modeling; analytical explanations with the development of equivalent circuits give a clear picture regarding how the controller parameters and droop gains affect the system damping performance. The proposed derivative droop control has been demonstrated to damp the oscillation and to improve the system stability during transients. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy are validated by both simulation and experimental evaluation.

Abstract: While electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to provide environmental and economical benefit, judicious coordination of EV charging is necessary to prevent overloading of the distribution grid. Leveraging the smart grid infrastructure, the utility company can adjust the electricity price intelligently for individual customers to elicit desirable load curves. In this context, this paper addresses the problem of predicting the EV charging behavior of the consumers at different prices, which is a prerequisite for optimal price adjustment. The dependencies on price responsiveness among consumers are captured by a conditional random field (CRF) model. To account for temporal dynamics potentially in a strategic setting, the framework of online convex optimization is adopted to develop an efficient online algorithm for tracking the CRF parameters. The proposed model is then used as an input to a stochastic profit maximization module for real-time price setting. Numerical tests using simulated and semi-real data verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The harmonic pollution of electric vehicle chargers is increasing rapidly as the scale of electric vehicle charging stations enlarges to meet the rising demand for electric vehicles. This paper investigates the operating characteristics of a three-phase uncontrolled rectification electric vehicle charger with passive power factor correction. A method for estimating the equivalent circuit parameters of chargers is proposed based on the measured feature data of voltage and current at the ac side and on the circuit constraint during the conduction charging process. A harmonic analytical model of the charging station is then established by dividing the same charger types into groups. The parameter estimation method and the harmonic model of the charging station are verified through simulation, experiment, and field test. The parameter sensitivities of the equivalent circuit to the charging current harmonic are also studied.

Abstract: New voltage control algorithms are necessary to cope with the increasing amount of distributed generation and electric vehicles in distribution networks. Many of the newly proposed voltage control algorithms are based on linearized dependencies between the voltage magnitude, and the active and reactive power consumption. These linearized dependencies are normally obtained by algorithms, which rely on accurate grid topology information. Due to the traditionally passive operation of low voltage (LV) distribution networks, this information is typically missing, incomplete, or inaccurate. Therefore, this paper introduces a method to extract these linear dependencies based on historical smart meter data only. No information about the grid topology is required. The model adapts to the changing load conditions in the network. The algorithm has a low complexity and is applied to an unbalanced LV distribution network. Data of a practical laboratory setup is used to validate the proposed method in real-life conditions. With the obtained voltage sensitivity factors a voltage management strategy was implemented for the laboratory grid.

Abstract: Distributed energy generation and storage are widely investigated demand-side management (DSM) technologies that are scalable and integrable with contemporary smart grid systems. However, prior research has mainly focused on day-ahead optimization for these distributed energy resources while neglecting forecasting errors and their often detrimental consequences. We propose a novel game theoretic model predictive control (MPC) approach for DSM that can adapt to real-time data. The MPC-based algorithm produces subgame perfect equilibrium strategies for distributed generation and storage with perfect forecasting information, and is shown to be more effective than a day-ahead scheme when mean forecasting errors greater than 10% are present. This robust and continuous MPC approach reduces effective forecasting errors, and in doing so, achieves greater electricity cost savings and peak to average demand ratio reduction than the day-ahead optimization scheme.

Abstract: The energy-saving dispatch could significantly enhance the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission reduction, as well as the sustainable development of the socio economy in China. With the rapid growth of smart grid, the use of demand response to dispatch loads with flexible consumption time and/or quantity has been a new trend in power industry. This paper proposes a new energy-saving dispatch problem while considering energy-saving and emission-reduction potentials of generation and demand sides, as well as the interaction between the two. A bi-level optimization model is established to address the interaction between the energy-saving dispatch of thermal units and that of users. The objective function of the upper level considers both the electric power generation cost and the carbon emission cost of thermal units, while the lower level integrates both compensation and incentive costs of electricity consumers into its objective function according to the influences of their regulation-based demand response to the power grid. Moreover, user benefits of reducing downtime and avoiding frequent load restarting are also considered in the lower layer model. An iterative algorithm is proposed and the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) method is used to solve the lower-layer model for seeking the optimal compromise solution on the Pareto frontier, which is derived by maximum deviations and entropy-based multiple attributes decision making method. Comparing with general NSGA-II and multiobjective genetic algorithms, the improved NSGA-II method can improve the spatial distribution of Pareto solution set and reduce the number of iterations, thus having stronger consistency among multiple objective functions and better performance.

Abstract: To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, several incentives are given to use renewable energy sources (RES) and plug-in electrical vehicles (PEVs). By using PEVs for electricity storage and RES as distributed generators, microgrids (MG) become more reliable, stable, and cost-effective. However, the high intermittent nature of energy sources and unpredictable presence of PEV in the MG offers new technological challenges to the smart grid/MG energy management system (EMS). In this paper, we propose a new distributed real-time electricity allocation (DRTA) scheme for the smart grid/MG EMS whose objectives are to reduce the electricity bill of the residential customers, to increase the overall social benefit of smart MG/grid community, and to increase the energy efficiency and reliability of the MG to rely on locally generated electricity. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game using mechanism design and solve it to optimality. The proposed DRTA scheme converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium and produces a near-optimal solution. We compare the proposed scheme with a centralized optimal electricity consumption scheme and to the solution obtained from unregulated (natural) scheduling framework.

Abstract: A new class of microgrids, called provisional microgrids, is introduced in this paper. Provisional microgrids hold similar characteristics as microgrids; however, do not possess the islanding capability and are dependent on one or more electrically connected microgrids for islanding purposes. Removing the islanding requirements and relying on the available unused capacity of existing microgrids characterizes provisional microgrids as enablers of rapidly deploying variable generation renewable energy resources in distribution networks and further preventing underutilization of capital-intensive distributed energy resources in microgrids. Provisional microgrids are defined and an uncertainty-constrained optimal scheduling model is developed, which considers prevailing uncertainties associated with loads, nondispatchable generation, and market price forecasts, as well as islanding incidents and the available unused capacity from coupled microgrids. The optimal scheduling problem is decomposed using Benders decomposition and solved via the robust optimization method. Numerical simulations study a test provisional microgrid for exploring its economic, reliability, and environmental merits.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is of paramount importance to maintain normal operations of smart power grids. However, recent research shows that carefully produced attacks with the knowledge of the grid topology, i.e., Jacobian matrix, can bypass the bad data detection (BDD) system. The BDD is used to ensure the integrity of state estimation to filter faulty measurements introduced by device malfunctions or malicious attacks. However, to construct the false data injection attack vectors, a common assumption in most prior works on false data injection attacks is that the attacker has complete knowledge about the power grid topology and transmission-line admittances. By contrast, this paper studies the general problem of blind false data injection attacks using the principal component analysis approximation method without the knowledge of Jacobian matrix and the assumption regarding the distribution of state variables. The proposed attack is proven to be approximately stealthy.(1) The performance of the proposed attack is analyzed. Simulations confirm the performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for the real-time management of electric vehicles (EVs) charging processes. The proposed method aims to limit the peak load and to increase the number of rechargeable EVs with respect to the scenario in which no coordination action is performed, while achieving given constraints on the power distribution system. The approach is based on a tight interaction between a scheduling algorithm and a power-flow evaluation procedure. The scheduling algorithm finds the best charging periods for each EV. The power flow procedure checks the achievement of electrical constraints and evaluates the operational parameters of the grid. Simulations are carried out on a real electricity distribution system of a medium-sized Italian city. The results show that the proposed approach increases the number of rechargeable EVs up to 33%. At the same time, the peak load is reduced by 25%. The scheduling algorithm requires an average of 50 ms to evaluate each charge request on an ordinary computer, therefore allowing its use in real-time conditions.

Abstract: The evolving wide-area measurement system technology offers new opportunities for backup protection of transmission lines to avert the misoperation of conventional relays against system disturbances and prevent system instability. Since wide-area backup protection (WABP) is to operate at the range of a few hundred milliseconds, the delays associated with data and command communications and algorithm execution can be a troublesome issue in a large-scale power system. This paper briefly reviews a WABP scheme based on positive-sequence voltage phasor direct and indirect measurements. To overcome the problem of WABP delays, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is proposed to divide the power system into several protection regions. This process is accomplished in three stages in which the number and location of measurement devices (MDs), the number and boundary of protection regions, and the location of protection rooms, as well as the total number of communication links between MDs and protection rooms are optimized. The proposed WABP scheme is implemented in each region and individually protects the associated transmission lines. Execution of the proposed ILP model on different test systems reveals that with regionalization of the systems, WABP schemes can reliably be used in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decentralized control scheme for islanded microgrids (ImGs) composed by the interconnection of distributed generation units (DGUs). Local controllers regulate voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling of each DGU, and they are able to guarantee stability of the overall ImG. The control design procedure is decentralized, since, besides two global scalar quantities, the synthesis of a local controller uses only information on the corresponding DGU and lines connected to it. Most important, our design procedure enables plug-and-play operations: when a DGU is plugged in or out, only DGUs physically connected to it have to retune their local controllers. We study the performance of the proposed controllers simulating different scenarios in MATLAB/Simulink and using performance indexes proposed in IEEE standards.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical control architecture designed for an arbitrary high voltage multiterminal dc (MTDC) network. In the proposed architecture, the primary control of the MTDC system is decentralized and implemented using a generalized droop strategy. Design criteria for dimensioning the primary control parameters, including voltage limits, are offered by analyzing the transients appearing in the system. The proposed secondary control is centralized and regulates the operating point (OP) of the network so that optimal power flow (OPF) is achieved. Compared to previous works, this paper further elaborates, both analytically and through simulations, on the coordination between the primary and secondary control layers. This includes how local primary controllers have to be driven by the centralized controller in order to ensure a smooth transition to the optimal OP.

Abstract: This paper studies the electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling problem to match the stochastic wind power. Besides considering the optimality of the expected charging cost, the proposed model innovatively incorporates the matching degree between wind power and EV charging load into the objective function. Fully taking into account the uncertainty and dynamics in wind energy supply and EV charging demand, this stochastic and multistage matching is formulated as a Markov decision process. In order to enhance the computational efficiency, the effort is made in two aspects. Firstly, the problem size is reduced by aggregating EVs according to their remaining parking time. The charging scheduling is carried out on the level of aggregators and the optimality of the original problem is proved to be preserved. Secondly, the simulation-based policy improvement method is developed to obtain an improved charging policy from the base policy. The validation of the proposed model, scalability, and computational efficiency of the proposed methods are systematically investigated via numerical experiments.

Abstract: The operation of the power grid is becoming more stressed, due to the addition of new large loads represented by electric vehicles (EVs) and a more intermittent supply due to the incorporation of renewable sources. As a consequence, the coordination and control of projected EV demand in a network of fast charging stations becomes a critical and challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a game theoretic based decentralized control mechanism to alleviate negative impacts from the EV demand. The proposed mechanism takes into consideration the nonuniform spatial distribution of EVs that induces uneven power demand at each charging facility, and aims to: 1) avoid straining grid resources by offering price incentives, so that customers accept being routed to less busy stations; 2) maximize total revenue by serving more customers with the same amount of grid resources; and 3) provide charging service to customers with a certain level of quality-of-service (QoS), the latter defined as the long term customer blocking probability. We examine three scenarios of increased complexity that gradually approximate real world settings. The obtained results show that the proposed framework leads to substantial performance improvements in terms of the aforementioned goals when compared to current state of affairs.

Abstract: The microgrid has been shown to be profitable, reliable, and efficient for military, commercial, and university-like installations. However, until now, there has been no study to show how and when a residential microgrid may be profitable. Therefore, in this paper, we present a design space exploration methodology of the microgrid by modeling all the energy resources at the residential level and conducting numerous simulations with various parameters. Moreover, a set of rules are defined to make the stakeholders in the microgrid profitable. Also, by analyzing the number of houses in the microgrid, we observe that the number of years it takes to return the capital costs invested in the microgrid may become adequately short for a certain range of the number of houses. For instance, if the aggregator owns the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, it may profit in less than five years when 500 houses participate in the microgrid where each house owns 500 sf solar panels. On the other hand, if the prosumers own the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, the aggregator may profit in about a year. Typically, for an apartment-block type housing area in U. S. there are more than 1000 houses, therefore the aggregator profitability may improve furthermore. pu pa

Abstract: Over a home area network, between smart appliances and the smart meter, and over an 802.15.4g smart utility network, from a smart meter toward the utility center, IEEE 802.15.4 assists with advanced metering infrastructure components in a smart grid. Adopting the synchronous beacon-enabled mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a slotted framework for low-power, real-time collection, and distribution of power information. However, the shared nature of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band introduces the beacon corruption issue, and confronts the 802.15.4-based network with service interruptions and large delays. This paper, experimentally and analytically, studies how interference from collocated networks affects the beaconing functionally and, consequently, network performance. Investigations indicate that beaconing contributes in low-power and low-delay communications over an 802.15.4 network only when its proper operation is guaranteed over a coexistent environment like ISM band; otherwise, the application delay is significantly compromised. In this regard, a standard-conforming enhancement, called the beacon corruption recovery scheme (BCRS), is proposed to mitigate effects of coexistence on beaconing performance by migration of the network to a cleaner channel. Simulation results show that by applying the BCRS, an 802.15.4 network experiences a less fragmented accesses to the medium and better fulfills real-time bidirectional flow of monitoring information.

Abstract: Without demand-side management, an increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) could result in overloads on distribution feeders. Aggregators could optimally manage the charging/discharging of the EVs, to not only maximize the consumers' welfare in response to real-time prices and accommodate their needs for transportation, but also to keep the distribution network within its operating limits. This paper proposes a decentralized framework in which the aggregator seeks to maximize its profits while the consumers minimize their costs in response to time-varying prices, and additional incentives provided to mitigate potential overloads in the distribution system. Test results show that a large penetration of EV penetration can then be managed without violating the capacity of the distribution network.

Abstract: In the risk-based security assessment, probability and severity of events are the two main factors for measuring the security level of power systems. This paper presents a method for assessing line overload risk of wind-integrated power systems with the consideration of wind and load-power generation correlation. The established risk assessment model fully considers the probability and the consequence of wind uncertainties and line flow fluctuations. The point estimate method is employed to deal with the probability of line overload and the severity function is applied to quantify line flow fluctuations. Moreover, with the Cholesky decomposition, the correlation between loads and power generations are simulated by the spatial transformation of probability distributions of random variables. In addition, Nataf transformation is used to address wind resource correlation. Finally, the line overload risk index is obtained, which can be used as an indicator for quantifying power system security. Numerical results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system and the modified IEEE 118-bus system show that the types and the parameters of the wind speed distribution would affect the risk indices of line overload, and the risk indices obtained with the consideration of wind resource correlation and load correlation would reflect the system security more accurately.

Abstract: Reactive power support through shunt capacitors and distributed generation is used in conjunction with step voltage regulators (SVRs) for voltage control of distribution feeders. Distribution management system is responsible for coordination among distributed reactive power sources, such as capacitors, photovoltaic and wind power generators, and SVRs. In this paper, a novel method for calculating voltage sensitivity to active, reactive power injection, and SVR taps in unbalanced distribution feeders is developed. The method is based on ABCD parameters of network components which are used in forward/backward sweep of power-flow solution. The method can deal with network unbalance, network shunt admittances, single-phase sections, and ungrounded sections. The initial sensitivities are calculated in one power-flow forward sweep through a recursive way, and the online updating of sensitivities is very easy and straightforward so the method is suitable for online voltage control. A novel sensitivity-based online optimization method is developed for online coordinated voltage control with no prior information about the load. The same ABCD parameters are used for developing a novel method for calculating short circuit currents in unbalanced distribution feeders. The method can also handle unbalance, shunt elements, and single phase sections, and is applicable to all fault types. The developed method for voltage control and short circuit calculation are tested on the IEEE comprehensive test feeder and the results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Minimizing the peak power consumption of electrical appliances under delay requirements is shown to be NP-hard. To address this, we propose a "family plan" approach that partitions users into groups and schedules users' appliances to minimize the peak power consumption of each group. Our scheme leverages the social network topology and statistical energy usage patterns of users. To partition users into groups with the potential of reducing peak power consumption, our distributed clustering scheme seeks such a partition of users into groups that the total power consumption in each group of users achieves minimum variance. Then, given a set of jobs of users' appliances to be scheduled in the next scheduling period, we use a distributed scheduling algorithm to minimize the peak power consumption of each group of users. Our simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves a significant reduction in user payments, peak power consumption, and fuel cost.

Abstract: In the foreseeable future, power grids will be managed largely with demand-side management (DSM) programs. With the growing population of electric vehicles (EVs) and the emergence of aggregators, DSM will surely introduce more intense competition to the markets. Since EV charging produces a large amount of time-flexible load in power systems, competition of its management could become a major game. This paper first formulates the game of EV charging management to describe this major form of the future DSM competition and then studies three challenges inherent in it: 1) inefficiency of Nash equilibria; 2) the game of chicken; and 3) cheating on private information. It is found that a central regulator is required to prevent these drawbacks. Solutions are proposed and a central governing procedure is also presented. The notion of the game of EV charging management is compatible with DSM programs that are able to schedule load flexibly over multiple time periods.

Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a potential candidate for medium/high-power applications, specifically for high-voltage direct current transmission systems. One of the main challenges in the control of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents while the capacitor voltages are maintained balanced. This paper proposes a control strategy for the MMC using finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). A bilinear mathematical model of the MMC is derived and discretized to predict the states of the MMC one step ahead. Within each switching cycle, the best switching state of the MMC is selected based on evaluation and minimization of a defined cost function. The defined cost function is aimed at the elimination of the MMC circulating currents, regulating the arm voltages, and controlling the ac-side currents. To reduce the calculation burden of the MPC, the submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing controller based on the conventional sorting method is combined with the proposed FCS-MPC strategy. The proposed FCS-MPC strategy determines the number of inserted/bypassed SMs within each arm of the MMC while the sorting algorithm is used to keep the SM capacitor voltages balanced. Using this strategy, only the summation of SM capacitor voltages of each arm is required for control purposes, which simplifies the communication among the SMs and the central controller. This paper also introduces a modified switching strategy, which not only reduces the calculation burden of the FCS-MPC strategy even more, but also simplifies the SM capacitor voltage balancing algorithm. In addition, this strategy reduces the SM switching frequency and power losses by avoiding the unnecessary switching transitions. The performance of the proposed strategies for a 20-level MMC is evaluated based on the time-domain simulation studies.

Abstract: Communication network brings new challenges such as time delay and data loss to wide-area damping control of power systems. The uncertainty caused by stochastic time delay of network communication increases the difficulty of wide-area control performance analysis. This paper proposes a mathematical expectation modeling approach to model and analyze wide-area controlled power systems considering the effect of stochastic time delay. In the proposed method, mathematical expectation of stochastic time delay distribution is derived to accurately model the impact of communication network on wide-area control performance. The theoretical frame of the proposed modeling approach is presented, and the effectiveness of the method is verified through the simulation of a power system with eight generators and 36 nodes.

Abstract: Power management is an essential tool for microgrid (MG) safe and economic operation, particularly in the islanded operation mode. In this paper, a multi-timescale cost-effective power management algorithm (PMA) is proposed for islanded MG operation targeting generation, storage, and demand management. Comprehensive modeling, cost, and emission calculations of the MG components are developed in this paper to facilitate high accuracy management. While the MGs overall power management and operation is carried out every several minutes to hours, depending on the availability of the required data, simulation for highly dynamic devices, such as batteries and electric water heaters (EWHs) used for demand response (DR), are performed every minute. This structure allows accurate, scalable, and practical power management taking into consideration the intrainterval dynamics of battery and EWHs. Two different on/off strategies for EWH control are also proposed for DR application. Then, the PMA is implemented using the two different DR strategies and the results are compared with the no-DR case. Actual solar irradiation, ambient temperature, nonEWH load demand, and hot water consumption data are employed in the simulation studies. The simulation results for the MG studied show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to reduce both MGs cost and emission.

Abstract: As the smart grid solutions enable active consumer participation, demand response (DR) strategies have drawn much interest in the literature recently, especially for residential areas. As a new type of consumer load in the electric power system, electric vehicles (EVs) also provide different opportunities, including the capability of utilizing EVs as a storage unit via vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) options instead of peak power procurement from the grid. In this paper, as the main contribution to the literature, a collaborative evaluation of dynamic-pricing and peak power limiting-based DR strategies with a bi-directional utilization possibility for EV and energy storage system (ESS) is realized. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework-based modeling of a home energy management (HEM) structure is provided for this purpose. A distributed small-scale renewable energy generation system, the V2H and V2G capabilities of an EV together with two-way energy trading of ESS, and different DR strategies are all combined in a single HEM system for the first time in the literature. The impacts of different EV owner consumer preferences together with the availability of ESS and two-way energy trading capabilities on the reduction of total electricity prices are examined with case studies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel optimization based home load control (HLC) to manage the operation periods of responsive electrical appliances, determine several recommended operation periods for nonresponsive appliances, and schedule the charge/discharge cycling of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) considering various customer preferences. The customer preferences are in the format of payment cost, interruption cost, and different operational constraints. The projected algorithm is online, in which household appliances are initially scheduled based on the payment cost, and when the home load is interrupted, the scheduling will be updated to minimize customer interruption cost. Due to vehicle to home capability of PHEV, the home outage can be managed through solving the proposed optimization problem. Several realistic case studies are carried out to examine the performance of the suggested method. In addition, the impacts of common electricity tariffs on the HLC results are investigated. The results reveal that employing the proposed HLC program benefits not only the customers by reducing their payment and interruption costs, but also utility companies by decreasing the peak load of the aggregate load demand.

Abstract: The possibility of leveraging the data provided by smart meters to understand the load characteristics is studied in this paper. The loads are modeled as voltage-dependent elements to increase the accuracy of volt-VAR optimization (VVO) techniques for distribution systems. VVO techniques are part of the distribution management system and may be used for purposes such as loss reduction, voltage profile improvement, and conservation voltage reduction. A deterministic framework is proposed that formulates the VVO problem as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming problem, which is solved efficiently using advanced branch-and-cut techniques. The proposed framework is capable of optimally controlling capacitor banks, voltage regulators, and under-load tap changers (ULTCs) for day-ahead operation planning. The results indicate that loss reductions of up to 40% and a total demand reduction of up to 4.8% are achievable under some loading conditions in a radial test system. The effect of the load voltage dependence is also demonstrated through analytical simulations.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to present a novel agent based distributed power flow solver for general unbalanced radial distribution systems utilizing multiagent system communication. The distributed solver makes use of intelligent agents, which possess three key characteristics, namely autonomy, local view, and decentralization. Comprehensive models of distribution systems will be considered, including lines, switching devices, voltage regulators, transformers, shunt capacitors, distributed energy storage systems, and different load types. The distributed intelligent agents will use the backward/forward sweep technique to iteratively solve the power flow. A distinguishing feature of the new solver is that it deals with the problem from a completely distributed perspective. The proposed solution algorithm is evaluated on three standard IEEE distribution test systems with very promising results.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new coordinated voltage control (CVC) method with reactive power management scheme (RPMS) for a hybrid micro-grid (MG). The CVC scheme, based on synchronizing the response speeds of different voltage regulating devices, is coordinated with novel RPMS. Two cases, with and without proposed CVC, were simulated in the power system computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including dc (EMTDC) environment and compared against each other. The case with proposed CVC shows superior performance, when tested for fault triggered islanding, intentional islanding, and MG internal fault. Further, the proposed CVC with RPMS is compared to a voltage regulation method present in literature. The proposed CVC with RPMS provides better voltage regulation, maximizes the fast dynamic reactive power reserve, and improves the transient response and transient stability margin of the hybrid MG.

Abstract: Minimization of the de-energized consumers load and reduction of the service restoration costs are considered in the proposed heuristic graph-based approach for finding the solution of the service restoration in distributed networks. The approach is based on the logic of the modified Prim's algorithm that finds the minimum spanning trees (i.e., a forest). Operation costs including an actual status ("open" or "close") of the switching equipment in a de-energized area is represented by the switching cost coefficients. The cost coefficients are assigned to all branches in a de-energized area. The switching action is performed by switching equipment with minimal switching costs coefficient in each iteration of the algorithm. The results confirm that the service restoration costs are decreased by the consideration of the actual status of the switching equipment.

Abstract: This paper develops an analytical model for a residential microgrid (RMG) under a collaborative environment. The model assumes that the RMG community is under a social agreement referred to as Collaborative Consumption. The model includes a framework for RMGs using a unique method of demand response based on the particular characteristics of residential loads. Residential loads are categorized into three types based on their necessity and reschedulable ability. Consumers assign priority to their appliances. Then, the microgrid informs consumers about their real-time consumption and economic benefits associated with their participation in collaborative consumption. Accordingly, consumers can evaluate suggested alternatives prior to using appliances and consequentially make better decisions. Finally, the effects of model parameters on profit maximization are studied. The results of this paper estimate the economic benefits within a collaborative environment.

Abstract: This paper presents a topology for dc grids which enables very robust dc fault protection with moderate costs, good operating flexibility, and simple controls. It is postulated that radial dc systems are best suited for limited-size local dc grids. Radial topology enables robust and fast protection selectivity using only local signals and exploiting the advantages of hybrid dc circuit breakers (CBs). To enable flexible expansion options to national/international systems, it is suggested to interconnect star points of radial systems using dc/dc converters. DC/dc converters enable inherent isolation of dc faults and provide firewall between radial dc grids. Each interconnecting cable is protected by a dc/dc at one end and a hybrid CB at the other end. The control options for dc/dc converter and the radial grids are analyzed. A detailed simulation model of six terminal dc grid with two-star points is presented. The power systems computer aided design (PSCAD) simulation results confirm dc fault isolation and good control performance of the proposed topology for a range of dc fault contingencies.

Abstract: Large-scale penetration of photovoltaic (PV) power generators and storage batteries is expected in recently constructed power systems. For the realization of smart energy management, we need to make an appropriate day-ahead schedule of power generation and battery charge cycles based on the prediction of demand and PV power generation, which inevitably involves nontrivial prediction errors. With this background, a novel framework is proposed to maintain the balance among the total amounts of power generation, demand, and battery charging power with explicit consideration of the prediction uncertainty, assuming that consumer storage batteries are not directly controllable by a supplier. The proposed framework consists of the following three steps: 1) the day-ahead scheduling of the total amount of generation power and battery charging power; 2) the day-ahead scheduling of utility energy consumption requests to individual consumers, which aim to regulate battery charging cycles on the consumer side; and 3) the incentive-based management of the entire power system on the day of interest. In this paper, we especially focus on the day-ahead scheduling problems in steps 1) and 2), and show that they can be analyzed in a manner originating from spatiotemporal aggregation. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework through numerical verification of the power system management.

Abstract: In the smart grid environment, reserve services (RS) are also expected from the demand side, taking into account the flexibility and availability of loads connected into the grid. This paper proposes a method to calculate the availability of thermal domestic loads for the provision of upward RS, considering some aspects regarding the constructive characteristics of the appliances, as well as the consumer habits and comfort preferences. A case study comprising 500 consumers with three types of domestic thermal loads (electric water heaters, air-conditioners, and refrigerators) will be used to illustrate the method.

Abstract: An effective power system protection scheme has to be able to detect and locate all occurring faults corresponding to low and high impedance values. The latter category poses the greatest challenge for the protection schemes due to the low values of the related fault current. This paper extends previous work by the authors on the subject, aiming to achieve detection and location of high impedance faults (HIFs) in multiconductor overhead distribution networks utilizing power line communication (PLC) devices. Fault detection is proposed to be performed by a PLC device installed at the starting point of the monitored line and by using differences to the values of metrics related to input impedance at frequencies utilized by narrowband systems. Moreover, fault location can be derived by a response to impulse injection procedure utilized by all installed PLC devices along the line. The method is evaluated and validated in various simulation test cases concerning its ability to effectively detect and locate HIFs.

Abstract: Gearbox has proven to be a major contributor toward downtime in wind turbines. The majority of failures in the gearbox originate from the gearbox bearings. An early indication of possible wear and tear in the gearbox bearings may be used for effective predictive maintenance, thereby reducing the overall cost of maintenance. This paper introduces a self-evolving maintenance scheduler framework for maintenance management of wind turbines. Furthermore, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based condition monitoring approach using data from supervisory control and data acquisition system is proposed. The ANN-based condition monitoring approach is applied to gearbox bearings with real data from onshore wind turbines, rated 2 MW, and located in the south of Sweden. The results demonstrate that the proposed ANN-based condition monitoring approach is capable of indicating severe damage in the components being monitored in advance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present optimal day-ahead scheduling and control models for microgrids under uncertainty. The traditional deterministic mixed integer programming used in wholesale market fails to produce adequate results, especially when variations and risks are high. We develop stochastic programming optimization models with risk neutral and risk-averse options. We also characterize microgrids with their mean design capacity configuration and operational volatility. A dissimilarity measure determines the relative volatility between two microgrids. We demonstrate that risk-based decision-making in microgrids can significantly change the day-ahead scheduling and control outcomes, and capacity configuration and volatility measures are determining factors for microgrid risks and savings.

Abstract: In order to analyze the fault trends more accurately, a failure rate model appropriate for general electric power equipment is established based on a nonparametric regression method, improved from stratified proportional hazards model (PHM), which can make maximum use of equipment lifecycle data as the covariates, including manufacturer, service age, location, maintainer, health index, etc. All of covariates are represented in the hierarchy process of equipment health condition, which is beneficial for processing and classifying the lifecycle data into multitype recurrent events quantitatively. Meanwhile, based on new definitions of single health cycle and time between events, recurrent inspecting events distributed with martingale process can correspond with event-specific failure function during equipment lifecycle. On this occasion, more inspecting events can be utilized in a complete cycle to predict potential risk and assess equipment health condition. Then, stratified nonparametric PHM is employed to build the multitype recurrent events-specific failure model appropriate for competing risk problem toward interval censored. Lastly, the example in terms of transformers demonstrates the modeling procedure. Results show the well asymptotic property and goodness-of-fit tested by both of graphical and analytical methods. Compared with existing failure models, such as age-based or CBF model, this improved nonparametric regression model can mine lifecycle data acquisition from asset management system, depict the failure trend accurately considering both individual and group features, and lay the foundation for health prognosis, maintenance optimization, and asset management in power grid.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a single-phase on-board bidirectional plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charger that can provide reactive power support to the utility grid in addition to charging the vehicle battery. The topology consists of two-stages: 1) a full-bridge ac-dc boost converter; and 2) a half-bridge bidirectional dc-dc converter. The charger operates in two quadrants in the active-reactive power (PQ) power plane with five different operation modes (i.e., charging-only, charging-capacitive, charging-inductive, capacitive-only, and inductive-only). This paper also presents a unified controller to follow utility PQ commands in a smart grid environment. The cascaded two-stage system controller receives active and reactive power commands from the grid, and results in line current and battery charging current references while also providing a stable dynamic response. The vehicle's battery is not affected during reactive power operation in any of the operation modes. Testing the unified system controller with a 1.44 kVA experimental charger design demonstrates the successful implementation of reactive power support functionality of PEVs for future smart grid applications.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage robust optimization model for the distribution network reconfiguration problem with load uncertainty. The first-stage decision is to configure the radial distribution network and the second-stage decision is to find the optimal a/c power flow of the reconfigured network for given demand realization. We solve the two-stage robust model by using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm, where the master problem and subproblem are formulated as mixed-integer second-order cone programs. Computational results for 16, 33, 70, and 94-bus test cases are reported. We find that the configuration from the robust model does not compromise much the power loss under the nominal load scenario compared to the configuration from the deterministic model, yet it provides the reliability of the distribution system for all scenarios in the uncertainty set.

Abstract: An energy management system (EMS) determines the dispatching of generation units based on an optimizer that requires the forecasting of both renewable resources and loads. The forecasting system discussed in this paper includes a representation of the uncertainties associated with renewable resources and loads. The proposed modeling generates fuzzy prediction interval models that incorporate an uncertainty representation of future predictions. The model is demonstrated using solar and wind generation and local load data from a real microgrid in Huatacondo, Chile, for one-day ahead forecasts to obtain the expected values together with fuzzy prediction intervals to represent future measurement bounds with a certain coverage probability. The proposed prediction interval models would help to enable the development of robust microgrid EMS.

Abstract: High penetration levels from renewable energy sources in large-scale power systems demand a high degree of flexibility in the transmission and distribution system. This paper presents a method for utilization of flexible demand in the low-voltage distribution system using the thermal mass of a building to defer power consumption from electric space heating. The power consumption for heating is controlled by an operational virtual power plant, which is sending a set point for requested power consumption to the building management system. An optimization problem is formulated such that the discrete dispatch of power from ten electric space heaters is following the power set point given constraints on the indoor comfort that is defined by the users of the building. The controlling method has been implemented in an intelligent office building and used for demonstration of flexible demand in the low voltage network.

Abstract: This paper describes the development of a multi-function control strategy for the stable operation of distributed generation (DG) units during the integration with the power grid. The proposed control model is based on direct Lyapunov control (DLC) theory and provides a stable region for the proper operation of DG units during the integration with the power grid. The compensation of instantaneous variations in the reference current components in ac-side and dc-voltage variations in the dc-side of the interfacing system are adequately considered in this control plan, which is the main contribution and novelty of this paper in comparison with previous control strategies. Utilization of the DLC technique in DG technology can confirm the continuous injection of maximum active power in fundamental frequency from the DG source to the power grid, compensating all the reactive power and harmonic current components of grid-connected loads through the integration of DG link into the grid. Application of this concept in smart grids system can guarantee to reduce the stress on the utility grid during the peak of energy demand. Simulation and experimental test results are presented to demonstrate the proficiency and performance of the proposed DLC technique in DG technology.

Abstract: Sales of privately-owned plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are projected to increase dramatically in coming years and their charging will impact residential service transformer loads. Transformer life expectancy is strongly related to the cumulative effects of internal winding temperatures, which are a function of loading. Thermal models exist (e.g., IEEE Standard C57.91) for predicting these internal temperatures, the most sophisticated being the Annex G model. While this model has been validated with measurements from large power transformers, small residential service transformers have been given less attention. Given increasing PEV loads, a better understanding of service transformer aging could be useful in replacement planning processes. Empirical data from this paper indicate that the Annex G model over-estimates internal temperatures in small 25 kVA 65 degrees C rise mineral-oil-immersed transformers. This paper presents an alternative model to Annex G by using a genetic program. Empirical results using a thermally-instrumented transformer suggest that this model is both simpler and more accurate at tracking empirical transformer data. We conclude that one can use a simple thermal model in combination with data from advanced metering infrastructure to more accurately estimate service transformer lifetimes, and thus better plan for transformer replacement.

Abstract: This paper presents a new risk assessment method that is applicable to extreme cases in power systems. This paper analyzes the interactions among protection system components and the power grid in extreme events pertaining to simultaneous faults and cascading failures. The hidden failures of protection systems could exacerbate power system conditions if cascading events tend to follow a path to a blackout. The proposed risk assessment considers detailed reliability models of protection system components including circuit breakers (CBs) and protective relays. The failure probability of a CB is formulated considering its component degradation rate and operation times. The failure model of a protective relay is constructed using the dynamic fault tree. The evolution of cascading failures of power systems in extreme conditions, which deteriorates due to protection system malfunctions, is modeled based on the actual physical system behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed risk assessment method is demonstrated using a modified 9-bus system and the IEEE 68-bus system.

Abstract: Condition monitoring and diagnosis have become an essential part of power transformer asset management. A variety of online and offline measurements have been performed in utilities for evaluating different aspects of transformers' conditions. However, properly processing measurement data and explicitly correlating these data to transformer condition is not a trivial task. This paper proposes an intelligent framework for condition monitoring and assessment of power transformer. Within this framework, various signal processing and pattern recognition techniques are applied for automatically denoising sensor acquired signals, extracting representative characteristics from raw data, and identifying types of faults in transformers. This paper provides case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and techniques for power transformer asset management. The hardware and software platform for implementing the proposed intelligent framework will also be presented in this paper.

Abstract: Dynamic asset rating (DAR) is one of the number of techniques that could be used to facilitate low carbon electricity network operation. Previous work has looked at this technique from an asset perspective. This paper focuses, instead, from a network perspective by proposing a dynamic network rating (DNR) approach. The models available for use with DAR are discussed and compared using measured load and weather data from a trial network area within Milton Keynes in the central area of the U.K. This paper then uses the most appropriate model to investigate, through a network case study, the potential gains in dynamic rating compared to static rating for the different network assets-transformers, overhead lines, and cables. This will inform the network operator of the potential DNR gains on an 11-kV network with all assets present and highlight the limiting assets within each season.

Abstract: This paper presents game-theoretic frameworks for demand response at both electricity market and consumer levels. First, the interaction between a demand response aggregator (DRA) and electricity generators is modeled as a Stackelberg game in which the DRA, as the leader of the game, makes demand reduction bids, and generators, as followers, compete for maximizing their profits based on the reduced demand. Next, the interaction between the DRA and consumers is modeled as a mechanism design problem wherein the DRA seeks to minimize the aggregate inconvenience of consumers while achieving the targeted load curtailment. The inconvenience function of each consumer is captured by a type value, which is used by the DRA to solve the load curtailment problem. A Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-based mechanism is proposed, which guarantees that each consumer reveals its true type value to the DRA. A case study of the Stackelberg game shows that, in the South Australian electricity market where there is significant renewable penetration, peak period demand response provides the maximum potential profit, but off-peak demand response even in a concentrated market is not financially attractive.

Abstract: This paper presents a new modeling framework for analysis of impact and scheduling of price-responsive as well as controllable loads in a three-phase unbalanced distribution system. The price-responsive loads are assumed to be linearly or exponentially dependent on price, i.e., demand reduces as price increases and vice versa. The effect of such uncontrolled price-responsive loads on the distribution feeder is studied as customers seek to reduce their energy cost. Secondly, a novel constant energy load model, which is controllable by the local distribution company (LDC), is proposed in this paper. A controllable load is one that can be scheduled by the LDC through remote signals, demand response programs, or customer-end home energy management systems. Minimization of cost of energy drawn by LDC, feeder losses, and customers cost pertaining to the controllable component of the load are considered as objectives from the LDCs and customers' perspective. The effect of a peak demand constraint on the controllability of the load is further examined. The proposed models are tested on two feeders: 1) the IEEE 13-node test feeder; and 2) a practical LDC feeder system. Detailed studies examine the operational aspects of price-responsive and controllable loads on the overall system. It is observed that the LDC controlled load model results in a more uniform system load profile, and that with a reduction in the peak demand cap, the energy drawn decreases, consequently reducing feeder losses and LDC's and customers' costs.

Abstract: Through smart metering in the smart grid end-user domain, load profiles are measured per household. Personal data can be inferred from these load profiles by using nonintrusive appliance load monitoring methods, which has led to privacy concerns. Privacy is expected to increase with longer intervals between measurements of load curves. This paper studies the impact of data granularity on edge detection methods, which are the common first step in nonintrusive load monitoring algorithms. It is shown that when the time interval exceeds half the on-time of an appliance, the appliance use detection rate declines. Through a one-versus-rest classification modeling, the ability to detect an appliance's use is evaluated through F-scores. Representing these F-scores visually through a heatmap yields an easily understandable way of presenting potential privacy implications in smart metering to the end-user or other decision makers.

Abstract: This letter presents a performance enhancement for a previously developed direct load control scheme that controls (toggles on/off) thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) through two-way communication infrastructure for providing load balancing services. In addition to device operating temperature and on/off status (TCA states), two more pieces of information, rates of temperature increase and decrease (RTI/RTD), are calculated at each TCA and communicated to the central controller. By communicating the RTI/RTD to the central controller, the same or even better control performance can be achieved at 2-3 times longer sampling periods, showing significant reduction of the communication needs from each TCA to the central controller.

Abstract: Smart transmission grids are intended to utilize various measurements for enhanced operation. In particular, synchronized phasor measurements have found many applications in this context. This paper presents a linear weighted least-squares (WLS) method for fault location estimation of transmission lines by synchronized voltage measurements. The measurements may be taken from the faulted line terminals or buses far from the faulted line. The circuit equations of the network are used to find the transfer function between the fault location and each voltage measurement. Next, two auxiliary variables are defined to transform the nonlinear fault location estimation problem into a linear WLS problem. A closed-form solution is then obtained for fault location. The use of multiple measurements provides the opportunity of identifying erroneous measurements by a statistical test. The linearity of the problem expedites both estimation and identification procedures. Moreover, the method requires neither to classify the fault type nor to estimate the fault resistance. Furthermore, transmission lines are modeled by distributed parameters so that the method can be applicable to long lines. Electromagnetic transient simulations for 9-bus and 22-bus test systems reveal accurate fault location estimation, regardless of fault type and resistance, as well as successful identification of measurement errors.

Abstract: To protect complex power-grid control networks, power operators need efficient security assessment techniques that take into account both cyber side and the power side of the cyber-physical critical infrastructures. In this paper, we present CPINDEX, a security-oriented stochastic risk management technique that calculates cyber-physical security indices to measure the security level of the underlying cyber-physical setting. CPINDEX installs appropriate cyber-side instrumentation probes on individual host systems to dynamically capture and profile low-level system activities such as interprocess communications among operating system assets. CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state. The results of our experiments with actual attacks against a real-world power control network shows that CPINDEX, within few seconds, can efficiently compute the numerical indices during the attack that indicate the progressing malicious attack correctly.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust control strategy for reducing system frequency deviation, caused by load fluctuation and renewable sources, in a smart microgrid system with attached storage. Frequency deviations are associated with renewable energy sources because of their inherent variability. In this work, we consider a microgrid where fossil fuel generators and renewable energy sources are combined with a reasonably sized, fast acting battery-based storage system. We develop robust control strategies for frequency deviation reduction, despite the presence of significant (model) uncertainties. The advantages of our approach are illustrated by comparing system frequency deviation between the proposed system (designed via mu synthesis) and the reference system which uses governors and conventional PID control to cope with load and renewable energy source transients. All the simulations are conducted in the Matlab (TM) and Simulink (TM) environment.

Abstract: As the penetration of renewable energy resources increases in distribution networks, so does the need to manage these resources in an effective manner. Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical control approach and new mathematical optimization models of greenhouses, which can be readily incorporated into energy hub management systems (EHMSs) in the context of smart grids to optimize the operation of their energy systems. In greenhouses, artificial lighting, CO2 production, and climate control systems consume considerable energy; thus, a mathematical model of greenhouses appropriate for their optimal operation is proposed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing greenhouse control systems. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of greenhouses; in particular, inside temperature and humidity, CO2 concentration, and lighting levels should be kept within acceptable ranges. Therefore, the proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing control systems in greenhouses. Effects of uncertainty in electricity price and weather forecast on optimal operation of the storage facilities are studied through Monte Carlo simulations. The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.

Abstract: Moving toward a carbon free energy system has become an objective for many countries nowadays. Among other changes, the electrification of strategic sectors, such as heating and transportation, is inevitable. As a consequence, the current power system load will substantially increase. In this context, the nature of the expected loads (heat pumps, plug-in electric vehicles, etc.) makes the low voltage (LV) networks specially targeted. A promising solution to overcome the challenges resulting from their grid integration is demand response (DR). This paper introduces a hierarchical structure for controlling the DR of a LV grid. This is designed to maximize the grid utilization, thereby reducing the need for reinforcement; accommodate the maximum number of flexible loads; and satisfy the power and comfort requirements from each of the consumers in the network. The validation of the proposed concept is made using a model of an LV network currently operative in Denmark. The results show that by using the proposed strategy a considerable improvement of the minimum system voltage and a better load distribution is obtained.

Abstract: Managing the widely distributed wood pole assets owned by typical electric power utilities in the USA is challenging in the absence of appropriate analytical tools. The traditional method of inspecting poles by headquarters or strictly age is insufficient for effective management since natural hazards cause the largest instantaneous pole replacements. A probabilistic framework is developed and presented in this paper to address this issue. Fragility assessment is conducted using Latin hypercube sampling to estimate pole failure probabilities conditional on wind speed intensities. Failure probability estimates are obtained using age-dependent fragility functions and appropriate distribution functions for maximum 3 s wind gust speeds. Pole locations from an electric power utility's database management system were imported into ArcMap, a component of Environmental Systems Research Institute geospatial processing program. Age distributions were extracted by county and used to estimate expected pole failures. A sort-algorithm on the failures-the inspection order indices gives the proposed appropriate order of pole locations to be inspected. These calculated values were added as a data layer into ArcMap generating a geospatial visualization of both the orders of pole inspections and probabilistic pole loss estimates for the electric utility by counties. Applying the framework will increase utilities' visibility into the vulnerability of their pole plants. Emergency preparedness will also improve, strengthening customer-perception on utilities' maintenance efforts.

Abstract: Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are expected to become widespread in the near future. However, high penetration of PHEVs can overload the distribution system. In smart grid, the charging of PHEVs can be controlled to reduce the peak load, known as demand-side management (DSM). In this paper, we focus on the DSM for PHEV charging at low-voltage transformers (LVTs). The objective is to flatten the load curve of LVTs, while satisfying each consumer's requirement for their PHEV to be charged to the required level by the specified time. We first formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem and then propose a decentralized water-filling-based algorithm to solve it. A moving horizon approach is utilized to handle the random arrival of PHEVs and the inaccuracy of the forecast nonPHEV load. We focus on decentralized solutions so that computational load can be shared by individual PHEV chargers and the algorithm is scalable. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time implementation of a multiagent-based game theory reverse auction model for microgrid market operations featuring conventional and renewable distributed energy resources (DER). Studies were conducted on a grid connected microgrid consisting of a synchronous generator, two inverter-based generation units, and a combined load. The multiagent-based platform was applied to monitor, control, and perform the reverse auction process of DERs. A competitive game-theory reverse auction model was investigated to schedule the DER unit commitment with an hour-ahead market approach for the 24 h of the day. The proposed methodology was realistically implemented and operated at the Florida International University smart grid test system. The investigation shows that the proposed algorithm and the industrial hardware-based infrastructure can be implemented in the existing electric utility grid as new assets of the system are added.

Abstract: If several feeders are interrupted in a severe accident, distribution networks should be restored by reconfiguring switches automatically with smart grid technologies. Although there have been several restoration algorithms developed to find the new network configuration, they might fail to restore the whole network if the network were critically damaged. The network's design has to guarantee that it is restorable under any possible failure for secure power delivery, but it is a computationally hard task to examine all possible failures in a large-scale network with complex electrical constraints. This paper proposes a novel method to find all the critical (unrestorable) line cuts with great efficiency to verify the network design. The proposed method first runs a fast screening algorithm based on hitting set enumeration; the algorithm selects suspicious cuts without naively examining all possible cuts. Next, unrestorable cuts are identified from the suspicious ones with another algorithm, which strictly tests the restorability of the network under each suspicious cut without redundantly repeating heavy power flow calculations. Thorough experiments on two distribution networks reveal that the proposed method can find thousands of unrestorable cuts from the trillions of possible cuts in a large 432-Bus network with no significant false negatives.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the price competition among electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) with renewable power generators (RPGs). As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, a competition among EVCSs to attract EVs is inevitable. Thereby, each EVCS sets its electricity price to maximize its revenue by taking into account the competition with neighboring EVCSs. We analyze the competitive interactions between EVCSs using game theory, where relevant physical constraints such as the transmission line capacity, the distance between EV and EVCS, and the number of charging outlets at the EVCSs are taken into account. We show that the game played by EVCSs is a supermodular game and there exists a unique pure Nash equilibrium for best response algorithms with arbitrary initial policy. The electricity price and the revenue of EVCSs are evaluated via simulations, which reveal the benefits of having RPGs at the EVCSs.

Abstract: Automated demand response can be a valuable resource for ancillary services in the power grid. This paper illustrates this value with the first experimental demonstration of frequency regulation from commercial building heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The experiments were conducted in Pugh Hall, a 40 000 sq. ft. commercial building located at the University of Florida. Detailed are the steps required to make this possible, including control architecture, system identification, and control design. Experiments demonstrate: that satisfactory frequency regulation service can be provided by the HVAC system without noticeable effect on the indoor climate, and the ancillary service provided by this system passes the qualification criteria for participating in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection's frequency regulation market.

Abstract: To increase the reliability of the power grid and reduce the risk of power supply failure, demand-side management (DSM) is of central importance. In this paper, a nonparametric test is applied to detect if the demand behavior of consumers is consistent with time-of-day electricity tariff initiatives. The test is based on Afriat's theorem in economics and has the unique feature that it provides necessary and sufficient conditions to detect if the price-demand behavior is consistent with utility maximization (i.e., the test detects demand-responsive consumers) without prior knowledge of the consumer's utility function. For consumers that are responsive to time-of-day pricing initiatives, a nonparametric learning algorithm is used to forecast power demands for unobserved electricity tariffs. The nonparametric learning algorithm can be used in anticipatory control structures in a DSM framework to achieve power usage objectives. Real-world data from Ontario's power system and numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of the nonparametric test and nonparametric learning algorithm for forecasting consumer demand.

Abstract: Life cycle management (LCM) combines a set of technical and economic activities with the specific goal of improving the long-term economic value of an asset. An LCM plan helps to make operational decisions for a component over its life cycle. It typically consists of preventive maintenance scheduling, condition monitoring, inspection activities, replacement or refurbishment planning, and spares management. It is developed based on a study of component failure modes, operating history, maintenance practices, aging, spares, and obsolescence. Utility companies have predominantly developed LCM plans based on heuristic approaches. The existing methods do not accurately cover the impact of maintenance on equipment reliability and cost. A state diagram is developed to simulate the aging, inspection, maintenance, repair, failure, and overhaul cycle of a component throughout its lifetime. This diagram can help in deciding the optimal maintenance policy, and also quantify the impact of maintenance on reliability and cost. Probabilistic tools are also developed to help in the evaluation of an LCM plan and for further optimization.

Abstract: With the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), an avalanche of new energy-use information became available. Better understanding of the actual power consumption patterns of customers is critical for improving load forecasting and efficient deployment of smart grid technologies to enhance operation, energy management, and planning of electric power systems. Unlike traditional aggregated system-level load forecasting, the AMI data introduces a fresh perspective to the way load forecasting is performed, ranging from very short-term load forecasting to long-term load forecasting at the system level, regional level, feeder level, or even down to the consumer level. This paper addresses the efforts involved in improving the system level intraday load forecasting by applying clustering to identify groups of customers with similar load consumption patterns from smart meters prior to performing load forecasting.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generic optimal industrial load management (OILM) model, which can be readily incorporated into energy hub management systems (EHMSs) for industrial customers, in interaction with local distribution companies (LDCs), for automated and optimal scheduling of their processes. The mathematical models comprise an objective function to minimize the total energy costs and/or demand charges for industrial customers, and a set of equality and inequality constraints to represent the industrial process, storage units, distribution system components, operator's requirements, and other relevant constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed OILM model is demonstrated in two industrial customers: 1) a flour mill; and 2) a water pumping facility. The results show that the proposed OILM model, in conjunction with communication and control infrastructures at the customer and LDC levels, would allow optimal operation of industrial EHMSs in smart grids.

Abstract: The presence of energy hubs and the advancement in smart grid technologies have motivated system planners to deploy intelligent multicarrier energy systems entitled "smart energy hub" (S.E. Hub). In this paper, we model S.E. Hub, and propose a modern energy management technique in electricity and natural gas networks based on integrated demand side management (IDSM). In conventional studies, energy consumption is optimized from the perspective of each individual user without considering the interactions with each other. Here, the interaction among S.E. Hubs in IDSM program is formulated as a noncooperative game. The existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) is proved. Additionally, the strategies for each S.E. Hub are determined by proposing a distributed algorithm. We also address the IDSM game in a cloud computing (CC) framework to achieve efficient data processing and information management. Simulations are performed on a grid consisting of ten S.E. Hubs. We compare the CC framework with conventional data processing techniques to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach in determining NE. It is also shown that in the NE, the energy cost for each S.E. Hub and the peak-to-average ratio of the electricity demand decrease substantially.

Abstract: A fully distributed control scheme of island ac microgrids that can perform the primary, secondary, and tertiary control locally in distributed generators (DGs) is proposed. In the control scheme, no central controller or external information exchange is needed, while the final frequency can be controlled within the allowable range and the DGs can share loads according to their increment costs. The low-pass filters are designed to decouple the dynamics of the microgrid and to improve the system performance. Simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the control scheme.

Abstract: Rapid development of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) brings new challenges and opportunities to the power industry. A large number of idle PHEVs can potentially be employed to form a distributed energy storage system for supporting renewable generation. To reduce the negative effects of unsteady renewable generation outputs, a stochastic optimization-based dispatch model capable of handling uncertain outputs of PHEVs and renewable generation is formulated in this paper. The mathematical expectations, second-order original moments, and variances of wind and photovoltaic (PV) generation outputs are derived analytically. Incorporated all the derived uncertainties, a novel generation shifting objective is proposed. The cross-entropy (CE) method is employed to solve this optimal dispatch model. Multiple patterns of renewable generation depending on seasons and renewable market shares are investigated. The feasibility and efficiency of the developed optimal dispatch model, as well as the CE method, are demonstrated with a 33-node distribution system.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel finite-state-machine (FSM) representation of long-term load operating waveforms for feature extraction and load identification. An operating waveform is first converted into a quantized sequence of states. Each state is assigned with 2-D numerical values: root mean square (RMS) current values and staying time values. A set of elemental states and events are defined to reduce the number of states and extract numerical features to represent electric loads for classification and identification. Three major categories of repeating patterns in waveforms that correspond to repeating operating actions are summarized and identification methods are proposed for each such category. Test results using a large dataset of real-world waveforms show that the different appliances have distinct ranges of features extracted from the proposed FSM representation, and thus can be identified with high accuracy.

Abstract: Demand-management programs intend to maintain supply-demand balance and reduce the total energy cost. In this paper, we propose a user-aware demand-management approach that manages residential loads while taking into consideration user preferences. Maximizing users' savings and comfort can be two contradicting objectives. We identify a trade-off between these two objectives and propose an energy consumption optimization model, as well as a game theoretic approach to take this trade-off into account. User comfort is modeled in a simple yet effective way that considers waiting time, type of appliance, as well as a weight factor to prioritize comfort over savings. The proposed game is based on a modified regret matching procedure and borrows advantages of both centralized and decentralized schemes. Through simulations, we show that the proposed approach is scalable, converges in acceptable times, introduces a very limited amount of overhead in the system, achieves very high cost savings, and preserves users' preferences. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the optimization model and the proposed approach.

Abstract: Service restoration is important in distribution networks following an outage. During the restoration process, the system operating conditions will fluctuate, including variation of the load demand and the output from distributed generators (DGs). These variations are hard to be predicted and the load demands are roughly estimated because of absence of real-time measurements, which can significantly affect the restoration strategy. In this paper, we report a robust restoration decision-making model based on information gap decision theory, which takes into account the uncertainty in the load and output of the DGs. For a given bounded uncertain set of parameters, the solutions can ensure feasibility and that an objective does not fall below a given threshold. We describe the implementation of a robust optimization algorithm based on a mixed integer quadratic constraint programming restoration model, the objective of which is to restore maximal outage loads. Numerical tests on a modified Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) 69-node distribution network are discussed to demonstrate the performance of the model.

Abstract: Aiming at eliminating the current drawbacks that exists in condition-based maintenance (CBM) decision-making, such defects as single objective model, difficulty in controlling the process, and individual rather than group decision-making, this paper proposed a multiobjective group decision-making CBM model based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory by establishing maintenance decision-making framework, setting index system and quantifying all the indices. The model takes decision-making indices as evidence sources and maintenance schemes as knowledge framework, solving the problem of difficulty in demarcation of objectives and constraints. Maintenance schemes are achieved according to mean residual life prediction based on maintenance guidance and current condition quantified by health index to estimate the most appropriately maintenance interval. After that, standardized values of indices under each scheme are normalized into mass function of D-S evidence theory. Then, considering comprehensive weights of indices decision-makers, multiobjective group decision-making results of maintenance types, and time intervals are obtained. Finally, a numerical case is studied to illustrate the proposed modeling process, and demonstrates that the model can effectively realize multiobjective group decision-making, as well as considering the intentions of decision makers while all indices can reach global optimum.

Abstract: This paper presents a flexible and robust numerical algorithm for fault location on transmission lines. The algorithm does not require line parameters to locate the fault, which is an advance over fault locators that do require such information. Line parameters are only approximately constant; they vary with different loading and weather conditions, which affects the accuracy of existing fault location algorithms. Thus, an approach which does not require line parameters would be more robust, accurate, and flexible. Accurately, locating faults on transmission lines is vital for expediting their repair, so the proposed solution could lead to an improvement in the security and quality of the energy supply. Development of the proposed algorithm was facilitated by new smart grid technologies in the field of wide-area monitoring, protection, and control. The proposed algorithm is based on emerging synchronized measurement technology, using synchronized data sampling at both line terminals; however, the "SynchroCheck" procedure is also proposed as a means of accurately locating faults when data sampling synchronization has been lost. This paper presents the algorithm derivation and the results of thorough testing using alternative transients program-electromagnetic transients program (ATP-EMTP) fault simulations.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal charging strategy for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to be used in electric distribution networks. The optimization algorithm is made up of two phases: 1) an optimal power flow calculation; and 2) a linear optimization. The former, while taking into account the power system technical constraints, sets the upper bounds to the recharge power for each vehicle and the latter defines the recharge profiles of each PEV. In order to test the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm, a case study was set up. The connection of 300 PEVs to the Conseil International des Grands Reseaux lectriques (CIGRE) European low voltage benchmark network has been simulated. The proposed algorithm has been compared with a nonoptimal charging strategy, which assigns a flat charging profile by dividing the energy requested by the desired recharge time. The results show that the optimization algorithm both complies with the energy requests set by the end users and with the technical operation limits of the network. This allows for PEVs to provide a basic-although of paramount importance-service to the grid: the smart charge.

Abstract: When considering the characteristics of electric power systems in the U.S., the local distribution is the most likely part to be adversely affected by the unregulated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging. The increased load that can result from unregulated charging of PEVs could dramatically accelerate the aging of electrical transformers. In this paper, the control strategies that can mitigate or eliminate the accelerated aging that could result from load peaks caused by PEV charging is developed. The aging model makes it possible to develop charging control strategies that protect the transformer system while maximizing overall PEV charging quality. The charging control policy makes use of load prediction algorithms using data-driven models that are based on actual electricity consumption data. The experimental tests are done to calibrate the thermal model of a 25 kVA distribution transformer and validate the effectiveness of the control strategy.

Abstract: Microgrids are perceived to play an important role in the future of smart grids. Cost reduction and frequency regulation are among the major concerns in this context. This paper aims to study the mutual impacts of these issues and to propose an integrated mathematical framework in order to achieve minimum costs while maintaining frequency-regulation requirements. Inspired by the operational practices and requisites of the real-world microgrid applications, different methods of frequency control are reviewed and discussed. This is followed by developing adequate models for the different types of frequency-regulation mechanisms in the framework of the microgrid generation scheduling problem. The application of the proposed methodology to the Bella Coola microgrid in British Columbia, Canada, is explained, and several numerical results are presented and discussed.

Abstract: In a smart micro-grid (MG) each generator or load has to take part in the network management, joining in reactive power supply/voltage control, active power supply/frequency control, fault ride-through capability, and power quality control. This paper includes a new concept for building integration in MGs with zero grid-impact so improving the MG efficiency. These aims are shown to be achievable with an intelligent system, based on a dc/ac converter connected to the building point of coupling with the main grid. This system can provide active and reactive power services also including a dc link where storage, generation, and loads can be installed. The system employed for validation is a prototype available at ENEA Laboratories (Italian National Agency for New Technologies). A complete and versatile model in MATLAB/SIMULINK is also presented. The simulations results and the experimental test validation are included. The trial confirms the model goodness and the system usefulness in MG applications.

Abstract: Electricity cost has become a big concern of commercial cloud service providers with the rapid expansion of network-based cloud computing. Locationally, dispersed large-scale Internet data centers (IDCs) that underpin the cloud have increasing impact on the regional electricity market with their skyrocketing energy consumption. In this paper, the electricity market participation and accordingly the demand response capability of an IDC is defined as its temporally and spatially shiftable electricity demand quantities for processing delay-tolerant central processing unit-intense batch computing jobs. The demand response capability of the IDC is obtained by the proposed electric demand management solution. Price-sensitive and cooling efficiency-enabled batch computing workload dispatch with the objective of minimizing electricity cost is realized by dynamic IDC server consolidation and scheduling with virtual machine live migration technology. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed demand management solution in IDC energy consumption and electricity cost reduction.

Abstract: A power packet dispatching system is expected to be one of the advanced power distribution systems for controlling electric power, providing energy on demand, and reducing wasted energy consumption. In this paper, power packet routers are designed and experimentally verified for realizing a networked power packet distribution system. While the previously developed router directly forwards the power packet to a load, the new router forwards the packet to the other router with an information tag reattached to the power payload. In addition, the new router can adjust the starting time for forwarding the received power packet to the other site, thus utilizing storage capacity integrated into the router. The results successfully clarify the feasibility of the power packet distribution network.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel flow invariants-based approach to microgrid management that is much more intuitive, less complex, and highly scalable in comparison with existing droop control, agent-based, and model predictive control-based approaches. These proclaimed advantages are exemplified by using a renewable energy-based microgrid (a microgrid-in-a-container) for a military forward operating base camp as the model system. The ability of the proposed approach to maintain the overall system stability and valid power flows while efficiently managing distributed energy resources through multiple operational modes is reflected by using a requirements matrix, and proven techniques in distributed systems and formal analysis. A Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD) simulation is used to validate and verify the real-world practicality of the proposed control approach.

Abstract: Voltage and frequency fluctuation associated with renewable integration have been well identified by power system operators and planners. At the microgrid level, a novel device for the implementation of dynamic load response, which is known as the electric springs (ES), has been developed for mitigating both active and reactive power imbalances. In this paper, a comprehensive control strategy is proposed for ES to participate in both voltage and frequency response control. It adopts the phase angle and amplitude control which respectively adjust the active power and the reactive power of the system. The proposed control strategy is validated using a model established with power system computer aided design/electro-magnetic transient in dc system. Results from the case studies show that with appropriate setting and operating strategy, ES can mitigate the voltage and frequency fluctuation caused by wind speed fluctuation, load fluctuation, and generator tripping wherever it is installed in the microgrid.

Abstract: Proactive preparedness to cope with emergencies, especially those of nature origins, significantly improves the resilience and minimizes the restoration cost of electric power systems. In this paper, a proactive resource allocation model for repair and restoration of potential damages to the power system infrastructure located on the path of an upcoming hurricane is proposed. The objective is to develop an efficient framework for system operators to minimize potential damages to power system components in a cost-effective manner. The problem is modeled as a stochastic integer program with complete recourse. The large-scale mixed-integer equivalence of the original model is solved by the Benders' decomposition method to handle computation burden. The standard IEEE 118-bus system is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and further discuss its merits.

Abstract: We propose a compression approach for load profile data, which addresses practical requirements of smart metering. By providing linear time complexity with respect to the input data size, our compression approach is suitable for low-complexity encoding and decoding for storage and transmission of load profile data in smart grids. Furthermore, it allows for resumability with very low overhead on error-prone transmission lines, which is an important feature not available for standard time series compression schemes. In terms of compression efficiency, our approach outperforms transmission encodings that are currently used for electricity metering by an order of magnitude.

Abstract: This paper proposes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles bidirectional charging/discharging and state of charge (SoC) control for a microgrid frequency stabilization using a multiple model predictive control (MMPC). The MMPC is the improved version of a model predictive control (MPC) for working with multiple operating condition of the system. The MPC is an effective model-based prediction which calculates the future control signals by optimization of a quadratic programming based on the plant model, past manipulate, and control signals of the system. By optimization of an electric vehicle power control signal at each time instant, as well as changing the MPC by electric vehicle battery SoC, the proposed MMPC is able to improve the frequency stabilization of the microgrid effectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-step methodology for scheduling electric vehicle (EV) charging, which limits the burden on distribution and transmission assets while ensuring all the vehicles are charged. In the first step, the number of vehicles to be charged during each hour is optimized based on day-ahead requests for charging. The second step determines the maximum number of vehicles that can be charged based on operating conditions during the next hour to ensure distribution reliability requirements are met. A numerical example is given to illustrate the EV charging management scheme. This technique will limit the effects of EV charging on distribution assets.

Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) create power imbalance and congestion in the existing power network, and hence causes significant problems in the control and operation. Despite investing huge efforts from the electric utilities, governments, and researchers, smart grid (SG) is still at the developmental stage to address those issues. In this regard, a smart grid testbed (SGT) is desirable to develop, analyze, and demonstrate various novel SG solutions, namely demand response, real-time pricing, and congestion management. In this paper, a novel SGT is developed in a laboratory by scaling a 250 kVA, 0.4 kV real low-voltage distribution feeder down to 1 kVA, 0.22 kV. Information and communication technology is integrated in the scaled-down network to establish real-time monitoring and control. The novelty of the developed testbed is demonstrated by optimizing EV charging coordination realized through the synchronized exchange of monitoring and control packets via an heterogeneous Ethernet-based mesh network.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of voltage source converter interfaced distributed generators (DGs) for reactive power support in active distribution networks. Integration of DG management systems into decentralized parts of the Volt/VAR management system is proposed. The solution is designed to address issues connected to increased DG penetration, while at the same time avoiding the technical challenges and high costs related to state-of-the-art model-based Volt/VAR management. Coordination of DGs with conventional voltage regulation equipment is based on predefined control hierarchies. However, to reduce requirements for data handling capability, the distribution grid is divided into zones with individual voltage regulation and reactive support schemes. To add flexibility and scalability, these zones can be combined into larger zones with a common Volt/VAR management scheme. This is referred to as adaptive zoning. The results indicate that the control schemes successfully restore voltage to within limits after disturbance of grid conditions. Adaptive zoning effectively reduces system complexity and requirements for data handling capability, while still ensuring a grid-wide solution.

Abstract: Due to the rapid deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) on large power grids, the system operators now have access to high speed high resolution data. A new class of monitoring and control applications are made possible with the PMUs. Although PMU based monitoring systems have been well developed, implementations of PMU based fast acting closed loop wide area control systems are relatively rare. To meet the stringent latency requirements of a wide area controller the communication and power infrastructures have to collaborate strongly. In this paper, a combined process for design and simulation of both communication network and power network has been presented with the objective of damping interarea oscillations. A method to determine the optimal location of data routing hubs so as to minimize the volume of communications is also proposed. The IEEE 118 bus system is used to study the performance of communication system and the wide area power damping control system on both centralized and decentralized topologies, and the results are discussed. One of the conclusions of the paper is that the decentralized communication architectures involving data routing hubs are better suited for control applications requiring fast control actions.

Abstract: In the context of energy saving and carbon emission reduction, the electric vehicle (EV) has been identified as a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuel-driven vehicles. Due to a different refueling manner and driving characteristic, the introduction of EVs to the current logistics system can make a significant impact on the vehicle routing and the associated operation costs. Based on the traveling salesman problem, this paper proposes a new optimal EV route model considering the fast-charging and regular-charging under the time-of-use price in the electricity market. The proposed model aims to minimize the total distribution costs of the EV route while satisfying the constraints of battery capacity, charging time and delivery/pickup demands, and the impact of vehicle loading on the unit electricity consumption per mile. To solve the proposed model, this paper then develops a learnable partheno-genetic algorithm with integration of expert knowledge about EV charging station and customer selection. A comprehensive numerical test is conducted on the 36-node and 112-node systems, and the results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm.

Abstract: In the past decade, distribution network operators have been broadly engrossed toward automated distribution networks. The operators acknowledge network automation as an efficient investment toward a better service reliability. This paper aims to provide a new long-term cost/benefit analysis for an optimal level of distribution network automation. In the analysis, reduction in customer outage cost is considered as the benefit of implementing automation systems with capital investment, and annual operation and maintenance costs. In the Finnish regulation model, there is a special incentive based on customer outage cost reduction. As the main contribution of this paper, the impact of earth fault events and their required time-consuming fault management process is taken into account within the calculation of the benefit of automation systems. The solution of the analysis consists of the optimal number and location of remote-controlled sectionalizing switches, which are building blocks of automation systems. The problem is formulated in a mixed-integer linear programming format that can be effectively solved by commercially available solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the Helsinki distribution network. The results show that neglecting the impact of earth fault events can lead to suboptimal solutions.

Abstract: One of the most challenging problems associated with operation of smart micro-grids is the optimal energy management of residential buildings with respect to multiple and often conflicting objectives. In this paper, a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed for optimal energy use in a smart home, considering a meaningful balance between energy saving and a comfortable lifestyle. Thorough incorporation of a mixed objective function under different system constraints and user preferences, the proposed algorithm could not only reduce the domestic energy usage and utility bills, but also ensure an optimal task scheduling and a thermal comfort zone for the inhabitants. To verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, a number of simulations were performed under different scenarios using real data, and the obtained results were compared in terms of total energy consumption cost, users' convenience rates, and thermal comfort level.

Abstract: In modern power systems and electricity markets, demand response (DR) programs play an important role enabling the mitigation of critical load periods or price-peaking scenarios, thereby improving system reliability. Price fluctuations, in forward or real-time markets, can be an effective price-based DR mechanism for curtailing or shifting load. However, using dynamic pricing to achieve a desired load profile requires both an accurate demand forecast and knowledge of the price elasticity of demand, which is notoriously difficult to estimate. The limited accuracy of these parameter estimates is the main source of uncertainty limiting appropriate DR implementation. In this paper, we present a novel DR scheme that avoids the need to predict the price elasticity of demand or demand forecast, yet still delivers a significant DR. This is done based on the consumers' submissions of candidate load profiles ranked in the preference order. The load aggregator then performs the final selection of individual load profiles subject to the total system cost minimization. Additionally, the proposed DR model incorporates a fair billing mechanism that is enhanced with an ex post consumer performance tracking scheme implemented in a context of a virtual power plant aggregating load and generation units.

Abstract: The purpose of underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) is to maintain the frequency of an interconnected or island power system within permissible limits in case of severe power deficits. Thus, the proper performance of UFLS scheme is of great importance. In hybrid power systems, disconnecting and connecting the power generation sources and loads result in variations in the system parameters. Moreover, the output power of some distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaic (PV) or wind turbine generator (WTG), might change during the load shedding process. These factors may affect the performance of the load shedding scheme and decrease the reliability of power system. Hence, in this paper, a UFLS scheme is proposed that has two advantages: 1) it is independent of power system parameters; and 2) it considers power generation variations during the load shedding process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed load shedding method, simulation studies are carried out on a hybrid power system including PV, WTG, fuel cell, diesel generator, and battery energy storage system. Finally, the performance of the proposed method on a multiarea power system is evaluated.

Abstract: The customer domain of the smart grid naturally blends with smart home and smart building systems, but typical proposed approaches are "distributor-centric" rather than "customer-centric," undermining user acceptance, and are often poorly scalable. To solve this problem, we propose a detailed architecture and an implementation of a "last-meter" smart grid-the portion of the smart grid on customer premises-embedded in an internet-of-things (IoT) platform. Our approach has four aspects of novelty and advantages with respect to the state of the art: 1) seamless integration of smart grid with smart home applications in the same infrastructure; 2) data gathering from heterogeneous sensor communication protocols; 3) secure and customized data access; and 4) univocal sensor and actuator mapping to a common abstraction layer on which additional concurrent applications can be built. A demonstrator has been built and tested with purposely-developed ZigBee smart meters and gateways, a distributed IoT server, and a flexible user interface.

Abstract: This paper presents a rule-based approach using synchrophasor measurements for generating unit model validation and calibration. The proposed method utilizes frequency and three-phase voltage signals recorded by phasor measurement unit at the point of common coupling of unit transformers to the high voltage grid. In the simulation setup, by taking the hybrid data simulation technique in use, the signals are being injected to the subsystem of generating units through a voltage source, which models the truncated external grid. The measured and simulated active power oscillations are then compared to each other and the effects of generating unit parameters on the oscillation mismatches are extracted. The maximum amplitude and damping ratio of oscillations are two main aspects of the observed mismatches. To recognize the most effective parameters on these aspects, a sensitivity analysis technique is applied. Next, identified parameters are adjusted to calibrate the generating unit dynamic model. Finally, quantitative and qualitative perspectives of the proposed method are investigated through different sorts of actual disturbances. The obtained results demonstrate that the final calibrated model outperforms the existing one, and it can be used for power system planning and operation studies. Time domain simulations are performed by DIgSILENT power factory software.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of fractional order (FO) controllers for a microgrid. The microgrid employs various autonomous generation systems like wind turbine generator, solar photovoltaic, diesel energy generator, and fuel-cells. Other storage devices like the battery energy storage system and the flywheel energy storage system are also present in the power network. An FO control strategy is employed and the FO-proportional integral derivative (PID) controller parameters are tuned with a global optimization algorithm to meet system performance specifications. A kriging based surrogate modeling technique is employed to alleviate the issue of expensive objective function evaluation for the optimization based controller tuning. Numerical simulations are reported to prove the validity of the proposed methods. The results for both the FO and the integer order controllers are compared with standard evolutionary optimization techniques, and the relative merits and demerits of the kriging based surrogate modeling are discussed. This kind of optimization technique is not only limited to this specific case of microgrid control, but also can be ported to other computationally expensive power system optimization problems.

Abstract: In this paper, a goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) based controller is developed for the doubly-fed induction generator based wind farm to improve the system transient stability under fault conditions. The proposed controller is based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques to approximate the optimal control policy according to the interaction between the controller and the power plant. Compared to existing ADP approaches with one action network and one critic network, our GrHDP architecture introduces an additional network, i.e., the reference network, to form an internal goal/reward representation. This better mapping between the system state and the control action significantly improves the control performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated via two cases. The first case investigates a revised four-machine two-area system with high wind penetration and a static synchronous compensator. The second case is a practical size power system with wind farm in Liaoning Province in China. Detailed simulation analysis and comparative studies with traditional ADP approaches are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control strategy for coordinated operation of networked microgrids (MGs) in a distribution system. The distribution network operator (DNO) and each MG are considered as distinct entities with individual objectives to minimize the operation costs. It is assumed that both the dispatchable and nondispatchable distributed generators (DGs) exist in the networked MGs. In order to achieve the equilibrium among all entities and take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs, we formulate the problem as a stochastic bi-level problem with the DNO in the upper level and MGs in the lower level. Each level consists of two stages. The first stage is to determine base generation setpoints based on the load and nondispatchable DG output forecasts and the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based on the realized scenarios. A scenario reduction method is applied to enhance a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden. Case studies of a distribution system with multiple MGs of different types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The centralized control, deterministic formulation, and stochastic formulation are also compared.

Abstract: With the emerging area of smart grids, one critical challenge faced by administrators of wide-area measurement systems is to analyze and model streaming data with limited resources on their embedded controllers. Usually, streaming data can be modeled as a multiset where each data item has its own frequency. In this paper, we study the problem on how to generate histograms of data items based on their frequency, so we can identify various issues such as power line tripping or line faults under constraints. The primary challenge for achieving this goal using conventional methods is that keeping an individual counter for each unique type of data is too memory-consuming, slow, and costly. In this paper, we describe a novel data structure and its associated algorithms, called the loglog bloom filter, for this purpose. This data structure extends the classical bloom filter with a recent technique called probabilistic counting, so it can effectively generate histograms for streaming data in one pass with sub-linear overhead. Therefore, this method is suitable for data processing in smart grids, where limited computational resources are available on the controllers. We analyze the performance, trade-offs, and capacity of this data structure, and evaluate it with real data traces collected through the frequency disturbance recorders deployed for the FNET/GridEye infrastructure. We demonstrate that this method can identify the frequencies of all unique items with high accuracy and low memory overhead, so that data outliers can be conveniently identified.

Abstract: In this paper, a double-quadrant state-of-charge (SoC)-based droop control method for distributed energy storage system is proposed to reach the proper power distribution in autonomous dc microgrids. In order to prolong the lifetime of the energy storage units (ESUs) and avoid the overuse of a certain unit, the SoC of each unit should be balanced and the injected/output power should be gradually equalized. Droop control as a decentralized approach is used as the basis of the power sharing method for distributed energy storage units. In the charging process, the droop coefficient is set to be proportional to the nth order of SoC, while in the discharging process, the droop coefficient is set to be inversely proportional to the nth order of SoC. Since the injected/output power is inversely proportional to the droop coefficient, it is obtained that in the charging process the ESU with higher SoC absorbs less power, while the one with lower SoC absorbs more power. Meanwhile, in the discharging process, the ESU with higher SoC delivers more power and the one with lower SoC delivers less power. Hence, SoC balancing and injected/output power equalization can be gradually realized. The exponent n of SoC is employed in the control diagram to regulate the speed of SoC balancing. It is found that with larger exponent n, the balancing speed is higher. MATLAB/simulink model comprised of three ESUs is implemented and the simulation results are shown to verify the proposed approach.

Abstract: Load management is a challenging issue in microdistribution systems dealing with power utilities. To efficiently detect fraudulent and abnormal consumption, this paper proposes the use of fractional-order self-synchronization error-based Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) to detect nontechnical losses and outage events. Under the advanced metering infrastructure technique, the Sprott system is a feature extractor, which tracks the differences between profiled usages and irregular usages, such as illegal and fault events. Thus, fraudulent consumption, outages, and service restoration activities can be pointed out, randomly initiated, and terminated in a real-time application. Multiple FPNs-based making-decision systems are used to locate abnormalities. Computer simulations are conducted using an IEEE 30-bus power system and medium-scale microdistribution systems to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Smart grid is advancing power grids significantly, with higher power generation efficiency, lower energy consumption cost, and better user experience. Microgrid utilizes distributed renewable energy generation to reduce the burden on utility grids. This paper proposes an energy ecosystem; a cost-effective smart microgrid based on intelligent hierarchical agents with dynamic demand response (DR) and distributed energy resource (DER) management. With a dynamic update mechanism, DR automatically adapts to users' preference and varying external information. The DER management coordinates operations of micro combined heat and power systems (mu CHPs), and vanadium redox battery (VRB) according to DR decisions. A two-level shared cost-led mu CHPs management strategy is proposed to reduce energy consumption cost further. VRB discharging is managed to be environment-adaptive. Simulations and numerical results show the proposed system is very effective in reducing the energy consumption cost while satisfying user's preference.

Abstract: Accurate information about dynamic states is important for efficient control and operation of a power system. This paper compares the performance of four Bayesian-based filtering approaches in estimating dynamic states of a synchronous machine using phasor measurement unit data. The four methods are extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, ensemble Kalman filter, and particle filter. The statistical performance of each algorithm is compared using Monte Carlo methods and a two-area-four-machine test system. Under the statistical framework, robustness against measurement noise and process noise, sensitivity to sampling interval, and computation time are evaluated and compared for each approach. Based on the comparison, this paper makes some recommendations for the proper use of the methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the operation optimization for a microgrid (MG) aggregator, which can procure energy from various sources including the pool market and local distributed energy resources to serve MG customers. We assume that the MG aggregator sells electricity to customers at a predefined retail rate and it also offers customers various contracts for adjusting their loads. Our design objective is to determine the optimal hourly bids that the MG aggregator submits to the day-ahead market to maximize its profit. To deal with various uncertainties, a risk-constrained scenario-based stochastic programming framework is proposed where the MG aggregator's risk aversion is modeled using conditional value at risk method. The proposed formulation enables customers' demand response (DR) aggregation to be integrated into the operation of the MG aggregator via contractual agreements. This design is not only beneficial for both MG aggregator and customers, but also facilitates the operation of the system operator (SO), since a single entity (i.e., the MG aggregator) is visible to the SO instead of two separate entities (i.e., a MG aggregator and a DR aggregator). Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) programs are implemented to encourage consumers to reduce their electricity demand when needed, e.g., at peak-load hours, by adjusting their controllable load. In this paper, our focus is on controllable load types that are associated with dynamic systems and can be modeled using differential equations. Examples of such load types include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; water heating; and refrigeration. In this regard, we propose a new DR model based on a two-level differential game framework. At the beginning of each DR interval, the price is decided by the upper level (aggregator, utility, or market) given the total demand of users in the lower level. At the lower level, for each player (residential or commercial buildings that are equipped with automated load control systems and local renewable generators), given the price from the upper level, the electricity usage of air conditioning unit, and the battery storage charging/discharging schedules, are controlled in order to minimize the user's total electricity cost. The optimal user strategies are derived using the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also show that the proposed game can converge to a feedback Nash equilibrium. Based on the effect of real-time pricing on users' daily demand profile, the simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed game and show how we can optimize consumers' electricity cost in the presence of time-varying prices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the energy scheduling problem for a household equipped with a solar assisted heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, and water heating system in the real-time pricing environment. Our objective is to minimize the electricity cost while maintaining user's thermal comfort requirements. We consider different types of loads with different characteristics, detailed modeling of thermal dynamics, and uncertainty in electricity price and solar energy. The advantage of the proposed design lies in the exploitation of the solar assisted thermal system that can flexibly utilize the energy from the solar source or from the grid during low-price periods to support the home hot water demand, user thermal indoor temperature preference while reducing the electricity cost. We present numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. Specifically, we show that the proposed design can achieve significant cost saving, allow flexible tradeoff between user comfort tolerance and electricity cost reduction, and efficiently adjust the electricity consumption load profile. We also analyze the influence of solar assisted thermal system factors such as the water tank temperature limit, solar collector size, and weather condition on the achievable cost.

Abstract: Microgrid is a key enabling solution to future smart grids by integrating distributed renewable generators and storage systems to efficiently serve the local demand. However, due to the random and intermittent characteristics of renewable energy, new challenges arise for the reliable operation of microgrids. To address this issue, we study in this paper the real-time energy management for a single microgrid system that constitutes a renewable generation system, an energy storage system, and an aggregated load. We model the renewable energy offset by the load over time, termed net energy profile, to be practically predictable, but with finite errors that can be arbitrarily distributed. We aim to minimize the total energy cost (modeled as sum of time-varying strictly convex functions) of the conventional energy drawn from the main grid over a finite horizon by jointly optimizing the energy charged/discharged to/from the storage system over time subject to practical load and storage constraints. To solve this problem in real time, we propose a new off-line optimization approach to devise the online algorithm. In this approach, we first assume that the net energy profile is perfectly predicted or known ahead of time, under which we derive the optimal off-line energy scheduling solution in closed-form. Next, inspired by the optimal off-line solution, we propose a sliding-window based online algorithm for real-time energy management under the practical setup of noisy predicted net energy profile with arbitrary errors. Finally, we conduct simulations based on the real wind generation data of the Ireland power system to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, as compared with other heuristically designed algorithms, as well as the conventional dynamic programming based solution.

Abstract: Global warming and environmental pollution concerns have promoted dramatic integrations of renewable energy sources all over the world. Associated with benefits of environmental conservation, essentially uncertain and variable characteristics of such energy resources significantly challenge the operation of power systems. In order to implement reliable and economical operations, a robust energy and reserve dispatch (RERD) model is proposed in this paper, in which the operating decisions are divided into pre-dispatch and re-dispatch. A robust feasibility constraint set is imposed on pre-dispatch variables, such that operation constraints can be recovered by adjusting re-dispatch after wind generation realizes. The model is extended to more general dispatch decision making problems involving uncertainties in the framework of adjustable robust optimization. By revealing the convexity of the robust feasibility constraint set, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming based oracle is presented to verify the robust feasibility of pre-dispatch decisions. A cutting plane algorithm is established to solve associated optimization problems. The proposed model and method are applied to a five-bus system as well as a realistic provincial power grid in China. Numeric experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective and efficient.

Abstract: An average absolute frequency deviation value based active islanding detection technique is proposed in this paper. The inverter's classical q-axis current controller is modeled with a continuous periodic reference current of a small value. During the loss of mains, the island's frequency deviates with respect to the variation in the reference current; this is detected by making the use of an average absolute frequency deviation value. In case of a stable island formation, there is a small periodic frequency deviation owing to the small value of the periodic reference current, and the frequency deviation is so small that it falls inside the nondetection zone (NDZ) of the frequency relay. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it detects the stable island formation but without forcing the island to lose its stable operation. In case of nonislanding switching events, which may transiently impose a significant deviation in the frequency, the possibility of false detection is eliminated by reconfirming the occurrence of islanding once it is suspected. The reference current is kept to a small value to limit the degradation of the power quality and the power factor. Computer simulation is done with MATLAB.

Abstract: Neighborhood area network (NAN) is one of the most important sections in smart grid communications. It connects residential customers as part of a two-way communication infrastructure responsible for transmitting power grid sensing and measuring status, as well as the control messages. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective, flexible, and sustainable NAN design using wireless technologies such as IEEE 802.11s and IEEE 802.16, as well as renewable energy such as solar power. We propose an optimization problem to minimize total cost. To solve the problem, we also study the problem of selecting the optimal number of gateways in a NAN. Moreover, in order to achieve fairness for the customers and to meet the most critical latency requirements, we propose geographical deployment methods for gateway data aggregate points (DAPs). Different transmission power of each gateway DAP is also carefully determined for the fairness, as well as for the maximum power efficiency. Unlike other researches using game theoretical approaches in multiaccess systems, we manage to achieve the global optimum solution and our results are more energy efficient.

Abstract: Demand response plays an important role in the development of the smart grid, which can effectively manage society's energy consumption. Cooling devices, such as refrigerators and freezers, are ideal devices for demand-response programs because their energy states can be controlled without reducing the lifestyle and comfort of the residents. Conversely, managing air conditioning and space heating would affect a resident's comfort level. Direct compressor control and thermostat control methods have been proposed in the past for controlling cooling devices but they are never studied concurrently. This paper proposes a new control mechanism and compares the effectiveness of the three control mechanisms for cooling devices in demand response. In addition, this paper illustrates the need for a damping strategy to mitigate demand oscillations that occur from synchronous fleet control.

Abstract: This paper presents mathematical optimization models of produce storage facilities to optimize the operation of their energy systems in the context of smart grids. In the storage facilities, climate control of the storage rooms consumes considerable energy; thus, in this paper, a mathematical model of storage facilities appropriate for their optimal operation is developed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing climate controllers. The proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing climate control systems in storage facilities. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of storage facilities, i.e., inside temperature and humidity should be kept within acceptable ranges. The performance of the proposed model for various electricity prices and weather conditions and their variations are studied via Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.

Abstract: Generator coherency identification is establishing itself as an important task to aid in the resistance of cascading failures within wide-area power systems and as a necessary preprocessing stage in real-time control for transient stability. Inspired by flocking behavior in nature, we propose a novel multiflock-based technique to identify generator coherence rapidly within a short observation window. Our measurement-based approach transforms generator data from the observation space to an information space, whereby the generator frequencies and phases characterize the movement and dynamics of boids within multiple flocks. Analysis of the boids' trajectories enables the discrimination of multiple flocks corresponding to coherent generator clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique to identify generator coherency rapidly while exhibiting robustness to environmental noise and cyber attack on the 39-bus New England test system and a modified IEEE 118-Bus test system.

Abstract: In the presence of distributed generation (DG), it is important to assure a fast and reliable protection system for the distribution network to avoid unintentional DG disconnection during fault conditions. In this paper, dual setting directional over-current relays are proposed for protecting meshed distribution systems with DG. Dual setting relays are equipped with two inverse time-current characteristics whose settings will depend on the fault direction. The protection coordination problem for the dual setting directional relay is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem where the objective is to minimize the overall time of operation of relays during primary and backup operation. The proposed protection coordination scheme using dual setting relays is compared against the conventional approach, which relies on the conventional one setting directional relay. The proposed scheme is applied to the power distribution network of the IEEE 30-bus system equipped with synchronous and inverter-based DG. The results show that the proposed protection coordination scheme with dual setting relay can significantly reduce the overall relay operating time, making it an attractive option for distribution systems with DG.

Abstract: As a consequence of the developments in electric transportation and the evolution toward smart grids, large-scale deployment of smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) becomes feasible. This leads to opportunities for different market parties to use the flexibility of EVs for various objectives that may be conflicting and result in a nonoptimal shifting of peak demands for the distribution grids. In this paper, we assess the financial impact of various EV charging strategies on distribution grids. We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads (from a network operators perspective) with a strategy to minimize charging costs (from the perspective of a commercial party). In a scenario with a high wind penetration in the system, the electricity prices are, for a significant part, determined by the instantaneous wind production. Therefore, we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and, consequently, on the resulting EV load and network impacts. We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value (NPV) of the investments costs and energy losses. We found that, in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices, the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25% higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized. The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration. The results strongly suggest that the situation where EVs are controlled with a strategy to minimize charging costs that does not take the distribution grids into account may not lead to an optimal situation when the entire electricity delivery system is regarded.

Abstract: Recently, distributed energy resources (DERs) are becoming more attractive to supply local loads under concept of microgrids. These new parts of the power system have basically different dynamics compared with conventional power plants (CPPs). Some of them do not have any rotating inertia and most of them are connected to the grid by power electronic interfaces. Stability and control of microgrids and the entire power system containing DERs and CPPs is one of the most important challenges of the recent power systems. Interactions between microgrids in grid-connected mode and CPPs should be coordinated to ensure and improve the stability of power system. In this paper, the effect of the increased penetration of DERs on the load frequency problem of power system is studied. Basically, synchronous generators of CPPs determine the dynamic behavior of power system for frequency control and are responsible to compensate load changes of the system. With the high penetration of DERs, these new parts can contribute in the frequency control. It is shown that with appropriate control of DERs in microgrids, the frequency deviation of the power system will decrease and the stability margin can be increased.

Abstract: Energy storage systems (ESSs) are often proposed to support the frequency control in microgrid systems. Due to the intermittency of the renewable generation and constantly changing load demand, the charging/discharging of various ESSs in an autonomous microgrid needs to be properly coordinated to ensure the supply-demand balance. Recent research has discovered that the charging/discharging efficiency of ESSs has remarkable dependence on the charging/discharging rate and state-of-charge of the ESS. This paper proposes a distributed cooperative control strategy for coordinating the ESSs to maintain the supply-demand balance and minimize the total power loss associated with charging/discharging inefficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation results.

Abstract: Smart grid, as the next power grid, can efficiently monitor, predicate, and control energy generation/consumption by using the real-time users' electricity information. However, the fine-grained user energy consumption information may reveal the private information of the user. In this paper, we construct a linkable anonymous credential protocol based on Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signature. Then, we propose a privacy preserving smart metering scheme based on the new linkable anonymous credential. In addition to providing privacy protection for the user, our protocol also has the security properties of message authentication and traceability of fault smart metering. And there are some other useful features in our protocol, such as no need of trust-third party, dynamic users' enrollment and revocation, and complex statistical analysis of the energy use information. The computation cost and communication overhead of our scheme is O(1), which is independent of the user number. The simulation results show that our scheme is efficient.

Abstract: Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are being rapidly deployed in power grids due to their high sampling rates and synchronized measurements. The devices high data reporting rates present major computational challenges in the requirement to process potentially massive volumes of data, in addition to new issues surrounding data storage. Fast algorithms capable of processing massive volumes of data are now required in the field of power systems. This paper presents a novel parallel detrended fluctuation analysis (PDFA) approach for fast event detection on massive volumes of PMU data, taking advantage of a cluster computing platform. The PDFA algorithm is evaluated using data from installed PMUs on the transmission system of Great Britain from the aspects of speedup, scalability, and accuracy. The speedup of the PDFA in computation is initially analyzed through Amdahl's Law. A revision to the law is then proposed, suggesting enhancements to its capability to analyze the performance gain in computation when parallelizing data intensive applications in a cluster computing environment.

Abstract: A suitable networked control scheme and its stability analysis framework have been developed for controlling inherent electromechanical oscillatory dynamics observed in power systems. It is assumed that the feedback signals are obtained at locations away from the controller/actuator and transmitted over a communication network with the help of phasor measurement units (PMUs). Within the generic framework of networked control system (NCS), the evolution of power system dynamics and associated control actions through a communication network have been modeled as a hybrid system. The data delivery rate has been modeled as a stochastic process. The closed-loop stability analysis framework has considered the limiting probability of data dropout in computing the stability margin. The contribution is in quantifying allowable data-dropout limit for a specified closed loop performance. The research findings are useful in specifying the requirement of communication infrastructure and protocol for operating future smart grids.

Abstract: In this paper, the economic viability and profitability of a newly emerging storage technology, i.e., cryogenic energy storage (CES), is investigated. A real-time optimal dispatching algorithm is proposed and developed to optimally dispatch a privately owned CES unit to generate revenue by exploiting arbitrage opportunities in the day-ahead/week-ahead electricity market. Due to its special characteristics, CES can provide significantly more financial and technical benefits in a weekly scheduling compared with common daily scheduling. The electricity price modulation is proposed as a new approach to competitively offer subsidy by the utility regulator to CES owners to fill the gap between current and a stable expected rate of return. Using real-world price data from the Ontario wholesale electricity market, the method is validated. The results reveal significant benefits of weekly usage as compared to daily usage of CES. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed approach to subsidize CES owners are validated through simulation studies.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach to incorporate voltage source converter-based embedded HVDC for improving power system economic dispatch efficiency is proposed. An analytical formulation is presented to quantify the economic benefits of embedded HVDC by modeling its flow control as an injection-extraction pair in the economic dispatch of the transmission grid. A computationally efficient algorithm is proposed to rank the potential locations of such embedded HVDC. The algorithm is based on expected economic dispatch cost reduction weighted by the historical line shadow prices. The use of a distribution of historical data as a means of weighting also allows for incorporation of diurnal and seasonal influences on congestion patterns. Numerical case studies using the proposed method of locating the embedded HVDC suggest promising results in choosing the location of improved flow control devices.

Abstract: Smart meters, designed for information collection and system monitoring in smart grid, report fine-grained power consumption to utility providers. With these highly accurate profiles of energy usage, however, it is possible to identify consumers' specific activities or behavior patterns, thereby giving rise to serious privacy concerns. This paper addresses these concerns by designing a cost-effective and privacy-preserving energy management technique that uses a rechargeable battery. From a holistic perspective, a dynamic programming framework is designed for consumers to strike a tradeoff between smart meter data privacy and the cost of electricity. In general, a major challenge in solving dynamic programming problems lies in the need for the knowledge of future electricity consumption events. By exploring the underlying structure of the original problem, an equivalent problem is derived, which can be solved by using only the current observations. An online control algorithm is then developed to solve the equivalent problem based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. It is shown that without the knowledge of the statistics of the time-varying load requirements and the electricity price processes, the proposed online control algorithm, parametrized by a positive value V, is within O(1/V) of the optimal solution to the original problem, where the maximum value of V is limited by the battery capacity. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through extensive numerical analysis using real data.

Abstract: The concept of dynamic rating (DR) implies that the capacity of a component varies dynamically as a function of external parameters, while the rating traditionally is based on the worst-case. The value of DR thus lies in utilizing existing equipment to a greater extent. By implementing DR and correlating the new ratings with wind power generation, more generation can be implemented. The aim is hence to facilitate connection of renewable electricity production. This paper provides two main contributions: 1) a general dynamic line rating (DLR) calculation model on overhead lines; and 2) an economic optimization simulation model regarding wind power integration comparing DLR with more traditional approaches. These models can both be implemented together, but also separately. The DLR calculation model is easy to use by companies in daily operation where the dynamic line capacity is calculated as a function of static line capacity, wind speed, and ambient temperature. The DLR calculation model is furthermore compared with more comprehensive calculations that validate that the model is accurate enough. This paper also provides an application study where both proposed models are exemplified together and evaluated. Results from this study conclude that it is a significant economic potential of implementing DR within wind power integration.

Abstract: In order to study the impact of dynamic demand response in the future smart grid, we examine in an abstract framework how a tradeoff between efficiency and risk arises under different market architectures. We first examine the system performance under noncooperative and cooperative market architectures. The statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes show that, although the noncooperative load scheduling scheme leads to an efficiency loss, the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail, resulting in less frequent aggregate demand spikes. Cooperative dynamic demand response, on the other hand, makes the market place more efficient at the cost of increased risk of aggregate demand spikes. The market architecture determines the locus of the system performance with respect to the tradeoff curve. We also investigate how a properly designed real-time electricity pricing mechanism can help the system operator achieve a target tradeoff between efficiency and risk in a noncooperative market. We further provide a convex characterization of the Pareto front of system performance measures, which serves as a benchmark of the tradeoffs for the system operator to evaluate the pricing rules.

Abstract: Traditional proportional integral (PI) control has been extensively used for power control of voltage source converters in microgrid systems. Previous studies show that fixed-gain PI controllers cannot easily adapt to power changes, disturbances, and parameters variation, especially in large microgrids; hence the need for continuous algorithms to adjust the controller gains over the transients cannot be neglected. In this paper, a novel online tuning algorithm for PI controllers is proposed and implemented in a microgrid system. In this algorithm, which is based on the neuro-dynamic programming concept, a fuzzy critic is employed to evaluate the credibility of the control system performance and provide an evaluation signal, which is then used in the gain-tuning process. The PI controller gains are updated in an optimization process based on steepest decent rule so that the evaluation signal produced by the critic is minimized. The developed control structure, which is named critic-based self-tuning PI controller, is tested in a microgrid system with different penetrations of distributed generators and operational scenarios. The simulation results verify that implementation of a heuristic gain-tuning algorithm results in a model-independent controller with increased adaptivity compared with conventional PI control. Furthermore, due to simple learning rules, the convergence time is significantly reduced and the transient response is improved. The proposed gain-tuning algorithm can also be applied to PI controllers in other applications of controllable systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the real-time control and energy management of a dc microgrid incorporating hybrid energy sources with various loading schemes. In the proposed dc microgrid, a supercapacitor bank, a power buffer, and a pulse load are directly connected to a dc bus. The proposed system configuration highly improves the grid redundancy and reduces the total power losses. Moreover, the supercapacitor bank not only supplies the pulse load, but also supports the grid during transient periods when it is highly loaded. However, the energy management and control of such a system is more complex, since the heavy pulse load can cause high power pulsation and voltage drop. To reduce the adverse effects of the pulse load, a new real-time energy management system (EMS) with an adaptive energy calculator (AEC) based on the moving average measurement technique is developed. The proposed microgrid was implemented in hardware and experimentally tested. The results were compared with other methods, such as direct voltage control and continuous current averaging approaches. The results show that the developed EMS with AEC technique properly share the power and control the bus voltage under different loading conditions, while the adverse effects of the pulse load are highly reduced.

Abstract: Two problems are tackled in this paper: determining the active demand reduction potential of wet appliances and making time series estimates from project data. The former is an application of the latter. Household groups representative to the average population are defined by applying expectation maximization clustering to a representative measurement set (n = 1363). Attitudes toward active demand are found by conducting a survey (n = 418). Project data (n = 58) containing wet appliance measurements are scaled up by adapting the clustering algorithm, spreading the electricity demand of the wet appliances over the clusters. The potential for active demand reduction with wet appliances is 4% of the total residential power demand, assuming that 29% of the households take part. The potential is in the order of magnitude of the power reserves, but does not fulfill availability and response time requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for autonomous (islanded) operation of an electronically interfaced distributed generation unit and its load. In the grid-connected mode, the voltage-sourced converter is operated in the active and reactive power (PQ) control mode, where a conventional control scheme is used to control the active and reactive power exchange with the grid. In the islanded mode, the proposed FLC is used to control the voltage of the islanded system despite the load variability and uncertainties. In addition, this paper also presents the use of the black-box nonlinear optimization technique to tune the parameters of the membership functions of the FLC in order to achieve optimal performance. The salient features of the proposed FLC are: 1) efficient to deal with the nonlinear systems; 2) design does not depend on the mathematical model of the system; and 3) less sensitive to the parameters variation than the conventional controllers. The frequency of the islanded system is dictated through the use of an internal oscillator. The effectiveness of the proposed FLC in controlling the voltage of the islanded system, irrespective of the load variability, is extensively validated based on simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment. Moreover, the paper highlights the superiority of the proposed FLC over the conventional proportional-integral controllers through comparing the transient responses of the system based on both controllers.

Abstract: Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) seeks to determine the operation of individual loads in a building strictly from measurements made on an aggregate current signal serving a collection of loads. Great strides have been made in performing NILM for loads whose operating state can be represented by a finite-state machine, i.e., loads that consume discrete or distinct power levels for periods of time. It is much more difficult to track the operation of continuously variable loads that demand ever-changing power. These loads are becoming more prevalent as variable speed drives, daylight-responsive lighting, and other power electronic controlled loads emerge on the grid. This paper demonstrates a method for tracking the power consumption of variable demand loads nonintrusively. The method applies to any site where NILM might be of interest, including commercial and industrial buildings, residences, and transportation systems.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) can be effectively integrated with the power grid through vehicle-to-grid (V2G). V2G has been proven to reduce the EV owner cost, support the power grid, and generate revenues for the EV owner. Due to regulatory and physical considerations, aggregators are necessary for EVs to participate in electricity markets. The aggregator combines the capacities of many EVs and bids their aggregated capacity into electricity markets. In this paper, an optimal bidding of ancillary services coordinated across different markets, namely regulation and spinning reserves, is proposed. This coordinated bidding considers electricity market uncertainties using fuzzy optimization. The electricity market parameters are forecasted using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The fuzzy set theory is used to model the uncertainties in the forecasted data of the electricity market, such as ancillary service prices and their deployment signals. Simulations are performed on a hypothetical group of 10 000 EVs in the electric reliability council of Texas electricity markets. The results show the benefit of the proposed fuzzy algorithm compared with previously proposed deterministic algorithms that do not consider market uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new fault current limiting dynamic voltage restorer (FCL-DVR) concept. The new topology uses a crowbar bidirectional thyristor switch across the output terminals of a conventional back-to-back DVR. In the event of a load short, the DVR controller will deactivate the faulty phase of the DVR and activate its crowbar thyristor to insert the DVR filter reactor into the grid to limit the fault current. A fault condition is detected by sensing the load current and its rate of change. The FCL-DVR will operate with different protection strategies under different fault conditions. Design of the FCL-DVR involves selecting important parameters, such as DVR power rating, dc link voltage of the DVR, output filter reactors and capacitors, and grid-tied transformers is proposed. The design methodology of the proposed FCL-DVR is fully discussed based on power systems computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including dc (EMTDC) simulation. A scaled-down experimental verification is also carried out. Both modeling and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the new FCL-DVR concept for performing both voltage compensation and fault current limiting functions.

Abstract: The concept of electric spring (ES) has been proposed recently as an effective means of distributed voltage control. The idea is to regulate the voltage across the critical (C) loads while allowing the noncritical (NC) impedance-type loads (e.g., water heaters) to vary their power consumption and thus contribute to demand-side response. In this paper, a comparison is made between distributed voltage control using ES against the traditional single point control with STATic COMpensator (STATCOM). For a given range of supply voltage variation, the total reactive capacity required for each option to produce the desired voltage regulation at the point of connection is compared. A simple case study with a single ES and STATCOM is presented first to show that the ES and STATCOM require comparable reactive power to achieve similar voltage regulation. Comparison between a STATCOM and ES is further substantiated through similar case studies on the IEEE 13-bus test feeder system and also on a part of the distribution network in Sha Lo Wan Bay, Hong Kong. In both cases, it turns out that a group of ESs achieves better total voltage regulation than STATCOM with less overall reactive power capacity. Dependence of the ES capability on proportion of critical and NC load is also shown.

Abstract: The energy exchange between microgrids (MGs) that are capable of generating power from renewable energy sources in smart grids is investigated. As MGs are autonomous and have control over their energy exchange, prospect theory is a useful tool to provide a user-centric view on MG power trading. More specifically, in this paper, the energy exchange among MGs that are also connected to a power plant as a backup energy supply is formulated as a prospect theory-based static game and Nash equilibria are provided under various scenarios. The impact of user objective weight is evaluated during the outcome evaluation on the performance of the game. Simulation results show that user subjectivity tends to exaggerate selling and buying probabilities when battery levels are high (and low), and thus decreases the overall utility and increases the amount of the energy bought at either low battery levels or low MG selling prices. Conditions on the pricing system to ensure that the energy exchange system is not impacted by the subjective view of MGs are also provided.

Abstract: Technical innovation in power distribution networks is pointing toward a decentralized control vision to deal with the issues in design and operations related to distributed energy resources. Thus, decentralized approaches to power flow management (PFM) are of significant importance from the distributed network operator (DNO) perspective. In this paper, a new hybrid distributed control approach is proposed to deal with thermal overload issues. The control algorithm is based on constraint satisfaction problem that is applied to solve the network constraint problem. The novelty of this control approach consists in the joint control of both distributed generation and demand response units for PFM in an autonomous regional control environment. The implementation of this demand-side management, integrated active network management, and distributed control technique contributes to network reinforcement deferral, economy of supply, and efficient capital expenditure. Simulation has been implemented in a medium voltage interconnected test network with a substation controller and a network simulator. The control actions successfully achieve the desired objectives and are evaluated in comparison analysis. This new hybrid distributed control technique has potential to benefit the DNO planning and operation activities in the development of future decentralized smart grids.

Abstract: It is expected that the use of cognitive radio for smart grid communication will be indispensable in near future. Recently, IETF has standardized RPL (routing protocol for low power and lossy networks), which is expected to be the standard routing protocol for majority of applications including advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Our objective in this paper is to enhance RPL for cognitive radio enabled AMI networks. Our enhanced protocol provides novel modifications to RPL in order to address the routing challenges in cognitive radio environments along with protecting the primary users as well as meeting the utility requirements of secondary network. System level performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of proposed protocol as a viable solution for practical cognitive AMI networks.

Abstract: Energy storage devices (ESDs) have the potential to revolutionize the electricity grid by allowing the smoothing of variable-energy generator output and the time-shifting of demand away from peak times. A common approach to study the impact of ESDs on energy systems is by modeling them as electric circuits in simulations. Although recent circuit models are becoming more accurate, to obtain statistically valid results, extensive simulations need to be run. In some cases, existing datasets are not large enough to obtain statistically significant results. The impact of ESDs on energy systems has also been recently studied using analytical methods, but usually by assuming ideal ESD behavior, such as infinite ESD charging and discharging rates, and zero self-discharge. However, real-life ESDs are far from ideal. We investigate the effect of nonideal ESD behavior on system performance, presenting an analytical ESD model that retains much of the simplicity of an ideal ESD, yet captures many (though not all) nonideal behaviors for a class of ESDs that includes all battery technologies and compressed air energy storage systems. This allows us to compute performance bounds for systems with nonideal ESDs using standard teletraffic techniques. We provide performance results for five widely used ESD technologies and show that our models can closely approximate numerically computed performance bounds.

Abstract: With the cost of computation and information distribution continually decreasing, as well as accelerating deployment of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs), there is an opportunity to create an efficient electricity distribution and electrified transportation network by combining these technologies. This paper describes a technology whereby renewable energy can be seamlessly integrated into a local network keeping the network load constant, but using all the fluctuating energy locally when it is available. This technique is a type of demand side management (DSM) whereby consumption of deferrable electric loads is adjusted in order to provide maximum utility to the electricity network without impacting the end user. Many household loads are already suitable for DSM, and with an increased uptake of EVs, a sizable amount of demand could be controlled in this manner, which could in turn significantly improve the viability of fluctuating energy sources. In this paper a new DSM scheme, termed localized demand control (LDC), has been designed, and its operation and performance is compared with the classical DSM method of dynamic demand control. It is shown that the system dynamics of both controllers are similar, but LDC is intrinsically more stable over a wider range of applications.

Abstract: In this paper, a dynamic model of the wholesale energy market that captures the effect of uncertainties of renewable energy sources and real-time pricing with demand response is derived. Beginning with a framework that includes real-time pricing as an underlying state, an attempt is made in this model to capture the dynamic interactions between generation, demand, locational marginal price (LMP), and congestion price near the equilibrium of the optimal dispatch. Conditions under which stability of the market can be guaranteed are derived. Modeling the effect of renewable energy resources (RERs) and demand response as perturbations, robust stability of the energy market model in the presence of such perturbations is discussed. Numerical studies of an IEEE 30-bus are reported to illustrate the effect of transmission lines constraints on the wholesale market stability in the presence of wind power.

Abstract: For distribution networks with a high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems, overvoltage is a common and major issue that needs be addressed to not only assure reliable and secure system operation, but also to fully utilize PV generation capacity. A new real power capping method is proposed in this paper to prevent overvoltages by adaptively setting the power caps for PV inverters in real time. The proposed method can maintain voltage profiles below a preset upper limit while maximizing the PV generation and fairly distributing the real power curtailments among all the PV systems in the network. As a result, each of the PV systems in the network has equal opportunity to generate electricity and shares the responsibility of voltage regulation. The method does not require global information and can be implemented either under a centralized supervisory control scheme or in a distributed way via consensus control. Both steady state and dynamic simulation studies under various scenarios have been carried out on a 33-bus distribution system and the IEEE 13-bus test feeder to verify the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to provide a review of distributed control and management strategies for the next generation power system in the context of microgrids. This paper also identifies future research directions. The next generation power system, also referred to as the smart grid, is distinct from the existing power system due to its extensive use of integrated communication, advanced components such as power electronics, sensing, and measurement, and advanced control technologies. At the same time, the need for increased number of small distributed and renewable energy resources can exceed the capabilities of an available computational resource. Therefore, the recent literature has seen a significant research effort on dividing the control task among different units, which gives rise to the development of several distributed techniques. This paper discusses features and characteristics of these techniques, and identifies challenges and opportunities ahead. The paper also discusses the relationship between distributed control and hierarchical control.

Abstract: Smart grid and smart meter initiatives seek to enable energy providers and consumers to intelligently manage their energy needs through real-time monitoring, analysis, and control. An essential element of intelligent management and control is access to information. The nonintrusive load monitor (NILM) identifies the operation of electrical loads from an aggregate service, making installation inexpensive, and speeding data collation and analytics. Smart meters are likely, in the near future, to be tasked with finding energy waste without requiring unreasonable demands for communication bandwidth. This paper presents NilmManager and NilmDB; tools for finding electromechanical energy wasters with a minimum of network bandwidth.

Abstract: In this paper, a new islanding detection method for single phase inverter-based distributed generation is presented. In the first stage of the proposed method, a parametric technique called autoregressive signal modeling is utilized to extract signal features from voltage and current signals at the point of common coupling with the grid. In the second stage, advanced machine learning technique based on support vector machine, which takes calculated features as inputs is utilized to predict islanding state. The extensive study is performed on the IEEE 13 bus system and feature vectors corresponding to various islanding and nonislanding conditions are used for support vector machine classifier training and testing. Simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately detect system islanding operation mode 50 ms after the event starts. Further, the robustness of the proposed method is analyzed by examining its performances in the systems with multiple distributed generations, and when system loading condition, grid disturbance types, and characteristics are altered.

Abstract: With the development of smart grid technologies, some of the electric demands which are traditionally considered fixed and inflexible will become promising distributed energy resources in future power systems. However, the participation of small scale or household energy sources into balancing power might challenge the operation of electric distribution systems and cause congestions. This paper presents a distribution congestion price (DCP) based market mechanism to alleviate possible distribution system congestions. By employing the locational marginal pricing model, the proposed DCPs are able to reflect the real congestion cost and further direct the schedule of the responses of electric demands. Based on the NordPool Spot market structure, the interactions between aggregators and the distribution system operator are discussed, and the procedure for calculating DCPs is proposed. Finally, a practical Danish 60kV/10.5kV distribution system is employed as the test case to verify the proposed method for mitigating congestion.

Abstract: In this paper, a market based multiagent control mechanism that incorporates distribution transformer and voltage constraints for the charging of a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) is presented. The algorithm solves a utility maximization problem in a distributed way, assigning most charging power to the EVs with the highest need for energy. The algorithm does not rely on an iterative exchange of messages, but finds the optimal solution after the exchange of just one single message. A substation agent is responsible for guaranteeing a safe network operation. It uses the remaining capacity of each of the EV chargers for reactive voltage control. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on an existing three-phase four-wire distribution grid. Simulation results show that the fleet of EVs can be charged at a minimal increase of costs, without jeopardizing the network.

Abstract: Heating/cooling systems have played an important role in building energy and comfort management. There have been intensive discussions about the integration of heating/cooling systems into the smart grid infrastructure over the past decade, yet controlling the operation of heating/cooling systems in a smart grid with high penetration of renewable resources has not been addressed clearly. This study has investigated the suitability of a novel active controller applied to heating/cooling systems in the context of smart grid with high penetration of renewable energies. The proposed controller operates by responding to a combination of internal set points and external signals (e.g. the availability of renewable energy resources and welfare of customers) from a single local controller. The heating/cooling systems management minimizes the overall cost of the simulated smart microgrid, the size of smart microgrid units, and the imported energy from the distribution grid through an optimization process. It also at the same time maximizes the reliability of the smart microgrid. Demonstrated results confirm the capability of the proposed heating/cooling system controller on the planning of a smart microgrid.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimal charging problem for future plug-in electric taxi (PET) with time-varying profits, i.e., time-varying service incomes and charging costs. Aiming at maximizing the average profit of a PET in long term under the constraint of state of charge (SoC) dynamics of PET battery, this problem is formulated as a constrained binary programming problem in infinite time horizon. The main contribution of this paper consists of three parts. First, because the original infinite binary programming problem cannot be directly solved, it is divided into a series of periodic subproblems. Each of the subproblems is in finite time horizon and much easier to solve, which is also proven rigorously to be equivalent to the original one. Second, an efficient and optimal algorithm is proposed to solve the finite time constrained binary programming subproblem, which also yields the optimal initial SoC of PET. Third, a transient control strategy is proposed to transfer the any initial SoC to the optimal one, if they are not identical. The performance of the proposed method is verified by numerical results.

Abstract: Fast charging stations (FCS) are able to recharge plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (pHEVs) in less than half an hour, thus representing an appealing concept to vehicle owners since the off-road time is similar as for refuelling at conventional public gas stations. However, since these FCS plugs have power ratings of up to 100 kW, they may expose the utility mains to intolerable stresses in the near future scenario where there will be a large number of public FCS spread across the network. This paper proposes an internal power balancing strategy for FCS based on flywheel energy storage system (ESS) which is able to mitigate those impacts by ramping the initial power peak. The balancing strategy was implemented in a distributed manner to grid and flywheel interfacing converters by means of distributed bus signaling (DBS) method. Since the parameters in the proposed upper hierarchical control layer affect the stability features of the system, a reduced order small-signal model has been assembled and parameters have been selected accordingly. Finally, real-time simulation results performed on a full scale model have been reported in order to verify the validity of proposed approach.

Abstract: The large-scale integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to the power grid spurs the need for efficient charging coordination mechanisms. It can be shown that the optimal charging schedule smooths out the energy consumption over time so as to minimize the total energy cost. In practice, however, it is hard to smooth out the energy consumption perfectly, because the future PEV charging demand is unknown at the moment when the charging rate of an existing PEV needs to be determined. In this paper, we propose an online coordinated charging decision ( ORCHARD) algorithm, which minimizes the energy cost without knowing the future information. Through rigorous proof, we show that ORCHARD is strictly feasible in the sense that it guarantees to fulfill all charging demands before due time. Meanwhile, it achieves the best known competitive ratio of 2.39. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a novel reduced-complexity algorithm to replace the standard convex optimization techniques used in ORCHARD. Through extensive simulations, we show that the average performance gap between ORCHARD and the offline optimal solution, which utilizes the complete future information, is as small as 6.5%. By setting a proper speeding factor, the average performance gap can be further reduced to 5%.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) with large battery charging demands may cause detrimental impact on distribution grid stability without EV charging coordination. This paper proposes an on-line adaptive EV charing scheduling (OACS) framework to optimize EV charging schedules and reduce flow limit, voltage magnitude limit, 3-phase voltage imbalance limit, and transformer capacity violations. EV user convenience is considered and EV charging cost is optimized. DC power flow based optimizations is proposed for EV charging scheduling approximation and parallel ac power flow verification is used to verify the scheduling results. Incremental feasibility improvement procedure is further proposed to correct the scheduling discrepancy between dc linear model and the ac model. Experiments are performed on a modified IEEE 34 14.7 kV distribution system with different EV penetration levels to demonstrate performance comparisons between different scheduling schemes. The result shows that our proposed OACS framework optimizes the EV charging coordination problem efficiently.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid voltage/var control (VVC) architecture for distribution systems with a high PV penetration. The architecture consists of two control loops: coordinated normal control loop and uncoordinated transient cloud movement control loop. In the first loop, hourly dispatches are scheduled for on-load tap changer (OLTC), capacitor banks (CBs), and static var compensators (SVCs) based on forecasted load and PV power output so as to minimize power losses and voltage deviations. The second loop is triggered when large variations of PV power output caused by rapid cloud movement happen. All SVCs and CBs become self-controlled based on local voltage measurements with the single control objective to minimize voltage deviations. SVCs will operate firstly to flatten the voltage profile. If SVCs fail, CBs will switch to provide reactive power support. A time-adaptive delay is applied to each CB to avoid overcompensation. Case studies show the proposed method can optimize the system operation and is effective in voltage regulation with PV generators.

Abstract: It is well known that information will play an important role in enhancing emerging smart grid system operation. Therefore, questions naturally arise as to when the increased data-dependence may be considered excessive. Two practical considerations emerge: 1) communications and computational overhead, in which redundant and irrelevant information acquisition and use results in heavy computational burden with limited performance return; and 2) increasing risks of power system disruption due to information delay from communication congestion or cyber attack. One strategy to improve smart grid resilience is to determine the appropriate degree of dependence on cyber information to balance performance with overhead and risk. In this paper, we present a hierarchical cyber-physical multiagent model of smart grid system operation based on flocking theory in the context of the transient stability problem. Through this model, we study strategies that harness a selective degree of cyber technology by leveraging physical couplings. Our formulation enables the identification of large-scale distributed control strategies for robust and resilient power grid operation. We demonstrate the potential performance improvements of our findings on the New England 39-bus power system for case studies involving a variety of system faults and communication delays.

Abstract: In this paper, the results of the energy efficiency and power loss measurements of a 16 kVA customer-end inverter (CEI) unit are analyzed. The CEI is part of the low-voltage dc (LVDC) distribution network. The efficiency of the CEI power conversion significantly affects the energy efficiency of the LVDC distribution network and the electricity supply chain. The efficiency of the CEI and its components is measured by applying calorimetric and electrical input-output methods. The power loss measurement results are analyzed, and the power loss mechanisms are described. The efficiency optimization goals are discussed and set.

Abstract: Smart grid technology has enhanced the ability to monitor numerous aspects of the distribution system for improving system performance and reducing system losses. One benefit is the continuous assessment of insulation degradation within distribution transformers, which is commonly referred to as a loss of life assessment. Calculating the expended life of a transformer consists of determining its winding hotspot temperature, which fluctuates with customer demand, ambient temperature, and cooling characteristics. Most residential transformers in service today do not possess the ability to connect to a smart grid communication system for continuous monitoring; therefore, they rely upon fusing for protection against extreme loading conditions. Smart meters can provide utility companies with the information required to identify distribution transformers that are experiencing higher than rated losses that can ultimately reduce their expected life. The research presented in this paper defines the smart meter functions required to accurately assess the aging of distribution transformers according to IEEE Std C57.91 and C57.110. To establish general accuracy guidelines, transformer loading indices were developed to evaluate acute excessive loading, long-term excessive loading, and excessive loading due to harmonics. Metering functions evaluated included power factor, harmonic demand, and ambient temperature.

Abstract: This paper proposes the integration of multiple antenna technologies with compressed sensing algorithms to facilitate wireless multiple-access from smart meters to a central base station in smart grid home area networks. This integration is made possible by new precoding weight designs which utilize the multiple antennas for either achieving multiplexing or providing power-gain. For the multiplexing scheme, we show that the use of multiple antennas can significantly reduce the delay, particularly at high signal-to-noise ratios. For the power-gain scheme, we demonstrate that the use of multiple antennas enhances the performance of the compressed sensing algorithm by reducing the impact of unwanted noise, leading to a lower delay. Finally, we compare our distributed scheme with a carrier sense multiple-access scheme, and show that our scheme achieves a lower average delay for even a small number of transmitting nodes.

Abstract: With ever increasing penetration of renewable distributed generation (DG) in distribution systems, power restoration of remote distribution feeders under emergency conditions tends to be carried out with the support of renewable DG units. The available power from the renewable DG units ensures restoration of more number of affected customers, thus, improving overall system reliability. In this paper, a probabilistic based analytical method is developed to assess system reliability in terms of system average interruption duration index and system average interruption frequency index for distribution feeders containing dispatchable and nondispatchable renewable DG units. The proposed method has been developed by implementing DG side restoration with comprehensive technical considerations, including possible failures of DG units, time-dependent patterns of load demand and DG power output, and single-stage and two-stage restoration. The proposed analytical method is validated by comparing with the Monte Carlo simulation and results are presented.

Abstract: Wide-area power system stabilizer (WPSS) is one of the most potentially effective approaches to damp interarea low frequency oscillations in power systems. When WPSS is implemented in a real project, emphasis should be put on feedback signal delay problem. In order to intensively study the delay of phasor measurement unit data, field tests have been carried out in Guizhou power grid (GZPG), and results show that, in the long-term, the delay might change remarkably under some circumstances, such as when route switches or communication load increases. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive time delay compensation method to deal with such kind of delay. Bounded random delay is divided into several intervals and compensators are designed for each delay interval. Then appropriate compensators will be selected according to the delay measured online, based on the switching rules that is also demonstrated in this paper. The delay used here is the average delay before the compensator switching. The proposed compensator is demonstrated in a two area power system. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed adaptive compensator. A comparison with conventional methods is also presented. Finally, the proposed method is validated on GZPG based on real-time digital simulations.

Abstract: To enhance environmental sustainability, many countries will electrify their transportation systems in their future smart city plans, so the number of electric vehicles (EVs) running in a city will grow significantly. There are many ways to recharge EVs' batteries and charging stations will be considered as the main source of energy. The locations of charging stations are critical; they should not only be pervasive enough such that an EV anywhere can easily access a charging station within its driving range, but also widely spread so that EVs can cruise around the whole city upon being recharged. Based on these new perspectives, we formulate the EV charging station placement problem (EVCSPP) in this paper. We prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard. We also propose four solution methods to tackle EVCSPP, and evaluate their performance on various artificial and practical cases. As verified by the simulation results, the methods have their own characteristics and they are suitable for different situations depending on the requirements for solution quality, algorithmic efficiency, problem size, nature of the algorithm, and existence of system prerequisite.

Abstract: Real-time availability of electricity prices via a smart power grid has a potential bilateral benefit to electricity users and suppliers. The users can reduce their costs by consuming energy during low-price hours and balancing their energy usage during other hours. This in turn benefits energy utility companies by reducing their peak power demand. This article describes an optimal shrinking horizon model for electricity-consuming units based on user preferences. The proposed model optimizes the end user's electricity cost while meeting preferred comfort levels. The user can set preferences in the model using a tristate flexibility parameter for each electric-power-consuming unit. The electricity price model used in the optimization model is general and covers all pricing schemes in the electricity market today. The model derived can be described by a simple mixed integer linear program and solved by most optimization software in a short time. The most distinguishing characteristics of our proposed model are its simplicity, generality, comprehensibility, and ease of implementation. Simulation results are used to verify the model's performance in reducing consumer electricity costs and satisfying comfort preferences.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the incremental welfare consensus algorithm for solving the energy management problem in a smart grid environment populated with distributed generators and responsive demands. The proposed algorithm is distributed and cooperative such that it eliminates the need for a central energy-management unit, central price coordinator, or leader. The optimum energy solution is found through local peerto-peer communications among smart devices. Each distributed generation unit is connected to a local price regulator, as is each consumer unit. In response to the price of energy proposed by the local price regulators, the power regulator on each generation/consumer unit determines the level of generation/consumption power needed to optimize the benefit of the device. The consensus-based coordination among price regulators drives the behavior of the overall system toward the global optimum, despite the greedy behavior of each unit. The primary advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) convergence to the global optimum without requiring a central controller/coordinator or leader, despite the greedy behavior at the individual level and limited communications; and 2) scalability in terms of per-node computation and communications burden.

Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is the construction of the efficient privacy-preserving protocol for smart metering systems (EPPP4SMS), which brings together features of the best privacy-preserving protocols in the literature for smart grids. In addition, EPPP4SMS is faster on the meter side-and in the whole round (encryption, aggregation, and decryption)-than other protocols based on homomorphic encryption and it is still scalable. Moreover, EPPP4SMS enables energy suppliers and customers to verify the billing information and measurements without leaking private information. Since the energy supplier knows the amount of generated electricity and its flow throughout electrical substations, the energy supplier can use this verification to detect energy loss and fraud. Different from verification based on digital signature, our verification enables new features; for example, smart meters and their energy supplier can compute the verification without storing the respective encrypted measurements. Furthermore, EPPP4SMS may be suitable to many other scenarios that need aggregation of time-series data keeping privacy protected, including electronic voting, reputation systems, and sensor networks. In this paper, we present theoretical results of EPPP4SMS and their validation by implementation of algorithms and simulation using real-world measurement data.

Abstract: This paper studies how a system operator can estimate the amount of demand which will be curtailed in each hour and that which will be shifted between any two hours based on the short-term price elasticities of the demand (PED) in each hour (i.e., own price elasticity and the associated cross price elasticities), besides finding near optimal unit commitment schedule for generators. Ideally, the system operator would want to curtail and/or shift out as much demand as possible from the hours where the generation is expensive. However, such an action may not be desirable for the demand side. In reality, the demand side suffers a penalty (e. g., cost of rescheduling a scheduled job in a factory) when the demand is curtailed and/or shifted. According to our formulation, the system operator constructs a social optimal solution based on the PED and the penalty information related to the demand side. In other words, the total utility of the demand side is maximized, while the sum of the total power generation costs and the total penalty incurred by the demand side are jointly minimized. The effect of the cross price elasticities and the penalty on the system performance will be shown through various simulations.

Abstract: Load shaping is one of important and challenging issues in power grid. In this paper, we propose a novel load shaping strategy based on energy storage and dynamic pricing in smart grid. In the proposed strategy, a consumer is encouraged to draw a certain amount of energy (i.e., quota) from the grid. When the actual energy demand is deviated from the quota, the consumer is faced with a higher electricity price. With the help of energy storage, the consumer can draw less electricity from the grid at a lower price by discharging energy when the demand is higher than the quota and draw more electricity from the grid at a lower price by charging energy when the demand is lower than the quota. As a result, the utility can implement load shaping and consumers can save energy cost simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed strategy can be implemented with low complexity and in a distributed fashion, which offers scalability to large number of consumers. Simulations results show the effectiveness of the proposed load shaping strategy.

Abstract: To provide a guideline for grid operators to manage medium voltage distribution grids, this paper presents a probabilistic approach for measurement placement optimization and a state-estimator-based operation framework. The Monte Carlo method is used to optimize the measurement placement with minimum measured points, which support the observability of state estimator and satisfy the requirements for operation activities. The proposed framework covers several important factors from practical situations, including cost allocation of measurement systems, unavailability of measurement data, and small voltage deviation across medium voltage (MV) grids. Finally, a case study on a typical European distribution grid demonstrates the feasibility of the framework.

Abstract: The smart grid vision has resulted in many demand side innovations such as nonintrusive load monitoring techniques, residential micro-grids, and demand response programs. Many of these techniques need a detailed residential network model for their research, evaluation, and validation. In response to such a need, this paper presents a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) simulation platform for modeling and simulating low voltage residential networks. This platform targets the simulation of the quasi-steady-state network condition over an extended period such as 24 h. It consists of two main components. The first is a multiphase network model with power flow, harmonic, and motor starting study capabilities. The second is a load/generation behavior model that establishes the operating characteristics of various loads and generators based on time-of-use probability curves. These two components are combined together through an SMC simulation scheme. Four case studies are presented to demonstrate the applications of the proposed platform.

Abstract: Frequency control is essential to maintain the stability and reliability of power grids. For decades, generation side controllers, e. g., governors and automatic generation controllers, have been used to stabilize the frequency of power systems, which incur high operational costs. In smart grids, utilizing demand response is an appealing alternative to control the system frequency at the demand side, which can reduce the dependency of grids on expensive generation side controllers. Despite of economic advantages, the frequency oscillation problem, which occurs when smart appliances simultaneously respond to the system frequency by varying their power consumptions, is the main barrier to realize demand response enabled frequency control in practice. In this paper, we investigate a new distributed control algorithm by randomizing smart appliances' responses to solve this problem. We provide a comprehensive analysis to characterize various impacts of the randomized demand response on the system frequency in terms of its mean and variance over time. Furthermore, based on the frequency dynamics analysis, we determine the average frequency recovery time, the average number of responded smart appliances, and the probability of frequency overshoot, which provide important guidelines for designing our control algorithm. Finally, we validate our analysis via simulations under practical setups.

Abstract: A fault detection, identification, and location approach is proposed and studied in this paper. This approach is based on matching pursuit decomposition (MPD) using Gaussian atom dictionary, hidden Markov model (HMM) of real-time frequency and voltage variation features, and fault contour maps generated by machine learning algorithms in smart grid (SG) systems. Specifically, the time-frequency features are extracted by MPD from the frequency and voltage signals, which are sampled by the frequency disturbance recorders in SG. A hybrid clustering algorithm is then developed and used to cluster the frequency and voltage signal features into various symbols. Using the symbols, two detection HMMs are trained for fault detection to distinguish between normal and abnormal SG operation conditions. Also, several identification HMMs are trained under different system fault scenarios, and if a fault occurs, the trained identification HMMs are used to identify different fault types. In the meantime, if the fault is detected by the detection HMMs, a fault contour map will be generated using the feature extracted by the MPD from the voltage signals and topology information of SG. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed approach for the diagnosis of various types of faults with different measurement signal-to-noise ratios in SG systems.

Abstract: System modeling and stability analysis is one of the most important issues of inverter-dominated microgrids. It is useful to determine the system stability and optimize the control parameters. The complete small signal models for the inverter-dominated microgrids have been developed, which are very accurate and could be found in literature. However, the modeling procedure will become very complex when the number of inverters in microgrid is large. One possible solution is to use the reduced-order small signal models for the inverter-dominated microgrids. Unfortunately, the reduced-order small signal models fail to predict the system instabilities. In order to solve the problem, a new modeling approach for inverter-dominated microgrids by using dynamic phasors is presented in this paper. Our findings indicate that the proposed dynamic phasor model is able to predict accurately the stability margins of the system, while the conventional reduced-order small signal model fails. In addition, the virtual omega-E frame power control method, which deals with the power coupling caused by the line impedance X/R characteristic, has also been chosen as an application example of the proposed modeling technique.

Abstract: In this paper the need for a better design of the galvanic isolation and the output filter inductor in the customer-end inverter (CEI) of the low voltage DC (LVDC) network is discussed. The galvanic isolation can be implemented either with a 50 Hz transformer after the CEI or with an isolated DC-DC converter between the DC network and the CEI. However, the 50 Hz transformer solution adds a significant amount of volume and mass to the system. Based on calorimetric measurements conducted with the current system in which the galvanic isolation is implemented with the former method, the minimum requirements for the isolated DC-DC converter are presented and a comparison is carried out. For the system to be cost efficient the DC-DC converter should result in reduced lifetime cost compared with the transformer solution. In the output filter part a design method for an amorphous core filter inductor based on minimization of the lifetime cost is presented.

Abstract: In the future smart grids, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are seen as an important means of transportation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One of the main issues regarding to this sort of vehicles is managing their charging time to prevent high peak loads over time. Deploying advanced metering and automatic chargers can be a practical way not only for the vehicle owners to manage their energy consumption, but also for the utilities to manage the electricity load during the day by shifting the charging loads to the off-peak periods. Additionally, an efficient charging schedule can reduce the users' electricity bill cost. In this paper we propose a new practical demand response (DR) program for PHEVs charging scheduling based on game theoretic approach, aiming at optimizing customers charging cost. In the proposed method, a stochastic model is given for starting time of charging, which makes the method a practical tool for simulating the vehicle owners charging behavior effectively.

Abstract: A fuzzy P+I and a classical proportional-integral (PI) controllers for charging and discharging of a battery pack connected to a photovoltaic (PV) array are described. To maintain the PV array operating as close as possible to the maximum power point (MPP) a perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm along with a classical PI controller to regulate the terminal voltage of the PV array are also investigated. The power electronics interfaces used to keep the PV array operating close to the MPP and to manage the charging and discharging of the batteries are the step-up and bidirectional buck-boost converters. On the other hand, the interface to the grid consists of a voltage source inverter (VSI), which controls the power injected into the grid and regulates the DC-link voltage. The DC-link voltage is also controlled by a fuzzy P+I or classical PI controllers, which are used to promote the power balance between the DC-link and grid and to determine the amount of current and, consequently, power absorbed by or injected into the grid. Simulated and experimental results under different conditions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based voltage/var optimization (VVO) technique considering the integration of distributed generators and load-to-voltage sensitivities. The paper schedules optimal tap positions of on-load tap changer and switch statuses of capacitor banks based on predictive outputs of wind turbines and photovoltaic generators. Compared with previous efforts on VVO which used constant-power load model, the exponential load model is used to capture the various load behaviors in this paper. Different customer types such as industrial, residential, and commercial loads are also considered. The uncertainties of model prediction errors are taken into account in the proposed model. A scenario reduction technique is applied to enhance a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden. The MPC-based VVO problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with reduced scenarios. Case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The additional deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) has attracted further attention to dc microgrid applications. The objective of the study is to discuss the possibilities and the merits of adopting a dc control system for enhancing the economics and the resilient operation of a dc microgrid, and to test the proposed hierarchical control strategy that applies to a dc microgrid. This paper provides case studies in which an existing microgrid at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is operated as a dc microgrid and the results for each case are compared with the ac model. The structure, components, and control strategies of IIT dc microgrids are discussed and the economic operation of a grid-connected dc microgrid through tertiary control, as well as islanding, load restoration, and resynchronization of the dc microgrid are simulated. The dc microgrid simulation results are compared with those of an ac microgrid, which demonstrate that the proposed coordinated dc strategy for the optimal operation of DERs is an effective way of ensuring the resilient response of dc microgrid to emergencies and its economic operation at steady state.

Abstract: Under high penetration of renewable energy resources, more and more reactive power control devices are integrated into power grids. The large-scale deployment of these devices requires upgrading existing reactive power control solutions. To improve energy efficiency and voltage profiles of the power grids under different operating conditions, this paper proposes a fully distributed multiple agent system based optimal reactive control solution. To update its control setting, a reactive controller only needs information measured locally or obtained from its neighboring buses. The updating rules of the subgradient based algorithm are derived under mild assumptions. The solution is able to provide comparable steady state performance as that of centralized optimization solutions. Due to the simplicity of communication topology and the reduced amount of data to process, the solution can provide timely response to changes of operating conditions. Simulation studies with power systems of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed control solution.

Abstract: This paper presents the design guidelines of a series hybrid fuel cell system, including control and protection loops. This hybrid system consists of a fuel cell (FC), an auxiliary storage device (ASD), and current-controlled DC-DC converters responsible for managing the energy transfer between the FC, the ASD, and the load. The main advantages of the selected converter are its voltage step-up and step-down properties, high efficiency, and low input and output current ripples, which enable it to be positioned in all system locations, provided the corresponding controllers are suitably designed. Also, using the same module for all system converters simplifies the design and construction tasks. The theoretical analyses have been verified by simulations and validated experimentally on a 48 V 1500 W purpose-built DC bus.

Abstract: The classical distribution system can evolve in a new concept of grid, where the distributed generation has a big impact. These changes take into account the use of power electronic devices. With these devices it is necessary to study the stability of the system in a new form due to their multi-current domain and the influence of the controllers applied to each device. The paper presents a methodology that takes into account the structure of a DC microgrid system and evaluates its stability. The stability analysis uses the computational continuation to obtain the conclusions. The real time simulation results present the grid behavior and validate the limits of operation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel controller design for controlling appliances based on local measurements of voltage. The controller finds the normalized voltage deviation accounting for the sensitivity of voltage measurements to appliance state. The controller produces a signal indicating desired power consumption which can be mapped to temperature setpoint offsets of thermostat controlled loads. In networks where a lower voltage level corresponds to high system load (and vice versa), this controller acts to regulate voltage and increase the load factor. Simulations are conducted on low- and medium-voltage distribution systems with residential loads including voltage-sensitive water heaters. In low-voltage systems, the results of the simulations show the controller to be effective at reducing the extremes of voltage and increasing the load factor while respecting end-use temperature constraints. In medium-voltage systems, the simulation results show the controller to be effective at reducing voltage fluctuations that occur at the 10-minute time scale.

Abstract: The distributed generator (DG) has a huge economical and environmental potential, especially if it is based on renewable energy sources (RESs). It is very important for the future development of smart grids. However, high penetration of DGs into distribution systems can cause voltage deviations beyond the statutory range, and reverse power flow toward the substation transformer. Consequently, it can increase the distribution system losses if it is not well supervised. Thus, in order to meet smart grid objectives, DGs have to be controlled in coordination with other power resources existing in the distribution system. Controllable loads (CLs) can also help in promoting smart grids through demand response (DR) application. Therefore, this paper proposes a decision technique of an optimal reference schedule for DGs, battery energy storage system (BESS), CLs, and tap changing transformers. The main objective of the proposed optimization problem is to achieve loss reduction in the distribution system. However, other aims such as voltage control and power flow smoothing have been achieved. The optimization is performed based on predicted values of load demand and DG generation. Simulations are conducted for one operation day to illustrate the optimality of the proposed scheduling method and to assess the impact of CLs in smart grids.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) control can effectively relieve balancing and frequency regulation burdens on conventional generators, facilitate integrating more renewable energy, and reduce generation and transmission investments needed to meet peak demands. Electric water heaters (EWHs) have a great potential in implementing DR control strategies because: a) the EWH power consumption has a high correlation with daily load patterns; b) they constitute a significant percentage of domestic electrical load; c) the heating element is a resistor, without reactive power consumption; and d) they can be used as energy storage devices when needed. Accurately modeling the dynamic behavior of EWHs is essential for successfully designing DR controls. In this paper, a new partial differential equation (PDE) physics-based model is developed to capture the detailed temperature profiles at different tank locations, which is validated against field test data for more than 10 days. The developed PDE model is compared with the one-mass and two-mass models, and shows better performance in capturing water thermal dynamics for benchmark testing purposes.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fault current management (FCM) technique for radial distribution systems with embedded inverter-based distributed generators (IB-DGs). At the point of connection to a power system, many distributed generators (DGs) require power electronic (PE) interfaces, which are normally idle during faults. The proposed FCM method employs these PE interfaces for control of the fault current. For this purpose, operation of IB-DGs is modified to FCM mode at the moment of fault and new current references are applied. Of the two controllable parameters of the IB-DG output current-current magnitude and current phase angle-the current phase angle is chosen as the means of controlling the fault current magnitude. The reference current phase angle is calculated based on the relation between the fault current elements and their phase angles. As a result of this novel operation, IB-DGs with larger capacity can be connected at different locations of the system without affecting the fault current magnitude. Also, implementing this technique in smart grids is economically proven, since the asset of power system which have been designed for normal operation are employed to manage the fault current magnitude. Moreover, possibilities of synchronization problems are reduced by keeping IB-DGs connected to the system at all the time. The evaluation of the proposed FCM technique using the standard IEEE 33-bus distribution system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for managing the fault current magnitude.

Abstract: In this paper, the problem of optimal voltage and power regulation is formulated for distributed generators (DGs) in DC microgrids. It is shown that the resulting control is optimal but would require the full information of the microgrid. Relaxation of information requirement reduces the optimal control into several controls including the conventional droop control. The general setting of a DC microgrid equipped with local sensing/communication network calls for the design and implementation of a cooperative droop control that uses the available local information and coordinates voltage control in a distributed manner. The proposed cooperative droop control is shown to include other controls as special cases, its performance is superior to the conventional droop control, and it is robust with respect to uncertain changes in both distribution network and sensing/communication network. These features make the proposed control an effective scheme for operating a DC microgrid with intermittent and distributed generation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Microgrid (MG) planning methodology to decide optimal locations, sizes and mix of dispatchable and intermittent distributed generators (DGs). The long-term costs in the proposed planning model include investment, operation and maintenance (O&M), fuel and emission costs of DGs while the revenue includes payment by MG loads and utility grid. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) considering the probabilistic nature of DG outputs and load consumption, wherein the costs are minimized and profits are maximized. The model is transformed to be a two-stage robust optimization problem. A column and constraint generation (CCG) framework is used to solve the problem. Compared with conventional MG planning approaches, the proposed model is more practical in that it fully considers the system uncertainties and only requires a deterministic uncertainty set, rather than a probability distribution of uncertain data which is difficult to obtain. Case studies of a MG with wind turbines, photovoltaic generators (PVs) and microturbines (MTs) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: This paper proposes a possible approach to providing differentiated reliability options to customers in urban and suburban distribution networks. To offer different reliability options based on customer's preferences, a utility can deploy distributed generation (DG), sectionalizing switches (Normally Closed Switches: NCSs) and tie switches (Normally Open Switches: NOSs). During power outages, DG, as backup generation unit, is a means of providing higher reliability to customers who require it. Furthermore, a utility may need to reconfigure the networks such that NCSs and NOSs operate in an optimal way to deliver power to priority customers. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing utility liability while assuring the supply of power to priority customers. The optimization is performed off-line and the optimal switch combinations are stored in a database for use by the utility in real time. The information about customer preferences for uninterrupted service is needed to provide investment signals for NCSs, NOSs, and DG to utilities. The paper also demonstrates that utilities would invest in providing differentiated reliability options as long as the cost of these investments is lower than the liability cost utilities must pay for failing to deliver service.

Abstract: Low voltage dc microgrids have been widely used for supplying critical loads, such as data centers and remote communication stations. Consequently, it is important to ensure redundancy and enough energy capacity in order to support possible increments in load consumption. This is achieved by means of expansion of the energy storage system by adding extra distributed energy storage units. However, using distributed energy storage units adds more challenges in microgrids control, since stored energy should be balanced in order to avoid deep discharge or over-charge in one of the energy storage units. Typically, voltage droop loops are used for interconnecting several different units in parallel to a microgrid. This paper proposes a new decentralized strategy based on fuzzy logic that ensures stored energy balance for a low voltage dc microgrid with distributed battery energy storage systems by modifying the virtual resistances of the droop controllers in accordance with the state of charge of each energy storage unit. Additionally, the virtual resistance is adjusted in order to reduce the voltage deviation at the common dc bus. The units are self-controlled by using local variables only, hence, the microgrid can operate without relying on communication systems. Hardware in the loop results show the feasibility of the proposed method.

Abstract: An energy distribution network is a critical infrastructure that any compromise has an enormous impact on daily lives and the economy. The objective of this work is a computerized tool for distributed monitoring, dynamic re-configuration and control of DC distribution topology. This paper describes the double bar bus DC system exploiting the event-driven, service-oriented architecture, and real-time metering with nonuniform time sampling as an example of neighborhood optimization. We build a system with the capability to assess the resilience of and to rebuild better resilient grid partitions at run-time. The result is an intelligent system distributing loads between two buses dynamically in a way to keep self-sustainable and/or non-interruptible portion running at one bus by moving few other loads to the second bus. In standalone modality, the tool assesses the survivability of microgrid with high penetration of renewable energy. Running in cooperation with grid management tools, the same software can reconfigure optimally the local topology at run-time.

Abstract: Large scale data centers and Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are valuable assets that can be used to balance power grid frequency by adjusting their power consumption. This paper considers the joint power management of a data center and the PEVs of its employees for frequency regulation. The problem involves designing a real-time power control strategy for the integrated assets to collectively track the assigned frequency regulation signal, as well as developing a market planning strategy that determines the best baseload and capacity (regulation up/down) values over a multi-hour operating period to minimize energy cost and maximize regulation service revenue. A two-layer hierarchical power management framework is proposed, which enables a systematic design of both the tracking control and market planning problems. The proposed framework is evaluated based on real workload, regulation signal, and market data. The simulation results indicate that the regulation signal can be accurately tracked, and our scheme outperforms other designs that manage different regulation assets separately.

Abstract: The paper presents methods for mitigating subsynchronous interaction (SSI) between doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms and series capacitor compensated transmission systems. SSI damping is achieved by introducing a supplemental control signal in the reactive power control loop of the grid side converter of DFIG and full-scale frequency converter wind turbines, as well as in the reactive power control loop of the HVDC onshore multimodule converter (MMC) of offshore wind farms. This paper also investigates the impact of the phase imbalance series capacitive compensation concept that was introduced in the 1990s as a subsynchronous resonance countermeasure on SSI damping. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated on a test benchmark through time domain simulation studies using the ElectroMagnetic Transient Program (EMTP-RV).

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a job scheduling problem with random local generation, in which some jobs must be scheduled ahead of time while the others can be scheduled in a real-time fashion. To capture the randomness of the locally distributed generation, we develop a two-stage robust optimization model by considering an uncertainty set without probability information. Given that the problem is challenging, a nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is implemented to find an optimal solution. Some computational study, along with management insights, is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed model in dealing with the worst case situations.

Abstract: This paper describes the controller design procedure for a line-regulating converter in a converter-dominated dc microgrid system. The purpose of the controller is to mitigate the effects of the constant power loads on the stability and performance of the dc microgrid system. In this work, first, the overall structure, operation, and building blocks of the dc microgrid under analysis are introduced. Next, the dynamic model of the dc microgrid and the required transfer functions for the controller design are derived. Then, two proposed controller design methods are introduced and implemented on an virtual line-regulating converter in a dc microgrid system. Finally, the controller design methods are verified experimentally using the results from a built prototype dc microgrid system.

Abstract: The recent deployment of distributed generation has led to a revolution in the use of distribution systems and the emergence of smart-grid concepts. Smart grids are intended primarily as a means of facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources and of achieving greater system reliability and efficiency. Energy storage systems offer a number of benefits that can help utilities move toward those goals. One of those benefits is the capacity to improve system reliability through successful islanding operation. This paper proposes a methodology for the cost-effective improvement of system reliability through the allocation of distributed storage units in distribution systems. The costs of energy storage installation are optimized with respect to reliability value expressed as customers' willingness to pay in order to avoid power interruptions. The primary goal of this research was thus to determine the optimal combination of storage units to be installed and the loads to be shed so that all possible contingencies can be effectively addressed. A probabilistic approach is therefore adopted that includes consideration of the stochastic nature of system components.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal operational scheduling framework to be taken in use in the distribution management system (DMS) as the heart of smart active distribution networks (ADNs). The proposed algorithm targets to optimally control active elements of the network, distributed generations (DGs) and responsive loads (RLs), seeking to minimize the day-ahead total operation costs. The technical constraints of the components and the whole system are accommodated in the ac power flow fashion. As an innovative point, the DMS effectively utilizes the hourly network reconfiguration capabilities being realized by the deployment of remotely controlled switches (RCSs). Accordingly, besides the optimal schedule of active elements, the optimal topology of the network associated with each hour of the scheduling time horizon is determined as well. The effect of hourly reconfiguration on the capacity release of DGs and RLs is highlighted, which could be envisaged as a new trend in the reserve scheduling problem. Considering practical issues, the maximum daily switching actions of RCSs as well as switching costs are judicially included. The optimization procedure is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem and tackled with the genetic algorithm. To validate the satisfactory performance of the proposed framework, a 33-bus ADN is thoroughly interrogated.

Abstract: Load dispatch such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) control of electric vehicles (EVs) is taken as a promising way to promote the integration of wind power. This paper proposes a cooperation model of EVs and wind generation based on the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). Different from existing works, it pays special attentions to the model and constraints of EV aggregators. The distribution pattern of user trips is included and the dynamic process of stored energy is analyzed in the model. The constraints that EVs can't charge and discharge simultaneously are proved to be redundant under some conditions on theory and the necessity of battery storage constraints are explained via numerical examples. The proposed model is verified in case studies on the IEEE-RTS. The results show that V2G can not only improve the efficiency of thermal units but also promote the integration of wind power. Factors influencing storage violations are also analyzed.

Abstract: Bus voltage stability is a key issue in future medium-voltage DC (MVDC) power systems on ships. The presence of high-bandwidth controlled load converters (Constant Power Load, CPL) may induce voltage instabilities. A control design procedure is presented which starts at the modeling level and comes to control implementation. A control method based on a Linearization via State Feedback (LSF), is proposed to face the CPL destabilizing effect and to ensure the MVDC bus voltage stability. A multiconverter shipboard DC grid is analyzed by means of a new comprehensive model, which is able to capture the overall behavior in a second-order nonlinear differential equation. Exploiting DC-DC converters that interface power sources to the bus, LSF technique is able to compensate for system nonlinearities, obtaining a linear system. Then, traditional linear control techniques can be applied to obtain a desired pole placement. With reference to system parameters mismatch, LSF control design is verified by means of a sensitivity analysis, evaluating the possibility of an over-linearization strategy. Time-domain numerical simulations are used to validate the proposed control, in presence of relevant perturbations by means of a two-way comparison (average value model and detailed switching model).

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reliability modeling and analysis methodology for modern substation protection systems. A typical IEC 61850 based substation protection system is designed and analyzed using this methodology as an example. This system includes cyber components such as Merging Units (MUs), Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), and process bus, as well as physical components such as transformers, circuit breakers, and transmission lines. A general technique for cyber-physical system reliability analysis and the concept of cyber-physical interface matrix are presented. The failure modes of individual components and their impacts on the overall system are modeled and numerically analyzed. The utility of the cyber-physical interface matrix in the reliability analysis of a composite power system is also illustrated. The cyber-physical interface matrix is the critical idea that helps making the analysis tractable. The results of our study provide important and precise information for substation reliability evaluation and pave the way for the reliability analysis of complex and large scale cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: This paper studies the stability analysis of a dc distribution network in a hybrid micro-grid. A micro-grid with ac and dc distribution networks based on multi-port power electronic interfaces (MPEIs) is conceptualized. Afterwards, an extended averaging method for modeling systems with multiple switching converters is introduced. Using this method, the dc distribution network is modeled. Furthermore, the stability assessment of this network is performed using pole-zero analysis of the small-signal model. Simulation results and experimental measurements are provided to validate the stability assessment of the hybrid micro-grid.

Abstract: In contrast with a centralized Home Energy Management System, a Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system as an energy audit identifies power-intensive household appliances non-intrusively. In this paper, an NILM system with a novel hybrid classification technique is proposed. The novel hybrid classification technique integrates Fuzzy C-Means clustering-piloting Particle Swarm Optimization with Neuro-Fuzzy Classification considering uncertainties. In reality, household appliances or operation combinations of household appliances in a house field may be identified under similar electrical signatures. The ambiguities on electrical signatures extracted for load identification exist. As a result, the Fuzzy Logic theory is conducted. The ambiguities are addressed by the proposed novel hybrid classification technique for load identification. The proposed NILM system is examined in real lab and house environments with uncertainties. As confirmed in this paper, the proposed approach is feasible.

Abstract: During recent years the electricity supply chain (electricity production, consumption, distribution, storage, and load management) has changed. In this context a new term appears: the prosumer, that is both a consumer and producer of energy in the same entity. In the paper, an energy management approach of several prosumers aggregated in a coalition, the energy district (ED), and coordinated through a central control entity, the coalition coordinator, is proposed. The aim of the coalition coordinator is to maximize the coalition utility also reducing in this way the reverse energy flows at the point of delivery by an appropriate demand response program. The application on an Italian residential housing area is illustrated. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and attractiveness of the proposed energy management scheme.

Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic framework to mitigate the effects of uncertainty and enhance the predictability of wind power using the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs). An Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) wind speed model forecasts the wind power output. Using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, EVs are grouped into 6 fleets of similar daily driving patterns. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in combination with a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to optimize charging and discharging of the EVs. The optimization scheme minimizes the sum of the penalty cost associated with wind power imbalances and V2G expenses associated with purchased energy, battery wear and capital costs. The proposed method provides a collaborative strategy between the wind participants and EV owners to increase their revenues and incentives. A cost-benefit analysis assesses the economic feasibility of V2G services for wind power integration. The coordinated charging/discharging scheme optimally utilizes the V2G capacities of EVs and compensates for power imbalances due to random variations of wind power.

Abstract: Direct current (DC) power systems have recently been proposed as a promising technology for distribution networks and microgrids. By eliminating unnecessary conversion stages, DC distribution systems can enable seamless integration of natively DC devices such as photovoltaic cells and batteries. Moreover, DC technologies can overcome several disadvantages of alternating current (AC) distribution systems, such as synchronization requirements and reactive power compensation. Therefore, in this paper, the first steps are taken towards designing demand response programs for DC distribution networks. The idea is to adjust the internal parameters of power electronics loads to ensure reliable and efficient operation of the DC distribution system. In this regard, first, an optimization-based foundation is proposed for demand response in DC distribution networks in presence of distributed generators. Then, the formulated problem is solved using both centralized and decentralized approaches, where the latter requires devising a pricing mechanism. Finally, simulation results are presented to assess the performance and to gain insights into the proposed demand-response paradigm.

Abstract: This paper addresses common-mode (CM) and radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic interferences (EMI) in a converter-fed low-voltage direct current (LVDC) distribution research network. The LVDC distribution is a novel approach to public electricity distribution, and a research site is set up to enable comprehensive studies concerning the LVDC distribution. Because the customers in the LVDC system are supplied with customer-end inverters (CEI), CM and RF EMI generated by the CEIs have to be analyzed. To this end, common-mode currents in the DC network and the customer-end networks are studied by on-site measurements. The objective is to determine whether there are disturbances that exceed the requirements of the standards or whether the CM current could cause safety issues in the converter-fed user-end network. In the DC network, the effect of the CM current on the feasibility of power line communication (PLC) in a DC network is analyzed. Finally, RF disturbances are measured and discussed.

Abstract: Inverter-dominated microgrids impose significant challenges on the distribution network, as inverters are well known for their limited contribution to fault current, undermining the performance of traditional overcurrent protection schemes. This paper introduces a new protection scheme based on the initial current traveling wave utilizing an improved mathematical morphology (MM) technology, with simplified polarity detection and new logics introduced for meshed networks and feeders with single-end measurement. The proposed protection scheme provides ultrafast response and can be adapted to varied system operational modes, topologies, fault conditions, and load conditions. Only low-bandwidth communication is required to achieve high-speed operation and adequate discrimination level in meshed networks. Simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC verifies both the sensitivity and stability of the proposed protection scheme under different microgrid operational scenarios.

Abstract: The use of "Electric Springs" is a novel way of distributed voltage control while simultaneously achieving effective demand-side management through modulation of noncritical loads in response to the fluctuations in intermittent renewable energy sources (e.g., wind). The proof-of-concept has been successfully demonstrated on a simple 10-kVA test system hardware. However, to show the effectiveness of such electric springs when installed in large numbers across the power system, there is a need to develop simple and yet accurate simulation models for these electric springs which can be incorporated in large-scale power system simulation studies. This paper describes the dynamic simulation approach for electric springs which is appropriate for voltage and frequency control studies at the power system level. The proposed model is validated by comparing the simulation results against the experimental results. Close similarity between the simulation and experimental results gave us the confidence to use this electric spring model for investigating the effectiveness of their collective operation when distributed in large number across a power system. Effectiveness of an electric spring under unity and non-unity load power factors and different proportions of critical and noncritical loads is also demonstrated.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for enhancing the stability of a dc distribution system that integrates plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with an ac power grid. The dc distribution system is interfaced with the host ac grid via a voltage-sourced converter and can also embed photovoltaic (PV) modules. Thus, bidirectional dc-dc electronic power converters act as battery chargers and interface the PHEVs with the dc distribution system, while PV modules are interfaced with the dc distribution system via unidirectional dc-dc converters. The dc distribution system is expected to be more efficient and economical than a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid, but it is prone to instabilities due to the constant-power property of the dc-dc converters. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by altering the power setpoints of the battery chargers, bidirectional dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware. The paper presents mathematical models for the original and modified systems and demonstrates that the proposed technique expands the stable operating region of the dc distribution system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a study system in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

Abstract: This paper deals with a residential hybrid thermal/electrical grid-connected home energy system, including a fuel-cell with combined heat and power (CHP) and a battery as energy storage system (ESS). A day-ahead scheduling algorithm for managing different resources is developed to generate an efficient look-up table that determines an optimal operation schedule for the distributed energy resources at each time interval, so that the operation cost of a smart house is minimized. The impact of the electricity tariff and the efficiency of the energy storage system are considered when optimizing the operation schedules.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an active distribution network (ADN) that performs primary voltage control using real-time demand response via a broadcast low-rate communication signal. The ADN also owns distributed electrical energy storage. We show that it is possible to use the same broadcast signal deployed for controlling loads to manage the distributed storage. To this end, we propose an appropriate control law to be embedded into the distributed electrical storage controllers that reacts to the defined broadcast signal in order to control both active and reactive power injections. We analyze, in particular, the case where electrical storage systems consist of supercapacitor arrays and where the ADN uses the grid explicit congestion notification (GECN) for real-time demand response that the authors have developed in a previous contribution. We estimate the energy reserve required for successfully performing voltage control depending on the characteristics of the network. The performance of the scheme is numerically evaluated on the IEEE 34-node test feeder. We further evaluate the effect, depending on the line characteristics, of reactive versus active power controlled injections. We find that without altering the demand-response signal, a suitably designed controller implemented in the storage devices enables them to successfully contribute to primary voltage control.

Abstract: In this paper, the interconnected dc distribution system is represented as a class of interconnected, nonlinear discrete-time systems with unknown dynamics. The dc distribution system comprises several dc sources, here called subsystems, along with resistive and constant-power loads (CPLs.) Each subsystem includes a dc-dc converter (DDC) and exploits distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic, wind, etc. Due to the power system frequent disturbances this system is prone to instability in the presence of the DDC dynamical components. On the other hand, designing a centralized controller may not be viable due to the distance between the subsystems (dc sources.) Therefore, in this paper the stability of the interconnected dc distribution system is enhanced through decentralized adaptive nonlinear controller design that employs neural networks (NNs) to mitigate voltage and power oscillations after disturbances have occurred. The adaptive NN-based controller is introduced to overcome the unknown dynamics of each subsystem's converter and stabilize the entire grid, assuming that only the local measurements are available to each converter. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in damping oscillations that occur in the presence of disturbances.

Abstract: This paper presents a high speed current differential implementation approach for smart dc distribution systems capable of sub-millisecond fault detection. The approach utilizes the natural characteristics of dc differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection times compared to standard applications and hence meet requirements for dc converter protection (around 2 ms). Analysis is first developed to help quantify protection implementation challenges for a given dc system. Options for implementing the proposed technique are then illustrated. Results of scaled hardware testing are presented which validate the overall protection operating times in a low voltage environment. These results show the implementation approach can consistently achieve protection system operating within the order of a few microseconds.

Abstract: Aging network assets, significant variations in weather conditions, increased accommodation of intermittent distributed generation, and the network operating patterns deviate actual thermal limits of assets from deterministic thermal limits. In that context, the paper proposes a model integrated innovative approach to assess the security of energy supply in an active distribution network. The approach integrates models of dynamic thermal limits, stochastic variations in weather conditions, random outages, intermittent generation outputs, and random load fluctuations into Monte Carlo simulation and quantifies the level of insecurity. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by a case study. The results suggest that costs of outages can be significantly affected by combinatorial effects of weather patterns and dynamic thermal limits. Changes in weather patterns contribute more to the costs of the outages than dynamic variations in thermal limits. Latent capacities of assets do not necessarily reduce insecurity of energy supply. The paper also argues that assets in stressed distribution networks should be modeled with dynamic thermal limits for the quantification of true impacts.

Abstract: There are many technical aspects and challenges in distributed generation (DG) that have not been properly understood and addressed so far. Distribution systems cannot be considered as balanced three-phase systems, because these are inherently unbalanced in steady-state operation. A full characterization of the unbalanced system with respect to system stability allows a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of such systems. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the effects of system unbalance on the stability of the distribution systems with synchronous generator (SG) and doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based DG units at different loading levels. Detailed steady-state and dynamic analyses of the system are performed. Based on classical voltage, small-perturbation and transient stability studies, it is demonstrated that system unbalance can significantly affect the distribution system dynamic performance, in ways that have not been discussed in the technical literature so far. A simple and effective control strategy based on an Unbalanced Voltage Stabilizer (UVS) is also proposed to improve the system control and the stability of unbalanced distribution systems with SG and DFIG. Eigenvalue analyses and time-domain simulations (TDS) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UVS for unbalance conditions.

Abstract: At high penetrations, uncontrolled electric vehicle (EV) charging has the potential to cause line and transformer congestion in the distribution network. Instead of upgrading components to higher nameplate ratings, we investigate the use of real-time control to limit EV load to the available capacity in the network. Inspired by rate control algorithms in computer networks such as TCP, we design a measurement-based, real-time, distributed, stable, efficient, and fair charging algorithm using the dual-decomposition approach. We show through extensive numerical simulations and power flow analysis on a test distribution network that this algorithm operates successfully in both static and dynamic settings, despite changes in home loads and the number of connected EVs. We find that our algorithm rapidly converges from large disturbances to a stable operating point. We show that in a test setting, for an acceptable level of overload, only 70 EVs could be fully charged without control, whereas up to around 700 EVs can be fully charged using our control algorithm. This compares well with the maximum supportable population of approximately 900 EVs. Our work also provides engineering guidelines for choosing the control parameters and setpoints in a distribution network.

Abstract: In this paper, an intelligent on-load tap changer (OLTC) control scheme is introduced that is based on the changes of the transformer primary side voltage and current caused by the OLTC action. It is shown that the changes in the voltage and current can be used to estimate the supply system Thevenin impedance and to monitor the OLTC stability by using a simple index. The proposed method is validated by simulation on a standard test system. Different cases are studied to demonstrate the ability of the method in monitoring the OLTC stability and avoiding or mitigating the possible instabilities.

Abstract: It is generally accepted that if dynamic electricity pricing tariffs were to be introduced, their effectiveness in controlling domestic loads will be curtailed if consumers were relied on to respond in their own interests. The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage. Using sub-metered load data from various domestic wet appliances, the proposed technique is demonstrated learning the appliance operating likelihood surfaces from no prior knowledge.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources continues to gain popularity. However, two major limitations exist that prevent widespread adoption: availability of the electricity generated and the cost of the equipment. Distributed generation, (DG) grid-tied photovoltaic-wind hybrid systems with centralized battery back-up, can help mitigate the variability of the renewable energy resource. The downside, however, is the cost of the equipment needed to create such a system. Thus, optimization of generation and storage in light of capital cost and variability mitigation is imperative to the financial feasibility of DC microgrid systems. PV and wind generation are both time dependent and variable but are highly correlated, which make them ideal for a dual-sourced hybrid system. This paper presents an optimization technique base on a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) which uses high temporal resolution insolation data taken at 10 seconds data rate instead of more commonly used hourly data rate. The proposed methodology employs a techno-economic approach to determine the system design optimized by considering multiple criteria including size, cost, and availability. The result is the baseline system cost necessary to meet the load requirements and which can also be used to monetize ancillary services that the smart DC microgrid can provide to the utility at the point of common coupling (PCC) such as voltage regulation. The hybrid smart DC microgrid community system optimized using high-temporal resolution data is compared to a system optimized using lower-rate temporal data to examine the effect of the temporal sampling of the renewable energy resource.

Abstract: Real-time electricity prices along with demand-side potentials can provide distribution companies (DisCos) with considerable financial and technical benefits compared to the conventional flat prices. This paper incorporates demand response in DisCos' short-term decision model in a real-time pricing (RTP) environment wherein consumers are charged based on hourly varying prices. Besides the hourly RTP sale prices, the established model deals with other DisCo's short-term activities including hourly purchases from the grid, commitment of distributed generation (DG) units, dispatch of shunt compensators, and invocation of load curtailments (LCs). The stochastic nature of wholesale market prices and customers load is also considered in the model. The model is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which can be easily solved via commercial software packages. The objective is to maximize the DisCo's expected profit while its revenue is limited by regulating bodies. A typical Finnish 20 kV urban distribution network is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the established model. Simulation results are presented and discussed to investigate the impacts on both financial and technical aspects of using of RTP sale prices.

Abstract: Low voltage direct current (LVDC) distribution systems have the potential to support future realization of smart grids and enabling of increased penetration of distributed renewables, electric vehicles, and heat pumps. They do, however, present significant protection challenges that existing schemes based on dc fuses and conventional electro-mechanical circuit breakers cannot manage due to the nature of dc faults and slow device performance. Therefore, this paper presents an advanced protection scheme that addresses the outstanding challenges for protecting an LVDC last mile distribution network. The scheme takes advantage of advanced local measurements and communications that will be naturally integrated in smart grids, and the excellent level of controllability of solid state circuit breakers. It thus provides fast dc fault detection and interruption during dc transient periods, in addition to achieving fault limitation and fast reliable restoration. The introductory part of the paper quantifies the potential benefits of LVDC last mile distribution networks, and discusses the potential LVDC architectures that best utilize the existing plant. Based on the new LVDC architectures, a typical U.K. LV network is energized using dc and modeled, and is used as a case study for investigating the protection issues and evaluating the new protection scheme performance through simulation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a non-cooperative game (NCG) model for non-technical loss (NTL) screening inmicro-distribution systems. This model can compound an infra-structure with smart electric meters and fractional-order self-synchronization error formulation to distinguish illegal activities between profiled usages and non-technical usages. Then a NCG-based decision-making model is used to locate the abnormalities. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Most previous total cost of ownership (TCO) studies give insight into the overall costs of various communications network architectures under the assumption of the traditional vertical integration model. However, it is necessary to take a closer look at the possibilities and gains achieved through collaboration. In this work, we develop a flexible, generic yet comprehensive TCO framework for the rollout of integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) smart grid communications infrastructures. Further, we propose a novel collaborative implementation model for a shared infrastructure for both broadband access and smart grid communications. In addition, we take into account that buildings currently shift from a product to a service (i.e., renewable power supply) and exploit the idea that housing companies may collaborate by offering surplus renewable energy to communications network providers across interconnected smart microgrids. We study the impact of our implementation model on TCO and compare it with the vertical integration model. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis for the key cost parameters and analyze the risks related to solar power intermittency and random fiber cuts in terms of power service penalty, fiber cut related costs, and TCO.

Abstract: Given the appropriate control strategies and market rules, distributed energy resources (DER) organized into microgrids have the potential to be active participants in regional energy and ancillary services markets. This paper integrates a price-based control mechanism into the conventional frequency droop control mechanism to present an integrated droop-based control framework that could facilitate greater DER penetration in the power system and electricity markets. The proposed control framework makes use of the concept of "price droop," and introduces the idea of a "system frequency elasticity". These two concepts combine the power system control concept of frequency droop and the economic concept of own price elasticity. The framework consists of a centralized agent-based learning process and a decentralized operational response. The applicability of the proposed control mechanism is demonstrated through a series of case studies. Results highlight the need to consider the dynamics of the existing system in the design of new technical and market strategies to allow for the integration of DER and microgrids into the power system.

Abstract: Power grid is one of the most critical infrastructures in a nation and could suffer a variety of cyber attacks. Recent studies have shown that an attacker can inject pre-determined false data into smart meters such that it can pass the residue test of conventional state estimator. However, the calculation of the false data vector relies on the network (topology and parameter) information of the entire grid. In practice, it is impossible for an attacker to obtain all network information of a power grid. Unfortunately, this does not make power systems immune to false data injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a local load redistribution attacking model based on incomplete network information and show that an attacker only needs to obtain the network information of the local attacking region to inject false data into smart meters in the local region without being detected by the state estimator. Simulations on the modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of this paper reveal the mechanism of local false data injection attacks and highlight the importance and complexity of defending power systems against false data injection attacks.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for modeling the load demand of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Due to the stochastic nature of vehicle arrival time, departure time and daily mileage, probabilistic methods are chosen to model the driving pattern. However, these three elements of driving pattern are correlated with each other, which makes the probability density functions (pdfs)-based probabilistic methods inaccurate. Here a fuzzy logic based stochastic model is built to study the relationship between the three elements of driving pattern. Moreover, a load profile modeling framework (LPMF) for PHEVs is proposed to synthesize both the characteristics of driving pattern and vehicle parameters into a load profile prediction system. Based on this stochastic model of PHEV, a two-layer evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is proposed to integrate PHEVs into a residential distribution grid. A novel business model is developed for PHEVs to provide ancillary service and participate in peak load shaving. A virtual time-of-use rate is used to reflect the load deviation of the system. Then, an objective function is developed to aggregate the peak load shaving, power quality improvement, charging cost, battery degradation cost and frequency regulation earnings into one cost function. The ESPSO approach can benefit the system in four major aspects by: 1) improving the power quality; 2) reducing the peak load; 3) providing frequency regulation service; and 4) minimizing the total virtual cost. Finally, simulations are carried out based on different control strategies and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In the context of the implementation of smart grid, electric distribution systems operation should be managed and optimized in a way that saves energy, reduce emissions, allow for a seamless integration of renewable energy sources and improves the power quality, while still meeting increasing demands with minimum operating costs. Achieving these objectives requires efficient smart techniques that address both existing and future challenges with respect to the implementation of smart grid. This paper proposes a smart matching scheme (SMS) that will select the most efficient and economical distribution system (DS) controlled resources for a reliable and improved DS operation. The selected resources will then be optimally controlled to fulfill the operator's needs while adhering to the operational constraints. Performance evaluation of different optimization problems with and without the use of the proposed SMS were conducted and applied on the IEEE 123 bus DS. The IEEE 123 test system is modified to include dis-patchable and renewable distributed generations to match the performance of a typical electric distributions system.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel magnetic sensor array based technique for measuring currents in a group of enclosed conductors. It is designed specifically for monitoring the real-time power consumptions of North American homes. The technique consists of three key components: magnetic field sensors deployed in close proximity of the power conductors to be measured; algorithms to compute the conductor currents based on the magnetic fields measured; a simple, integrated sensor calibration and communication scheme. Prototype devices have been developed based on the technique. Extensive lab and field tests have demonstrated that the technique can provide adequate current measurements for residential homes. Combining with the non-intrusive load monitoring methods, the proposed measurement technique represents an attractive platform to create a complete home energy use tracking system.

Abstract: Connecting distributed generation (DG) to weak distribution networks can often cause voltage rise problems. Traditionally, these voltage rise problems have been mitigated by passive methods such as reinforcing the network. This can, however, lead to high connection costs of DG. The connection costs can in many cases be lowered if active voltage control methods are used instead of the passive approach. In this paper, two coordinated voltage control algorithms suitable for usage in distribution networks including several distributed energy resources are proposed and studied. The first algorithm uses control rules to determine its control actions and the second algorithm utilizes optimization. The operation of the implemented algorithms is, at first, studied using time domain simulations. Thereafter, the network effects and costs of both algorithms are compared using statistical distribution network planning and also practical implementation issues are discussed.

Abstract: Motivated by the potential ability of heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in demand response (DR), we propose a distributed DR control strategy to dispatch the HVAC loads considering the current aggregated power supply (including the intermittent renewable power supply). The control objective is to reduce the variation of nonrenewable power demand without affecting the user-perceived quality of experience. To solve the problem, first, a queueing model is built for the thermal dynamics of the HVAC unit based on the equivalent thermal parameters (ETP) model. Second, optimization problems are formulated. Based on an extended Lyapunov optimization approach, a control algorithm is proposed to approximately solve the problems. Third, a DR control strategy with a low communication requirement is proposed to implement the control algorithm in a distributed way. Finally, practical data sets are used to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control algorithm.

Abstract: This paper introduces distributed algorithms that share the power generation task in an optimized fashion among the several Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) within a microgrid. We borrow certain concepts from communication network theory, namely Additive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) algorithms, which are known to be convenient in terms of communication requirements and network efficiency. We adapt the synchronized version of AIMD to minimize a cost utility function of interest in the framework of smart grids. We then implement the AIMD utility optimisation strategies in a realistic power network simulation in Matlab-OpenDSS environment, and we show that the performance is very close to the full-communication centralized case.

Abstract: A situational awareness system is essential to provide accurate understanding of power system dynamics, such that proper actions can be taken in real time in response to system disturbances and to avoid cascading blackouts. Event analysis has been an important component in any situational awareness system. However, most state-of-the-art techniques can only handle single event analysis. This paper tackles the challenging problem of multiple event detection and recognition. We propose a new conceptual framework, referred to as event unmixing, where we consider real-world events mixtures of more than one constituent root event. This concept is a key enabler for analysis of events to go beyond what are immediately detectable in a system, providing high-resolution data understanding at a finer scale. We interpret the event formation process from a linear mixing perspective and propose an innovative nonnegative sparse event unmixing (NSEU) algorithm for multiple event separation and temporal localization. The proposed framework has been evaluated using both PSS/E simulated cases and real event cases collected from the frequency disturbance recorders (FDRs) of the Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET). The experimental results demonstrate that the framework is reliable to detect and recognize multiple cascading events as well as their time of occurrence with high accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents an online optimal energy/power control method for the operation of energy storage in grid-connected electricity microgrids. The approach is based on a mixed-integer-linear-program optimization formulated over a rolling horizon window, considering predicted future electricity usage and renewable energy generation. Performance objectives include electricity usage cost, battery operation costs, and utility oriented goals related to the peak demand and load smoothing. A robust counterpart formulation of the optimization problem is also proposed to handle uncertainty in energy demand/generation prediction in a computationally efficient way. Further reduction in the computations is achieved by employing variable time steps and relaxing binary constraints. A series of simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of various features of the proposed energy/power management methodology in different scenarios.

Abstract: A major feature of the smart grid is its diverse load management opportunities for customers, which calls for innovative techniques for load monitoring. This paper presents a method to monitor loads in commercial and small industrial facilities using a set of distributed voltage sensors and current estimation algorithms. The technique is especially suited for facilities where it is difficult to measure loads directly but the load voltages can be sensed. A state-estimation-like current estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the load currents using the voltages sensed at the terminals of the loads. Currents and powers collected from a limited number of panels are also utilized to provide redundancy for the estimation. Case studies have shown that the proposed method represents a promising alternative measurement strategy for load monitoring.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach based on wavelet design and machine learning applied to passive islanding detection of distributed generation. Procrustes analysis is used to determine the filter coefficients of a newly designed wavelet. To automate the classification process, machine learning algorithms are used to develop appropriate models. The IEEE 13-bus standard test distribution system simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC is used as a test bed to assess the performance of the proposed approach. The numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach are discussed and conclusions are drawn.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) has been known to play an important role in the electricity sector to balance supply and demand. To this end, the DR baseline is a key factor in a successful DR program since it influences the incentive allocation mechanism and customer participation. Previous studies have investigated baseline accuracy and bias for large, industrial and commercial customers. However, the analysis of baseline performance for residential customers has received less attention. In this paper, we analyze DR baselines for residential customers. Our analysis goes beyond accuracy and bias by understanding the impact of baselines on all stakeholders' profit. Using our customer models, we successfully show how customer participation changes depending on the incentive actually received. We found that, in general, bias is more relevant than accuracy for determining which baseline provides the highest profit to stakeholders. Consequently, this result provides a valuable insight into designing effective DR incentive schemes.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical demand side management scenario where the selfish consumers compete to minimize their individual energy cost through scheduling their future energy consumption profiles. We adopt an instantaneous load billing scheme to effectively convince the consumers to shift their peak-time consumption and to fairly charge the consumers for their energy consumption. For the considered DSM scenario, an aggregative game is first formulated to model the strategic behaviors of the selfish consumers. By resorting to the variational inequality theory, we analyze the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game. Subsequently, for the scenario where there is a central unit calculating and sending the real-time aggregated load to all consumers, we develop a one timescale distributed iterative proximal-point algorithm with provable convergence to achieve the NE of the formulated game. Finally, considering the alternative situation where the central unit does not exist, but the consumers are connected and they would like to share their estimated information with others, we present a distributed synchronous agreement-based algorithm and a distributed asynchronous gossip-based algorithm, by which the consumers can achieve the NE of the formulated game through exchanging information with their immediate neighbors.

Abstract: Cooperative distributed optimization is proposed in this paper to optimally dispatch the reactive power of the distributed generators (DGs). The overall objective is to minimize the cost function that is the sum of all quadratic voltage errors of the DG nodes and other critical nodes in the system. It is assumed that each DG is only aware of its own cost function defined as the quadratic voltage error of its respective node. In the proposed method, every DG performs optimization with respect to its own objective function while considering the information received locally from the neighboring nodes in the microgrid, and the critical nodes without DG also contribute to optimization. The proposed distributed optimization and control scheme enables the microgrid to have a unified voltage profile, and incorporating the subgradient method facilitates its application even when the microgrid information is unknown. Microgrid active power loss is also investigated, and it is shown that the unified voltage profile naturally leads to the overall active power loss minimization as well. Stability analysis and criteria are provided. Simulation results of a typical microgrid illustrate superior performance of the proposed technique.

Abstract: This paper deals with reconfiguration of distribution system to minimize power losses, deviation of nodes voltages and branches current constraint violations. This means alternation of feeders' topological structure by changing the status of tie and sectionalizing switches. The work presented here is a step forward to define the reconfiguration problem closer to reality by considering the effect of harmonic loads. To solve this complicated combinatorial, non-differentiable constrained optimization problem, novel heuristic optimization techniques such as Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) are employed. The methods are compared with Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithm to examine their performance including computational time, convergence rate, and accuracy of results. In this context, experiments are conducted on 69-bus and 84-bus distribution test systems for the short-and long-term reconfiguration scenarios. The obtained results establish that harmonic losses are a major deciding factor in reconfiguration and harmonic loads cannot be represented with only fundamental components.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of optimizing the electrical consumption patterns for a community of closely located households, with a large degree of flexible consumption, and further some degree of local electricity production from solar panels. We describe optimization methods for coordinating consumption of electrical energy within the community, with the purpose of reducing grid loading and active power losses. For this we present a simplified model of the electrical grid, including system losses and capacity constraints. Coordination is performed in a distributed fashion, where each consumer optimizes his or her own consumption pattern, taking into account both private objectives, specific to each individual consumer, as well as objectives common to all consumers. In our work, the common objective is to minimize active losses in the grid, and ensure that grid capacity limits are obeyed. These objectives are enforced by coordinating consumers through a nonlinear penalty on power consumption. We present simulation test-cases, illustrating that significant reduction of active losses, can be obtained by such coordination. The distributed optimization algorithm employs the alternating directions method of multipliers.

Abstract: Existing standards impose limits on the allowable feeder voltage variation in a distributed generation environment. These stipulations must be respected by the distributed power generators (suppliers), which put a cap on the penetration level. A possible solution is to provide reactive power support to improve the voltage profile. This paper proposes a novel scheme, where an auxiliary circuit (comprising an inverter and reactive power bank, RPB), in conjunction with a PV-grid system, increases the system's reactive power compensation capacity up to 300% compared to the original or dedicated VAR capacity of the main PV inverter. In spite of using only the conventional discrete form of capacitor/inductor bank, the entire VAR range can be controlled. This enables the local Photovoltaic Distributed Generation System (PV-DGS) to provide the necessary reactive power support for the mitigation of large voltage variation on the feeder because of reverse power flow, intermittent solar radiation and load variation. This, in turn, supports increased PV penetration into the power system. As an extension of the proposed scheme, any existing conventional reactive power banks may be retrofitted with a given PV grid system to realize the proposed functionality. Detailed modeling, analysis and control design are included along with experimental verification.

Abstract: Large commercial HVAC systems are attractive targets for fast demand response (DR) applications, e.g., integrating time-intermittent renewable generation. By leveraging the communications in the building automation system (BAS) already present in most buildings, large commercial HVAC systems provide easier access to a large controllable resource than aggregating a large number of small residential loads. However, large commercial HVAC systems are complex with many variables, many end point controllers, and several internal control loops that interact with each other. In addition, the existing fleet of large commercial buildings is diverse with many different HVAC configurations and BAS architectures. Capturing these buildings as DR resources requires a method to greatly reduce the complexity of the HVAC DR control and is general and flexible enough that it can be easily deployed across the diverse fleet of existing buildings. We create such a DR control by developing a system model that uses a single state variable instead of the several hundred variables in a commercial HVAC system. The model includes a small number of system parameters, and we demonstrate how their values can be determined via system identification measurements. Finally, we test our model on a large commercial HVAC system to investigate its control performance.

Abstract: Flexible ac transmission systems, as a key building block of transmission-level smart girds, have shown effective functionalities in promoting the system operation security and service reliability. Facing with series-compensated lines, subsynchronous resonance (SSR) may strike the power system by jeopardizing its stability and mechanical facilities. The operation of such transmission lines is broadening as a direct result of emergent desire to exploit distant wind energy resources in large scales. This paper verifies the capability of unified power flow controller (UPFC) in attenuating SSR in wind farm integrations. SSR is local in its nature; hence, local measurements are merely employed here for controlling the series convertor while wide-area signals could be as well utilized in parallel for other objectives such as inter-area oscillation damping. An equivalent self-excited induction generator (SEIG) represents the wind farm and is connected to the system through a series-compensated line. The UPFC is located at the wind terminal of the linking line; thus, the needed reactive power of SEIG is produced by the shunt branch of UPFC. Both SSR types, namely generator effect and torsional interaction, are examined here. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE first SSR benchmark model integrated with a SEIG wind turbine.

Abstract: This paper considers heat and power production from micro Combined Heat and Power systems and heat storage in a network of households. The goal is to balance the local heat demand and supply in combination with balancing the power supply and demand in the network. The on-off decisions of the local generators are done completely distributed based on local information and information exchange with a few neighbors in the network. This is achieved by using an information sharing model with a distributed model predictive control method based on dual-decomposition and sub-gradient iterations. Because of the binary nature of the decisions, a mixed integer quadratic problem is solved at each agent. The approach is tested with simulation, using realistic heat and power demand patterns. We conclude that the distributed control approach is suitable for embedding the distributed generation at a household level.

Abstract: Real-time demand response management (DRM) in smart grid (SG) requires a reliable wireless communication network with sufficient spectrum resources. However, the allocated spectrum for wireless communications is heavily under-utilized in the spatial and temporal dimensions. To solve the spectrum scarcity problem, cognitive radio (CR) and dynamic spectrum sharing have been proposed, but this can result in poor reliability. In this paper, the influence of wireless communication reliability on DRM is analyzed and the relationship between outage and DRM performance is derived. Outage results from not only interference and noise, but also the unavailability of spectrum resources. Therefore, joint spatial and temporal spectrum sharing is proposed to improve spectrum utilization. The SG network is divided into a Temporal Spectrum Sharing Region (TSSR) and a Free Spatial Spectrum Sharing Region (Free-SSSR). SG nodes in the TSSR can utilize the licensed spectrum when primary users (PUs) are idle, while in the Free-SSSR they can simultaneously share this spectrum with the PUs without using power control. Performance results are presented which show that joint spatial and temporal spectrum sharing can increase the SG spectrum utilization opportunities and lower the outage probability, which is beneficial for DRM performance.

Abstract: Synchrophasor Standards have evolved since the introduction of the first one, IEEE Standard 1344, in 1995. IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 introduced measurement accuracy under steady state conditions as well as interference rejection. In 2009, the IEEE started a joint project with IEC to harmonize real time communications in IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 with the IEC 61850 communication standard. These efforts led to the need to split the C37.118 into 2 different standards: IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 that now includes performance of synchrophasors under dynamic systems conditions; and IEEE Standard C37.118.2-2011 Synchrophasor Data Transfer for Power Systems, the object of this paper.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to identify power system impedance in real-time using signals obtained from grid-connected power electronic converters. The proposed impedance estimation has potential applications in renewable/distributed energy systems, STATCOM, and solid state substations. The method uses wavelets to analyze transients associated with small disturbances imposed by power converters and determine the net impedance back to the source. A data capture period of 5 ms is applied to an accurate impedance estimation which provides the possibility of ultra fast fault detection (i.e., within a half cycle). The paper describes how the proposed method would enhance the distributed generation operation during faults.

Abstract: Microgrids have gained a lot of interest under the smart grid vision demanding systematic procedures for their optimal construction and performance enhancement. By defining a new probabilistic index, this paper presents approaches for clustering active distribution systems into a set of microgrids with optimized reliability and supply-adequacy indices. After proposing two different methods for optimally designing the microgrids, as two corrective actions to improve the defined index, the advantages of installing distributed reactive sources (DRSs) and distributed energy storage resources (DESRs) are investigated. The problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper. The well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as a test case and through several sensitivity studies, the robustness of the design and the effect of interconnecting different amounts of DRSs' and DESRs' capacities on the defined index are investigated. It is found that by properly designing the system and integrating the DRSs and DESRs, the index can be improved from 23% in the base system without distributed generators (DGs) to 77% in the basic microgrid design with distributed generators and to 93% considering all resources.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel algorithm for calculating distribution load flow (DLF) for smart grid is presented. The algorithm can provide a DLF solution in a specific area of interest in the distribution system without the necessity of including all of the distribution system laterals in the DLF problem. The system laterals excluded from the DLF solution are replaced by equivalent loads using a proposed lumping technique. The proposed DLF zooming method thus reduces the size of the DLF problem and hence minimizes the effect of system size on the DLF solution time. The construction of the DLF problem is based on a novel automated recursive process, which enables fast accommodation of changes in the network topology of smart grid. The simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed DLF zooming algorithm and provide a favorable evaluation of its performance for smart grid operation.

Abstract: Voltage sensing of the utility network provide critical information for asset management, prioritizing asset replacements, increasing situational awareness and providing increased visibility of the grid. For ease of use, and to increase commercial appeal among utilities, these sensors should be designed to have a low cost, long life (> 10years), be self-powered, and require no maintenance. This paper deals with the development of a novel low-cost wireless voltage sensor for medium- and high-voltage (MV/HV) utility assets such as cables, transformers, switchgear, capacitor banks, and conductors. A review of existing techniques along with their drawbacks is outlined in this paper. Further, the challenges pertaining to the development a low-cost floating voltage sensor such as variability of voltage, self-calibration requirements, and distance-to-earth variations are presented. These challenges are circumvented by deriving a detailed mathematical model of the sensor. Further, using a set of valid assumptions, a new moving average voltage sensing (MAVS) algorithm is proposed, tested using simulations and validated using a high-voltage prototype. The wireless voltage sensor prototype is tested at up to 35 kV and is built to accommodate electric field energy harvesting in addition to voltage sensing. The prototype has a low-volume production cost of $150 and shows promising results by providing self-calibrated measurements capable of tracking the voltage variation with less than 2.5% error.

Abstract: The thermal storage potential in commercial buildings is an enormous resource for providing various ancillary services to the grid. In this paper, we show how fans in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings alone can provide substantial frequency regulation service, with little change in their indoor environments. A feedforward architecture is proposed to control the fan power consumption to track a regulation signal. The proposed control scheme is then tested through simulations based on a calibrated high fidelity non-linear model of a building. Model parameters are identified from data collected in Pugh Hall, a commercial building located on the University of Florida campus. For the HVAC system under consideration, numerical experiments demonstrate how up to 15% of the rated fan power can be deployed for regulation purpose while having little effect on the building indoor temperature. The regulation signal that can be successfully tracked is constrained in the frequency band [1/tau(0,) 1/tau(1) where tau(0) approximate to 3 minutes and tau(1) approximate to 8 seconds. Our results indicate that fans in existing commercial buildings in the U.S. can provide about 70% of the current national regulation reserve requirements in the aforementioned frequency band. A unique advantage of the proposed control scheme is that assessing the value of the ancillary service provided is trivial, which is in stark contrast to many demand-response programs.

Abstract: Renewable energy resources such as wind and solar are an important component of a microgrid. However, the inherent intermittency and variability of such resources complicates microgrid operations. Meanwhile, more controllable loads (e.g., plug-in electric vehicles), distributed generators (e.g., micro gas turbines and diesel generators), and distributed energy storage devices (e.g., battery banks) are being integrated into the microgrid operation. To address the operational challenges associated with these technologies and energy resources, this paper formulates a stochastic problem for microgrid energy scheduling. The proposed problem formulation minimizes the expected operational cost of the microgrid and power losses while accommodating the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources. Case studies are performed on a modified IEEE 37-bus test feeder. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed stochastic microgrid energy scheduling model.

Abstract: In power systems, load curve data is one of the most important datasets that are collected and retained by utilities. The quality of load curve data, however, is hard to guarantee since the data is subject to communication losses, meter malfunctions, and many other impacts. In this paper, a new approach to analyzing load curve data is presented. The method adopts a new view, termed portrait, on the load curve data by analyzing the periodic patterns in the data and reorganizing the data for ease of analysis. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms to build the virtual portrait load curve data, and demonstrate its application on load curve data cleansing. Compared to existing regression-based methods, our method is much faster and more accurate for both small-scale and large-scale real-world datasets.

Abstract: For the efficient operation of the smart grid, it is important that there is an instant by instant matching between the electricity supply and the power consumption. Electrical power storage provides a viable solution to managing power supply and electrical loads as well as unexpected imbalances. Electricity suppliers could deploy electricity storage facilities at various levels of the smart grid system: generation, transmission, substations and residential level. Storage would significantly address the power quality and reliability problems through peak shaving and frequency control. It also reduces the need for huge infrastructural expenditures by making them more efficient. At the residential level, smart storage together with dynamic pricing in the deregulated electricity markets presents the electricity suppliers with a strategy to achieve grid stability. In this paper, we consider a smart grid environment with a high penetration of households' storage batteries. By using an appropriate electricity price structure, the electricity supplier influences households' electricity consumption. On the other hand, the households aim to minimize their electricity bills by capitalizing on price fluctuation to schedule their electrical appliances and coordinate the charging and discharging of their batteries. The electricity supplier has a dynamic power limit for each hour that must not be exceeded by the hourly aggregate load of the households. Further, we assume that in supplying electrical power, the households' electrical devices are given priority over their storage devices. The policy is such that batteries will be charged by the residual power after the appliances loads have been satisfied. The households have to compete for the residual electricity so as to maximize the state of charge of their batteries. We have therefore modeled this system as a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium game where the households are considered as selfish but rational players whose objectives are to optimize their individual utilities.

Abstract: Reinforcing the Low Voltage (LV) distribution network will become essential to ensure it remains within its operating constraints as demand on the network increases. The deployment of energy storage in the distribution network provides an alternative to conventional reinforcement. This paper presents a control methodology for energy storage to reduce peak demand in a distribution network based on day-ahead demand forecasts and historical demand data. The control methodology pre-processes the forecast data prior to a planning phase to build in resilience to the inevitable errors between the forecasted and actual demand. The algorithm uses no real time adjustment so has an economical advantage over traditional storage control algorithms. Results show that peak demand on a single phase of a feeder can be reduced even when there are differences between the forecasted and the actual demand. In particular, results are presented that demonstrate when the algorithm is applied to a large number of single phase demand aggregations that it is possible to identify which of these aggregations are the most suitable candidates for the control methodology.

Abstract: Anti-islanding protection methods, proposed in the literature, are distributed generation (DG) type dependent or in other words work efficiently for a specific DG type (synchronous or inverter based). In this paper, we investigate the possibility of developing an efficient universal islanding detection method that can be applied to both inverter and synchronous-based DG. The proposed method relies on extracting a group of features, from measured data simulated for both types of DGs, from which the best features are selected for islanding detection. A random forest (RF) classification technique is used to detect islanding and non-islanding situations with an objective of minimizing the non-detection zone as well as avoiding nuisance DG tripping during non-islanding conditions. Islanding and non- islanding cases were generated for the IEEE 34- bus system and used to train and test the proposed technique. In the paper, - fold cross-validation was used in order to test the accuracy of the proposed algorithm for detecting islanding. The results show that the proposed methodology has zero non-detection zone, high accuracy, and fast response when applied to both types of DGs independently of the size of the island. Among the various classification approaches investigated, the RF technique proved to be the most efficient approach for the proposed islanding detection method.

Abstract: The paper analyzes the optimal response of an individual smart load with deferrable demand for electricity, to exogenous and stochastic price processes. It is assumed that a smart load can delay a time-flexible energy demand up to a fixed deadline. Under mild assumptions on the regularity of the stochastic price process, it is shown that the optimal strategy is to consume only when the price is less than or equal to a certain threshold that depends only on the time left to the deadline and the price statistics. This analysis is performed under both perfect and partial information about the statistics of the price process. Robust policies with performance guarantees are derived for the partial information case. Such performance bounds are also used for deriving upper and lower bounds on the economic value of load-shifting. Numerical simulation results based on price data from wholesale electricity markets suggest that when information must be empirically extracted from data, the robust policies provide various theoretical and practical advantages over the full information policies.

Abstract: Distributed generation (DG) is rapidly increasing its penetration level worldwide and is expected to play a more important role in providing power. An important benefit of DG is its ability to defer transmission investments. In this paper, a simulation model is implemented to conduct quantitative analysis on the effect of DG on transmission investment deferral. The transmission expansion model is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with comprehensive technical constraints, such as AC power flow and system reliability and/or security. The case study that was selected is the Queensland electricity market in Australia. Simulation results show that DG can reduce transmission investments significantly. This ability however is greatly influenced by a number of factors, such as the location of DG, the network topology, and power system technical constraints.

Abstract: Real-time control of a smart distribution grid with renewable energy based generators requires accurate state estimates, that are typically based on measurements aggregated from smart meters. However, the amount of data/measurements increases with the scale of the physical grid, posing a significant stress on both the communication infrastructure as well as data processing control centers. This paper first investigates the effect of geographical footprint of distributed generation (DG) on the voltage states of a smart distribution system. We demonstrate that the strong coupling in the physical power system results in estimated voltage phasors exhibiting a correlation structure that allows for compression of measurements. Specifically, by exploiting principles of 1D and 2D compressed sensing, we develop two approaches, an indirect and direct method for state estimation starting from compressed power measurements. We illustrate the effectiveness of voltage estimation with significantly low number of random spatial, temporal as well as spatio-temporal power measurements using the IEEE 34 node distribution test feeder and a larger 100 node radial distribution system. Results show similar performance for both methods at all levels of compression. It is observed that, even with only 50% compressed power measurements, both methods estimate the states of the test feeder with high level of accuracy.

Abstract: The Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) is the communication protocol standardized by IEEE for electric power systems (EPS) and it is a promising communication standard in the context of Smart Grids. This paper presents the Distributed Network Protocol over Ethernet (E-DNP3) using field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology as the first step to the EPS automation. The communication architecture improves the delivery time comparing with previous works and provides an adaptable solution for real-time information exchange in electrical applications such as management, control, and protection of power systems. The developed work allows the analysis of the feasibility of the proposed communication architecture in a real microgrid scenario. This implementation accomplishes a new technique for the communication architecture in order to integrate the distributed energy resources (DERs) to the local power system. The experimental results prove that the proposed architecture satisfies the communication requirements for real-time monitoring and control of EPS towards Smart Grid applications.

Abstract: An optimization model is proposed to manage a residential microgrid including a charging spot with a vehicle-to-grid system and renewable energy sources. In order to achieve a realistic and convenient management, we take into account: (1) the household load split into three different profiles depending on the characteristics of the elements considered; (2) a realistic approach to owner behavior by introducing the novel concept of range anxiety; (3) the vehicle battery management considering the mobility profile of the owner and (4) different domestic renewable energy sources. We consider the microgrid operated in grid-connected mode. The model is executed one-day-ahead and generates a schedule for all components of the microgrid. The results obtained show daily costs in the range of 2.82 to 3.33; the proximity of these values to the actual energy costs for Spanish households validate the modeling. The experimental results of applying the designed managing strategies show daily costs savings of nearly 10%.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted growing attention in recent years. However, daily charging of EVs, in particular rapid charging, may impact power systems, especially during peak hours, and the effects may occur in different places as traffic conditions change. To address these issues, we describe an integrated rapid-charging navigation strategy that considers both the traffic conditions and the status of the power grid. The system is based on an intelligent transport system (ITS), and contains four modules: a power system control center (PSCC), an ITS center, charging stations, and EV terminals. The PSCC calculates the available charging capacity and station charging capacity based on power grid data and transmits the results to the charging stations. The charging stations determine their charging plans and estimate the available charging power for future EVs (CPFE), and transmit these data to the ITS center. After receiving CPFE data and traffic data from the ITS center, the EV terminal estimates the total time for charging (TTC) for different stations, which includes the driving time, waiting time, and charging time. The driver can view these results and choose to be navigated to the charging station corresponding to the minimum TTC. The modular design of the navigation system reduces data transmission, which protects the drivers' privacy since they can choose which charging station to use and are not required to send any data to the ITS system. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for different working conditions for power system and traffic conditions.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) is emerging as one of the key smart grid components that plays a major role in achieving adequate supply-demand balance. DR is often considered as a market resource and thus there is more focus in the literature on economic aspects, thereby neglecting the DR's interaction and impact on the power system operation. This paper identifies a potential gap while employing DR in distribution systems. Usually, the load reactive power and the load's voltage dependency are ignored in the DR studies. It is shown in this paper that the inclusion of these two elements results in an active power mismatch between the scheduled and the actually achieved DR. A new term that is capable of quantifying this mismatch is introduced and is termed as "demand responsemismatch (DRM)." To overcome such problem, this paper proposes a mixed integer non linear program (MINLP) to find the optimal size and location of STATCOM and/or optimal transformer tap setting that can minimize the DRM. The phenomenon of DRM is illustrated using a standard 16-bus U.K. generic distribution system (UKGDS) while considering different load power factors, load reduction amounts, load models, as well as DR locations.

Abstract: An approach is proposed to deal with distributed energy resources, renewables and storage devices connected to microgrids. Specifically, a multilevel architecture is introduced and evaluated for the following main purposes: to reduce the computational complexity, to deal with different decentralized microgrids, different decision makers, and multiple objectives. A two-level decision architecture based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is presented, in which the upper decision level has the function of fixing the values of a certain set of parameters (reference values), by assuming a certain structure of the control strategies to be applied at the lower decision level. On the basis of such parameters, each decision maker at the lower level solves its own optimization problem by tracking the reference values provided by the upper level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated. The application of the proposed control architecture to a specific case study (Savona, Italy) is presented and discussed.

Abstract: By offering appropriate incentives, electricity users can be incentivized to alter their power consumption patterns so as to achieve the electricity supplier's intended profile. In this paper we have proposed a day-ahead demand-side bidding approach to realize the desired demand response. In our mechanism, customers submit their day-ahead electricity demands to the utility company through a secure communication infrastructure. The electricity supplier then generates the customers' hourly demand profile by aggregation of the individual requests. This information then forms the basis of procuring power in the wholesale market as well as developing a dynamic electricity pricing scheme. However, as expected, the actual electricity supply and the actual electricity consumption may not match. This could be due to the inability of the utility company to secure enough power at the wholesale market or due to changes in consumer power requirements. In the event the demand outstrips the supply, the customers willingly offer to shed some of their flexible appliances' loads but bid for prices at which they would like to pay for the curtailed load. We assume that customers are rational but selfish and are only concerned with maximizing their own benefits. In this study, this demand-side bidding problem is mathematically formulated and solved. Simulation studies are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The major issue in smart grid (SG) communications networks is the latency management of a vast amount of SG traffic in the access network that connects power substations to a large number of SG monitoring devices. There are three possible deployments for the SG access network considered by power industries: 1) a public access network with a mix of SG and human-to-human (H2H) traffic; 2) a private access network exclusively assigned to SG communications; and 3) a mix of private and public access networks, referred to as hybrid access networks. The SG communications traffic is classified as fixed-scheduling (FS) and event-driven (ED). The FS and ED traffic, generated by SG devices, occur on a periodic basis and as a response to electricity supply conditions, respectively. In this paper, we develop traffic models for public, private, and hybrid SG access networks based on queuing theory. By using these models, we derive an expression for the mean queuing delay for each traffic class in each network. We then propose an optimization problem to find the optimal partitioning of the SG traffic in a hybrid access network. The analytical results obtained from the proposed models agree very well with the simulation results.

Abstract: This study optimizes the structure and size of a district heating network. The optimization task is formulated as a mixed-integer problem on a graph of possible pipe locations. Both structure (where to build pipes) and size (pipe capacities) are decision variables in a mathematical description of the optimization problem. The validity of its results are then tested on a case study in Munich, using a published district heating extension plan as reference. The district heating model employs an idealized graph of the street network to represent potential sites for pipes. This street graph is derived from publicly available data, which is also the main source for estimating the heat demand of buildings. Heat demand of individual buildings is aggregated along streets; heat supply, in turn, is possible at pre-defined source locations. The structural optimization relies on a concave investment cost function which represents the diameter-independent part of pipeline investment costs. The case study results finally show a good correspondence between the overall structure of the optimized network and the real expansion plan of a district heating network.

Abstract: The operation of power systems now relies on extensive applications of digital communication systems, known as cyber networks. These applications are categorized as having either direct or indirect interactions between cyber and power networks. We previously studied direct interdependencies inside cyber-power networks and proposed the state mapping based model to evaluate its impact on the power system reliability. This paper focuses on indirect interdependencies between cyber and power networks. Certain applications of indirect interdependencies in modern power systems are discussed, and a state updating-based model is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of cyber-power networks under indirect interdependencies. Two optimization models are used to maximize the data connectivity in the cyber network and minimize the load curtailment in the power network. A high-voltage substation equipped with both monitoring and protection systems is studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution model.

Abstract: The weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is commonly employed to solve the state estimation problem in today's power systems, which are primarily measured by SCADA measurements, including bus power injection, branch power flow and bus voltage magnitude measurements. Despite being widely used, WLS estimator remains to be non-robust, i.e., it fails in the presence of bad measurements. The so called least absolute value (LAV) estimator is more robust, but is not widely used due to its higher computational cost. LAV estimator has the desirable property of automatic bad-data rejection provided that the measurement set does not include any "leverage measurements."There will be two important advantages to using LAV estimator when systems are observed by phasor measurements: 1) if the measurement set consists of only phasors, the leveraging effect of measurements can be easily eliminated by strategic scaling; 2) computational performance of LAV estimator will become competitive with that of WLS due to the linearity of the estimation problem for phasor measurements. This paper demonstrates these advantages and argues that the LAV estimator will be a statistically robust and computationally competitive estimator for those power systems that will be measured entirely by PMUs.

Abstract: In an isolated power grid or a micro-grid with a small carbon footprint, the penetration of renewable energy is usually high. In such power grids, energy storage is important to guarantee an uninterrupted and stable power supply for end users. Different types of energy storage have different characteristics, including their round-trip efficiency, power and energy rating, self-discharge, and investment and maintenance costs. In addition, the load characteristics and availability of different types of renewable energy sources vary in different geographic regions and at different times of year. Therefore joint capacity optimization for multiple types of energy storage and generation is important when designing this type of power systems. In this paper, we formulate a cost minimization problem for storage and generation planning, considering both the initial investment cost and operational/maintenance cost, and propose a distributed optimization framework to overcome the difficulty brought about by the large size of the optimization problem. The results will help in making decisions on energy storage and generation capacity planning in future decentralized power grids with high renewable penetrations.

Abstract: This paper quantifies the impact of single-phase on-board charging strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) in a case study of a heavily loaded unbalanced Flemish three-phase low-voltage residential grid. Voltage droop charging and EV-based peak shaving, which do not need communication with the distribution grid, are modeled and the results are compared. The grid voltages are analyzed according to the probabilistic and deterministic limits of the EN50160 standard, for a 100% EV penetration rate. The impact on the EV user comfort is evaluated in terms of charging time and electrically driven distances. The chosen voltage droop charging eliminates critical voltages below 0.85 pu and reduces voltage unbalance, with a limited impact on the total charging time. EV-based peak shaving makes the grid fully compliant with EN50160 and avoids the need for an infrastructure upgrade. The electrically driven distances are not influenced by the charging strategies.

Abstract: The increasing interest in integrating intermittent renewable energy sources into microgrids presents major challenges from the viewpoints of reliable operation and control. In this paper, the major issues and challenges in microgrid control are discussed, and a review of state-of-the-art control strategies and trends is presented; a general overview of the main control principles (e.g., droop control, model predictive control, multi-agent systems) is also included. The paper classifies microgrid control strategies into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary, where primary and secondary levels are associated with the operation of the microgrid itself, and tertiary level pertains to the coordinated operation of the microgrid and the host grid. Each control level is discussed in detail in view of the relevant existing technical literature.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal day-ahead price-based power scheduling problem for a community-scale microgrid (MG). The proposed optimization framework aims to balance between maximizing the expected benefit of the MG in the deregulated electricity market and minimizing the MG operation cost considering users' thermal comfort requirements and other system constraints. The power scheduling and bidding problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program where various system uncertainties are captured by using the Monte Carlo simulation approach. Our formulation is novel in that it can exploit the thermal dynamic characteristics of buildings to compensate for the variable and intermittent nature of renewable energy resources and enables us to achieve desirable tradeoffs for different conflicting design objectives. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the great benefits in exploiting the building thermal dynamics and the flexibility of the proposed scheduling method in achieving different practical design tradeoffs. We also investigate the impacts of different design and system parameters on the curtailment of renewable energy resources and the optimal expected profit of the MG.

Abstract: Increased levels of variable renewable generation lead to increased variations in power flows. If the required transmission capacity is provided by a grid with no or little controllability as in today's power system, the consequence is a significant under-utilization of the transmission assets most of the time. In this paper, corrective power flow control is used to improve the utilization of the existing transmission capabilities and adjust the grid to the varying needs of generation and demand. In lieu of the traditional N-1 security formulation, a risk based approach is employed. The resulting risk constrained economic dispatch is solved efficiently by decomposing it into a two stage process by using newly defined locational security impact factors (LSIF). In addition, these LSIFs provide information on the most effective, location-dependent measures to reduce system risk. Simulations provide insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the potential of corrective power flow control to reduce cost of dispatched generation and to decrease system risk.

Abstract: Forward/backward sweep power flow (FBS) is widely used in distribution network analysis because it is very efficient for radial and weakly meshed networks. In these types of methods, sensitivity-based approaches are commonly used to account for PV nodes in active distribution system; however, the convergence deteriorates as the number of PV nodes increases, and may even diverge for large-branch R X ratios. We propose an efficient-method for handling PV nodes based on loop analysis incorporated in the FBS framework. Here, PV nodes refer to nodes connected by distributed generators with constant voltage control. As an extension of FBS, the proposed method's convergence remains satisfactory when the number of PV nodes increases for a wide range of branch R X ratios. Numerical simulations with three-phase models were carried out to quantify the performance of the method.

Abstract: We present a systematic stability analysis of inverter-connected distributed generation. Our approach is to replace simulations with much faster and more informative analysis using transfer functions. The transfer functions characterize the dynamics of the interconnected feedback loops in the system. The methodology is applicable to different types of inverters, including droop inverters. It also may be applied to distribution systems with arbitrary topology. The analysis allows evaluation of system stability and performance, subject to frequency, load, and power set-point disturbances. By means of two examples we demonstrate how the proposed approach can help in analysis and engineering of the distribution systems with acceptable frequency and voltage profile responses to both distributed generation power and grid frequency disturbances.

Abstract: This paper presents the mathematical formulation of the microgrid's energy management problem and its implementation in a centralized Energy Management System (EMS) for isolated microgrids. Using the model predictive control technique, the optimal operation of the microgrid is determined using an extended horizon of evaluation and recourse, which allows a proper dispatch of the energy storage units. The energy management problem is decomposed into Unit Commitment (UC) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in order to avoid a mixed-integer non-linear formulation. The microgrid is modeled as a three-phase unbalanced system with presence of both dispatchable and non-dispatchable distributed generation. The proposed EMS is tested in an isolated microgrid based on a CIGRE medium-voltage benchmark system. Results justify the need for detailed three-phase models of the microgrid in order to properly account for voltage limits and procure reactive power support.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hierarchical transactive control architecture that combines market transactions at the higher levels with inter-area and unit-level control at the lower levels. A model of this architecture is introduced, with dynamics at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. With a goal of ensuring frequency regulation using optimal allocation of resources in the presence of uncertainties in renewables and load, a hierarchical control methodology is presented. Global asymptotic stability of the overall system is established in the presence of uncertainties at all three time-scales. An IEEE 30-bus as well as simulations of practical examples of realistic sizes are used to validate the approach where it is shown that the proposed control architecture has the potential to reduce cost of reserves and to increase social welfare.

Abstract: In a regulated business environment, a utility must be able to validate that deployed technologies provide quantifiable benefits to the end-use customers. While there are well established procedures for determining the benefits derived from the deployment of traditional technologies, the same procedures do not exist for many emerging technologies. Volt-VAR Optimization is an example of an emerging technology that is being deployed across the nation without a standardized method for determining system performance and benefits. This paper will present a method for the evaluation, and quantification of benefits, for field deployments of Volt-VAR Optimization technologies. In addition to presenting the methodology, the paper will present a summary of results, and observations, from two separate Volt-VAR Optimization field evaluations using the presented method.

Abstract: The increasing demand for electricity and the emergence of smart grids have presented new opportunities for residential energy management systems (REMS) in demand response market. Several techniques are available for optimizing the operation schedules and decisions of REMS. However, it can be challenging for REMS to capture sufficient resolution and horizon to make good short-term and long-term decisions, respectively, under limited computing resources. We propose a two-horizon algorithm, which can achieve high resolution schedules with reasonable value of energy services while limiting computation time. Simulation results are provided to confirm the validity of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Cyber intrusions to substations of a power grid are a source of vulnerability since most substations are unmanned and with limited protection of the physical security. In the worst case, simultaneous intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations of a power grid.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel online coordination method for the charging of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in smart distribution networks. The goal of the proposed method is to optimally charge the PEVs in order to maximize the PEV owners' satisfaction and to minimize system operating costs without violating power system constraints. Unlike the solutions reported in the literature, the proposed charging architecture guarantees the feasibility of the charging decisions by means of a novel prediction unit that can forecast future PEVs power demand and through an innovative two-stage optimization unit that ensures effective charging coordination. Coordinated PEV discharging also enables improved utilization of power system resources. Simulation results for a typical distribution network are provided as a demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) approach to optimally dispatch energy storage and dispatchable generation in the electric energy system under uncertainties introduced by variable energy sources as well as demand. The objective is to minimize the expectation of the sum of the production and ramping costs for generators while satisfying all the system constraints. The uncertainties are represented by scenarios, resulting in a large-scale and computationally demanding optimization problem. We use the optimality condition decomposition (OCD) to decompose the SMPC problem into subproblems which can be solved in parallel thereby reducing the computation time. Both a scenario-based decomposition and a temporal-based decomposition are formulated and numerically evaluated in terms of speed and convergence using a modified IEEE 39-bus test system. Simulation results indicate that the scenario-based decomposition scheme achieves a better trade-off between convergence speed and subproblem size for the considered optimal dispatch problem.

Abstract: First, we investigate the technical and economic potential of autonomously operating voltage control strategies in low voltage grids with high photovoltaic penetration. The investigated control strategies are based on the reactive power control capabilities of modern photovoltaic inverters and the application of distribution transformers with on-load tap changers. We present a methodology for assessing the technical potential of autonomous voltage control strategies to increase the hosting capacity of low voltage grids and show the results for 40 real German LV grids. Second, we compare the investment and operational costs for conventional grid extension measures with those resulting from the application of autonomous voltage control strategies over a period of 10 years, using real measured load and generation data. Finally, we assess the additional grid loss reduction potential by applying a coordinated control approach, using the reactive power capabilities of the inverters as well as the on-load tap changer. The results clearly highlight the economic benefit of autonomous voltage

Abstract: The vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) is well-suited for applications with renewable energy devices. This paper presents a practical analysis of the VRB for use in a microgrid system. The first part of the paper develops a reduced order circuit model of the VRB and analyzes its experimental performance efficiency during deployment. The model parameters of the various VRB system components were estimated from experimental field data. The parasitic losses of the circulation pumps power consumption were predicted during different operating situations. The second part of the paper addresses the implementation issues of the VRB application in a photovoltaic-based microgrid system. Commercially available chargers designed for lead-acid battery systems were shown to be non-optimal for VRB systems and a new dc-dc converter control was proposed to provide improved charging performance. The system model was validated with field-obtained experimental data.

Abstract: One of complementary value propositions of microgrids is to improve power system resiliency via local supply of loads and curtailment reduction. This subject is investigated in this paper by proposing a resiliency-oriented microgrid optimal scheduling model. The proposed model aims at minimizing the microgrid load curtailment by efficiently scheduling available resources when supply of power from the main grid is interrupted for an extended period of time. The problem is decomposed to normal operation and resilient operation problems. The normal operation problem solution, i.e., unit commitment states, energy storage schedules, and adjustable loads schedules, is employed in the resilient operation problem to examine microgrid capability in supplying local loads during main grid supply interruption. The schedule is revised via resiliency cuts if a zero mismatch is not obtained. Prevailing operational uncertainties in load, non-dispatchable generation, and the main grid supply interruption time and duration are considered and captured using a robust optimization method. The final solution, which is obtained in an iterative manner, is economically optimal, guarantees robustness against prevailing operational uncertainties, and supports a quick islanding with minimum consumer inconvenience and load curtailment. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resiliency-oriented microgrid optimal scheduling model applied to a test microgrid.

Abstract: With the proliferation in the number of PHEVs the demand on the electric grid increases appreciably. A smart charging station is proposed in which the charging of the PHEVs is controlled in such a way that the impact of charging during peak load period is not felt on the grid. The power needed to charge the plug in hybrids comes from grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generation or the utility or both. The three way interaction between the PV, PHEVs and the grid ensures optimal usage of available power, charging time and grid stability. The system designed to achieve the desired objective consists of a photovoltaic system, DC/DC boost converter, DC/AC bi-directional converter and DC/DC buck converter. The output of DC/DC boost converter and input of DC/AC bi-directional converter share a common DC link. A unique control strategy based on DC link voltage sensing is proposed for the above system for efficient transfer of energy.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical optimal control framework to coordinate the charging of plug-in electric vehicles in multifamily dwellings. A particular scenario is considered where distributed urban residential communities access electric power supplies through a common primary distribution transformer. We first formulate a centralized finite-horizon control problem. The proposed multistage mixed-integer program seeks to maximize the total utility of the charging service provider while satisfying customers' charge demands and transformer capacity constraints. By exploiting the structure of the centralized model, we decompose the centralized problem with respect to each parking deck based on the Lagrangian relaxation method and design an effective heuristic method to find feasible solutions to speed up convergence. Case studies on operations of five parking decks following different charging strategies are carried out. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed hierarchical charging strategy outperforms the centralized charging strategy from the perspective of computational requirements. System reliability and customer privacy protection are also discussed.

Abstract: Inverter driven, inertia-less interface of a large photovoltaic (PV) source with power grid raises challenging penetration issues such as bus voltage fluctuation, active power variation, reactive power flow and poor system dynamics. Extensive efforts are underway to overcome these issues, which tend to put a limit on the maximum PV power injection capability for a given local area electric power system. This paper proposes a new control scheme that enables a centralized PV-grid system to damp out the low frequency power swings on the local area network as an ancillary activity apart from its regular function. The proposed scheme enhances the power system stability without incorporating any additional devices or systems (e. g., PSS). The analytical basis of the control law used in this scheme is derived from the structure preserving energy function (SPEF) model. A notable feature of the scheme that makes it highly feasible is that it requires only locally measurable signals. Further, it does not affect the MPPT control of the PV system in any manner. All these features make it highly relevant and suitable for smart grid applications. Relevant simulation results as well as key experimental results for a laboratory level hardware model are included.

Abstract: This paper explores distributed smart grid attack strategies to destabilize power system components using variable structure system theory. Here, an opponent is able to remotely control multiple circuit breakers within a power system, say through data corruption or communication network attack, to destabilize target synchronous generators through application of state-dependent breaker switching. In contrast to attack via a single breaker, the multi-switch case provides additional degrees of freedom that can lead to stealthier and wide-scale cascading failures. We provide a dynamical systems context for formulating distributed multi-switch strategies and execute such attacks on the New England 10-generator 39-bus test system.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel modeling framework for the analysis of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) charging in unbalanced, residential, distribution systems. A Smart Distribution Power Flow (SDPF) framework is proposed to determine the controlled or smart charging schedules and hence address the shortcomings of uncontrolled charging. The effect of peak-demand constraint imposed by the Local Distribution Company (LDC) is also studied within the SDPF framework for the smart charging scenarios. Uncontrolled versus smart charging schemes are compared for various scenarios, from both the customer's and the LDC's perspective. Various objective functions, such as energy drawn by the LDC, total feeder losses, total cost of energy drawn by LDC and total cost of PEV charging are considered. Studies are carried out considering two sample systems i.e., the IEEE 13-node test feeder and a real distribution feeder. Analyses are also presented considering a probabilistic representation of the initial state of charge (SOC) and start time of charging for various scenarios to take into account the difference in customers' driving patterns. The results show that uncontrolled charging of PEVs results in increased peak demand, low node voltage levels, and increased feeder current magnitudes. On the other hand, the SDPF framework provides very satisfactory operating schedules for the overall system including smart PEV charging.

Abstract: We study the demand side management (DSM) problem when customers are equipped with energy storage devices. Two games are discussed: the first is a non-cooperative one played between the residential energy consumers, while the second is a Stackelberg game played between the utility provider and the energy consumers. We introduce a new cost function applicable to the case of users selling back stored energy. The non-cooperative energy consumption game is played between users who schedule their energy use to minimize energy cost. The game is shown to have a unique Nash equilibrium, that is also the global system optimal point. In the Stackelberg game, the utility provider sets the prices to maximize its profit knowing that users will respond by minimizing their cost. We provide existence and uniqueness results for the Stackelberg equilibrium. The Stackelberg game is shown to be the general case of the minimum Peak-to-Average power ratio (PAR) problem. Two algorithms, centralized and distributed, are presented to solve the Stackelberg game. We present results that elucidate the interplay between storage capacity, energy requirements, number of users and system performance measured in total cost and peak-to-average power ratio (PAR).

Abstract: Electric storage units constitute a key element in the emerging smart grid system. In this paper, the interactions and energy trading decisions of a number of geographically distributed storage units are studied using a novel framework based on game theory. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between storage units, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or an array of batteries that are trading their stored energy. Here, each storage unit's owner can decide on the maximum amount of energy to sell in a local market so as to maximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the revenues from energy trading and the accompanying costs. Then in this energy exchange market between the storage units and the smart grid elements, the price at which energy is traded is determined via an auction mechanism. The game is shown to admit at least one Nash equilibrium and a novel algorithm that is guaranteed to reach such an equilibrium point is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant performance improvements, in terms of the average utility per storage unit, reaching up to 130.2% compared to a conventional greedy approach.

Abstract: Coordinated regulation for the outputs from renewable energy sources is an appealing issue in future smart grid. This paper presents a distributed control strategy for multiple photovoltaic generators (PVs), which makes all the PVs have the same reserve ratio with respect to their maximum available power, but also makes their aggregated output support power network by providing power regulation service within the power limit. In addition, an estimation method is proposed to get the maximum available power of PV. The proposed control strategy is nearly center-free, i.e., there is no centralized station which collects the output of each PV and sends the power command to each PV, and only uses local communication networks (CNs) to avoid expensive sometimes unreliable, long distance communications. Simulation results based on the IEEE standard 123-bus distribution system are presented and discussed, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

Abstract: Rapidly increasing electricity demands and capacity shortage of transmission and distribution facilities are the main driving forces for the growth of Distributed Generation (DG) integration in power grids. One of the reasons for choosing a DG is its ability to support voltage in a distribution system. Selection of effective DG characteristics and DG parameters is a significant concern of distribution system planners to obtain maximum potential benefits from the DG unit. This paper addresses the issue of improving the network voltage profile in distribution systems by installing a DG of the most suitable size, at a suitable location. An analytical approach is developed based on algebraic equations for uniformly distributed loads to determine the optimal operation, size and location of the DG in order to achieve required levels of network voltage. The developed method is simple to use for conceptual design and analysis of distribution system expansion with a DG and suitable for a quick estimation of DG parameters (such as optimal operating angle, size and location of a DG system) in a radial network. A practical network is used to verify the proposed technique and test results are presented.

Abstract: Renewable energy sources, such as wind, are characterized by non-dispatchability, high volatility, and non-perfect forecasts. These undesirable features can lead to energy loss and/or can necessitate a large reserve in the form of fast-ramping fuel-based generators. Energy storage can be used to mitigate these effects. In this paper, we are interested in the tradeoff between the use of the reserves and the energy loss. Energy loss includes energy that is either wasted, due to the inefficiency of the storage cycle and the inevitable forecasting errors, or lost when the storage capacity is insufficient. We base our analysis on an initial model proposed by Bejan, Gibbens, and Kelly. We first provide theoretical bounds on the trade-off between energy loss and the use of reserves. For a large storage capacity, we show that this bound is tight, and we develop an algorithm that computes the optimal schedule. Second, we develop a scheduling strategy that is efficient for small ormoderate storage. We evaluate these policies on real data from the U. K. grid and show that they outperform existing heuristics. In addition, we provide guidelines for computing the optimal storage characteristics and the reserve size for a given penetration of wind in the energy mix.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Fed Power Electronic Transformer (MF-PET) for use in power distribution electrical systems. The MF-PET is a power electronic transformer with two or more AC/DC rectifiers at its input port, which may be connected to different feeders. Thus, it is possible to share the demand among feeders. Through a proper control, the AC/DC rectifiers may handle active power from the feeders (independently of the load type), may protect the load from sag/swell events, and may transfer power among feeders. This paper presents a three-phase MF-PET model. A small-scale laboratory prototype is shown and its application to distribution electrical system is discussed, exhibiting the MF-PET as a power electronic building block (PEBB) for its integration into electrical grids, enhancing the distribution system flexibility and contributing to the smart grid concept.

Abstract: Smart pricing methods using auction mechanism allow more information exchange between users and providers, and they can meet users' energy demand at a low cost of grid operation, which contributes to the economic and environmental benefit in smart grid. However, when asked to report their energy demand, users may have an incentive to cheat in order to consume more while paying less, causing extra costs for grid operation. So it is important to ensure truthfulness among users for demand side management. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method that can prevent users' cheating. In the proposed model, the smart meter can record user's consumption information and communicate with the energy provider's terminal. Users' preferences and consumption patterns are modeled in form of a utility function. Based on this, we propose an enhanced AGV (Arrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet) mechanism to ensure truthfulness. In this incentive method, user's payment is related to its consumption credit. One will be punished to pay extra if there is a cheat record in its consumption history. We prove that the enhanced AGV mechanism can achieve the basic qualifications: incentive compatibility, individual rationality and budget balance. Simulation results confirm that the enhanced AGV mechanism can ensure truth-telling, and benefit both users and energy providers.

Abstract: This paper investigates the residential energy consumption scheduling problem, which is formulated as a coupled-constraint game by taking the interaction among users and the temporally-coupled constraint into consideration. The proposed solution consists of two parts. Firstly, dual decomposition is applied to transform the original coupled-constraint game into a decoupled one. Then, Nash equilibrium of the decoupled game is proven to be achievable via best response, which is computed by gradient projection. The proposed solution is also extended to an online version, which is able to alleviate the impact of the price prediction error. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively shift the peak-hour demand to off-peak hours, enhance the welfare of each user, and minimize the peak-to-average ratio. The scalability of the approach and the impact of the user number are also investigated.

Abstract: We propose a robust network coding protocol for enhancing the reliability and speed of data gathering in smart grids. At the heart of our protocol lies the idea of tunable sparse network coding, which adopts the transmission of sparsely coded packets at the beginning of the transmission process but then switches to a denser coding structure towards the end. Our systematic mechanism maintains the sparse structure during the recombination of packets at the intermediate nodes. The performance of our protocol is compared by means of simulations of IEEE reference grids against standard master-slave protocols used in real systems. Our results show that network coding achieves 100% reliability, even for hostile network conditions, while gathering data 10 times faster than standard master-slave schemes.

Abstract: Hybrid ac/dc microgrids have been planned for the better interconnection of different distributed generation systems (DG) to the power grid, and exploiting the prominent features of both ac and dc microgrids. Connecting these microgrids requires an interlinking ac/dc converter (IC) with a proper power management and control strategy. During the islanding operation of the hybrid ac/dc microgrid, the IC is intended to take the role of supplier to one microgrid and at the same time acts as a load to the other microgrid and the power management system should be able to share the power demand between the existing ac and dc sources in both microgrids. This paper considers the power flow control and management issues amongst multiple sources dispersed throughout both ac and dc microgrids. The paper proposes a decentralized power sharing method in order to eliminate the need for any communication between DGs or microgrids. This hybrid microgrid architecture allows different ac or dc loads and sources to be flexibly located in order to decrease the required power conversions stages and hence the system cost and efficiency. The performance of the proposed power control strategy is validated for different operating conditions, using simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

Abstract: Data refreshment rate of a present power system is relatively slow and in some cases this slow refreshment rate may not be capable of providing information about dynamic state of power system devices. The use of multi protocol label switching based technique is one option to overcome this problem. A cost effective and simpler detection device is needed for condition monitoring and integrating the sensor signals into the smart grid monitoring system. Remote and on-line monitoring of ultra wide band partial discharge signal in a switch-yard is a new concept in smart grid technology that will help avoid damage of switchyard devices. It is possible to convert the radio frequency partial discharge signal into an equivalent milli-volt or milli-ampere output for remote or centralized monitoring of switchyard devices. Multi Protocol Label Switching based data transfer rate is faster than the conventional data transfer system of a power grid. In this paper a new and technically better method of on-line radio frequency partial discharge monitoring from a remote smart grid control room through multi protocol label switching is discussed.

Abstract: Remedial action scheme (RAS) is an automatic protection system designed to maintain system reliability. As result of green initiatives and mandates, there will be a proliferation of RAS in order to accommodate many new generation interconnections. With enabling technologies such as advanced intelligent electronic devices, fast computing technologies, utilities' extensive telecommunication network infrastructure, and the continued development of international standards, the opportunity allows a breakthrough in wide area monitoring and protection solutions. This paper describes how Southern California Edison systematically moved through stages from problem definition to ultimately deployment and system operation. Both the business and technical challenges during the project execution are discussed. Starting with the pressure on business practice, the evolutionary process of problem solving not only demonstrated how advanced information and telecommunication technologies can address the power utility business needs, but also paved a pathway for even more advanced wide area monitoring and protection applications.

Abstract: When paralleling multiple inverters that are capable of operating as an island, the inverters typically employ the droop control scheme. Traditional droop control enables the decentralized regulation of the local voltage and frequency of the microgrid by the inverters. The droop method also enables the inverters to share the real and reactive power required by the loads. This paper focuses on some of the limitations of parallel islanded single phase inverters using droop control. Algorithms with the aim to address the following limitations in islanded operation were proposed: reactive power sharing and reduction of the voltage harmonic distortion at the point of common coupling (PCC). Experimental results were then presented to show the suitability of the proposed algorithms in achieving reactive power sharing and in improving the voltage harmonic distortion at the PCC.

Abstract: Intermittent nature of renewable energies and random nature of moving loads negatively influence the power system transient stability. Energy storage can enhance the system response by providing short-term energy sources. However, fast dynamic storage systems require advanced controllers to stabilize the transients. This paper introduces the application of a decentralized overlapping decomposition controller in transient stability of renewable energy penetrated storage-based power systems. In a battery-based power system there exists strongly coupled state variables shared among areas. Large-scale controllers can decouple the system state variables and stabilize the oscillations. Here, the model of battery storage is obtained considering the battery's state of charge and the droop in power electronic interfaces. The overlapping decomposition decentralized controller demonstrates an enhanced transient stability performance under variable state of charge in various capacity of storage devices.

Abstract: In recent years, smart grids have been a common interest for many consumers, because of their comfort, safety, robustness, and economic characteristics. This paper presents the development of a computational tool, as an adaptive cognition system for smart grids, having smart homes as their composing nodes. Such a tool has been named Smart Home Energy Aware-Preserver (SHEAP). SHEAP incorporates evolutionary computation algorithms, and communication protocols, to provide users with context awareness and fault tolerance. Moreover, SHEAP considers a smart home powered by solar and wind energy, as a small version of the smart grid. SHEAP demonstrates the benefits of having a smart home that can control the amount of power needed, according to the context of usage. Furthermore, SHEAP includes fault tolerant mechanisms to monitor and react on fault occurrences. Simulation shows that with a smart control of the load, the requirements for a green energy system are reduced. An economic analysis of the approach demonstrates the viability of the project reducing the usage of grid energy by utilizing green energy.

Abstract: In this paper, the authors present work in the field of analog emulation of electric power system dynamics via field-programmable analog array (FPAA) technology. Specifically, they discuss development of a new emulation tool with increased modularity and operator density for analysis of larger power systems and smart grids. One innovative aspect of this work is the fact that it employs custom FPAA boards developed by researchers at The College of New Jersey and Drexel University. The work places emphasis on decreased prototype size, increased density of computational analog blocks (CABs), more effective FPAA interconnection scheme, and batch-mode FPAA configuration.

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy management technique for a consumer-to-grid system in smart grid. The benefit to consumers is made the primary concern to encourage consumers to participate voluntarily in energy trading with the central power station (CPS) in situations of energy deficiency. A novel system model motivating energy trading under the goal of social optimality is proposed. A single-leader multiple-follower Stackelberg game is then studied to model the interactions between the CPS and a number of energy consumers (ECs), and to find optimal distributed solutions for the optimization problem based on the system model. The CPS is considered as a leader seeking to minimize its total cost of buying energy from the ECs, and the ECs are the followers who decide on how much energy they will sell to the CPS for maximizing their utilities. It is shown that the game, which can be implemented distributedly, possesses a socially optimal solution, in which the sum of the benefits to all consumers is maximized, as the total cost to the CPS is minimized. Numerical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the game.

Abstract: The normal operation of power system relies on accurate state estimation that faithfully reflects the physical aspects of the electrical power grids. However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection attacks can bypass the security system and introduce arbitrary errors to state estimates. In this paper, we use graphical methods to study defending mechanisms against false-data injection attacks on power system state estimation. By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables with minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a graph. Based on the graphical characterization, we propose both exact and reduced-complexity approximation algorithms. In particular, we show that the proposed tree-pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity, while yielding negligible performance degradation compared with the optimal algorithms. The advantageous performance of the proposed defending mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system testcases.

Abstract: Electric utilities have been reluctant to embrace realtime pricing and the integration of renewables because both demand and supply will become uncertain. We quantify these risks as a function of solar/renewable penetration, and provide engineering analysis here to show it is possible to preserve the difference between supply and demand at levels manageable with current grid equipment and within the current deregulated market structure in the USA. First, we show how simple futures contracts and real-time energy management canmotivate widespread acceptance of real-time pricing (RTP). Our illustrative calculations use data from a large commercial facility in New York. In the other parts of our analysis, we show how spatially distributed supplies of solar energy connected to the grid reduce unpredictability of power production. We also show a natural stabilizing effect-the correlation between local solar production and local consumption of air-conditioners.

Abstract: The concept of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has gained recent interest as more and more electric vehicles (EVs) are put to use. In this paper, we consider a dynamic aggregator-EVs system, where an aggregator centrally coordinates a large number of dynamic EVs to provide regulation service. We propose a Welfare-Maximizing Regulation Allocation (WMRA) algorithm for the aggregator to fairly allocate the regulation amount among the EVs. Compared with previous works, WMRA accommodates a wide spectrum of vital system characteristics, including dynamics of EV, limited EV battery size, EV battery degradation cost, and the cost of using external energy sources for the aggregator. The algorithm operates in real time and does not require any prior knowledge of the statistical information of the system. Theoretically, we demonstrate that WMRA is away from the optimum by, where is a controlling parameter depending on EVs' battery size. In addition, our simulation results indicate that WMRA can substantially outperform a suboptimal greedy algorithm.

Abstract: Microgrids can provide various economic and environmental benefits but their implementation poses great technical challenges in control, protection and energy management. One of the most important technical aspects in microgrids is distribution system protection. This paper first demonstrates a need for and then focuses on the design aspects of the adaptive protection system addressing issues such as: selection of alternative setting groups, components and system architecture; system configuration and programmed logic. The system is based on a centralized controller running the real-time analysis of the data received from the field Intelligent Electronic Devices and communicating with them by means of IEC 61850 communications. The adaptive protection and microgrid control system has been developed and currently being installed at Hailuoto island in Finland.

Abstract: This paper investigates the real-time scheduling of residential appliances in the home energy management system (HEMS), including electric water heater (EWH), air conditioner (AC), clothes dryer (CD), electric vehicle (EV), photovoltaic cell (PV) and battery. A demand response (DR) mechanism is proposed to stimulate the household to participate in the DR services. The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is applied to make a trade-off between the expected costs and the risk of exposure to uncertainties of the electricity price and other factors. Fuzzy logic controller is utilized to determine the output power of the battery, and two sets of rules are designed to adjust the charging and discharging operations of the battery according to the DR request from the grid. Stochastic aspects of the electricity price, outdoor temperature, hot water usage, PV generation, and loads are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed DR mechanism can decrease the cost of the household considerably, and the proposed real-time scheduling algorithm can optimize the operation of appliances close to the ideal deterministic results, even when the gap between the forecast electricity price and the real price is large.

Abstract: To dynamically reduce voltage unbalance (VU) along low voltage distribution feeders, a distributed intelligent residential load transfer scheme is proposed. In this scheme, residential loads are transferred from one phase to another to minimize VU along the feeder. The central controller, installed at the distribution transformer, observes the power consumption in each house and determines the house(s) to be transferred from an initially connected phase to another. The transfer is carried out by the help of a static transfer switch, with a three-phase input and a single-phase output connection, through which each house is supplied. The steady-state and dynamic performances of the proposed load transfer scheme are investigated by MATLAB analyses and PSCAD/EMTDC simulations.

Abstract: Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are becoming a viable means for large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers to realize reliability improvements and service charge reductions. This paper investigates the operation and planning of customer-side-of-the-meter BESS that are simultaneously used for both purposes. For scheduling applications, a new multi-objective economic dispatch algorithm that accounts for battery cycling constraints is proposed for customers with net metering and a Time of Use (TOU) rate structure. For reliability applications, service point outage probability and outage cost models are presented to determine the economic value of standby energy capacity. Simulations are performed on a test C&I system with local generation resources using seven candidate storage systems. Service charge and outage savings solutions are combined to determine pareto-efficient partitioning of BESS energy capacity and assess the economic competitiveness of various storage technologies.

Abstract: Integrating information network into power system is the key for realizing the vision of smart grid, but also introduces many security problems. Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time, it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as "1" and the other is marked as "0." During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.

Abstract: Load control (LC) of populations of air conditioners (ACs) is considered suitable to shift energy from on-to off-peak times, and track the intermittent power output of renewable generation. From a technical and economical point of view, it is paramount to quantify the amount of energy that can be saved by implementing these LC events. This paper proposes a new causal methodology to estimate such energy savings using a Kalman filter that includes a parametric second-order model of the aggregate demand of a population of ACs. The proposed methodology relies only on readings of aggregate electrical power at the feeder level and does not require historical load data, or a control group, and hence, it can be used where other methods reported in the literature are inapplicable. The proposed estimator is evaluated on a numerical case study that embeds simulated ACs in real power and temperature data from a 70-house residential precinct.

Abstract: Active distribution grid is composed of autonomous systems which should collaborate with each other in order to operate the entire distribution grid in a secure and economic manner. This paper presents a system of systems (SoS) framework for optimally operating active distribution grids. The proposed SoS framework defines both distribution company (DISCO) and microgrids (MGs) as independent systems, and identifies the process of information exchange among them. As the DISCO and MGs are physically connected together, the operating condition of one might impact the operating point of other systems. The proposed mathematical model uses a decentralized optimization problem aimed at maximizing the benefit of each independent system. A hierarchical optimization algorithm is presented to coordinate the independent systems and to find the optimal operating point of the SoS-based active distribution grid. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed SoS framework and solution methodology.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the use of energy storage units (ESUs) to reduce the average cost of power supply. Using a dynamic programming (DP) argument, we first show that the optimal control policy for a single-battery ESU, under piecewise linear cost functions, has a threshold structure that can be expressed and stored in a very compact form. We then extend the analysis to an ESU with multiple (heterogeneous) batteries, where DP is generally impractical because of the explosion of the computational complexity with the number of batteries. We hence define a simple method to map the optimal solution of a suitable single-battery ESU into an admissible policy for the multiple-battery ESU, whose complexity grows only linearly with the number of batteries. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed approach can yield significant cost reduction in comparison with other policies, under realistic users' power requests, and with different costs functions. Furthermore, the admissible policy for the multiple-battery ESU is shown to achieve almost optimal performance under realistic assumptions on the battery parameters.

Abstract: We study decentralized plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging control, wherein the system operator (SO) sends price-based signals to a load aggregator (LA) that optimizes charging of a PEV fleet. We study a pricing scheme that conveys price and quantity information to the LA and compare it to a simpler price-only scheme. We prove that the price/quantity-based mechanism can yield a socially optimal solution. We also examine several numerical case studies to demonstrate the superior performance of the price/quantity-based scheme. The price/quantity scheme yields nearly identical PEV charging costs compared to the social optima, whereas the price-only scheme is highly sensitive to the choice of a regularization penalty term that is needed to ensure convergence. We also show that the time to compute an equilibrium with the price-only mechanism can be up to two orders of magnitude greater than with the price/quantity scheme and can involve 24 times more information exchange between the SO and LA.

Abstract: This paper presents a new two-step design approach of forward electricity markets, which is highly penetrated with intermittent energy sources, such as wind power, and Demand Response (DR) programs. First, an optimal market timeframe is determined that balances between generation forecast accuracy and customers' responding flexibility, in order to achieve a minimum system cost in forward and reserve energy markets. The timeframe obtained is used as a known parameter in the subsequent design of forward market price. End users' scheduling strategies modeled by price elasticity matrices along with current system conditions are considered in the price calculation process, during which the system cost of the forward energy market is minimized.

Abstract: The microgrid concept allows small distributed energy resources (DERs) to act in a coordinated manner to provide a necessary amount of active power and ancillary service when required. This paper proposes an approach of coordinated and integrated control of solar PV generators with the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control and battery storage control to provide voltage and frequency (V-f) support to an islanded microgrid. Also, active and nonactive/reactive power (P-Q) control with solar PV, MPPT and battery storage is proposed for the grid connected mode. The control strategies show effective coordination between inverter V-f (or P-Q) control, MPPT control, and energy storage charging and discharging control. The paper also shows an effective coordination among participating microresources while considering the case of changing irradiance and battery state of charge (SOC) constraint. The simulation studies are carried out with the IEEE 13-bus feeder test system in grid connected and islanded microgrid modes. The results clearly verify the effectiveness of proposed control methods. The simulations are carried out in Matlab and Simpowersystems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a flexible optimization method, based on state of the art algorithms, for the smart control of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to balance wind power production. The problem is approached from the perspective of a balance responsible party (BRP) with a large share of wind power in its portfolio. The BRP uses controllable PHEVs to minimize the imbalance of its portfolio resulting from wind power forecast errors. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation in combination with dynamic programming is used to solve the multistage stochastic problem. The main difficulty for applying MDPs to this problem is to efficiently include time interdependence of the wind power forecast error. In the presented approach, the probability distribution and time interdependence of the forecast error are represented by a scenario tree. Because of the MDP formulation, the algorithm is adaptable to deal with different transition models and constraints. This feature enables to use the algorithm in a dynamic environment such as the future smart grid. To demonstrate this, a generic charging model for PHEVs is used in the BRP wind balancing case. The flexibility of the algorithm is shown by investigating the solution for different degrees of complexity in the charging model.

Abstract: Cable failure process is gradual and is characterized by a series of single-phase sub-cycle incipient faults with high arc voltage. They often go undetected and eventually result in a permanent fault. The objective of this paper is to develop a robust yet practical incipient fault location algorithm taking into account the fault arc voltage. The algorithm is implemented in the time-domain and utilizes power quality monitor data to estimate the distance to the fault in terms of the line impedance. It can be applied to locate both sub-cycle as well as permanent faults. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and proved out using field data collected from utility distribution circuits. The average absolute error in locating incipient faults for three underground cable failures analyzed in this paper was found to be 7.37%, 4.69% and 3.58%, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper a new method is proposed to determine the minimum energy storage required to be installed at different locations of a low voltage (LV) grid in order to prevent the over-voltage due to high residential photovoltaic (PV) penetration. The method is based on the voltage sensitivity analysis of feasible scenarios associated with the net injected power into the grid by customers. A new concept is defined based on the remaining power curve (RPC) associated with the local generation and consumption, and the uncertainties related to PV output and load consumption are modeled in some RPCs with different occurrence probabilities without involving the time-series studies problems. The proposed method is capable of modeling output power of PV panels with different orientations as well as different electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns.

Abstract: In this paper, a hierarchical control system for parallel power electronics interfaces between ac bus and dc bus in a hybrid microgrid is presented. Both standalone and grid-connected operation modes in the dc side of the microgrid are analyzed. Concretely, a three-level hierarchical control system is implemented. In the primary control level, the decentralized control is realized by using the droop method. Local ac current proportional-resonant controller and dc voltage proportional-integral controller are employed. When the local load is connected to the dc bus, dc droop control is applied to obtain equal or proportional dc load current sharing. The common secondary control level is designed to eliminate the dc bus voltage deviation produced by the droop control, with dc bus voltage in the hybrid microgrid boosted to an acceptable range. After guaranteeing the performance of the dc side standalone operation by means of the primary and secondary control levels, the tertiary control level is thereafter employed to perform the connection to an external dc system. Meanwhile, the impact of the bandwidth of the secondary and tertiary control levels is discussed. The closed-loop model including all the three control levels is developed in order to adjust the main control parameters and study the system stability. Experimental results of a kW parallel ac-dc converter system have shown satisfactory realization of the designed system.

Abstract: Standalone operation of a wind turbine generating system under fluctuating wind and variable load conditions is a difficult task. Moreover, high reactive power demand makes it more challenging due to the limitation of reactive capability of the wind generating system. A Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system consisting of a PermanentMagnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG), a hybrid energy storage, a dump load and a mains load is considered in this paper. The hybrid energy storage consists of a battery storage and a supercapacitor where both are connected to the DC bus of the RAPS system. An energy management algorithm (EMA) is proposed for the hybrid energy storage with a view to improve the performance of the battery storage. A synchronous condenser is employed to provide reactive power and inertial support to the RAPS system. A coordinated control approach is developed to manage the active and reactive power flows among the RAPS components. In this regard, individual controllers for each RAPS component have been developed for effective management of the RAPS components. Through simulation studies carried out using detailed model in MATLAB Simulink, it has been demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of achieving: a) robust voltage and frequency regulation (in terms of their acceptable bandwidths), b) effective management of the hybrid storage system, c) reactive power capability and inertial support by the synchronous condenser, and d) maximum power extraction from wind.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new model of demand response management for the future smart grid that integrates plug-in electric vehicles and renewable distributed generators. A price scheme considering fluctuation cost is developed. We consider a market where users have the flexibility to sell back the energy generated from their distributed generators or the energy stored in their plug-in electric vehicles. A distributed optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to solve the optimization problem, in which consumers need to report their aggregated loads only to the utility company, thus ensuring their privacy. Consumers can update their loads scheduling simultaneously and locally to speed up the optimization computing. Using numerical examples, we show that the demand curve is flattened after the optimization, even though there are uncertainties in the model, thus reducing the cost paid by the utility company. The distributed algorithms are also shown to reduce the users' daily bills.

Abstract: The advancement of renewable energy technologies has seen the emergence of customer owned grid tied wind and solar microgrids. These microgrids offer an opportunity to energy users to lower their energy costs as well as enabling the power suppliers to regulate the utility grid. However, the integration of the renewable energy based sources into the smart grid increases the complexity of the main grid. The success of this scheme will be heavily reliant on accurate real-time information exchange between the microgrid, the main grid, and the consumers. The communication between these agents will be critical in implementation of intelligent decisions by the smart grid. The microgrids will be required to relay energy forecasts information to the utility grid. Similarly, customers will be expected to submit energy demand schedules, to actively monitor energy price signals, to participate in energy bids, and to respond to energy management signals in real time. This kind of grid-user interaction will be overwhelming and could result in consumer apathy. There is therefore a need to develop smart systems that will autonomously execute all these tasks without the prompting of the customers. This paper presents one such approach. In this study, we proposed a demand side energy management for a grid connected household with a locally generated photovoltaic energy. To ensure efficient household energy management, smart scheduling of electrical appliances has also been presented.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of integrating existing PHEV charging algorithms, which optimize PHEV charging per market timeslot (e.g., 15 minutes), into an environment with realistic communication conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a dual coordination mechanism, which controls a cluster of devices on two different operation levels: market operation and real-time operation. The market operation level uses an existing timeslot-based algorithm to calculate a charging schedule per timeslot. The real-time operation level translates this schedule into event-based control actions for a realistic communication environment, wherein a limited number of messages can be exchanged. A case study of 1000 PHEVs shows that it is possible to achieve results on par with the timeslot based algorithm but with significantly reduced communication with the PHEVs.

Abstract: Modeling electricity storage to address challenges and opportunities of its applications for smart grids requires inter-temporal equalities to keep track of energy content over time. Prevalently, these constraints present crucial modeling elements as to what extent energy storage applications can enhance future electric power systems' sustainability, reliability, and efficiency. This paper presents a novel and improved mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) formulation for energy storage of plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles (PEVs) for reserves in power system models. It is based on insights from the field of System Dynamics, in which complex interactions between different elements are studied by means of feedback loops as well as stocks, flows and co-flows. Generalized to a multi-bus system, this formulation includes improvements in the energy balance and surpasses shortcomings in the way existing literature deals with reserve constraints. Tested on the IEEE 14-bus system with realistic PEV mobility patterns, the deterministic results show changes in the scheduling of the units, often referred to as unit commitment (UC).

Abstract: Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are an alternative to provide flexibility in power system operation. ESS have been foreseen as crucial technologies to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon energy matrix that integrates higher level of renewable variable energy resources.
In this paper, the integration of grid-scale ESS in short term operational planning under a centralized cost-based electricity market is analyzed through an adapted stochastic unit commitment formulation to provide energy arbitrage, primary or/and secondary reserve. Several computational simulations are performed in a realistic study case to discuss techno-economic effects of ESS integration in detail. Results obtained show that value of storage is increased when ESS jointly provide different services. Additionally, ESS enable greater participation of renewables into generation mix, while reducing impacts on flexible power plants. Influence of ESS in marginal price signals is also discussed. The undertaken discussion provides insight information for agents in liberalized markets.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the electric demand response (DR) management for distributed large-scale Internet data centers (IDCs) via the stochastic optimization approach. The electric DR of IDCs refers to the capability of optimally shifting cloud service tasks among distributed IDCs. Thus, the energy consumption reduction at certain IDC locations could be considered as the DR provision capacity in day-ahead DR programs. Cloud service tasks of IDCs include processing, storage, and computing tasks, which are further categorized into interruptible and non-interruptible tasks. The proposed model determines the optimal hourly DR capabilities of individual IDCs while considering uncertain coming cloud service tasks to individual IDCs. The major contribution of this paper is to rigorously formulate the DR capability of IDCs as changes in the electricity consumption when shifting cloud service tasks among distributed IDCs in different time zones, while considering the energy consumption for providing IT service, cooling, shifting cloud service tasks, environmental impacts, and uncertain coming tasks. The proposed model would enhance the financial situation and improve the environmental impacts of distributed IDCs by participating in day-ahead DR programs. The stochastic optimization adopts scenario-based approach via the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the total electricity cost, which is the expected electricity payment minus the revenue from the DR provision. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved by state-of-the-art MILP solvers. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for solving the optimal electric DR management problem for distributed large-scale IDCs.

Abstract: Among many significant smart grid initiatives and challenges considered by many utilities and within the research community, are those associated with the energy management and conservation, in particular the management of energy demand during peak load periods. In this paper, a novel method for peak load curtailment by using a fuzzy system approach is presented. The proposed method is based on the application of fuzzy logic principles for peak load curtailment in a smart grid environment. The inputs to the system are the utility peak load data consisting of many energy demand scenarios, and the outputs are the necessary demand response power reductions required for the load curtailment during the peak load periods. The proposed method considers different peak load profiles and power consumption sources for multiple city regions. Furthermore, it is adaptable for use in many scenarios, such as those encompassing many input sources of power consumption with diverse input parameters of control (i.e., temperature offsets, duty cycle control, etc.) within numerous city regions. Thus, it can be applied to multiple output variables of control.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop optimization and control methods for a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) storage system. The storage component consists of two separate units, a large slower moving unit for energy shifting and arbitrage and a small rapid charging unit for smoothing. We use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to allow the units to automatically and dynamically adapt to changes in PV output while responding to external system operator requests or price signals. At each time step, the system is modeled using convex objectives and constraints and solved to obtain a control schedule for the storage units across the MPC horizon. For each subsequent time step, the first step of the schedule is executed before repeating the optimization process to account for changes in the operating environment and predictions due to availability of additional information. We present simulation results that demonstrate the ability of this optimization framework to respond dynamically in real time to external price signals and provide increased system benefits including smoother power output while respecting and maintaining the functional requirements of the storage units and power converters.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of stochastic dynamic programming to the optimization of charging and frequency regulation capacity bids of an electric vehicle (EV) in a smart electric grid environment. We formulate a Markov decision problem to minimize an EV's expected cost over a fixed charging horizon. We account for both Markov random prices and a Markov random regulation signal. We also propose an enhancement to the classical discrete stochastic dynamic programming method. This enhancement allows optimization over a continuous space of decision variables via linear programming at each state. Simple stochastic process models are built from real data and used to simulate the implementation of the proposed method. The proposed method is shown to outperform deterministic model predictive control in terms of average EV charging cost.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized storage strategy to support voltage control in low-voltage (LV) residential feeders with high photovoltaic (PV) capacity installed. The proposed strategy is capable of preventing overvoltage situations during high PV generation periods, by the use of locally controlled battery energy storage systems (ESS) at the PV system grid interface. The traditional way of operating a domestic ESS is based on charging the battery as soon as the PV generation exceeds the consumption, without taking into account overvoltage events during high PV generation hours; the proposed storage concept improves the traditional approach, thanks to the provision of voltage support. A novel method, based on voltage sensitivity analysis, identifies a common power threshold that triggers the ESSs activation in the feeder. A Belgian residential LV feeder is used as a case study. Time-series simulations based on 1-year load and generation profiles verify the method findings and quantify the ESS size in terms of storage power and energy level.

Abstract: Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units are one of the major resources providing demand response (DR) in residential buildings. A DR program requires a large population of units to make a significant impact on power grid services like peak shaving and balancing. This paper investigates the importance of various HVAC physical parameters and their distributions that affect the aggregate response of a population of units to DR signals. This is a key step to the construction of HVAC models with DR functionality, given insufficient data, to predict the DR capacity available for dispatch. The HVAC model parameters include the size of floors, insulation efficiency, the amount of solid mass in the house, and efficiency. These parameters are usually assumed to follow Gaussian or Uniform distributions over the population. The impact of uncertainty in parameter distributions are quantified through the following steps: 1) Simulate the response of an HVAC population during the transient phase and during steady state for a given DR signal; 2) Use a quasi-Monte Carlo sampling method with linear regression and Prony analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of the DR output to the uncertainty in the parameter distributions; and 3) Identify important parameters based on their impact to the aggregate HVAC response. Utilities or DR providers can use this analysis as guidance in the collection of data to derive an effective DR model.

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective sizing strategy for distributed battery energy storage system (BESS) in the distribution networks under high photovoltaic (PV) penetration level. The main objective of the proposed method is to optimize the size of the distributed BESS and derive the cost-benefit analysis when the distributed BESS is applied for voltage regulation and peak load shaving. In particular, a system model that includes a physical battery model and a voltage regulation and peak load shaving oriented energy management system (EMS) is developed to apply the proposed strategy. The cost-benefit analysis presented in this paper considers factors of BESS influence on the work stress of voltage regulation devices, load shifting and peaking power generation, as well as individual BESS cost with its lifetime estimation. Based on the cost-benefit analysis, the cost-benefit size can be determined for the distributed BESS.

Abstract: This paper presents a procedure for location-based forecasting of the potential vehicular charging load at off-home charging stations. A location-specific fuzzy decisionmaking system is proposed to characterize the charging behavior and determine the probability of charging by means of a three dimensional input obtained from a real-world driving dataset. The obtained charging and parking probability figures are then used in prediction of the local aggregated charging demand. The flexibility and usefulness of the developed procedure is exemplified in the case studies of two major shopping centers.

Abstract: Plug-in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (PHEV) are promising to improve energy efficiency and environment friendliness. However, without proper control, their charging will cause harmful impact on the power distribution grid, including load congestion and voltage drop. Instead of using centralized optimization which may need accurate predictions on key parameters, in this paper, a new decentralized random access framework is introduced to schedule the PHEV charging. The proposed distributed solution does not need accurate predictions and can be executed online. Simulation on a semi-urban residential medium voltage grid shows that our algorithm can effectively provide demand response to protect the distribution grid from bus congestion and voltage drop, and also improve its efficiency. Most importantly, this algorithm is simple to deploy.

Abstract: The need for high-speed multi-function protective relays in both traditional transmission systems and the new emerging paradigm of the smart grid is growing. As a widely used protective scheme for transmission lines, a distance relay's high speed and reliable operation to clear faults is essential. This paper proposes a real-time low-latency hardware digital distance protective relay on the field programmable gate array (FPGA). Taking advantage of inherent hard-wired architecture of the FPGA, the proposed hardware distance relay design is paralleled and fully pipelined to achieve low latencies in various relay modules which are developed in textual VHDL language. This low-latency feature allows fast operating and data throughput so that the relay can handle high-frequency sampled data and reach higher computational efficiency. In addition, the parallelism and hardwired architecture of the FPGA makes the design more reliable in computation than the sequential software-based numeric relay. The FPGA-based distance relay can operate on both phasor-based signals and instantaneous signals with 2.09 mu s and 0.35 mu s latency respectively based on the clock frequency of 100 MHz. The hardware relay is tested in real-time by feeding it with generated faulted current and voltage data for typical faults and the relay response recorded. The results demonstrate the speed and effectiveness of the hardware distance relay.

Abstract: In this paper, a coordinated voltage control scheme utilizing electrical energy storage (EES) is presented, for future distribution networks with large, clustered distributions of low carbon technologies (LCTs) in terms of both feeder and phase location. The benefits of the EES integrated scheme over conventional voltage control schemes are demonstrated by realizing a set of network scenarios on a case study network both in simulation and in network in the loop (NIL) emulation at a smart grid laboratory facility. The case study uses a rigorously validated model of an actual GB distribution network with multiple EES installations. It was found that the EES integrated voltage control scheme is able to provide increased capability over conventional voltage control schemes and increase the value of EES to network operation.

Abstract: A novel distributed power management scheme is proposed in this paper for a DC microgrid system, which is enabled by Solid-State transformer (SST). The proposed system includes distributed renewable energy resource (DRER) and distributed energy storage device (DESD). The proposed distributed control algorithm, which only relies on the local information and guarantees full utilization of each module in the system based on their characteristics, is applied to both SST and DC microgrid. To this end, a simulation platform is developed in MATLAB/Simulink, in which Photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell and battery are selected as the typical DRERs and DESD, respectively. Lastly, several typical case studies are carried out and the simulation results verify the proposed distributed power management.

Abstract: Today's more reliable communication technology, together with the availability of higher computational power, have paved the way for introduction of more advanced automation systems based on distributed intelligence and multi-agent technology. However, abundance of data, while making these systems more powerful, can at the same time act as their biggest vulnerability. In a web of interconnected devices and components functioning within an automation framework, potential impact of malfunction in a single device, either through internal failure or external damage/intrusion, may lead to detrimental side-effects spread across the whole underlying system. The potentially large number of devices, along with their inherent interrelations and interdependencies, may hinder the ability of human operators to interpret events, identify their scope of impact and take remedial actions if necessary. Through utilization of the concepts of graph-theoretic fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) and expert systems, this paper puts forth a solution that is able to reveal weak links and vulnerabilities of an automation system, should it become exposed to partial internal failure or external damage. A case study has been performed on the IEEE 34-bus test distribution system to show the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: The Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) Microgrid concept captures the emerging potential ofDistributed EnergyResource (DER) using an automatous plug-and-play approach. CERTS views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a "Microgrid." The sources can operate in parallel to the grid or can operate in island, providing high levels of electrical reliability. The system can disconnect from the utility during large events (i.e., faults, voltage collapses), but alsomay disconnect intentionally when the quality of power from the grid falls below certain standards. CERTS Microgrid concepts have been demonstrated at the Alameda County Santa Rita Jail in California. The existing system included a 1-MW fuel cell, 1.2 MW of solar photovoltaic, and two 1.2-MW diesel generators. Adding a 2-MW, 4-MWh storage system, a fast static switch, and a power factor correcting capacitor bank enabledmicrogrid operation. The islanding and resynchronization methods met all Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standard 1547 and the reliability requirements of the jail.

Abstract: Local PV storage systems are emerging in Germany as PV feed-in tariffs have dropped below electricity prices for households. These PV storage systems provide the opportunity to increase the local consumption of locally generated PV energy. The so called self-consumption does not imply an explicit benefit for highly PV penetrated distribution grids suffering PV related voltage rises. Hence, this paper introduces several local voltage control strategies using PV storage systems. These strategies focus on adding a voltage control capability to self-consumption strategies through a combination of voltage dependent battery charging, automatic reactive power provision as well as PV power curtailment. Their potential to smooth the grid integration of PV while increasing self-consumption is assessed through grid simulations and an economic evaluation. In conclusion, PV storage systems which are capable of voltage control can improve PV grid integration and provide a benefit to storage system owners.

Abstract: Although the unique characteristics of intermittent wind generation have been acknowledged and drastic impacts of sudden wind drops have been experienced, no effective integration approach has been developed. In this paper, without considering transmission capacity constraints for simplicity, aggregated wind generation is modeled as a discrete Markov process with state transition matrices established based on historical data. Wind generation is then integrated into system demand with multiple net demand levels at each hour. To accommodate the uncertain net demand, a stochastic unit commitment problem is formulated based on states instead of scenarios. The objective is to minimize the total commitment cost of conventional generators and their total expected dispatch cost while satisfying all possible net demand levels. The advantage of this formulation is that the state at a time instant summarizes the information of all previous instants in a probabilistic sense for reduced complexity. With state transition probabilities given, state probabilities calculated before optimization, and the objective function and constraints formulated in a linear manner, the problem is effectively solved by using branch-and-cut. Numerical testing shows that the new Markovian approach is effective and robust through the examined cases, resembling the sudden wind drop in Texas in February 2008.

Abstract: Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) communication delays and data frame losses play a critical role in designing of wide-area damping systems driven by synchrophasor technology. While there are a plethora of simulation-based studies addressing this issue, empirical results from actual PMUs deployed in the field are rare. This paper provides important insights into the characterization of PMU communication delays and data frame losses based on empirical results collected from a utility IP network. Additionally, efforts are also made to elicit design requirements considering the above PMU data quality problems. Furthermore, three distinct delay-robust wide-area damping control schemes parameterized according to the proposed requirements are validated against the empirical delays and data frame losses. Time-domain simulation results suggest that the control schemes in question can effectively stabilize the power system in all of the tested scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates modeling and control of a battery management system used in a microgrid for both grid-connected and autonomous modes. The paper has three salient contributions: 1) An aggregated battery circuit model with the open circuit voltage as a nonlinear function of the state of the charge (SOC) is derived and modeled in PSCAD. 2) Closed-loop feedback control strategies of the battery system are developed for the microgrid under both operation modes. At the grid-connected mode, power control is employed while at the autonomous mode, voltage and frequency control is employed for the battery to act as a synchronous generator by providing voltage and frequency support. 3) An upper level SOC based management system is also developed. Since SOC cannot be directly measured, an estimation scheme is derived based on power and voltage measurements from the battery. The overall management system is demonstrated to be effective by six case studies at different microgrid operation modes.

Abstract: Integration of residential-level photovoltaic (PV) power generation and energy storage systems into the smart grid will provide a better way of utilizing renewable power. With dynamic energy pricing models, consumers can use PV-based generation and controllable storage devices for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electric bill cost. The residential storage controller should possess the ability of forecasting future PV power generation as well as the power consumption profile of the household for better performance. In this paper, novel PV power generation and load power consumption prediction algorithms are presented, which are specifically designed for a residential storage controller. Furthermore, to perform effective storage control based on these predictions, the proposed storage control algorithm is separated into two tiers: the global control tier and the local control tier. The former is performed at decision epochs of a billing period (a month) to globally "plan" the future discharging/charging schemes of the storage system, whereas the latter one is performed more frequently as system operates to dynamically revise the storage control policy in response to the difference between predicted and actual power generation and consumption profiles. The global tier is formulated and solved as a convex optimization problem at each decision epoch, whereas the local tier is analytically solved. Finally, the optimal size of the energy storage module is determined so as to minimize the break-even time of the initial investment in the PV and storage systems.

Abstract: The objective of this work is to develop a mathematical model for the integration of electric vehicle (EVs) to the grid. Integrating the EV with the grid would help in simultaneous charging of numerous EVs and provide peak hour energy to the grid (from EV). This bi-directional exchange of energy between the grid and EV results in a complex financial calculations. So a simple model has been proposed. The energy provided by the EV to the grid depends on the battery capacity. Battery capacity is affected by capacity losses (CL). The model includes the possible cases of CL, such as CL due to battery usage (discharge during vehicle transportation) and CL due to the grid interaction. The main cause for a higher per kilometer (Km) transportation cost in EV, when compared to conventional vehicle, is the high cost of the battery and its maintenance. In this model, the economic analysis has been done in such a way that the battery related liabilities do not become a financial burden to EV owners. The above scenario has been evaluated for different combinations of charge rate and discharge rate ranging from to. Finally the optimal cost of electricity is determined such that the grid, EV owners, and consumers (EV users) are benefitted.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs), like electric vehicles (EVs), can offer valuable services to power systems, such as enabling renewable energy to the electricity producer and providing ancillary services to the system operator. However, these new DERs may challenge the distribution grid due to insufficient capacity in peak hours. This paper aims to coordinate the valuable services and operation constraints of three actors: the EV owner, the Fleet operator (FO) and the Distribution system operator (DSO), considering the individual EV owner's driving requirement, the charging cost of EV and thermal limits of cables and transformers in the proposed market framework. Firstly, a theoretical market framework is described. Within this framework, FOs who represent their customer's (EV owners) interests will centrally guarantee the EV owners' driving requirements and procure the energy for their vehicles with lower cost. The congestion problem will be solved by a coordination between DSO and FOs through a distribution grid capacity market scheme. Then, a mathematical formulation of the market scheme is presented. Further, some case studies are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

Abstract: The scale and complexity of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks requires careful planning for the deployment of security solutions. In particular, the large number of AMI devices and the volume and diversity of communication expected to take place on the various AMI networks make the role of intrusion detection systems (IDSes) critical. Understanding the trade-offs for a scalable and comprehensive IDS is key to investing in the right technology and deploying sensors at optimal locations. This paper reviews the benefits and costs associated with different IDS deployment options, including either centralized or distributed solution. A general cost-model framework is proposed to help utilities (AMI asset owners) make more informed decisions when selecting IDS deployment architectures and managing their security investments. We illustrate how the framework can be applied through case studies, and highlight the interesting cost/benefit trade-offs that emerge.

Abstract: Demand side management (DSM) programs are designed to encourage users to shift the use of their non-critical appliances to off-peak hours. Autonomous DSM programs have recently been proposed to achieve this goal by coordinating the users' energy consumption, using smart meters. On the other hand, this objective can be achieved only when the users actively contribute in DSM programs. Devising a fair billing mechanism is important to encourage the users to keep their contribution in the programs to achieve system optimality in the sense of minimum cost of the system. Another important issue in implementing DSM programs is protecting the users' privacy which is short addressed in DSM literature. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fairness, optimality and privacy in DSM systems. Next, we introduce a class of optimal billing mechanisms. We propose a subclass of optimal billing mechanisms which is fair in terms of distributing the energy cost across the users based on their contribution in minimizing the total cost of system. We show that fairness axioms which have been previously introduced in resource allocation algorithms are achievable in the proposed billing subclass. Next, we apply the secure sum algorithm to protect the users' privacy in implementing this billing mechanism.

Abstract: Choice of load signature or feature space is one of the most fundamental design choices for non-intrusive load monitoring or energy disaggregation problem. Electrical power quantities, harmonic load characteristics, canonical transient and steady-state waveforms are some of the typical choices of load signature or load signature basis for current research addressing appliance classification and prediction. This paper expands and evaluates appliance load signatures based on V-I trajectory-the mutual locus of instantaneous voltage and current waveforms-for precision and robustness of prediction in classification algorithms used to disaggregate residential overall energy use and predict constituent appliance profiles. We also demonstrate the use of variants of differential evolution as a novel strategy for selection of optimal load models in context of energy disaggregation. A publicly available benchmark dataset REDD is employed for evaluation purposes. Our experimental evaluations indicate that these load signatures, in conjunction with a number of popular classification algorithms, offer better or generally comparable overall precision of prediction, robustness and reliability against dynamic, noisy and highly similar load signatures with reference to electrical power quantities and harmonic content. Herein, wave-shape features are found to be an effective new basis of classification and prediction for semi-automated energy disaggregation and monitoring.

Abstract: This paper presents a FPGA (field programmable gate array)-based design of Grid Friendly Appliance (GFA) controller. A GFA controller can monitor the frequency of the power system and switch on or off the electrical appliance accordingly, to support the stability of the power system. In this paper, FPGA chip is adopted to develop GFA controller for real-time applications. The proposed method detects the power system frequency by a digital phase-locked loop (PLL), and compares the frequency with a threshold. If the frequency drops below the threshold, the GFA controller output a switching off signal to shed some load. In order to compensate the trigging response delay, a proportional-derivative (PD) predictor is designed for the controller. The proposed method is validated by the co-simulation results of Quartus II and Matlab. The hardware-based GFA controller is developed in Quartus II, and the frequency response model is developed in Matlab software, separately. The co-simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new pricing algorithm to minimize the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in aggregate load demand. The key challenge that we seek to address is the energy provider's uncertainty about the impact of prices on users' load profiles, in particular when users are equipped with automated energy consumption scheduling (ECS) devices. We use an iterative stochastic approximation approach to design two real-time pricing algorithms based on finite-difference and simultaneous perturbation methods, respectively. We also propose the use of a system simulator unit (SSU) that employs approximate dynamic programming to simulate the operation of the ECS devices and users' price-responsiveness. Simulation results show that our proposed real-time pricing algorithms reduce the PAR in aggregate load and help the users to reduce their energy expenses.

Abstract: In the near future, with more distributed generators connected and new demands arising from the electrification of heat and transport in the distribution networks, infrastructure will become ever more stressed. However, building costly new circuits to accommodate generation and demand growth is time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, active network management (ANM) has been promoted in many countries, aiming to relieve network pressure. Previous research in ANM was focused on distribution areas with significant renewable penetration, where ANM reduced network pressure through significantly enhanced generation curtailment strategies rather than adopting traditional asset investment. This paper proposes the use of electric vehicles (EVs) as responsive demand to complement network stress relief that was purely based on generation curtailment. It is achieved by allowing EVs to absorb excessive renewable generation when they cause network pressure, and it thus can provide additional measures to generation curtailment strategies. The approach is illustrated on a practical extra-high voltage distribution system. The analyses clearly demonstrate the combined management of demand and generation is superior to previous sole generation management. The combined management strategy can achieve 7.9% improvement in utilization of renewable energy, and subsequently increase the net investment profit by 566 pound k.

Abstract: As distribution networks become increasingly variable and generation becomes increasingly decentralised, voltage standards are becoming more liable to violation. Accordingly, intelligent voltage management strategies are required to enable standards compliance without unduly increasing network maintenance or infrastructure costs. The relationship between network power and voltages, however, is complex, non-linear and interdependent, and thus is difficult to conceptualise and use for decision-making and control purposes.
This paper introduces a software toolkit that simplifies the development of voltage management strategies by the application of sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis reduces complex network P-Q-vertical bar V vertical bar relationships to simple linear equations, and thus enables easy and comprehensive conceptualisation of the effect of network modifications. Sensitivity data is obtained through a unique 'perturb-and-observe' algorithm built on top of an open-source simulation package. The toolkit enables the rapid development of sensitivity-driven network experimentation and is highly extensible.
A number of applications that demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques are presented, including the development of a reactive power control algorithm for the mitigation of inverter-based, distributed generation (DG)-induced voltage rise, and the verification of voltage-support-capacitor-bank placement for a real Australian semi-rural network. Finally, this paper presents some suggestions for possible future applications of data-driven, simulator-augmented sensitivity analysis techniques.

Abstract: Demand Response Management (DRM) is a key component of the future smart grid that helps to reduce power peak load and variation. Different from most existing studies that focus on the scenario with a single utility company, this paper studies DRM with multiple utility companies. First, the interaction between utility companies and residential users is modeled as a two-level game. That is, the competition among the utility companies is formulated as a non-cooperative game, while the interaction among the residential users is formulated as an evolutionary game. Then, we prove that the proposed strategies are able to make both games converge to their own equilibrium. In addtion, the strategies for the utility companies and the residential users are implemented by distributed algorithms. Illustrative examples show that the proposed scheme is able to significantly reduce peak load and demand variation.

Abstract: The paper deals with developing and testing frequency-adaptive PMU algorithms with wider linearity range than specified in IEEE Std C37.118-1. This goal is achieved by means of three different concepts encompassing robust state-of-the-art design approaches: 1) FIR bandpass filtering, 2) extended Kalman filtering (EKF), and 3) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) demodulation with FIR low-pass smoothing. While FIR-based PMUs are linear phase with no overshoot in either phase or amplitude step responses, the adaptive EKF PMU is more computer-intensive but allows for a reduced group delay and better out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with overshoot. Frequency measurement performances of the various PMUs are assessed in detail. It turned out that FIR PMUs are best for meeting Std C37-118-1 metrics but they are outperformed by EKF under changing harmonics. Test results on three recent commercial PMU models further confirm that PMU algorithms meeting standard C37-118-1 can behave quite differently under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: An aggregated number of electric vehicles (EVs) provides a platform for smart energy storage (SES) in buildings which can be used during periods of maximum demand or high electricity price as well as for leveling the intermittent outputs of renewable energy sources (RESs). However, the vehicle to grid (V2G) capacity varies over time based on the availability of the EVs and their individual state of charge (SOC). Hence a real-time V2G capacity estimation is important for utilizing EVs as SES efficiently. In this paper, an algorithm for half-hourly V2G capacity estimation using real-time EV scheduling is proposed. The algorithm is implemented as part of the Building Energy Management System (BEMS). The BEMS uses forecasted building load demand without EVs and predicted charging profiles of the EVs connected to the building for estimating the V2G capacity. The estimated V2G capacity and the availability of RESs are considered by the BEMS to schedule the EV charging/discharging. The proposed algorithm is applied to study three case scenarios using BEMS on residential, office, and commercial buildings in Singapore. The results obtained clearly show that a group of EVs connected to any high-rise building can be effectively used as a distributed storage system.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) has traditionally targeted peak shaving for the optimal allocation of electricity consumption on a time scale that ranges from minutes to hours. However, with the availability of advanced monitoring and communication infrastructure, the potential of real-time DR for providing ancillary services to the grid has not yet been adequately explored. In this work, we propose a low-overhead decentralized DR control mechanism, henceforth called Grid Explicit Congestion Notification (GECN), intended for deployment by distribution network operators (DNOs) to provide ancillary services to the grid by a seamless control of a large population of elastic appliances. Contrary to classic DR approaches, the proposed scheme aims to continuously support the grid needs in terms of voltage control by broadcasting low-bit rate control signals on a fast time scale (i.e., every few seconds). Overall, the proposed DR mechanism is designed to i) indirectly reveal storage capabilities of end-customers and ii) have a negligible impact on the end-customer. In order to estimate the benefits of the proposed mechanism, the evaluation of the algorithm is carried out by using the IEEE 13 nodes test feeder in combination with realistic load profiles mixed with non-controllable demand and non-dispatchable generation from photovoltaic distributed generation.

Abstract: With conventional generation capacity being constrained on environmental grounds and renewable alternatives carrying capacity uncertainties, increasingly accurate forecasts of demand are likely to be required in future power systems: highly distributed renewable generation penetrating low voltage networks must be matched to small dynamic loads, while spinning reserves of conventional generation that are required to maintain security of supply, must be reduced to more efficient margins. Domestic loads, likely to form significant proportions of the loads on islanded power systems such as those in remote rural communities, are currently modeled with homogenous and coarse load profiles developed from aggregated data. An objective of AMR deployment is to clarify the nature and variability of the residential LV customer. In this paper, an algorithm for tracking the consistency of the behavior of small loads is presented. This would allow them to be assessed for their availability to provide demand services to the grid. In the method presented, significant changes in behavior are detected using Bayesian changepoint analysis which tracks a multivariate Gaussian representation of a residential load profile on a day to day basis. A hypothetical single phase feeder, representative of an islanded rural power system, is used to illustrate the detected heterogeneity of load behavior consistency.

Abstract: State estimation in electric power grid is vulnerable to false data injection attacks, and diagnosing such kind of malicious attacks has significant impacts on ensuring reliable operations for power systems. In this paper, the false data detection problem is viewed as a matrix separation problem. By noticing the intrinsic low dimensionality of temporal measurements of power grid states as well as the sparse nature of false data injection attacks, a novel false data detection mechanism is proposed based on the separation of nominal power grid states and anomalies. Two methods, the nuclear norm minimization and low rank matrix factorization, are presented to solve this problem. It is shown that proposed methods are able to identify proper power system operation states as well as detect the malicious attacks, even under the situation that collected measurement data is incomplete. Numerical simulation results both on the synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reward based demand response algorithm for residential customers to shave network peaks. Customer survey information is used to calculate various criteria indices reflecting their priority and flexibility. Criteria indices and sensitivity based house ranking is used for appropriate load selection in the feeder for demand response. Customer Rewards (CR) are paid based on load shift and voltage improvement due to load adjustment. The proposed algorithm can be deployed in residential distribution networks using a two-level hierarchical control scheme. Realistic residential load model consisting of non-controllable and controllable appliances is considered in this study. The effectiveness of the proposed demand response scheme on the annual load growth of the feeder is also investigated. Simulation results show that reduced peak demand, improved network voltage performance, and customer satisfaction can be achieved.

Abstract: Recent investigations by EPRI have focused on the application of existing technologies to reduce power system carbon footprint. Research examined the technical feasibility and potential benefits of energy storage to increase transmission capability of congested transmission networks that serve regions of the country having large renewable generation assets. The use of storage to relieve thermal constraints has not yet been explored or validated in depth. This paper summarizes the results of this research. These include a brief overview of different applications of storage, and a survey of past work by EPRI and others that investigated the application of energy storage on the transmission system. An in-depth description on the potential use of batteries storage to increase transmission capability in thermal-limited transmission paths is presented. A case study on a generic power system model illustrates the concept, with an economic analysis on benefits and costs. Conclusions and future steps are given.

Abstract: Electric power industry is experiencing a movement from the existing conventional electric grid to a more reliable, efficient and secure smart grid. In order to achieve these goals, components such as energy storage will be included, and potentially in large scale. Many feasible applications of energy storage in power systems have been investigated. The major benefits of energy storage include electric energy time-shift, frequency regulation and transmission congestion relief. In this paper, we focus on the reliability improvement of the bulk power system brought by the utilization of energy storage in the local distribution systems integrated with renewable energy generation. An intelligent operation strategy for energy storage which improves reliability considering the renewable energy integration is presented. The smart grid communication and control network is utilized to implement the proposed energy storage operation. A bulk power system reliability evaluation framework is proposed to study the reliability impact brought by the energy storage integration and operation. A detailed case study and sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented operation strategy and evaluation framework, and to provide valuable insights on the power system reliability impact derived from the energy storage integration.

Abstract: Generation connected to electrical distribution systems requires reliable and timely detection of loss-of-mains (islanding). Passive loss-of-mains detection relays typically use measurements of parameters such as frequency, phase, and the magnitudes of voltage and current. If a part of the power network becomes islanded and there is a very close match between generation and demand of both active and reactive power, there is a risk that the relay will not be able to detect the loss-of-mains (LOM) event quickly, or perhaps at all. This is the "non-detection zone"or NDZ. This paper proposes a combination of 2 generator control techniques which allow the NDZ to be avoided even when the generator has significant inertia. Firstly, the natural instability (when islanded) of a grid-connected control scheme consisting of integral and droop controls is recognized and exploited. Secondly, a simple strategy is added which makes occasional small, steady-state adjustments to the reactive power output of the generator. The scheme has been tested in the laboratory and shows that the 2 second detection time required by IEEE 1547 can be achieved, even when an exact match of active power generation and demand is initially configured, and the generator has a significant inertia.

Abstract: Microgrids are receiving attention due to the increasing need to integrate distributed generations and to ensure power quality and to provide energy surety to critical loads. Some of the main topics concerning microgrids are transients and stability concerns during transitions including intentional and unintentional islanding and reconnection. In this paper, the standard IEEE 34 bus distribution feeder is adapted and managed as a microgrid by adding distributed generations and load profiles. Supervisory power managements have been defined to manage the transitions and to minimize the transients on voltage and frequency. Detailed analyses for islanding, reconnection, and black start are presented for various conditions. The proposed control techniques accept inputs from local measurements and supervisory controls in order to manage the system voltage and frequency. An experimental system has been built which includes three 250 kW inverters emulating natural gas generator, energy storage, and renewable source. The simulation and experimental results are provided which verifies the analytical presentation of the hardware and control algorithms.

Abstract: Cyber systems play a critical role in improving the efficiency and reliability of power system operation and ensuring the system remains within safe operating margins. An adversary can inflict severe damage to the underlying physical system by compromising the control and monitoring applications facilitated by the cyber layer. Protection of critical assets from electronic threats has traditionally been done through conventional cyber security measures that involve host-based and network-based security technologies. However, it has been recognized that highly skilled attacks can bypass these security mechanisms to disrupt the smooth operation of control systems. There is a growing need for cyber-attack-resilient control techniques that look beyond traditional cyber defense mechanisms to detect highly skilled attacks. In this paper, we make the following contributions. We first demonstrate the impact of data integrity attacks on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) on power system frequency and electricity market operation. We propose a general framework to the application of attack resilient control to power systems as a composition of smart attack detection and mitigation. Finally, we develop a model-based anomaly detection and attack mitigation algorithm for AGC. We evaluate the detection capability of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm through simulation studies. Our results show that the algorithm is capable of detecting scaling and ramp attacks with low false positive and negative rates. The proposed model-based mitigation algorithm is also efficient in maintaining system frequency within acceptable limits during the attack period.

Abstract: With ever-increasing penetration of non-dispatchable intermittent generation resources in electric grids all over the world, the system operators are facing more challenges to meet the system AGC requirements which aim to maintain the target grid frequency and scheduled tie flows. The utility scale energy storage applications have been often referred to as one of the potential solutions for improving the system frequency response, especially the speed of response. A new concept relating to the use of Dynamic Available AGC (DAA) of the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is proposed in this paper and applied in conjunction with the priority and proportional AGC signal distribution strategies. Additionally, this paper proposes an independent AGC control strategy based on Area Control Error (ACE) signal distribution to further enhance the impact of the fast response capability of the BESS. The same is accomplished by means of implementing an independent Proportional Integral (PI) controller without low-order filter typically associated with the ACE signal distribution. The AGC simulation results based on generation trip and normal load variance events, as tested on the El Salvador system model, indicate significant benefits to the system AGC performance when using the concept of the DAA for the BESS and the independent AGC control strategy. The AGC simulation results also indicate that the utilization of 10 MW/3.66 MWh BESS can replace about 36 MW conventional AGC units on the tested system model without compromising on the AGC performance of the system for day-to-day variations experienced in the system load.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) has shown to be a promising tool for balancing generation and demand in the future power grid, specifically with high penetration of variable renewable generation, such as wind. This paper evaluates thermostat set-point control of aggregate electric water heaters (EWHs) for load shifting, and providing desired balancing reserve for the utility. It also assesses the economic benefits of DR for the customers through time-of-use pricing. Simulation results reveal the achievement of the economic benefits to the customers while maintaining their comfort level and providing a large percentage of desired balancing reserve at the presence of wind generation.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a stochastic model, based on queueing theory, for electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging demand. Compared to previous studies, our model can provide 1) more accurate forecasts of the load using real-time sub-metering data, along with the level of uncertainty that accompanies these forecasts; 2) a mathematical description of load, along with the level of demand flexibility that accompanies this load, at the wholesale level. This can be useful when designing demand response and dynamic pricing schemes. Our numerical experiments tune the proposed statistics on real PHEV charging data and demonstrate that the forecasting method we propose is more accurate than standard load prediction techniques.

Abstract: Demand bidding program (DBP) is recently adopted in practice by some energy operators. DBP is a risk-free demand response program targeting large energy consumers. In this paper, we consider DBP with the application in hotel energy management. For DBP, optimization problem is formulated with the objective of maximizing expected reward, which is received when the the amount of energy saving satisfies the contract. For a general distribution of energy consumption, we give a general condition for the optimal bid and outline an algorithm to find the solution without numerical integration. Furthermore, for Gaussian distribution, we derive closed-form expressions of the optimal bid and the corresponding expected reward. Regarding hotel energy, we characterize loads in the hotel and introduce several energy consumption models that capture major energy use. With the proposed models and DBP, simulation results show that DBP provides economics benefits to the hotel and encourages load scheduling. Furthermore, when only mean and variance of energy consumption are known, the validity of Gaussian approximation for computing optimal load and expected reward is also discussed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology to simulate the economic performance of hydro storage systems in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets. A detailed hydro storage system model is proposed to capture the unique characteristics of hydro storage units. A unique RT market bidding method named Tiered Bidding is proposed to represent the RT market offers of hydro storage units. In order to accurately represent the way hydro storage systems participate in the RT market, four hydro system RT bidding strategies are proposed and evaluated. The proposed methodology is applied to the Eastern Interconnection system to evaluate the economic benefits of Manitoba Hydro's market participation in MISO's RT energy and ancillary services market.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging could cause significant strain on residential distribution systems, unless technologies and incentives are created to mitigate charging during times of peak residential consumption. This paper describes and evaluates a decentralized and "packetized" approach to PEV charge management, in which PEV charging is requested and approved for time-limited periods. This method, which is adapted from approaches for bandwidth sharing in communication networks, simultaneously ensures that constraints in the distribution network are satisfied, that communication bandwidth requirements are relatively small, and that each vehicle has fair access to the available power capacity. This paper compares the performance of the packetized approach to an optimization method and a first-come, first-served (FCFS) charging scheme in a test case with a constrained 500 kVA distribution feeder and time-of-use residential electricity pricing. The results show substantial advantages for the packetized approach. The algorithm provides all vehicles with equal access to constrained resources and attains near optimal travel cost performance, with low complexity and communication requirements. The proposed method does not require that vehicles report or record driving patterns, and thus provides benefits over optimization approaches by preserving privacy and reducing computation and bandwidth requirements.

Abstract: This paper studies risk-aware day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch for electric vehicle (EV) charging, aiming to jointly optimize the EV charging cost and the risk of the load mismatch between the forecast and the actual EV loads, due to the random driving activities of EVs. It turns out that the consideration of the load mismatch risk in the objective function significantly complicates the risk-aware day-ahead scheduling problem (indeed it involves nonconvex optimization). A key step taken here is to utilize a hidden convexity structure to recast this problem as a two-stage stochastic linear program, and then solve it by using the L-shaped method. Since the computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of EVs, an estimation algorithm is developed based on importance sampling to mitigate the computational complexity. Further, a distributed risk-aware real-time dispatch algorithm is developed, in which the aggregator needs to compute only the shadow prices for each EV to optimize its own charging strategy in a distributed manner. It is shown, based on real data, that the proposed risk-aware day-ahead scheduling algorithm using importance sampling can significantly reduce the overall charging cost with a small number of samples.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a scenario where a group of investor-owned independently-operated storage units seek to offer energy and reserve in the day-ahead market and energy in the hour-ahead market. We are particularly interested in the case where a significant portion of the power generated in the grid is from wind and other intermittent renewable energy resources. In this regard, we formulate a stochastic programming framework to choose optimal energy and reserve bids for the storage units that takes into account the fluctuating nature of the market prices due to the randomness in the renewable power generation availability. We show that the formulated stochastic program can be converted to a convex optimization problem to be solved efficiently. Our simulation results also show that our design can assure profitability of the private investment on storage units. We also investigate the impact of various design parameters, such as the size and location of the storage unit on increasing the profit.

Abstract: Distributed mesh sensor networks provide cost-effective communications for deployment in various smart grid domains, such as home area networks (HAN), neighborhood area networks (NAN), and substation/plant-generation local area networks. This paper introduces a dynamically updating key distribution strategy to enhance mesh network security against cyber attack. The scheme has been applied to two security protocols known as simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) and efficient mesh security association (EMSA). Since both protocols utilize 4-way handshaking, we propose a Merkle-tree based handshaking scheme, which is capable of improving the resiliency of the network in a situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack. Finally, by developing a denial of service attack model, we can then evaluate the security of the proposed schemes against cyber attack, as well as network performance in terms of delay and overhead.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel coordinating algorithm for dispatching regulation services between slow and fast power regulating resources using a conventional power generator and a flywheel energy storage system as an example. The goal is to let the flywheel storage device follow the fast changes in the regulation signal and let the conventional generator compensate for the energy imbalance when the flywheel storage is nearly fully charged or discharged. A state-of-charge (SOC) band control algorithm is developed tomaintain the storage device SOC within a desired range. Real system regulation signals were used to test the performance of the coordinating algorithm. The simulation results show that: 1) the HRR achieves the same fast response rate as that of the storage device, 2) the up and down movements of the generator are minimized, and 3) the SOC of the storage device is maintained within the desired range most of the time. Therefore, the proposed coordinating algorithm can provide the high quality regulation service while reducing maintenance-inducing strain on conventional generators.

Abstract: EV technologies are still relatively new and under strong development. Many different designs and choices of technologies have been pursued by the automotive OEMs, battery industry and EV research centers. Although some standardized solutions are being promoted and becoming a new trend, there is an outstanding need for common platforms and sharing of knowledge and core technologies. This paper presents the development of a test platform, including three Li-ion batteries designed for EV applications and three associated bi-directional power converters, for testing impacts on different advanced loadings of EV batteries. The aim of the tests has been to study the impact of smart charging and fast charging on the power system, on the battery state of health and degradation, and to find out the limitations of the batteries for a Smart Grid. The paper outlines the advantages and disadvantages of both tests in terms of regulation of the aggregated local power, power capacity and the power exchange with the grid.

Abstract: Energy storage represents one of the key enabling technologies to facilitate an efficient system integration of intermittent renewable generation and electrified transport and heating demand. This paper presents a novel whole-systems approach to valuing the contribution of grid-scale electricity storage. This approach simultaneously optimizes investment into new generation, network and storage capacity, while minimising system operation cost, and also considering reserve and security requirements. Case studies on the system of Great Britain (GB) with high share of renewable generation demonstrate that energy storage can simultaneously bring benefits to several sectors, including generation, transmission and distribution, while supporting real-time system balancing. The analysis distinguishes between bulk and distributed storage applications, while also considering the competition against other technologies, such as flexible generation, interconnection and demand-side response.

Abstract: In addition to electric energy, ancillary services, such as operating reserves and frequency regulation service, are also traded in a competitive electricity market. With the emerging smart grid technologies and large scale integration of variables resources into the grid, the market for ancillary services is expected to grow, and thus, their prices become increasingly important. The prices of ancillary services feature different patterns and characteristics when compared to electric energy prices. The differences include lower price level, higher variability, and more frequent and extreme spikes. While electric energy prices have been broadly studied in the literature, research on features and modelling of ancillary services prices is limited. This paper investigates the application of established stochastic approaches for modelling the behavior of operating reserve and regulation prices in North American electricity markets. Such descriptive stochastic models are necessary for risk management and derivative pricing of these commodities. Mean-reverting jump-diffusion (MRJD) and Markov regime-switching (MRS) models with various specifications are analyzed. Historical prices from the Ontario and New York markets have been used for model calibration and simulation analysis. The performance of the two classes of models has been compared using various statistical measures.

Abstract: We propose an ensemble short-term wind power forecasting model that is based on our novel approaches and advanced forecasting techniques in the modern literature. The performance of our model has been verified by forecasting wind power up to 48 hours ahead at seven wind farms for one and a half years. Our model ranked fourth in the Power and Energy Society (PES) wind power forecasting competition. The forecasting model uses 52 Neural Network (NN) sub-models and five Gaussian Process (GP) sub-models in parallel. For 48 hours, the NN sub-models forecast the future wind power based on historical wind power data and forecasted wind information. In parallel, for the first five hours, five GP sub-models are used to forecast wind power using only historical wind power in order to provide accurate wind power forecasts to NN sub-models. These models provide various forecasts for the same hour, so the optimal forecast should be decided from overlapped forecasts by the decision process.

Abstract: Contingency analysis is a critical activity in the context of the power infrastructure because it provides a guide for resiliency and enables the grid to continue operating even in the case of failure. In this paper, we augment this concept by introducing SOCCA, a cyber-physical security evaluation technique to plan not only for accidental contingencies but also for malicious compromises. SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity. The results are valuable in both cyber and physical domains. From a physical perspective, SOCCA scores power system contingencies based on cyber network configuration, whereas from a cyber perspective, control network vulnerabilities are ranked according to the underlying power system topology.

Abstract: Estimating the input-output behavior of low voltage powerline channels for indoor high speed data communications requires the availability of proper wideband channel sounding tools. In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces. Some of its specific applications, namely the estimation of the time-varying transfer function of an indoor powerline channel and the evaluation of the power spectral density of the noise affecting it, are illustrated to show the potentialities of the developed equipment.

Abstract: Reactive power injection in smart grid distribution networks via distributed generators is envisioned to play a vital role in voltage/VAR support. In this paper, we integrate the three aspects of voltage/VAR support: modeling, state estimation and network control in a single framework. Firstly, we develop an input to state nonlinear dynamic model that incorporates power flow equations along with load and distributed generation (DG) forecasts. Then, considering an extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach for nonlinear state estimation, we analyze the impact of dropped packets on stability of estimation process. Finally, we apply separation principle locally around some known state estimates, to design a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) based voltage/VAR support strategy. The control problem aims to minimize the aggregate reactive power injected by DG with the following constraints: 1) voltage regulation; 2) phase imbalance correction; and 3) maximum and minimum reactive power injection by individual generators. Considering computational complexity incurred in search for the optimal solution for large scale nonlinear control problems, we propose a successive time varying linear (STVL) approximation to our voltage/VAR control problem. The control framework approach and the analytical results presented in this paper are validated by simulating a radial distribution network as an example.

Abstract: The protection of a microgrid containing inverter-based distributed generators (IBDGs) presents several problems if traditional techniques which rely on the current (fuses and overcurrent relays) are used. A possible solution to these problems is the use of a new type of the relay which takes advantage of the enhanced processing techniques and communication infrastructure, both of which are recently becoming available for power networks application. This paper proposes a new communication-based protection scheme for isolated microgrids where a data mining approach is used to identify the relay settings and parameters. A feature selection technique is implemented to help identify the most relevant electrical features required for the fault detection and to establish the best communication strategy to use between relays. The proposed approach is tested using a MATLAB simulation of a facility scale isolated microgrid embedded with IBDGs. The results show that a differential protection scheme that relies on symmetrical components is the most effective strategy for protecting microgrids with IBDGs.

Abstract: Scenarios of near future wind power are synthesized by considering the power spectral density (PSD), statistical characteristics, and the future capacity. The PSD of the wind power follows different power laws over different frequency ranges and is approximated by a piecewise function. A scaling exponent of the power law for a particular piece can be approximated by the slope of an affine function fitted to a logarithmic plot of the PSD. Each piece of the function has a different trend as the total capacity increases. Slope trends, the first PSD value, and the last PSD value are trained to forecast the PSD. Then, future wind power scenarios are synthesized from the forecasted PSD. In this process, phase angles are searched using a genetic algorithm while satisfying forecasted statistical characteristics for the given capacity. Our approach is simulated and validated for wind power for seven years in ERCOT and is used to synthesize a future wind power scenario at 10,000 MW capacity. Our approach could also be used to generate wind power scenarios at present capacity for many stochastic optimization problems in power systems.

Abstract: We address demand-side management of dispatchable loads in a residential microgrid by means of decentralized controllers deployed in each household. Controllers simultaneously optimize two possibly conflicting objectives: minimization of energy costs for the end user (considering a known, time-dependent tariff) and stabilization of the aggregate load profile (load flattening). The former objective can be optimized independently by each controller. On the other hand, the latter could benefit from a communication infrastructure that allows the controllers to explicitly exchange information and coordinate. To study how different levels of communication pervasiveness affect system performance, we developed a realistic micro-simulation environment accounting for the behavior of residents, dispatchable and non-dispatchable household loads, and the effects on the distribution network. We considered a generic model of communication among household controllers, not tied to any specific technology, and based on the partitioning of the households in a number of groups (neighborhoods). Controllers within the same neighborhood enjoy full connectivity, but cannot interact with controllers outside of their neighborhood. Through extensive simulation experiments, we observed that even communication neighborhoods constituted by as few as 3-4 households are sufficient to effectively stabilize the aggregate network load profile, with minimal bandwidth consumption. Increasing the neighborhood size leads to comparatively negligible performance improvements. We conclude that effective load flattening can be achieved with minimal requirements of communication infrastructure and transmitted information.

Abstract: This paper proposes the modeling and control of contactless based Charging Station (CS) in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) scenario. Various charging points, also called multi-point is present in a CS. The CS is a place where Electric Vehicles (EVs) of particular area will come to charge as well as to participate for the grid support. A multi-point bidirectional contactless based CS with its control structure has been modeled in this work. The smart control algorithm is developed for the CS, which has the ability to decide the power flow between EVs and grid. The control algorithm modulates the charging/discharging rates of individual EV batteries by updating the power requirement and realizes a fast and synchronized response among multiple EVs. Each charging points is designed for a maximum peak power handling capacity of 50 kW. The performance of the CS with its control system is investigated with multiple EVs of different battery ratings connected under a single power distribution node of a grid. Simulation studies show that the CS could effectively perform controlled charging/discharging based on the grid condition and EVs' batteries constraints.

Abstract: In the smart grid, the large scale wind power penetration tends to expand vastly. Nevertheless, due to the intermittent power generation from wind, this may cause a problem of large frequency fluctuation when the load-frequency control (LFC) capacity is not enough to compensate the unbalance of generation and load demand. Also, in the future transport sector, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is widely expected for driving in the customer side. Generally, the power of PHEV is charged by plugging into the home outlets as the dispersed battery energy storages. Therefore, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power control can be applied to compensate for the inadequate LFC capacity. This paper focuses on the new coordinated V2G control and conventional frequency controller for robust LFC in the smart grid with large wind farms. The battery state-of-charge (SOC) is controlled by the optimized SOC deviation control. The structure of frequency controller is a proportional integral (PI) with a single input. To enhance the robust performance and robust stability against the system uncertainties, the PI controller parameters and the SOC deviation are optimized simultaneously by the particle swarm optimization based on the fixed structure mixed H-2/H-infinity control. Simulation results show the superior robustness and control effect of the proposed coordinated controllers over the compared controllers.

Abstract: The electricity market plays a key role in realizing the economic prophecy of smart grids. Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to construct prediction intervals of MCPs with a two-stage formulation. In the first stage, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to estimate point forecasts of MCPs and model uncertainties involved. In the second stage, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the noise variance. A generalized and comprehensive evaluation framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method has been validated through comprehensive tests using real price data from Australian electricity market.

Abstract: Local electricity markets may emerge as a mechanism for managing the increasing numbers of distributed generation resources. However, in order to be successful, these markets will heavily rely on accurate forecasts of consumption and/or production from its participants. This issue has not been widely researched in the context of such markets, and it presents a clear roadblock for wide market adoption as forecasting errors result in penalty and opportunity costs. Forecasting individual demand often leads to large errors. However, these errors can be reduced through the creation of groups, however small. In the work presented here, we investigate the relationship between group size and forecast accuracy, based on Seasonal-Nave and Holt-Winters algorithms, and the effects forecasting errors have on trading in an intra-day local electricity market composed of consumers and "prosumers." Furthermore, we measure the performance of a group participating on the market, and demonstrate how it can be a mitigating strategy to enable even highly unpredictable individuals to reduce their costs, and participate more effectively in the market.

Abstract: This paper presents a single-ended traveling wave-based fault location method for a hybrid transmission line: an overhead line combined with an underground cable. Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is used to extract transient information from the measured voltages. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are utilized to identify the faulty-section and faulty-half. Bewley diagrams are observed for the traveling wave patterns and the wavelet coefficients of the aerial mode voltage are used to locate the fault. The transient simulation for different fault types and locations are obtained by ATP using frequency-dependent line and cable models. MATLAB is used to process the simulated transients and apply the proposed method. The performance of the method is tested for different fault inception angles (FIA), different fault resistances, non-linear high impedance faults (NLHIF), and non-ideal faults with satisfactory results. The impact of cable aging on the proposed method accuracy is also investigated.

Abstract: As a matter of course, the unprecedented ascending penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), mainly harvesting renewable energies (REs), is concomitant with environmentally friendly concerns. This type of energy resources are innately uncertain and bring about more uncertainties in the power system, consequently, necessitates probabilistic analyses of the system performance. Moreover, the uncertain parameters may have a considerable level of correlation to each other, in addition to their uncertainties. The two point estimation method (2PEM) is recognized as an appropriate probabilistic method in small scale or even medium scale problems. This paper develops a new methodology for probabilistic optimal power flow (P-OPF) studies for such problems by modifying the 2PEM. The original 2PEM cannot handle correlated uncertain variables but the proposed method has been equipped with this ability. In order to justify the impressiveness of the method, two case studies namely the Wood & Woollenberg 6-bus and the Mathpower 30-bus test systems are examined using the proposed method, then, the obtained results are compared against the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) results. Comparison of the results justifies the effectiveness of the method in the respected area with regards to both accuracy and execution time criteria.

Abstract: The increasing US deployment of residential advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has made hourly energy consumption data widely available. Using CA smart meter data, we investigate a household electricity segmentation methodology that uses an encoding system with a pre-processed load shape dictionary. Structured approaches using features derived from the encoded data drive five sample program and policy relevant energy lifestyle segmentation strategies. We also ensure that the methodologies developed scale to large data sets.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources and electrical vehicles (EVs) into microgrids is becoming a popular green approach. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, several incentives are given to use renewable energy sources and EVs. By using EVs as electricity storage and renewable energy sources as distributed generators (DGs), microgrids become more reliable, stable, and cost-effective. In this paper, we propose an optimal centralized scheduling method to jointly control the electricity consumption of home appliances and plug-in EVs as well as to discharge the latter ones when they have excess energy, thereby increasing the reliability and stability of microgrids and giving lower electricity prices to customers. We mathematically formulate the scheduling method as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solve it to optimality. We compare the optimal solution to that obtained from a scheduling framework, where EVs do not have discharge capabilities, decentralized charge control using game theory and to a solution obtained from a naive scheduling framework.

Abstract: The necessity of an AC or DC microgrid is governed by available micro sources and connected loads. A hybrid structure can ensure a sustainable configuration blending both the forms. In this paper, a hybrid microgrid structure for a grid connected microgrid with DC connection at back to back (B2B) converters is proposed. While a B2B connection between two AC systems could bestow a reliable, isolated and efficient coupling, an extra DC bus connection can facilitate use of the DC micro sources. The DC bus can supply the local DC loads and can also trade part of the power with the AC grids. The voltage support at the DC link (of the B2B converters) can be used for the DC bus formation. Different power management strategies with fixed power references or decentralized power distribution in AC/DC sides are proposed and validated with simulations in PSCAD.

Abstract: Determining loss minimum configuration in a distribution network is a hard discrete optimization problem involving many variables. Since more and more dispersed generators are installed on the demand side of power systems and they are reconfigured frequently, developing automatic approaches is indispensable for effectively managing a large-scale distribution network. Existing fast methods employ local updates that gradually improve the loss to solve such an optimization problem. However, they eventually get stuck at local minima, resulting in arbitrarily poor results. In contrast, this paper presents a novel optimization method that provides an error bound on the solution quality. Thus, the obtained solution quality can be evaluated in comparison to the global optimal solution. Instead of using local updates, we construct a highly compressed search space using a binary decision diagram and reduce the optimization problem to a shortest path-finding problem. Our method was shown to be not only accurate but also remarkably efficient; optimization of a large-scale model network with 468 switches was solved in three hours with 1.56% relative error bound.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the emerging smart grid is the integration of renewable energy resources (RER). The latter introduces both intermittency and uncertainty into the grid, both of which can affect the underlying energy market. An interesting concept that is being explored for mitigating the integration cost of RERs is demand response (DR). Beginning with an overall model of the major market participants with RER and DR, together with the constraints of transmission and generation, we analyze the energy market in this paper and derive conditions for existence and uniqueness of the competitive market equilibrium using standard Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) criteria. The effect of wind uncertainty on the competitive market equilibrium is then quantified. Perturbation analysis methods are used to compare the equilibria in the nominal and perturbed markets. This analysis is used to quantify the effect of RERs uncertainty and its possible mitigation using DR. Finally numerical studies are reported using an IEEE 30-bus to validate the theoretical results.

Abstract: By leveraging recent advances in atmospheric reanalysis it is possible to more fully characterize the effects of low frequency weather phenomena simultaneously affecting the native load and power output of weather-sensitive generators. To this end, this paper describes load "hindcasting"-a method of using reanalysis data to re-synthesize multiple decades of historical load data such that it represents a current and consistent load profile. When used together with coincident, reanalysis-derived records of weather-sensitive power output, load hindcasting enables a robust, long-term characterization of these resources that accounts for weather variability spanning decades. Drawing from the field of short-term load forecasting, hierarchical load hindcasting models are developed for summer weekday hours in New England using weather variables from the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Results demonstrate the efficacy of hindcasting realistic hourly loads using MERRA.

Abstract: Over the last decade, frequency-droop-based control schemes have become the preferred solution in microgrids dominated by power electronic converters. More recently, the concept of virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) has emerged as an effective method for adding virtual inertia to the power system through the control of power electronic converters. These two approaches have been developed in two separate contexts, but present strong similarities. In fact, they are equivalent under certain conditions, as demonstrated in this letter. Analysis of this equivalence provides additional physics-based insight into the tuning and operation of both types of controllers.

Abstract: Environmental issues in power systems operation lead to a rapid deployment of renewable wind generations. Wind generation is usually given the highest priority by assigning zero or negative energy bidding prices in the day-ahead power market, in order to effectively utilize available wind energy. However, when congestions occur, negative wind bidding prices would aggravate negative locational marginal prices (LMPs) in certain locations. The paper determines the proper amount of demand response (DR) load to be shifted from peak hours to off peaks under the Independent System Operator's (ISO) direct load control, for alleviating transmission congestions and enhancing the utilization of wind generation. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is to minimize the total operation cost while incorporating explicit LMP formulations and non-negative LMP requirements into the network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problem, which are derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the economic dispatch (ED) problem. Numerical case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization of electric vehicle (EV) and home energy scheduling. Our objective is to minimize the total electricity cost while considering user comfort preference. We take both household occupancy and EV travel patterns into account. The novel contributions of this paper lie in the exploitation of EVs as dynamic storage facility as well as detailed modeling of user comfort preference, thermal dynamics, EV travel, and customer occupancy patterns in a concrete optimization framework. Extensive numerical results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed design. Specifically, we show that the proposed design can achieve significant saving in electricity cost, allow more flexibility in setting the tradeoff between cost and user comfort, and enable to reduce energy demand during peak hours. We also demonstrate the benefits of applying the proposed framework to a residential community compared to optimization of individual household separately.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a novel method to evaluate Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) effects. A multistage Support Vector Regression (MSVR)-based model is proposed to estimate the load without voltage reduction during the CVR period. The first stage is to select a set of load profiles that are close to the profile under estimation by a Euclidian distance-based index; the second stage is to train the SVR prediction model using the pre-selected profiles; the third stage is to re-select the estimated profiles to minimize the impacts of estimation errors on CVR factor calculation. Compared with previous efforts to analyze the CVR outcome, this MSVR-based technique does not depend on selections of control groups or assumptions of any linear relationship between the load and its impact factors. In order to deal with the variability of CVR performances, a stochastic framework is proposed to assist utilities in selecting target feeders. The proposed method has been applied to evaluate CVR effects of practical voltage reduction tests and shown to be accurate and effective.

Abstract: In this article we describe our efforts of extending demand-side control concepts to the application in portable electronic devices, such as laptop computers, mobile phones and tablet computers. As these devices feature built-in energy storage (in the form of batteries) and the ability to run complex control routines, they are well-suited for the implementation of smart charging concepts. We developed simple hardware and software based prototypes of smart charging controllers for a laptop computer that steer the charging process depending on the frequency of the electricity grid and in case of the software implementation also based on the battery charge status. If similar techniques are incorporated into millions of devices in UK households, this can contribute significantly to the stability of the electricity grid, help to mitigate the short-term power production fluctuations from renewable energy sources and avoid the high cost of building and maintaining conventional power plants as standby reserve.

Abstract: Driven by the economical and environmental concerns, the importance of distributed generation-based microgrids is increasing. However, the presence of induction motor (IM) loads in converter-based microgrids might induce source-load admittance mismatch between the IM load and microgrid converters leading to medium-frequency instabilities, particularly in isolated microgrids. To overcome this issue, this paper presents detailed small-signal admittance models, analysis, and stabilization of a voltage-source inverter (VSI)-based microgrid with direct online IM load. The resultant source (VSI) and load (IM) admittances form a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system. Using the generalized Nyquist stability criterion, it is shown that the interactions between the lightly-damped dynamics of IMs and isolated VSI-based microgrid have significant destabilizing effect. Active compensation techniques are proposed to maintain the system stability. Time-domain simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Demand response and dynamic retail pricing of electricity are key factors in a smart grid to reduce peak loads and to increase the efficiency of the power grid. Air-conditioning and heating loads in residential buildings are major contributors to total electricity consumption. In hot climates, such as Austin, Texas, the electricity cooling load of buildings results in critical peak load during the on-peak period. Demand response (DR) is valuable to reduce both electricity loads and energy costs for end users in a residential building. This paper focuses on developing a control strategy for the HVACs to respond to real-time prices for peak load reduction. A proposed dynamic demand response controller (DDRC) changes the set-point temperature to control HVAC loads depending on electricity retail price published each 15 minutes and partially shifts some of this load away from the peak. The advantages of the proposed control strategy are that DDRC has a detailed scheduling function and compares the real-time retail price of electricity with a threshold price that customers set by their preference in order to control HVAC loads considering energy cost. In addition, a detailed single family house model is developed using OpenStudio and Energyplus considering the geometry of a residential building and geographical environment. This HVAC modeling provides simulation of a house. Comfort level is, moreover, reflected into the DDRC to minimize discomfort when DDRC changes the set-point temperature. Our proposed DDRC is implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and connected to the EnergyPlus model via building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB). The real-time retail price is based on the real-time wholesale price in the ERCOT market in Texas. The study shows that DDRC applied in residential HVAC systems could significantly reduce peak loads and electricity bills with a modest variation in thermal comfort.

Abstract: This paper presents a fault location algorithm for three-terminal multisection nonhomogeneous transmission lines using synchronized phasor measurements (synchrophasors) obtained from GPS based PMUs or digital relays with embedded PMUs or off-line data synchronization algorithms. The algorithm is extended from a two-terminal fault location technique to an algorithm for three-terminal multisection nonhomogeneous lines which combine overhead lines with underground power cables. An exclusively three-terminal faulty branch indicator/fault locator for nonhomogeneous lines is proposed, which can not only distinguish an external/internal fault but is able to locate a fault on an overhead line or an underground cable as well. The algorithm provides an exact solution for fault location estimation and excludes computational costs since neither fault type selections nor iterative operations are required. An extensive series of simulations and field evaluations have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the method. The proposed algorithm has already been implemented in Taiwan 161 kV transmission system. So far the technique yields excellent accuracy and robustness compared to existing fault location functions of digital relays in Taiwan.

Abstract: More and more cloud computing services are handled by different Internet operators in distributed Internet data centers (IDCs), which incurs massive electricity costs. Today, the power usage of data centers contributes to more than 1.5% market share of electricity consumption across the United States. Minimization of these costs benefits cloud computing operators, and attracts increasing attentions from many research groups and industrial sectors. Along with the deployment of smart grid, the electrical real-time pricing policy promotes power consumers to adaptively schedule their electricity utilization for lower operational costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to enable electrical energy buffering in batteries to predictively minimize IDC electricity costs in smart grid. Batteries are charged when electricity price is low and discharged to power servers when electricity price is high. A power management controller is used per battery to arbitrate the charging and discharging actions of the battery. The controller is designed as a MPC-based (model predictive control) controller. To this end, an MPC power minimization problem is formulated based on a discrete state-space model with states of battery power level and cost. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach based on real-life electricity prices in smart grid.

Abstract: AC power systems have to continuously balance generation and consumption in order to maintain a stable system frequency. The mismatches between the electricity generated and consumed have to be compensated by means of ancillary services, usually provided by conventional power plants. However, the recent developments in power distribution and automation will allow some of those services to be provided by distribution networks. Therefore, in this paper voltage control, at distribution substations, is used in connection with demand response (DR) for aiding system support in the Netherlands. The available capacity, which could be accessible by applying active voltage control, is evaluated and quantified as a function of supplied load over time. The DR capacity is estimated and the implications on power system imbalances are demonstrated in a case study for the Netherlands. In addition, the impact on the network losses is addressed and evaluated.

Abstract: The ability of data recovery during communicational failures is one of the significant advantages of the wide area measurement system (WAMS) with hierarchical structure. For this purpose, in addition to the proper partitioning of the WAMS, the relative location of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and phasor data concentrators (PDCs) should be selected so as to maximize the reliability of the communication network. The aim of this paper is to develop an organized method for partitioning the WAMS as well as proposing a new algorithm for the simultaneous optimal placement of PMUs and PDCs. In the proposed method, first it is assumed that PMUs are installed at all of the system buses. Then, redundant PMUs will be omitted sequentially to provide the system observability with the maximum communication reliability. The IEEE 30-, and 118-bus systems are used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. Contingencies such as PMU loss and line outage are considered in power system observability achievement. Finally, to show the applicability of proposed methods to real dimensional power systems, the IEEE 300-bus power system is also analyzed in the normal operating condition.

Abstract: Microgrid (MG) is a promising component for future smart grid (SG) deployment. The balance of supply and demand of electric energy is one of the most important requirements of MG management. In this paper, we present a novel framework for smart energy management based on the concept of quality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic usage is always guaranteed by theMG, while the quality usage is controlled based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i. e., QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual queues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm. We derive several " hard" performance bounds for the proposed algorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed electricity scheduling algorithm.

Abstract: This paper presents a phase locked loop-based approach for real-time estimation of electro-mechanical modal properties of slow-frequency oscillations in a power grid. The approach utilizes a closed-loop feedback control system to automatically adjust a locally generated signal to optimally fit the targeted signal from real-time measurements in order to obtain modal properties directly from the local signal. The paper tests the approach on a variety of datasets including simulated and real synchrophasor data. Compared to a traditional spectral analysis based approach, this new approach has better adaptability and accuracy especially when the length of a measured signal is limited, or the signal contains modes with close frequencies or has floating modal properties, which is not unusual in a power grid due to its nonlinearity. Applied to wide-area synchrophasor measurements, the new approach may help system operators monitor slow-frequency oscillations, especially inter-area modes, which is important for a smart grid to maintain angular stability under disturbances.

Abstract: Demand side management encourages the users in a smart grid to shift their electricity consumption in response to varying electricity prices. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for the demand response based on cost minimization. Each user in the system will find an optimal start time and operating mode for the appliances in response to the varying electricity prices. We model the cost function for each user and the constraints for the appliances. We then propose an approximate greedy iterative algorithm that can be employed by each user to schedule appliances. In the proposed algorithm, each user requires only the knowledge of the price of the electricity, which depends on the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. In order for the users to coordinate with each other, we introduce a penalty term in the cost function, which penalizes large changes in the scheduling between successive iterations. Numerical simulations show that our optimization method will result in lower cost for the consumers, lower generation costs for the utility companies, lower peak load, and lower load fluctuations.

Abstract: Very-short term wind power forecasting is one of the most effective ways to deal with the challenges of increased penetration of wind power into the electric grid due to its fluctuation and volatility. To improve wind power forecasting by taking advantage of each independent forecasting model, a hybrid model is proposed by means of grey relational analysis and wind speed distribution features. The weight of each independent model is estimated according to different wind speed subsection and similar wind speed frequency. The case study shows that the hybrid forecasting model has broader applications in very-short term (15-minute-ahead) wind power output forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasts of wind power generation in their probabilistic form are a necessary input to decision-making problems for reliable and economic power systems operations in a smart grid context. Thanks to the wealth of spatially distributed data, also of high temporal resolution, such forecasts may be optimized by accounting for spatio-temporal effects that are so far merely considered. The way these effects may be included in relevant models is described for the case of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to generating probabilistic forecasts. The resulting predictions are evaluated on the real-world test case of a large offshore wind farm in Denmark (Nysted, 165 MW), where a portfolio of 19 other wind farms is seen as a set of geographically distributed sensors, for lead times between 15 minutes and 8 hours. Forecast improvements are shown to mainly come from the spatio-temporal correction of the first order moments of predictive densities. The best performing approach, based on adaptive quantile regression, using spatially corrected point forecasts as input, consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark based on local information only, by 1.5%-4.6%, depending upon the lead time.

Abstract: This paper presents the analysis and novel controller design for a hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) bidirectional DC/DC converter, applicable for electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV/PHEV) energy storage system (ESS) applications, based on power of traction motor and battery current gradient. Features of voltage step-down, voltage step-up, and bi-directional power flow are integrated into a single circuit. The developed novel control strategy enables simpler dynamics compared to a standard buck converter with input filter. Experimental results show, the proposed converter topology enables good regulation capability, low EMI, lower source current ripple, ease of control, and continuous input current waveform in both buck as well as boost modes of operation.

Abstract: The improvements made to smart metering systems in terms of performance and accuracy have in many cases created a gap in the requirements for timekeeping performance. When clock errors accumulate in different metrology systems, data collected from one system cannot be compared to data collected from another system. This paper recommends the use of a common time-base for all data gathering systems, and that systems clocks are corrected with numerous minor corrections when possible rather than major corrections.

Abstract: The classical approach to long term load forecasting is often limited to the use of load and weather information occurring with monthly or annual frequency. This low resolution, infrequent data can sometimes lead to inaccurate forecasts. Load forecasters often have a hard time explaining the errors based on the limited information available through the low resolution data. The increasing usage of smart grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technologies provides the utility load forecasters with high resolution, layered information to improve the load forecasting process. In this paper, we propose a modern approach that takes advantage of hourly information to createmore accurate and defensible forecasts. The proposed approach has been deployed across many U. S. utilities, including a recent implementation at North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC), which is used as the case study in this paper. Three key elements of long term load forecasting are being modernized: predictive modeling, scenario analysis, and weather normalization. We first show the superior accuracy of the predictive models attained from hourly data, over the classical methods of forecasting using monthly or annual peak data. We then develop probabilistic forecasts through cross scenario analysis. Finally, we illustrate the concept of load normalization and normalize the load using the proposed hourly models.

Abstract: One of the important points in optimal operation of a micro-CHP based microgrids (e.g., a residential building) is to coordinate its thermal and electrical loads. Therefore, in this study, thermal load is analyzed more precisely in terms of the required hot water and desired building temperature. The microgrid is assumed to be equipped with smartmeters and controllable electrical loads. The information provided by smart meters is utilized in implementing smart control of micro-CHP, storages, and demand response programs. This study is aimed at presenting an optimal scheduling model for a microgrid considering technical and economical constraints based on temperature dependent thermal load modeling. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify and rank the impact of several uncertainties such as variations in temperature, electrical and thermal demand.

This paper reports on our experience designing, architecting, and evaluating the first survivable SCADA system-one that is able to ensure correct behavior with minimal performance degradation even during cyber attacks that compromise part of the system. We describe the challenges we faced when integrating modern intrusion-tolerant protocols with a conventional SCADA architecture and present the techniques we developed to overcome these challenges. The results illustrate that our survivable SCADA system not only functions correctly in the face of a cyber attack, but that it also processes in excess of 20 000 messages per second with a latency of less than 30 ms, making it suitable for even large-scale deployments managing thousands of remote terminal units.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of subsystems of distributed computation interconnected by computer networks that monitor and control switched physical entities interconnected by physical infrastructures. Finding a common semantic among these diverse subsystems that facilitates system synthesis, verification, and monitoring is a significant challenge of a CPS research program. Logical and temporal correctness of computational components, network timing, and frequency response are all system aspects that conspire to impede design, verification, and monitoring. Most current approaches ensure that each subsystem meets its individual specifications according to relevant metrics-stability of a physical system, safety and liveness of a cyber system, etc.-and then composes the overall system by functionality. The individual specifications are given in different semantics for each type of subsystem, and are in general equivalent to the cyber notion of correctness. This paper develops common semantics that span each aspect of a CPS through a new approach, unified invariants; unified invariants also ensure individual subsystem correctness but compose the overall system through logical truth instead of functionality. These individual invariants express and enforce system correctness common to the cyber, physical, and networking CPS subsystems and unified invariant approach ensures that the subsystems do not interfere with each others' correctness. In particular, the synthesis of switched dynamic CPSs will be unified by cyber, networking, and physical invariants rooted in the principal of Lyapunov-like functions. The goal is to make the resulting CPSs will be safe and stable at the system level, rather than just the subsystem level.

Abstract: This paper studies the technical design criteria for fast charge infrastructure, covering the mobility needs. The infrastructure supplements the residential and public slow charging infrastructure. Two models are designed. The first determines the charging demand, based on currentmobility behavior in Flanders. The second model simulates a charge infrastructure that meets the resulting fast charge demand. The energy management is performed by a rule-based control algorithm, that directs the power flows between the fast chargers, the energy storage system, the grid connection, and the photovoltaic installation. There is a clear trade-off between the size of the energy storage system and the power rating of the grid connection. Finally, the simulations indicate that 99.7% of the vehicles visiting the fast charge infrastructure can start charging within 10 minutes with a configuration limited to 5 charging spots, instead of 9 spots when drivers are not willing to wait.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the compression of waveforms obtained from measurements of power system quantities and analyze the reasons why its importance is growing with the advent of smart grid systems. While generation and transmission networks already use a considerable number of automation and measurement devices, a large number of smart monitors and meters are to be deployed in the distribution network to allow broad observability and real-time monitoring. This situation creates new requirements concerning the communication interface, computational intelligence and the ability to process data or signals and also to share information. Therefore, a considerable increase in data exchange and in storage is likely to occur. In this context, one must achieve an efficient use of channel communication bandwidth and a reduced need of storage space for power system data. Here, we review the main compression techniques devised for electric signal waveforms providing an overview of the achievements obtained in the past decades. Additionally, we envision some smart grid scenarios emphasizing open research issues regarding compression of electric signal waveforms. We expect that this paper will contribute to motivate joint research efforts between electrical power system and signal processing communities in the area of signal waveform compression.

Abstract: This paper introduces our proposed Split- and Aggregated-TCP (SA-TCP) scheme's enhanced TCP performance in a smart metering infrastructure (SMI). The scheme is based on upgrading intermediate devices (e.g., regional collectors) to aggregate TCP connections. An SA-TCP aggregator collects data packets from smart meters in a certain region over separate TCP connections, then reliably aggregates them in one TCP connection to the management server of the utility. Our proposed scheme responds better to data traffic dynamics of smart meters and makes TCP congestion control effective.
A full mathematical model of SA-TCP is provided. Validated by extensive ns-2 simulations, the model accurately and flexibly predicts the SA-TCP scheme's throughput, packet loss rate and packet delay. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem to find the optimal number of SA-TCP aggregators that ensures acceptable packet loss rate and delay.

Abstract: Energy suppliers are facing ever increasing competition, so that factors like quality and continuity of offered services must be properly taken into account. Furthermore, in the last few years, many countries are interested in renewable energies such as solar and wind. Renewable energy resources are mainly used for environmental and economic reasons such as reducing the carbon emission. It might also be used to reinforce the electric network especially during high peak periods. However, the injection of such energy resources in the low-voltage (LV) network can leads to high voltage constrains. To overcome this issue, one can motivate customers to use thermal or electric storage devices during high-production periods of PV to foster the integration of renewable energy generation into the network. In this paper, we are interested in forecasting household-level electricity demand which represents a key factor to assure the balance supply/demand in the LV network. A novel methodology able to improve short term functional time series forecasts has been introduced. An application to the Irish smartmeter data set showed the performance of the proposed methodology to forecast the intra-day household level load curves.

Abstract: In this paper a procedure to detect and isolate data attacks on power network power flow measurements is proposed. This method can be used in conjunction with available bad data detection (BDD) methods to isolate multiple bad data which are otherwise difficult to handle. The proposed procedure relies on secure measurements of bus voltage magnitudes to define a measurement residual using potentially compromised active and reactive power flow measurements on transmission lines. The proposed residual can be calculated in real-time. In addition, the component of the proposed residual on any particular line depends only locally on the component of the data attack on the same line. This makes the proposed residual well-suited for distributed data attack isolation in large-scale power networks. Furthermore, it can be shown that the proposed procedure becomes more effective when measurements from multiple time instances can be utilized. A detailed numerical case study on the IEEE 14-bus benchmark system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical wind power forecast framework, which leverages the spatio-temporal correlation in wind speed and direction data among geographically dispersed wind farms. Critical assessment of the performance of spatio-temporal wind power forecast is performed using realistic wind farm data from West Texas. It is shown that spatio-temporal wind forecast models are numerically efficient approaches to improving forecast quality. By reducing uncertainties in near-term wind power forecasts, the overall cost benefits on system dispatch can be quantified. We integrate the improved forecast with an advanced robust look-ahead dispatch framework. This integrated forecast and economic dispatch framework is tested in a modified IEEE RTS 24-bus system. Numerical simulation suggests that the overall generation cost can be reduced by up to 6% using a robust look-ahead dispatch coupled with spatio-temporal wind forecast as compared with persistent wind forecast models.

Abstract: The expected market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles has drawn much attention to the potential impact on power systems, which to a large extent depends on the number of electric vehicles on the road and the fleet's diurnal recharging load curve. We present two interactive models to jointly forecast plug-in electric vehicle sales and the diurnal recharging load curve in the U. S. between 2012 and 2020. The sales forecasting model is based on information about consumer preferences between hybrid electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, which can be extracted from historical data. The recharging load forecasting model is based on the assumption that electric vehicle users' recharging behavior will demonstrate a gradual transition from a convenience driven mode in 2012 to a cost driven mode in 2020. A case study is conducted for the Midwest ISO region. Compared to the sales forecasts from the literature, our results turn out to be less optimistic. Our recharging load forecast results also suggest that, if appropriately managed, the impact of plug-in electric vehicles on electricity load would not be overwhelming in the next decade.

Abstract: Electricity load forecasting faces rising challenges due to the advent of innovating technologies such as smart grids, electric cars and renewable energy production. For distribution network managers, a good knowledge of the future electricity consumption stands as a central point for the reliability of the network and investment strategies. In this paper, we suggest a semi-parametric approach based on generalized additive models theory to model electrical load over more than 2200 substations of the French distribution network, and this at both short and middle term horizons. These generalized additive models estimate the relationship between load and the explanatory variables: temperatures, calendar variables, etc. This methodology has been applied with good results on the French grid. In addition, we highlight the fact that the estimated functions describing the relations between demand and the driving variables are easily interpretable, and that a good temperature prediction is important.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) may soon enter the vehicle market in large numbers and change the overall fuel usage within the passenger transport sector. With increased variable consumption from EVs together with anticipated increased production from variable sources, due to renewable wind and solar power, also the balancing of the electric power system incur increased attention. This emphasizes the importance of developing models to estimate and investigate the stochasticity of personal car travel behavior and induced EV charging load. Several studies have been made in order to model the stochasticity of passenger car travel behavior but none have captured the charging behavior dependence of the type-of-trip conducted. This paper proposes a new model for plug-in-hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) utilization and recharging price sensitivity, to determine charging load profiles based on driving patterns due to the type-of-trip and corresponding charging need. This approach makes it possible to relate the type-of-trip with the consumption level, the parking location, and the charging opportunity. The proposed model is applied in a case study using Swedish car travel data. The results show the charging load impact and variation due to the stochastic PHEV type-of-trip mobility, allowing quantification of the PHEV charging impact on the system.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of the main characteristics of two power flow management (PFM) methodologies against a traditional inter-trip approach typically used by distribution network operators. The two PFM algorithms were developed, by the authors, for real-time operation with an aim to implement them in distribution networks with growing penetrations of renewable DG. The first PFM approach is modelled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), while the second is based on an optimal power flow (OPF) approach. These PFM algorithms are deployed on real substation hardware to simulate the monitoring and control of MV distribution network power flows through DG real power regulation. Multiple scenarios are presented to the closed-loop PFM test environment to demonstrate the algorithms ability of detecting and alleviating thermal overloads and recognizing when the constraint has passed. The main objective of this paper is the quantification of the resultant curtailment levels, for the two approaches, which are compared to that of a traditional inter-trip scheme for the same circuit overload duration. The results demonstrate that taking an active approach to managing power flows can significantly increase the output of DG units in a thermally constrained network.

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional control strategy for the autonomous operation of a multi-bus medium voltage (MV) microgrid under nonlinear and unbalanced load conditions. The main objective is to effectively compensate the harmonic currents of nonlinear loads using electronically-coupled distributed generation (DG) units. The proposed control strategy consists of a multi proportional resonant controller (MPRC) with adjustable resonance frequency and a harmonic impedance controller (HIC). The MPRC and HIC are, respectively, proposed to regulate the microgrid voltage and to share the harmonic currents of the nonlinear loads among the DG units. A conventional droop scheme is also employed to share the average powers of the loads between the DG units. Moreover, a virtual negative-sequence impedance control loop is augmented to the proposed control system to compensate the negative-sequence currents of the unbalanced loads. The proposed strategy minimizes the flow of harmonic and negative-sequence currents in the MV lines of the microgrid by local compensation of harmonic and negative-sequence currents of the feeders. The performance of the proposed control scheme is verified by using digital time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) charged in a manner that is optimal to the power system will tend to increase the utilization of the lowest cost power generating units on the system, which in turn encourages investment in these preferable forms of generation. Were these gains to be substantial, they could be reflected in future charging tariffs as a means of encouraging EV ownership. However, where the impact of EVs is being quantified, much of the system benefit can only be observed where generator scheduling is performed by unit-commitment based methods. By making use of a rapid, yet robust unit-commitment algorithm, in the context of a capacity expansion procedure, this paper quantifies the impact of EVs for a variety of demand and wind time-series, relative fuel costs and EV penetrations. Typically, the net-cost of EV charging increases with EV penetration and CO2 cost, and falls with increasing wind. Frequently however these relationships do not apply, where changes in an input often lead to step-changes in the optimal plant mix. The impact of EVs is thus strongly dependent on the dynamics of the underlying generation portfolio.

Abstract: Power line communications ( PLCs) have recently absorbed interest in the smart grid since they offer communication capability in an easy and simple deployment. The main role of PLC access network ( PLC-AN), which is constructed with medium and low voltage distribution networks, is to exchange control signals between substations and end users or to provide the Internet access to homes. Since a transmission signal of narrowband PLC penetrates electronic devices, a use of opportunistic routing ( OR) can be a viable option in PLC-AN design. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of OR use in PLC-AN and propose a customized OR for it, named PLC-OR, which uses static geographical information. For doing this, we formulate a bit-meter per second maximization problem and solves it in a distributed manner. Through simulations, we confirm that our proposed PLC-OR successfully reduces packet transmission time compared to the traditional sequential routing while achieving the same level of reliability in packet delivery.

Abstract: Many demand response resources are technically capable of providing ancillary services. In some cases, they can provide superior response to generators, as the curtailment of load is typically much faster than ramping thermal and hydropower plants. Analysis and quantification of demand response resources providing ancillary services is necessary to understand the resources' economic value and impact on the power system. Methodologies used to study grid integration of variable generation can be adapted to the study of demand response. In the present work, we describe and implement a methodology to construct detailed temporal and spatial representations of demand response resources and to incorporate those resources into power system models. In addition, the paper outlines ways to evaluate barriers to implementation. We demonstrate how the combination of these three analyses can be used to assess economic value of the realizable potential of demand response for ancillary services.

Abstract: We propose privacy-preserving energy management strategies for a microgrid system that consists of several cells and a central control center, with each cell composed of a local controller, a distributed renewable energy generator, and some energy consuming customers. It is assumed that the cells can cooperate by exchanging their locally generated energy and they can obtain external energy, both through the control center. The goal of energy management is to distribute the energy flow within the microgrid system to meet the energy demands of the customers and to minimize the cost of the external energy imported to the system. The problem is formulated as a linear optimization problem with privacy constraints. However, the privacy constraint, i e., the constraint that the information related to the customers' behaviors in a cell cannot be disclosed to other cells and/or the control center, makes the standard linear programming tools not directly applicable. This motivates us to develop privacy-preserving schemes for effective energy management in such systems. To this end, we develop a dual decomposition-based algorithm and a fast suboptimal algorithm to solve the energy management problem with privacy constraints in a distributed fashion. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed techniques over the traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper considers the use of sequential cluster weighted modeling (SCWM) for electric load transient recognition and energy consumption prediction that are promising for isolating the deleterious load transients from delicate renewable sources. Two computational processes co-exist in the SCWM scheme. In the training process, we propose a cluster weighted normalized least mean squares modification of the expectation maximization method to address the singular matrix inversion problem in updating the local model parameters. For the prediction process, we propose a sequential version of the CWM prediction that not only improves the real time performance of load transient recognition, but also resolves online overlapping transients. Other real time transient processing issues are also addressed. The methods are demonstrated using benchmark electric load transients.

Abstract: The vast installation of intermittent energy sources (especially wind) has distorted the normal strict pattern of the net demand (demand minus RES production), increasing the importance of real-time balancing markets, which handle efficiently imbalances between supply and demand. In this paper, the incorporation of demand response bids within a real-time balancing market is modeled. The price signal, to which the demand responds, is a price derived from the total cost incurred by increasing or decreasing power of generation units, with a pay-as-bid pricing scheme. The demand price is defined implicitly as a function of the upward and downward supply offers. The proposed balancing market clearing model is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem. All inter-zonal and intra-zonal dc transmission constraints are incorporated to the problem, thus making it a problem of interregional balancing, and nodal prices are derived from its clearing. The credits/debits to generators for providing balancing energy are balanced in zonal and system level with the debits/credits of elastic and inelastic demand entities. The proposed model can be useful for designing future real-time balancing markets, in view of the forthcoming active participation of price-responsive demand and the significant RES penetration targets set by most countries.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal control problem for the demand-side of the smart grid under time-varying prices with general structures. We assume that users are equipped with smart appliances that allow delay in satisfying demands, and one central controller that makes energy usage decisions on when and how to satisfy the scheduled demands. We formulate a dynamic programming model for the control problem. The model deals with stochastic demand arrivals and schedules the demands based on their own allowable delays, which are specified by users. However, the dynamic programming model encounters the "curses of dimensionality" and some other difficulties, thus is hard to solve. We develop a decentralization-based heuristic first, and also propose an approximation approach based on Q-learning. Finally, we conduct numerical studies on a testing problem. The simulation results show that both the Q-learning and the decentralization based heuristic approaches work well, but they have their own advantages and disadvantages under different scenarios. Lastly, we conclude the paper with some discussions on future extension directions.

Abstract: The smart grid initiative and electricity market operation drive the development known as demand-side management or controllable load. Home energy management has received increasing interest due to the significant amount of loads in the residential sector. This paper presents a hardware design of smart home energy management system (SHEMS) with the applications of communication, sensing technology, and machine learning algorithm. With the proposed design, consumers can easily achieve a real-time, price-responsive control strategy for residential home loads such as electrical water heater (EWH), heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), electrical vehicle (EV), dishwasher, washing machine, and dryer. Also, consumers may interact with suppliers or load serving entities (LSEs) to facilitate the load management at the supplier side. Further, SHEMS isdesignedwith sensors to detect human activities and then a machine learning algorithm is applied to intelligently help consumers reduce total payment on electricity without or with little consumer involvement. Finally, simulation and experiment results are presented based on an actual SHEMS prototype to verify the hardware system.

Abstract: An optimization model that incorporates demand in the paradigm of smart grids and distributed generation is formulated. The objective is to transform the demand into an active agent that helps minimizing costs incurred by a distribution company for energy purchases and capacity payments, in a cost based marginal pricing scheme, also extrapolated to market based bids. The development of a secondary market for ancillary services offered by demand is proposed, with local intelligence and distributed generation, operating in a similar way to a day ahead market. Existing resources from the demand-side are provided to allow hourly market adjustments. The demand uncertain future is modeled via preference models using discrete choice methods. Portfolios of incentives, tailored to demand needs and preferences, are built. Consumption profiles of users are identified from synthetic curves and real consumption profiles, associated to large customers. NYISO time series data are used to illustrate the mechanism operation. The optimization model may be easily integrated into any management model of a market operator or within electricity distribution and traders. The only requirement for proper incorporation is the use of two-way communications for coordinating with the customers in the smart-grid and distributed generation paradigm.

Abstract: This paper proposes an advanced distribution management system (DMS) that a) monitors each component and performs protection functions using a dynamic state estimation, b) the estimated states are transmitted to the DMS where the real time model of the entire feeder is synthesized, c) uses the real time model to perform upper level optimization (operations planning) and lower level optimization (real time control) via a hierarchical optimization procedure; and d) applies proper controls to operate the system at optimal points. The proposed approach for protection, operations planning, and real time control of the system provides the infrastructure for additional important applications. As an example, the paper presents a novel application for monitoring available reserves from all resources in the system. We propose the concept of Reserve-O-Meter that monitors in real time the available reserves from all resources (utility and customer owned).

Abstract: This paper presents a novel numerical algorithm implemented in a unique methodology for the control of smart single-phase autoreclosure and comprehensive fault analysis for overhead lines using synchronized measurement technology. The algorithm improves on existing methodologies for adaptive single-phase autoreclosure, fault location, detailed disturbance records analysis, and fault data management. It is based on line current and voltage data sampled at both line terminals and synchronized sampling of all analogue input variables is assumed in this paper. The proposed algorithm is derived in the spectral domain and based on the application of the Discrete Fourier Transform. The electrical arc as a source of higher harmonics is included in the complete fault model and represents the starting point for the development of the new algorithm. The algorithm's distinctive feature is that it can determine both the fault arc and the fault resistance. The presence or absence of an arc resistance is used to determine the nature of the fault. The algorithm can be applied to both short and long lines. The algorithm is thoroughly tested using electromagnetic transient simulations of an overhead line connected between two active networks, as well as with field data.

Abstract: In real-time energy market, Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) dispatchers meet the energy demand while respecting transmission security constraints using the least-cost security constrained economic dispatch program, called Unit Dispatch System (UDS). If the transmission violation detected by the Energy Management System (EMS) requires redispatch, system operator will transfer the transmission constraint information to UDS for resolution through a manual process. Dispatchers need to make an educated guess on constraint trends to support their manual redispatch process. However, as the number of constraints increases during peak hours, this process is more and more complicated and the system becomes less manageable. This paper intends to challenge this operational difficulty through a similarity model to reveal the constraint relations and a heuristic pattern recognition method to categorize constraints into controllable constraint groups (CCG). System operators only take care of a dominant constraint in each CCG using controllable units instead of them all. This will make system much more manageable during peak hours, therefore, will increase effectiveness and efficiency of system operations.

Abstract: We describe the class of probabilistic demand response (PDR) schemes, which are particularly suited for dynamic load management in the residential sector. Our main contribution is a new methodology for implementing and analyzing these schemes based on an operational objective function that balances the total cost of meeting demand, which includes the costs of supply generation, and spinning reserves, with the total revenue from the met demand and the gain from storage/deferment. We derive structural results for the design of PDR schemes in terms of sufficient conditions that yield a well-posed joint optimization problem for the two decision variables: the planned supply generation level and the real-time PDR signal magnitude. These results are used to evaluate the suitability of various proposed PDR schemes in single-period and multiple-period contexts. Finally, using simulations, we illustrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed methodology for a collection of thermostatically-controlled residential loads.

Abstract: It is important for both energy intensive enterprises (EIEs) and the utilities to analyze the electrical load tracking capacity of EIEs, so as to utilize resources in EIEs, and promote the participation of EIEs in Demand Response (DR) programs. An electrical load tracking problem integrating power generations self-scheduling (PGSS) and flexible load adjustment (FLA) is introduced. The relationships among PGSS, FLA, and electrical load tracking capacity are discussed. A method to decide whether a load curve can be well-tracked is presented, and reference ideas for adjusting load curve are given too. Mathematical programming models are also presented for discussing and testing the effect of electrical load tracking. The proposed methods and models are tested in numerical simulations.

Abstract: The smart grid vision is to build an intelligent power network with an unprecedented level of situational awareness and controllability over its services and infrastructure. This paper advocates statistical inference methods to robustify power monitoring tasks against the outlier effects owing to faulty readings and malicious attacks, as well as against missing data due to privacy concerns and communication errors. In this context, a novel load cleansing and imputation scheme is developed leveraging the low intrinsic-dimensionality of spatiotemporal load profiles and the sparse nature of "bad data." A robust estimator based on principal components pursuit (PCP) is adopted, which effects a twofold sparsity-promoting regularization through an l(1)-norm of the outliers, and the nuclear norm of the nominal load profiles. Upon recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to decentralized optimization, a distributed (D-) PCP algorithm is developed to carry out the imputation and cleansing tasks using networked devices comprising the so-termed advanced metering infrastructure. If D-PCP converges and a qualification inequality is satisfied, the novel distributed estimator provably attains the performance of its centralized PCP counterpart, which has access to all networkwide data. Computer simulations and tests with real load curve data corroborate the convergence and effectiveness of the novel D-PCP algorithm.

Abstract: Increase of penetration of intermittent renewable power connected to the system will increase the requirements for frequency regulation services. If these services are met by conventional plant running part-loaded, this will not only reduce the system operational efficiency but will also limit the ability of the system to accommodate renewable generation. This work quantifies the value of Dynamic Demand (DD) concept, which enables domestic refrigeration appliances to contribute to primary frequency regulation through an advanced stochastic control algorithm. The benefits of DD providing frequency response are determined for a wide range of future low-carbon generation systems, using an efficient generation scheduling model which includes scheduling of frequency regulation and reserve services. The analysis also considers the potential impact of wind generation on system inertia and primary frequency regulation. Simulations indicate that the benefits of DD increase considerably in systems with high wind penetration, making DD an attractive option for significantly improving system efficiency.

Abstract: The increasing demand coupled with expanding installation of distributed resources call for the development of smart technologies to control and optimize distribution system operations. In this paper, a distributed generation and storage optimization algorithm is proposed using pricing signals as distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP). This signal is used to optimize the day-ahead operation planning of distributed generation and energy storage. A distribution level state estimation algorithm is also designed. The main conclusion is that the proposed optimal control and state estimation will improve the energy efficiency and economic benefits in a digitally controlled distribution power system.

Abstract: This paper explores electric privacy issues that may occur along with the residential appliance demand response (DR) energy management in smartmeters. Threemetrics are introduced to quantitatively measure the spatial and/or temporal similarity of metered power profiles. The online stochastic optimization adopts the scenario-based approach viaMonte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the sum of the expected electricity payment and the weighted difference among metered power profiles for the entire day, which are measured by the three similarity metrics, in order to balance the tradeoff between the electricity payment and the electric privacy protection. In addition, batteries are employed to disguise the actual appliance power profile along with the scheduling horizon and enhance the electric privacy protection. Numerical case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for protecting the electric privacy in residential appliance DR energy management.

Abstract: This paper concerns mathematical conditions under which a system-level optimization of supply and demand scheduling can be implemented as a distributed optimization in which users and suppliers, as well as the load serving entities, are decision makers with well-defined sub-objectives. We start by defining the optimization problem of the system that includes the sub-objectives of many different players, both supply and demand entities in the system, and decompose the problem into each player's optimization problem, using Lagrange dual decomposition. A demand entity or a load serving entity's problem is further decomposed into problems of the many different end-users that the load serving entity serves. By examining the relationships between the global objectives and the local/individual objectives in these multiple layers and the optimality conditions of these decomposable problems, we define the requirements of these different objectives to converge. We propose a novel set of methods for coordinating supply and demand over different time horizons, namely day-ahead scheduling and real-time adjustment. We illustrate the ideas by simulating simple examples with different conditions and objectives of each entity in the system.

Abstract: This paper suggests a decentralized optimization of residential demand to minimize the cost to the utility company and customers while maintaining customer satisfaction. As an important feature, distribution system constraints such as equipment capacity, line flow limits, and phase balance constraints are taken into account. Due to the large amount of uncertainty in the residential demand, a two-stage pricing is considered. In the first stage, day-ahead prices as well as residential appliance scheduling are determined through interaction of the utility company and residential customers. Uncertainty of the customer demand is also considered in the day-ahead pricing. In the second stage, on the other hand, prices will be updated based on the actual residential loads. Similar to locational marginal price (LMP) in transmission system, customers on different nodes are charged with different prices. Performance of the approach is shown on a sample distribution system.

Abstract: Automatic bus transfer scheme (ABTS) is the practice of transferring a load bus to an alternate source when the normal power supply fails or is tripped thus ensuring continuity of supply. This paper comprehensively reviews existing schemes and implementations of ABTS especially for motor bus. To limit the fault levels, during certain situations, the transformers supplying a primary distribution substation can be run in split instead of parallel operation. This is because during outages if one transformer is lost, overloading of remaining transformers, if it occurs, can be managed. This paper proposes an ABTS for a primary distribution substation for a utility facing such a situation and present details of its implementation. In the proposed scheme which is enabled by digital communications, if a transformer is lost, the bus section circuit breaker (CB) will be closed automatically after the incomer CB trips. The proposed ABTS has been implemented in the bus section relay for a new 11 kV switchboard where inter-relay communication is based on the IEC 61850 suites of standard. The contribution of this paper is that it shows how to use a standard automation scheme smartly to defer network reinforcements and manage fault levels in primary distribution substation.

Abstract: We consider an aggregator managing a portfolio of ON/OFF demand-side devices. The devices are able to shift consumption in time within certain energy limitations; moreover, the devices are able to measure the system frequency and switch ON and OFF accordingly. We show how the aggregator can manage the portfolio of devices to collectively provide a primary reserve delivery in an unbundled liberalized electricity market setting under current regulations. Furthermore, we formulate a binary linear optimization problem that minimizes the aggregator's cost of providing a primary reserve delivery of a given volume, and demonstrate this method on numerical examples.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate efficient schemes for scheduling demand response (DR) in a deregulated environment. We begin with an analysis of partial schemes which are being implemented in many established markets. These schemes can be considered inefficient due to externalities that occur amongst DR beneficiaries including the transmission network company (Transco), distribution network companies (Discos), and retail electricity companies (Recos). This limitation of existing schemes motivates the development of a new concept-demand response exchange (DRX)-a separated market for trading DR fairly and flexibly across all beneficiaries. The DRX concept is realized by introducing a pool-based market clearing scheme. Extensive simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our DRX proposal.

Abstract: Demand response is increasingly important in many power systems but Transmission System Operators (TSO) require confirmation that the response is available if it is to be used effectively. Demand response may be used to minimise the amount of spinning reserve obtained from partially loaded generators. The ability of the proposed smart metering communication system in the U.K. to report the available demand response from domestic appliances was examined. This communication system expects to send all data traffic at an average rate of about 190 Mbytes per minute through a central Data Communication Company (DCC) to any actor operating in the power system. It is unlikely that this communication system will, in addition, support reporting demand response in near real-time. Using load profiles of fridges, cooking appliances and washers and dryers, the load profiles of 40 000 houses were constructed. These load profiles were used to calculate the average number of load changes in a typical house, a 11/0.4 kV transformer and a high voltage substation. Using these average numbers of load changes and the number of transformers and substations in the U.K. power system, the number of messages sent by all smart meters in the U.K. was calculated. It is shown that the wide area network proposed for the U.K. need to send an additional 162 Mbytes per minute to report demand response in near real-time. Then, a hierarchically arranged communication system that follows the hierarchy of electrical network was examined. It was assumed that aggregating units are installed at distribution transformers and substations. It is shown that by aggregating and sending only measurement changes, the number of bytes sent through the U.K. smart metering communication system per minute could be reduced from 162 M to 30 k. This has important implications as the U.K. is now finalizing the specifications for smart metering communications for about 27 million smart electricity meters that will be installed in the period 2014-2020.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new formulation for a stochastic unit commitment (UC) problem that incorporates two major and common sources of uncertainty in short-term generation scheduling, namely, unavailability of generators and load uncertainty. The objective is to minimize operating cost and expected loss of load cost subject to reliability constraints in terms of loss of load probability. The problem is first formulated as a two-stage recourse model in stochastic programming framework where generator unavailability is expressed by a discrete set of outage scenarios and system demand is set to be a nominal value in power balance equations. Then, load uncertainty is represented as a continuous random variable in loss of load probability constraint, which is approximated by a mixed-integer piecewise linear function and integrated to the second stage problem. As a result, the UC problem has a much smaller dimension as compared to the original two-stage recourse model. The proposed formulation can be solved in a timely manner even though the formulation requires some extra binary decision variables. Although loss of load probability constraint is approximated in the optimization problem, simulation results show that the optimal solutions yield desired reliability performance. Several case studies are conducted to examine the impact of reliability requirements and system uncertainties on UC decisions.

Abstract: In this paper, a comprehensive dedicated framework is set up to analyze distributed multi-generation (DMG) systems for the purpose of identifying and quantifying their potential to participate in real-time demand response (DR) programmes. At first, flexibility of DMG systems with multiple interconnected plant components is exploited to identify the optimal operational strategy in the presence of half-hourly pricing. Then, the costs and benefits of providing further real-time DR are assessed by taking into account different energy shifting strategies. The novel concept of electricity shifting potential is introduced to establish the upper limit to the possible reduction of the electricity flowing from the electrical grid to the DMG system. The maximum profitable energy shifting that can be activated in the presence of given DR incentives is established on the basis of a DR profitability map. The key point is that energy shifting can be deployed inside the local DMG system to respond to given DR signals without reducing the users' energy demand and thus without affecting their comfort level. Examples of real-time DR for a trigeneration system referring to half-hourly periods during selected Summer and Winter days are illustrated and discussed.

Abstract: Due to its salient features including real time pricing and distributed generation, the smart grid (SG) poses great challenges for energy management in the system. In this paper, we investigate optimal energy management for the SG, taking into consideration unpredictable load demands and distributed energy resources. Both delay intolerant (DI) and delay tolerant (DT) load demands are studied. We aim to optimally schedule the usage of all the energy resources in the system and minimize the long-term time averaged expected total cost of supporting all users' load demands. In particular, we first formulate an optimization problem, which turns out to be a time-coupling problem and prohibitively expensive to solve. Then, we reformulate the problem using Lyapunov optimization theory and develop a dynamic energy management scheme that can dynamically solve the problem in each time slot based on the current system state only. We are able to obtain both a lower and an upper bound on the optimal result of the original optimization problem. Furthermore, in the case of both DI and DT load demands, we show that DT load demands are guaranteed to be served within user-defined deadlines. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the developed schemes.

Abstract: Even though demand response (DR) participation has substantial benefits to the market as a whole, current DR programs suffer from a collection of market, regulatory, infrastructure and technology problems, such as lack of scalability, lack of privacy, imprecision, and nonacceptance by customers. This paper describes how a fundamentally different DR approach, based on service priority tiers for appliances and on stochastic distributed computing, can overcome these problems and be integrated with energy markets. Our approach takes advantage of inexpensive communications technology to estimate the state of home and small-business major electrical appliances and have those appliances respond to power grid state signals within a few seconds. Organizing appliances into service priority tiers allows retail customer power demand to be de-commoditized, making these DR resources a potent force for improving the efficiency of energy markets. This paper describes the proposed methodology, examines how it can be integrated into energy markets, and presents results from mathematical analysis and from simulation of 100 000 devices.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of bilevel programming for analyzing competitive situations of hierarchical decision making between an Energy Services Provider representing several microgrids (MGs)-each one comprising controllable loads and dispatchable distributed generation units-and a large central production unit. The rules of the interaction between the two entities are determined in a bilateral contract. This operation is compared to the vertically integrated operation of this system, i.e., only one entity manages both the central production unit and the distributed resources of the MG. This comparison highlights the benefits of applying a two level structure in the simulated interaction.

Abstract: In a deregulated market, wholesale energy costs and distribution investment costs contribute significantly to consumers' electricity bills. However, in a low carbon electrical power system, the two cost pressure points may not be synchronous in time and space with each other. This paper develops a novel methodology for home area energy management as a key vehicle for demand response, using electricity storage devices. The aim is to enable energy storage at consumer premises to not only take advantage of lower wholesale energy prices, but also to support low voltage (LV) distribution networks for reducing network investment. New operation strategies for domestic energy storage to facilitate demand response (DR) are developed in the paper. They have the capability to maximize the overall savings in energy costs and investment costs. In the proposed approach, the operation of home-area energy storage devices is jointly conducted by end customers and network operators. The purpose is to fight for an optimal balance between DRs to energy price and to network congestion, and thus to maximize benefits for both consumers and network operators. An intensive study is carried out to investigate the impacts of different dispatch strategies on wholesale energy costs and network investment costs. Benefit quantification methods are introduced as well to evaluate the total benefits in terms of savings in energy costs and investment costs that can be brought along by the proposed operation approach. The demonstration is carried out on two practical distribution networks with varying utilization levels for one typical calendar day and a whole year.

Abstract: Future distribution networks are undergoing radical changes, due to the high level of penetration of dispersed generation and information/communication technologies, evolving into the new concept of the Smart Grid. Dispersed generation systems, such as wind farms and photovoltaic power plants, require particular attention due to their incorporation of uncertain energy sources. Further and significant well-known uncertainties are introduced by the load demands. In this case, many new technical considerations must be addressed to take into account the impacts of these uncertainties on the planning and operation of distribution networks. This paper proposes novel Bayesian-based approaches to forecast the power production of wind and photovoltaic generators and phase load demands. These approaches are used in a probabilistic short-term steady-state analysis of a Smart Grid obtained by means of a probabilistic load flow performed using the Point Estimate Method. Numerical applications on a 30-busbar, low-voltage distribution test system with wind farms and photovoltaic power plants connected at different busbars are presented and discussed.

Abstract: This paper proposes the use of a risk measure based robust optimization bidding strategy for dispatching a wind farm in combination with energy storage. Through coordination with energy storage devices, variable wind generators can be utilized as dispatchable energy producers in the deregulated electricity market. The total profit from sale of electricity can be increased by exploiting arbitrage opportunities available due to the inter-temporal variation of electricity prices in the day ahead market. A case study is presented to show that as the forecast error in electricity price increases, the robust optimization based bidding strategy has an increasing probability of yielding better economic performance than a deterministic optimization based bidding strategy. The uncertainty set for robust optimization is selected based on the coherent risk measure conditional value at risk (CVaR). Uncertainties in electricity price forecasting and wind power forecasting are considered. The resulting robust optimization based bidding strategy is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation for different choices of uncertainty sets.

Abstract: A demand response (DR) problem is considered entailing a set of devices/subscribers, whose operating conditions are modeled using mixed-integer constraints. Device operational periods and power consumption levels are optimized in response to dynamic pricing information to balance user satisfaction and energy cost. Renewable energy resources and energy storage systems are also incorporated. Since DR becomes more effective as the number of participants grows, scalability is ensured through a parallel distributed algorithm, in which a DR coordinator and DR subscribers solve individual subproblems, guided by certain coordination signals. As the problem scales, the recovered solution becomes near-optimal. Robustness to random variations in electricity price and renewable generation is effected through robust optimization techniques. Real-time extension is also discussed. Numerical tests validate the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper brings the application of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) into demand response (DR). NILM is usually applied to identify the major loads in buildings, which is very promising in meeting the load monitoring requirements of demand response. Unlike the traditional approach of NILM in energy auditing, a new NILM system for DR is established based on a comprehensive analysis on the requirement of demand response. The new system is designed from both hardware and software aspects with a more practical load space and a more explicit measuring criteria. The ultimate goal of this paper is to pave the road for the future researchers to work in NILM for demand response.

Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of optimally scheduling a set of appliances at the end-user premises. In the context of electricity smart grids, the electric energy fee varies over time and the user may receive a reward from an energy aggregator if he/she modifies his/her consumption profile during certain time intervals. The problem is to schedule the operation of the appliances taking into account overall costs, climatic comfort level and timeliness. We devise a MILP model and a heuristic algorithm accounting for a typical household user. Several numerical simulation results are reported, showing that the problem can be efficiently solved in real-life instances.

Abstract: Conventional generation is no longer the only source of electricity, as medium and small-scale units, mostly referred to as distributed generation, are increasingly being connected to the power system. This paper introduces a planning methodology, based on AC optimal power flow, which takes a detailed account of the network sterilization effect and maximizes the net power export from the distribution network to the transmission network. It also introduces a mathematical formulation of the reactive power capabilities that are consistent with the reactive power limitations of the wind turbine generators. A comparison is made between the generation planning results, in terms of sterilization characteristics, when using the nameplate and extended reactive power capability, for both firm and non-firm (i.e., active power curtailment applies) generation. Finally, the transition from a firm to non-firm connection policy is examined.

Abstract: Operations planning in smart grids is likely to become a more complex and demanding task in the next decades. In this paper we show how to formulate the problem of planning short-term load curtailment in a dense urban area, in the presence of uncertainty in electricity demand and in the state of the distribution grid, as a stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem. We propose three rolling-horizon look-ahead policies to approximately solve the optimization problem: a deterministic one and two based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP) techniques. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the ADP-based policies yield curtailment plans that are more robust on average than the deterministic policy, but at the expense of the additional computational burden needed to calibrate the ADP-based policies. We also show how the worst case performance of the three approximation policies compares with a baseline policy where all curtailable loads are curtailed to the maximum amount possible.

Abstract: In order to reduce cost, size, weight, and volume of on board chargers in electric vehicles, it has been proposed to pursue integration for the dual usage of converters for both charging and propulsion. The solution here goes further in that it also supports the control of slow single-phase and fast three-phase charging through one and the same power electronic converter. A unified control methodology for the on-board chargers in electric vehicles is proposed. The control is distinguished in that it can perform four-quadrant operation while connected in single-phase or three-phase mode. The operation and network synchronization are automatically adjusted based on given terminal voltage and current measurements without the need for supplementary status signals. An analysis illustrates how the various measurements are processed for obtaining single-and three-phase flexibility while retaining compatibility with well-established methods of converter current mode control. The proposed control is validated via detailed simulation and demonstrated in a smart grid laboratory. The hardware implementation in the laboratory substantiates the claims of flexible single-and three-phase control.

Abstract: In this work, the focus is placed on the proof of concept of a novel control scheme for demand response. The control architecture considers a uniform representation of non-homogeneous distributed energy resources and allows the participation of virtually all system users in electricity markets. The proposed scheme captures the operational planning, the real-time operations, the verification of the energy and service provision, and the financial settlement. The research involves the experimental verification of the proposed control and communication architecture between the aggregator and a system user in a laboratory environment. Emphasis is given on the real-time operations, whereas the case study is about the domestic freezer appliance. The convergence of the demand response system under load frequency control is investigated through simulation studies and the time response is compared to that of conventional balance suppliers in The Netherlands.

Abstract: Household-based demand response is expected to play an increasing role in supporting the large scale integration of renewable energy generation in existing power systems and electricity markets. While the direct control of the consumption level of households is envisaged as a possibility, a credible alternative is that of indirect control based on price signals to be sent to these end-consumers. A methodology is described here allowing to estimate in advance the potential response of flexible end-consumers to price variations, subsequently embedded in an optimal price-signal generator. In contrast to some real-time pricing proposals in the literature, here prices are estimated and broadcast once a day for the following one, for households to optimally schedule their consumption. The price-response is modeled using stochastic finite impulse response (FIR) models. Parameters are estimated within a recursive least squares (RLS) framework using data measurable at the grid level, in an adaptive fashion. Optimal price signals are generated by embedding the FIR models within a chance-constrained optimization framework. The objective is to keep the price signal as unchanged as possible from the reference market price, whilst keeping consumption below a pre-defined acceptable level.

Abstract: Industrialized countries are increasingly committed to move towards a low carbon generating mix by increasing the penetration of renewable generation. Additionally, the development in communication technologies will allow small end-consumers and small-scale distributed energy resources (DER) to participate in electricity markets. Current electricity markets need to be tailored to incorporate these changes regarding how electricity will be generated and consumed in the future. The EcoGrid EU is a large-scale EU-funded project, which establishes the first prototype of the future European intelligent grids. In this project, small-scale DERs and small end-consumers can actively participate in a new real-time electricity market by responding to 5-min real time electricity prices. In this way, the market operator will also obtain additional balancing power to cancel out the production variation introduced by renewable electricity generation. The real-time market concept architecture for EcoGrid EU is introduced in this paper, which provides a market-based platform and information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure that extends the current electricity market to a shorter time horizon and to smaller assets.

Abstract: Electric utilities have been investigating methods to reduce peak power demand. Demand response (DR) is one such method which intends to reduce peak electricity demand. DR programs typically have limits on the number and timing of events that may be triggered for a selected group of customers. This paper presents a methodology for optimizing the scheduling of DR events for various DR programs. The proposed optimization mechanism establishes a policy that triggers DR events according to the criteria that govern the cost to the utility and based on probability distributions of exogenous information that is accessible to utilities a priori, for decision making. The policy determines a dynamic threshold for triggering events that optimizes the expected savings over the planning horizon. Case studies using real utility data show that our solutions are better than current industrial practices, and close to ex-post optimality.

Abstract: In the near future, a smart grid will accommodate customers who are prepared to invest in generation-battery systems and employ energymanagement systems in order to cut down on their electricity bills. The main objective of this paper is to determine the optimum capacity of a customer's distributed-generation system (such as a wind turbine) and battery within the framework of a smart grid. The proposed approach involves developing an electricity management system based on stochastic variables, such as wind speed, electricity rates, and load. Then, a hybrid stochastic method based on Monte Carlo simulation and particle swarm optimization is proposed to determine the optimum size of the wind generation-battery system. Several sensitivity analyses demonstrate the proper performance of the proposed method in different conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, an environmental economic dispatch problem with storage, network, and inter-temporal constraints is considered. An approach based on the simultaneous perturbation technique is proposed to deal with the equality and inequality constraints in the economic dispatch problem. The algorithm has been implemented using MATLAB and tested on a 6-bus, 5-generator system and a 140-bus, 48-generator system. The effects of cap-and-trade policies, energy storage, and transmission line flow limits in economic dispatch are discussed. The simulations reveal that the method can handle a variety of constraints with good convergence performance.

Abstract: Power grids are complex systems whose security and reliability depend on the collaboration among all the concerning entities, including peer operators, government authorities, etc. Data sharing in the manner of centralizing the data of peer operators in a common data center is highly desirable and even necessary to the collaboration and, in particular, applications such as global situational awareness in response to critical events. However, due to the concerns about privacy and security of data, the operators are reluctant to outsource their data. Hence, we propose, a mechanism that enables secure and efficient data sharing. The proposed scheme is demonstrated to achieve secure and unlinkable storage as well as fine-grained access control.

Abstract: An agent-based control system that coordinates the battery charging of electric vehicles in distribution networks is presented. The objective of the control system is to charge the electric vehicles at times of low electricity prices within distribution network technical constraints. Search techniques and neural networks are used for the decision making of the agents. The ability of the control system to work successfully when the distribution network is operated within its loading limits and when the loading limits are violated is demonstrated through experimental validation.

Abstract: This paper presents a centralized control scheme to regulate distribution network voltages in the presence of high penetration of distributed generation. The approach is inspired of Model Predictive Control in order to compensate for modeling inaccuracies and measurement noise. The control actions, calculated from a multi-step optimization, are updated and corrected by real-time measurements. The proposed controller uses a linear model to predict the behavior of the system and the optimization is solved using quadratic programming. The proposed corrective control has been tested in a 11-kV distribution network including 75 nodes and hosting 22 distributed generating units.

Abstract: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are a rapidly developing technology that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and change the way vehicles obtain power. PEV charging stations will most likely be available at home and at work, offering flexible charging options. Ideally, each vehicle will charge when electricity prices are relatively low, to minimize the cost to the consumer and maximize societal benefits. A demand response (DR) service for a fleet of PEVs could yield such charging schedules by regulating consumer electricity use during certain time periods, in order to meet an obligation to the market. We construct an automated DR mechanism for a fleet of PEVs that facilitates vehicle charging to meet the needs of the vehicles and satisfy a load scheduling obligation. Our dynamic algorithm depends only on the knowledge of driving behaviors from a previous similar day, and uses a simple adjusted pricing scheme to instantly assign feasible and satisfactory charging schedules to thousands of vehicles in a fleet as they plug-in. The charging schedules generated using our adjusted pricing scheme can ensure that a new demand peak is not created and can reduce the consumer cost by over 30% when compared to standard charging, which may also increase peak demand by 3.5%. In this paper, we present our formulation, algorithm, and results.

Abstract: The growing penetration of distributed generation (DG) and use of combined heat and power (CHP) techniques have made electrical distribution systems and water distribution systems increasingly interdependent. This paper proposes an integrated dispatch model that offers a generalized means for determining the potential accommodated DG capacity along with appropriate DG sitting for given urban electricity and water system configurations. The AC optimal power flow (ACOPF)-based system model was developed for each phase of a modified electrical distribution test feeder. A corresponding water distribution system was then designed with its mathematical model developed. A mathematical model of the CHP-based DG system was also developed to couple the electricity and water systems. Results indicate the optimal DG capacity and its optimal sitting based on urban electricity and water infrastructures. The present water network cannot support the complete recovery of the exhaust heat. The mutual impacts on operational performances of CHP-based DG units and urban energy infrastructures were also investigated.

Abstract: During the past two decades, utilities have saved tremendous capital investments in new transformers by improving utilization of existing transformers in distribution systems. Meanwhile, in these highly-utilized systems, deteriorated reliability has been observed at the end-user level. This is mainly because utilities determine transformer utilization conventionally through the N-1 approach, which only guarantees reliability at the system level but not reliability requirements of customers. This paper presents an innovative method that balances the financial interest of utilities and service quality of customers by maximizing transformers' utilization while assuring reliability at the end-user level. The proposed method's advantages are enhanced by its capability of handling customer reliability requirements of a whole distribution system and/or of designated locations with critical loads. In addition to determining the maximum utilization of transformers, the proposed method can be extensively applied to other power delivery equipment in distribution systems.

Abstract: Advancements in smart grid technologies have made it possible to apply various options and strategies for the optimization of demand response (DR) in electricity markets. DR aggregation would accumulate potential DR schedules and constraints offered by small-and medium-sized customers for the participation in wholesale electricity markets. Despite various advantages offered by the hourly DR in electricity markets, practical market tools that can optimize the economic options available to DR aggregators and market participants are not readily attainable. In this context, this paper presents an optimization framework for the DR aggregation in wholesale electricity markets. The proposed study focuses on themodeling strategies for energymarkets. In the proposed model, DRaggregators offer customers various contracts for load curtailment, load shifting, utilization of onsite generation, and energy storage systems as possible strategies for hourly load reductions. The aggregation of DR contracts is considered in the proposed price-based self-scheduling optimization model to determine optimal DR schedules for participants in day-ahead energy markets. The proposed model is examined on a sample DR aggregator and the numerical results are discussed in the paper.

Abstract: Microgrids are assumed to be established at the low voltage distribution level, where distributed energy sources, storage devices, controllable loads and electric vehicles are integrated in the system and need to be properly managed. The microgrid system is a flexible cell that can be operated connected to the main power network or autonomously, in a controlled and coordinated way. The use of storage devices in microgrids is related to the provision of some form of energy buffering during autonomous operating conditions, in order to balance load and generation. However, frequency variations and limited storage capacity might compromise microgrid autonomous operation. In order to improve microgrid resilience in the moments subsequent to islanding, this paper presents innovative functionalities to run online, which are able to manage microgrid storage considering the integration of electric vehicles and load responsiveness. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through extensive numerical simulations.

Abstract: Recent years have seen increased interest in the design and deployment of smart grid devices and control algorithms. Each of these smart communicating devices represents a potential access point for an intruder spurring research into intruder prevention and detection. However, no security measures are complete, and intruding attackers will compromise smart grid devices leading to the attacker and the system operator interacting via the grid and its control systems. The outcome of these machine-mediated human-human interactions will depend on the design of the physical and control systems mediating the interactions. If these outcomes can be predicted via simulation, they can be used as a tool for designing attack-resilient grids and control systems. However, accurate predictions require good models of not just the physical and control systems, but also of the human decision making. In this manuscript, we present an approach to develop such tools, i.e., models of the decisions of the cyber-physical intruder who is attacking the systems and the system operator who is defending it, and demonstrate its usefulness for design.

Abstract: Retailers face the problem of meeting instantaneous and variable loads using two strategies: i) purchasing electricity from the pool market, and ii) signing bilateral contracts with producers. Since pool prices are highly volatile, retailers sign bilateral contracts with generators reducing the exposure to pool prices risks. Ideally, retailers would like to match sold energy to customers with energy from bilateral contracts. However, unpredictable variations in customers' loads force retailers to buy or sell energy in the pool market. This paper analyzes and proposes, from the retailers perspective, a model to set price changes which encourage customers to shift their loads considering time-of-use tariffs. This load redistribution will produce savings for the retailers, reducing the energy bought in the pool market during periods with high prices. On the other hand, customers redistributing their loads will get savings according to the new prices. Uncertainty on pool prices and customer elasticities are accounted for via stochastic programming. Risk is properly quantified using the conditional value-at-risk measure. A case study is solved to illustrate the efficient performance of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: We present a stochastic programming model for investments in thermal generation capacity to study the impact of demand response (DR) at high wind penetration levels. The investment model combines continuous operational constraints and wind scenarios to represent the implications of wind variability and uncertainty at the operational level. DR is represented in terms of linear price-responsive demand functions. A numerical case study based on load and wind profiles of Illinois is constructed with 20 candidate generating units of various types. Numerical results show the impact of DR on both investment and operational decisions. We also propose a model in which DR provides operating reserves and discuss its impact on lowering the total capacity needed in the system. We observe that a relatively small amount of DR capacity is sufficient to enhance the system reliability. When compared to the case with no DR, a modest level of DR results in less wind curtailment and better satisfaction of reserve requirements, as well as improvements in both the social surplus and generator utilization, as measured by capacity factors.

Abstract: Energy systems experience a rise in complexity: new technologies, topologies and components, tighter links to other systems like markets and the increased usage of information technology. This leads to challenging questions that can not be answered via traditional methods. The goal of including renewable energy and clean technologies in the grid, however, requires solutions for the resulting complex problems.
This paper investigates dynamic demand response for intelligent electric vehicle charging as a use-case for detailed hybrid models that cannot be properly handled by traditional tools alone. Universal modeling languages and specialized domain-specific modeling solutions are brought together via standardized co-simulation interfaces to achieve maximal flexibility and minimal implementation efforts.
This combination of previously numerically incompatible modeling paradigms enables a detailed look into the dynamics of hybrid component models while keeping the comfort and the strength of established tools. This coupling of a Modelica-based physical simulation engine, a commercial power system simulation tool and an agent-based discrete event simulator for energy grids results in a novel co-simulation platform. This visionary concept provides the high level of detail, scope, flexibility, scalability and accuracy in simulations needed to analyze and optimize energy systems of the future.

Abstract: We develop and analyze real-time scheduling algorithms for coordinated aggregation of deferrable loads and storage. These distributed resources offer flexibility that can enable the integration of renewable generation by reducing reserve costs. We present three scheduling policies: earliest deadline first (EDF), least laxity first (LLF), and receding horizon control (RHC). We offer a novel cost metric for RHC-based scheduling that explicitly accounts for reserve costs. We study the performance of these algorithms in the metrics of reserve energy and capacity through simulation studies. We conclude that the benefits of coordinated aggregation can be realized from modest levels of both deferrable load participation and flexibility.

Abstract: This work proposes a two-step approach to minimizing radial distribution maintenance cost while ensuring that the performance of a utility is as close as possible to desired reliability benchmarks. The maintenance cost is first optimized within the required reliability level. The System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) is used as the reliability measure. If budget constraints do not allow the required maintenance, or if a component degrades beyond its expected level, then components are derated and system is reconfigured to prolong component life and raise system reliability. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate this method.

Abstract: We apply graphical exploration and regression analysis to estimate 1717 participants' relative kW responses in BC Hydro's residential TOU/CPP pilot study. We define a customer's relative kW response as the percentage change in the customer's hourly kW demand due to exposure to time-varying pricing. Compared to the control group of customers facing non-TOU rates, we find that TOU pricing yields a statistically-significant evening peak kWdecrease of 4-11%, after controlling for the effects of day of the week, month of the year, weather, customer location, and customer size. CPP produces an additional peak kW reduction of about 9%, which can be further increased to about 33% through remotely-activated load control of space and water heaters. Hence, a scheme of TOU pricing augmented with CPP and load control on system peak days can be a highly effective demand-response strategy for winter-peaking utilities.

Abstract: The problem of modeling and stochastic optimization for home energy management is considered. Several different types of load classes are discussed, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning unit, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and deferrable loads such as washer and dryer. A first-order thermal dynamic model is extracted and validated using real measurements collected over an eight months time span. A mixed integer multi-time scale stochastic optimization is formulated for the scheduling of loads of different characteristics. A model predictive control based heuristic is proposed. Numerical simulations coupled with real data measurements are used for performance evaluation and comparison studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic parameter selection process to optimize the performance of a centralized load controller designed to provide intra-hour load balancing services using thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs). An optimal set of control parameters for the controller are selected by exhaustive simulations of control variables such as the sampling time of the forecaster, the magnitude of the load balancing signal, and the temperature deadband. The effects of TCA lock-off times, ambient temperatures, heat gains, and two-way communication delays on the controller design are also modeled. Customer comfort, device life cycles, and control errors are used as metrics to evaluate the performance. The results demonstrate that the optimized controller offers satisfactory performance considering all the operational uncertainties.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal energy delivery problem from viewpoints of both the vehicle owner and aggregator, in load shaving services of a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. We formulate the optimization problem based on a general plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) model, taking into account the randomness in vehicle mobility, time-of-use electricity pricing, and realistic battery modeling. Stochastic inventory theory is applied to analyze the problem. We mathematically prove that a state-dependent (S, S') policy is optimal for the daily energy cost minimization of each vehicle, and develop an estimation algorithm to calculate the parameters of the optimal policy for practical applications. Furthermore, we investigate the multi-vehicle aggregator design problem by considering the power system constraints. A policy adjustment scheme is proposed to adjust the values of S and S' with respect to the optimal policy adopted by each PHEV, such that the aggregated recharging and discharging power constraints of the power system can be satisfied, while minimizing the incremental cost (or revenue loss) of PHEV owners. Based on characteristics of the state-dependent (S, S') policy and our proposed policy adjustment scheme, the optimal aggregator operation problem is transformed into a convex optimization one which can be readily solved by existing algorithms. The performance of our proposed schemes is evaluated via simulations based on real data collected from Canadian utilities, households, and commuters.

Abstract: This work presents a stochastic optimization framework for operations and planning of an electricity network as managed by an Independent System Operator. The objective is to maximize the total expected net benefits over the planning horizon, incorporating the costs and benefits of electricity consumption, generation, ancillary services, load-shedding, storage and load-shifting. The overall framework could be characterized as a secure, stochastic, combined unit commitment and AC optimal power flow problem, solving for an optimal state-dependent schedule over a pre-specified time horizon. Uncertainty is modeled to expose the scenarios that are critical for maintaining system security, while properly representing the stochastic cost. The optimal amount of locational reserves needed to cover a credible set of contingencies in each time period is determined, as well as load-following reserves required for ramping between time periods. The models for centrally-dispatched storage and time-flexible demands allow for optimal tradeoffs between arbitraging across time, mitigating uncertainty and covering contingencies. This paper details the proposed problem formulation and outlines potential approaches to solving it. An implementation based on a DC power flow model solves systems of modest size and can be used to demonstrate the value of the proposed stochastic framework.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to reduce the required amounts of ancillary services, by limiting ramp rates of wind power through control of a storage system. Storage operation policies to limit the ramp rate of net production (wind + storage output) are optimized in a two-stage stochastic linear program with fixed recourse. Operation policies decide the storage operation based on the probability density function of one step ahead wind power, which is forecasted by a Gaussian process. In this optimization problem, it is assumed that a financial penalty is incurred when violating the ramp rate limit (RRL), and that the penalty is linearly proportional to the number of MW per period above or below the RRLs. The L-shaped method is used to reduce the number of constraints caused by various wind power scenarios. Then, the storage specification is determined based on minimizing the sum of the penalty costs and the investment costs of the storage system. The ultimate goal of this paper is to find the relationship between the financial penalties and the RRL.

Abstract: Time-of-use (ToU) electricity tariffs are currently employed or considered for implementation in many jurisdictions around the world. In ToU modalities, a set of different tariffs for different hours of the day and/or seasons of the year is defined at the beginning of a given horizon, and then kept constant until its end. While designing ToU tariffs, one of the most significant sources of uncertainty to be considered relates to price-elasticities of demand. We propose an approach for ToU tariff design based in quadratically constrained quadratic programming and stochastic optimization techniques, addressing these uncertainties and dealing with various aspects of tariff design from the point of view of the regulator/regulated utility.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with large-scale integration of demand response (DR) from small loads such as residential smart appliances into modern electricity systems. These appliances have intertemporal consumption constraints, while the satisfaction of the end-user from operating them is captured through utility functions. Incorporation of the appliance scheduling flexibility and user satisfaction in the system optimization points to maximizing the social welfare. In order to solve the resultant very large optimization problem with manageable complexity, dual decomposition is pursued. The problem decouples into separate subproblems for the market operator and each aggregator. Each aggregator addresses its local optimization aided by the end-users' smart meters. The subproblems are coordinated with carefully designed information exchanges between the market operator and the aggregators so that user privacy is preserved. Numerical tests illustrate the benefits of large-scale DR incorporation.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the decentralized optimal control algorithm for distribution management system by considering distribution network as coupled microgrids. Based on the autonomous control model of each single microgrid, coordinated information and strategies among different microgrids are used to decrease the operating cost of distributed generation, improve the efficiency of the distributed storages utilization, and reduce the complexity of distribution network operation. The optimal control problem of microgrids is modeled as a decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP), and a coordinated dynamic programming algorithm is used to solve the problem by introducing a look-head dual multiplier mechanism as decentralized control signals from centralized information. The performances of this algorithm and the impacts of different coordinated information are discussed by some study cases in the end of this paper.

Abstract: This paper presents a new class of false data injection attacks on state estimation, which may lead to financial arbitrage in real-time power markets with an emerging look-ahead dispatch model. In comparison with prior work of cyber attack on static dispatch where no inter-temporal ramping constraint is considered, we propose a novel attack strategy with which the attacker can manipulate, in look-ahead dispatch, the limits of ramp constraints of generators. It is demonstrated that the proposed attack may lead to financial profits via malicious capacity withholding of selected generators, while being undetected by the existing bad data detection algorithm embedded in the state estimator. The feasibility of such cyber attacks and their economic impact on real-time electricity market operations are illustrated in the IEEE 14-bus system.

Abstract: Voltage and frequency of microgrids (MGs) are strongly impressionable from the active and reactive load fluctuations. Often, there are several voltage source inverters (VSIs) based distributed generations (DGs) with a specific local droop characteristic for each DG in a MG. A load change in a MG may lead to imbalance between generation and consumption and it changes the output voltage and frequency of the VSIs according to the droop characteristics. If the load change is adequately large, the DGs may be unable to stabilize the MG. In the present paper, following a brief survey on the conventional voltage/frequency droop control, a generalized droop control (GDC) scheme for a wide range of load change scenarios is developed. Then to remove its dependency to the line parameters and to propose a model-free based GDC, a new framework based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed. It is shown that the proposed intelligent control structure carefully tracks the GDC dynamic behavior, and exhibits high performance and desirable response for different load change scenarios. It is also shown that the ANFIS controller can be effectively used instead of the GDC. The proposed methodology is examined on several MG test systems.

Abstract: Energy storage is needed in micro-grid to help solve the problem of intermittency introduced by renewable energy sources, enhance power quality and improve controllability of power flow. This paper presents an energy manager for energy storage system (ESS) in micro-grids. The objectives of the energy manager are focused on improving the energy efficiency and extending the life expectancy of ESS while ensuring constraints of energy storage modules are complied with. To this end a smart local prediction and local scheduling algorithm is proposed. A battery lifetime model that uses the proposed Peukert lifetime energy throughput based on the workload of the battery is developed. Verification shows that in the long run, the energy manger can improve overall energy efficiency of ESS from 74.1% to 85.5%, and improve estimated lifetime of 2 Battery Packs in ESS from 3.6 years and 2.4 years to 5 years and 5.7 years respectively.

Abstract: Microgrids that integrate renewable power sources are suitable for rural communities or certain military applications such as forward operation bases. For microgrids that are not connected to the large electric grid, new control strategies must be designed to maintain proper grid voltage and frequency. In addition, microgrids with distributed power sources and load nodes may have frequent reconfiguration in grid architecture. Therefore, the control strategies ideally should be "plug-and-play", i.e., they should not require significant communication or architecture information, and they should work reliably as long as the supply/demand powers are reasonably balanced. Another unique issue of microgrids is the high resistance loss in distribution lines due to the low operating voltage. To reduce power losses, appropriate voltage control at distributed nodes is required which again must work in a plug-and-play fashion. In this paper, we propose a decentralized voltage control algorithm that minimizes power losses for microgrids. Its optimality and plug-and-play nature are demonstrated through comprehensive simulations.

Abstract: Analysis of voltage regulation impacts on distribution circuits due to electric vehicle (EV) battery loads requires accurate representation of the charging system. An EV charger consists of power electronic switches with PWM control to achieve desired charging characteristics while minimizing harmonic injections to the secondary service entrance. A detailed device-level model is accurate but it requires a significant amount of time to run due to the high switching frequency of the converter. For this reason, a novel and generic model of EV battery chargers is proposed and developed for evaluating distribution voltage regulation issues. The proposed model is developed based on the average-value modeling (AVM) approach. It includes a rectifier circuit along with PWM control, boost converter and battery banks. Average dynamics of the switching circuit are obtained by averaging the effects of fast switching in the device that occur within a prototypical switching interval. The proposed AVM is validated against a switching model and the actual measurements taken at an EV charging facility and is found to be very accurate in approximating EV charger behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, the coordinated charging control problem for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with vehicle-to-grid functionality is formulated and investigated at the residential transformer level. A two-stage charging control (TSCC) strategy is proposed to shift the transformer load while achieving good charging performance for all PEVs connected to the grid. The proposed TSCC consists of an aggregator optimizer and a power distributor designed in two stages with different control functions. During the first stage, based on the dynamic aggregator concept, the optimal charging power for all PEVs in the aggregator is derived using the Pontryagin's minimum principle. During the second stage, a power distribution law is developed to allocate the aggregated power from the first stage using the fuzzy logic control approach. The TSCC framework considers the stochastic characteristics and nonlinear battery dynamics of practical vehicle charging scenarios, and therefore, is feasible for practical implementation. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the control performance of the TSCC.

Abstract: Based on measurements obtained by commodity wireless sensors, we observe that the majority of thermostatic loads in a user premise are described by periodic pulse waves. We propose a novel first stage of optimization in the smart grid which reduces external on/off command flow for demand response between the controller and the smart appliances. A phase management scheme is developed that defines optimal time shifts on the periodic loads in order to provide peak power and energy cost reduction over a limited time horizon. A gradient descent optimization technique, based on Taylor series, is applied to determine the phases of the pulses in discrete time steps. Three optimization strategies and two control schemes are explored. Minimization of peak power loads, minimization of energy costs and flattening of the power curve are modeled. A centralized and a distributed control scheme are explored. It is found that respectable peak power and cost reduction can be achieved in the centralized control scheme but redundant data transfer in the network and increased complexity is necessary. On the other hand, the distributed control scheme reduces the overall complexity but does not present significant savings.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of the development of Smart Grid transmission network applications in the Great Britain (GB) power system. A new Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) application for monitoring inter-area oscillations is developed. The core of this novel application is a fast nonlinear algorithm for the real-time estimation of the dominant inter-area oscillation mode, which processes GPS synchronized information obtained from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) installed in the power system. It is based on the Newton-Type Algorithm (NTA), an efficient parameter estimator. The paper focuses on the practical application of the new WAMS application: two data sets were tested, one based on computer simulations and the other based on real-life data records. The computer simulated oscillatory signals were obtained through dynamic simulations of the full GB power system model consisting of over 200 generators. The real-life data records used information collected by the FlexNet Wide Area Monitoring System (FlexNET-WAMS) installed in the GB network. Based on these data records, the features of inter-area oscillations in the GB network are drawn.

Abstract: This paper is the first of a two-part series on a novel method of power system state estimation that makes use of information theory to calculate an accurate real-time power system model from a set of analog and digital measurements. This proposed minimum-information-loss (MIL) method is distinguished in that it seamlessly unifies the maximum a-posteriori estimation of both analog and digital quantities such as bus voltages and switch statuses. Both analog and digital estimation residuals are obtained. MIL takes into account the a priori probabilities of the quantities to be measured and the losses incurred along the measurement's information channels with noise when minimizing the overall loss of information. For the identification of network topology errors and switch statuses, MIL processes digital data directly without using auxiliary analog pseudo-measurements. It is shown that the well-known weighted-least-square (WLS) estimation is obtained as a special case of the comprehensive MIL state estimation.

Abstract: The integration of a massive number of small-scale wind turbines and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) brought about urgent technical challenge to power distribution network operators (DNOs) in terms of secure power supply and energy dispatching optimization. In this paper, we exploited three coordinated wind-PEV energy dispatching approaches in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) context, i.e., valley searching, interruptible and variable-rate energy dispatching, aiming to promote the user demand response through optimizing the utilization efficiency of wind power generation as well as meeting the dynamic power demands. This issue is addressed in a stochastic framework considering the uncertainties of wind power generation as well as the statistical PEV driving patterns. The performances of the proposed solutions are assessed through a comparative study through numerical simulation experiments covering sufficient system scenarios by the use of scenario generation and reduction techniques. The result demonstrates that the energy dispatch based on the latter two approaches can achieve better matching between power generation and demands as well as PEV user satisfaction. In addition, the suggested approaches can be adopted by DNOs in practice with minimal deployment hurdles to promote the energy supplies within microgrid with wind power sources and PEVs.

Abstract: The paper proposes a new concept of protection philosophy for Dutch distribution grids with high penetration of renewable energy. Conventional protection concepts are normally based on protection schemes that consist of definite or inverse time overcurrent relays. In future power systems, these schemes can lead to high fault clearing times, unselective tripping and massive DG disconnections, which are not acceptable in a deregulated multi-owner energy market. This research work proposes an efficient intelligent communication-based protection algorithm that implements different multi-functional protection principles supported by blocking schemes. The real-time organization of both the hardware architecture and communication infrastructure of the protection algorithm is illustrated in detail. Special emphasis is given to the network reconfiguration scenario cases and detailed simulation results of such illustrative studied cases are provided. The new protection strategy guarantees protection selectivity and provides DG-unit availability during and after the fault. The intelligent algorithm is applied on existing Dutch distribution network and meaningful conclusions are derived.

Abstract: A key feature of future smart grids is demand response. With the integration of a two-way communication infrastructure, a smart grid allows its operator to monitor the production and usage of power in real time. Upon detection of significant events, the operator may send requests to intelligent loads to curtail their power usage. The operator can use load curtailments reactively for adaptation to the loss of generation capacity (e. g., with unpredictable renewable energy sources), or proactively for profit maximization by avoiding the use of expensive energy sources during peak hours. In this paper, we optimize operator profits for the different cases of load curtailment, under various practical constraints including the physical properties of the power system, and different cost and valuation functions for heterogeneous generation units and loads, respectively. We also investigate the requirements imposed by different cases of the load curtailment on the cyber infrastructure. In particular, we evaluate how the delay of cyber control impacts the frequency stability of the power grid during the load curtailment phase.

Abstract: Wind power is gaining in significance as an important renewable source of clean energy. However, due to their inherent uncertainty, wind generators are often unable to participate in the forward electricity markets like the more predictable and controllable conventional generators. Given this, virtual power plants (VPPs) are being advocated as a solution for increasing the reliability of such intermittent renewable sources. In this paper, we take this idea further by considering VPPs as coalitions of wind generators and electric vehicles, where wind generators seek to use electric vehicles (EVs) as a storage medium to overcome the vagaries of generation. Using electric vehicles in this manner has the advantage that, since the number of EVs is increasing rapidly, no initial investment in dedicated storage is needed. In more detail, we first formally model the VPP and then, through an operational model based on linear programming, we show how the supply to the Grid and storage in the EV batteries can be scheduled to increase the profit of the VPP, while also paying for the storage using a novel scheme. The feasibility of our approach is examined through a realistic case-study, using real wind power generation data, corresponding electricity market prices and electric vehicles' characteristics.

Abstract: This paper is the second of a two-part series on analog-digital power system state estimation. The minimum-information-loss (MIL) method that calculates an accurate real-time power system model from a set of analog and digital measurements is implemented, applied, and validated. Two MIL implementations are proposed for both power grid and substation state estimation. The performance of the MIL method is evaluated through three tests. First, the success rate of identifying the true topology is statistically quantified for an IEEE 14-bus system and compared with state-of-the-art generalized state estimation (GSE). Then the competitive performance of the MIL method is further substantiated on two real-world test cases that involve the China Eastern power grid in China and a real substation.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the minimization of the total energy cost of multiple residential households in a smart grid neighborhood sharing a load serving entity. Specifically, each household may have renewable generation, energy storage as well as inelastic and elastic energy loads, and the load serving entity attempts to coordinate the energy consumption of these households in order to minimize the total energy cost within this neighborhood. The renewable generation, the energy demand arrival, and the energy cost function are all stochastic processes and evolve according to some, possibly unknown, probabilistic laws. We develop an online control algorithm, called Lyapunov-based cost minimization algorithm (LCMA), which jointly considers the energy management and demand management decisions. LCMA only needs to keep track of the current values of the underlying stochastic processes without requiring any knowledge of their statistics. Moreover, a decentralized algorithm to implement LCMA is also developed, which can preserve the privacy of individual household owners. Numerical results based on real-world trace data show that our control algorithm can effectively reduce the total energy cost in the neighborhood.

Abstract: To meet the fast growing demand of energy, in addition with increased generation, improved efficiency, stability and flexibility, smart techniques need to be adopted that are in compliance with the environment and energy conservation. In this paper, we present an autonomous demand-side energy management to encourage users to willingly modify their electricity consumption without compromising with service quality and customer satisfaction using load forecasting. The projected distributed demand side energy management (DSM) strategy gives each consumer an option to simply apply its best response strategy to current electric load and tariff in the power distribution system. Using NSGA II optimization technique on load prediction, it is obtained that an area-load based pricing method is beneficial for both electric utility and consumer. Finally, simulation results substantiate that the proposed approach can maximize load factor and reduce total energy cost as well as user's daily electricity charges.

Furthermore, on the basis of this vulnerability, we point out that Xia and Wang's argument for resistance against the unknown key share (UKS) attack is incorrect.

Abstract: This paper describes the droop control method for parallel operation of distributed electric springs for stabilizing ac power grid. It provides a methodology that has the potential of allowing reactive power controllers to work in different locations of the distribution lines of an ac power supply and for these reactive power controllers to support and stabilize the ac mains voltage levels at their respective locations on the distribution lines. The control scheme allows these reactive power controllers to have automatically adjustable voltage references according to the mains voltage levels at the locations of the distribution network. The control method can be applied to reactive power controllers embedded in smart electric loads distributed across the power grid for stabilizing and supporting the ac power supply along the distribution network. The proposed distributed deployment of electric springs is envisaged to become an emerging technology potentially useful for stabilizing power grids with substantial penetration of distributed and intermittent renewable power sources or weakly regulated ac power grid.

Abstract: Motor loads require high amount of reactive power for a short period during their startup. The high reactive power drawn from the system causes voltage dips at startup time and potentially overvoltage after motor startup is over. The voltage dip and overvoltage may cause the relays to trip and the system to go unstable. This phenomenon is more challenging in weak distribution systems and isolated systems such as microgrids due to the limited inertia of the master generator. This paper presents a dynamic voltage controller that coordinates all the reactive power sources in the system to provide the necessary reactive power during motor startup. The presented Model Predictive Control (MPC) based dynamic Volt/Var Control (VVC) scheme considers the dynamics of the microgrid in the VVC formulation to overcome the voltage dip caused by motor startup. This method uses predictions of voltage behavior of the system based on a simplified system model and tries to eliminate the effect of motor startup by coordinating the reactive power sources in the system.

Abstract: It is anticipated that an uncoordinated operation of individual home energy management (HEM) systems in a neighborhood would have a rebound effect on the aggregate demand profile. To address this issue, this paper proposes a coordinated home energy management (CoHEM) architecture in which distributed HEM units collaborate with each other in order to keep the demand and supply balanced in their neighborhood. Assuming the energy requests by customers are random in time, we formulate the proposed CoHEM design as a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem. We propose novel models to describe the deferrable appliance load [e. g., plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles (PHEV)], and apply approximation and decomposition techniques to handle the considered design problem in a decentralized fashion. The developed decentralized CoHEM algorithm allow the customers to locally compute their scheduling solutions using domestic user information and with message exchange between their neighbors only. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CoHEM architecture can effectively improve real-time power balancing. Extensions to joint power procurement and real-time CoHEM scheduling are also presented.

Abstract: The implementation of storage capacities in distribution grids is seen as an important element for the integration of fluctuating feed-in caused by photovoltaic and wind generators. However, the responsibility for the operating of these assets is not defined inmostmarket designs. Since decreasing costs are to be expected with further market penetration, next to distribution grid operators (DSO) further storage stake holders may be interested in controlling local storage devices. In this paper optimal storage profiles for different stakeholders (DSO and energy traders) are derived based on a case study with real world data. The results reveal conflicting interests-peak shaving of fluctuating feed-in (objective o the DSO to avoid reinforcements) is hampered significantly by storage usage of trading companies (objective of exploiting price spreads in the spot market). It is shown that unreasonable high costs occur with undesired economical side-effects if no control or cooperation mechanism is implemented.

Abstract: As renewable energy sources increase their penetration, the traditional providers of frequency regulation service, i.e., fossil fueled thermal power plants, will be displaced, motivating the search for novel providers such as demand-side resources. This paper presents the results of field experiments using demand as a frequency controlled reserve (DFCR) on appliances with programmable thermostats. The experiments conducted showed the response of a population of thermostatically controlled loads acting as normal reserves (up and down regulation) and disturbance reserves (up regulation only) as defined by the Nordic Grid Codes. In addition, industrial pump loads and relay-controlled loads were tested as DFCR. The tests show that a population of refrigerators was able to deliver frequency reserves approximately equal to their average power consumption. Electric space heaters in the autumn season were able to provide frequency reserves of a magnitude 2.7 times their average power consumption.

Abstract: This paper is concerned about strategic deployment of feeder remote terminal unit (FRTU) in primary network by considering cybersecurity of distribution secondary network. First, detection of historical anomaly load profile in secondary network is assumed to be observable. These irregularities of historical energy usages can be determined from consumer billing centers using proposed cybersecurity metrics. While it is constrained by budget on the number of FRTUs that can be deployed, the proposed algorithm identifies pivotal locations of a distribution feeder to install the FRTUs in different time horizons. The simulation results show that the infrastructure enhancement using proposed multistage method improves investment planning for distribution systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes an appliance scheduling scheme for residential building energy management controllers, by taking advantage of the time-varying retail pricing enabled by the two-way communication infrastructure of the smart grid. Finite-horizon scheduling optimization problems are formulated to exploit operational flexibilities of thermal and non-thermal appliances using a model predictive control (MPC) method which incorporates both forecasts and newly updated information. For thermal appliance scheduling, the thermal mass of the building, which serves as thermal storage, is integrated into the optimization problem by modeling the thermodynamics of rooms in a building as constraints. Within the comfort range modeled by the predicted mean vote (PMV) index, thermal appliances are scheduled smartly together with thermal mass storage to hedge against high prices and make use of low-price time periods. For non-thermal appliance scheduling, in which delay and/or power consumption flexibilities are available, operation dependence of inter-appliance and intra-appliance is modeled to further exploit the price variation. Simulation results show that customers have notable energy cost savings on their electricity bills with time-varying pricing. The impact of customers' preferences of appliances usage on energy cost savings is also evaluated.

Abstract: This paper presents a study of emission-concerned wind-electric vehicle (EV) coordination on the transmission grid side. An aggregator model representing a cluster of controllable EVs is proposed, and is coordinated with large-scale wind power on the transmission side. Using these EV aggregators, a conceptual framework is developed for wind-EV coordination, based on a three-level hierarchy. At the top level, the control center determines the optimal plant outputs and EV charging strategies from the proposed wind-EV dispatch model, where emission costs, thermal plant generation, controllable EVs, and CO2 capture power plants are taken into account and set as multi-objectives. The time-varying number of EV connections, plant ramp rate limits, and network constraints, including interface and branch transmission capacities, are also considered in the model. The model is used to verify the benefits of wind-EV coordination in an IEEE 14-bus system. Compared with uncoordinated charging, wind curtailment, emissions, total optimized cost, and EV charging fees are all greatly reduced by coordination. Moreover, interface transmission capacity and discharging price are found to be important factors in coordination, and the impacts are investigated.

Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is considered for microgrids, with the objective of minimizing either the power distribution losses, or, the cost of power drawn from the substation and supplied by distributed generation (DG) units, while effecting voltage regulation. The microgrid is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers. The resulting algorithm entails iterative message-passing among groups of consumers and guarantees faster convergence compared to competing alternatives.

Abstract: Depending on the capacity, type and location, distributed generation (DG) can have an impact on protection coordination of directional over-current relays for looped distribution systems. In this paper, a new index is proposed, "protection coordination index" (PCI), which can serve as an effective measure when planning the protection of meshed distribution systems with DG. A two-phase non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem is proposed to determine the PCI by optimally calculating variations in the maximum DG penetration level with changes in the protection coordination time interval. Furthermore, the influence of connecting a DG at a certain location on the system PCIs is examined. The presented analysis is tested on the distribution section of the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 30-bus systems. The PCI can serve as an efficient index for distribution system planners: (i) to determine the best DG candidate locations for utility owned DG and (ii) to evaluate the impact of a customer owned DG, considering distribution system protection.

Abstract: It is well known that power system operations are often constrained by transmission congestions which reflect the physical restrictions intrinsic to the power system itself. The power market running on top of the system is also constrained by factors such as primary energy, emissions, technical support, as well as multi-player gaming among market participants including regulators. In this paper, we propose a new concept of generalized congestions to describe those factors affecting both the competition level and the efficiency of power markets. Market power is a market participant's capability in influencing market efficiency with the aid of generalized congestions; generalized market power reflects its capability to influence the social welfare. This paper analyzes generalized congestions, market power and generalized market power in many aspects including taxonomy, evaluation indexes, control measures. and the corresponding research methods. Based on the experimental economics method, a research framework is proposed to facilitate comprehensive studies on the influences of generalized congestions on market power.

Abstract: Several techniques have been proposed for the automatic control of just-in-time heating and cooling systems in indoor spaces that accommodate both the occupants' comfort and energy savings. Current techniques, however, do not provide an adequate solution for efficient thermostat control, because they require costly infrastructures to detect occupancy or because they inaccurately predict the occupancy due to irregular patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic thermostat control system based on the mobility prediction of users, using contextual information obtained by mobile phones. We also present an arrival time prediction scheme that combines both historical pattern and route classification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can successfully predict at least 70% of the transit cases within 10 minutes' error and can decrease energy consumption by 26%.

Abstract: In this paper, a behavior-rule based intrusion detection system (BRIDS) is proposed for securing head-ends (HEs), distribution access points/data aggregation points (DAPs) and subscriber energy meters (SEMs) of a modern electrical grid in which continuity of operation is of the utmost importance. The impact of attacker behaviors on the effectiveness of a behavior-rule intrusion detection design is investigated. Using HEs, DAPs and SEMs as examples, it is demonstrated that a behavior-rule based intrusion detection technique can effectively trade false positives for a high detection probability to cope with sophisticated and hidden attackers to support ultra safe and secure applications. It is shown that BRIDS outperforms contemporary anomaly-based IDSs via comparative analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a new adaptive control approach to power system secondary voltage control (SVC) problem using synchronized phasor measurements as control feedback. The objective is to improve overall system voltage profile by appropriate management of reactive power sources against any unexpected load disturbances. The proposed method is adaptive in the sense that load disturbances are estimated on-line for computing the feasible control inputs for the minimization of the worst case load voltage deviation. That is, the resulting worst load voltage change can precisely remain within the range of predefined constraint using the feasible control inputs. Moreover, the computational burden of the proposed method is low such that it is suitable for on-line applications. Extensive simulation studies on the IEEE 14-bus and the IEEE 30-bus systems have been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the traditional robust method.

Abstract: Real power injections at loads and generators, and real power flows on selected lines in a transmission network are monitored and transmitted over a SCADA network to the system operator. These are used in state estimation algorithms to make dispatch, re-balance and other energy management system [EMS] decisions. Coordinated cyber attacks on power meter readings can be designed to be undetectable by any bad data detection algorithm. These unobservable attacks present a serious threat to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of power meters on lines is presented. This requires O(n(2)m) flops for a power system with buses and line meters. If all lines are metered, there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks. These can be quickly detected with O(n(2)) flops using standard graph algorithms. Known-secure phasor measurement units [PMUs] can be used as countermeasures against a given collection of cyber attacks. Finding the minimum number of necessary PMUs is NP-hard. It is shown that p + 1 PMUs at carefully chosen buses are sufficient to neutralize a collection of cyber attacks.

Abstract: Despite the economic and environmental advantages of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), the increased utilization of PHEVs brings up new concerns for power distribution system decision makers. Impacts of PHEVs on distribution networks, although have been proven to be noticeable, have not been thoroughly investigated for future years. In this paper, a comprehensive model is proposed to study the PHEV impacts on residential distribution systems. In so doing, PHEV fundamental characteristics, i.e., PHEV battery capacity, PHEV state of charge (SOC), and PHEV energy consumption in daily trips, are accurately modeled. As some of these effective characteristics depend on vehicle owner's behavior, their behavior and interests are considered in the proposed model. Also, to get a more practical model of PHEVs, the number of vehicles in a residential distribution network, the PHEV penetration level for upcoming years, distribution of PHEVs in the network, and estimation of household load growth for upcoming years are extracted from related published reports. The proposed model is applied to the IEEE 34-node test feeder, and PHEV impacts on residential distribution network are studied in different time horizons. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to demonstrate the effects of PHEV operation modes on the network load profile.

Abstract: We propose a framework for demand response in smart grids that integrates renewable distributed generators (DGs). In this model, some users have DGs and can generate part of their electricity. They can also sell extra generation to the utility company. The goal is to optimize the load schedule of users to minimize the utility company's cost and user payments, while considering user satisfaction. We employ a parallel autonomous optimization scheme, where each user requires only the knowledge of the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. All the users can execute distributed optimization simultaneously. The distributed optimization is coordinated through a soft constraint on changes of load schedules between iterations. Numerical examples show that our method can significantly reduce the peak-hour load and costs to the utility and users. Since the autonomous user optimization is executed in parallel, our method also significantly decreases the computation time and communication costs.

Abstract: This paper considers the technical and economical feasibility of the introduction of automated demand response from domestic smart appliances in a European setting as a means to create a significant amount of regulating power. Simplified power-time flexibility models for appliances are introduced on which generic economic simulations can be based. These simulations permit a good indication of the economic value that can be attained as a function of model parameters. This shows that classical load shifting of washing appliances creates sufficient value in the day-ahead market to justify investments in smart energy control services. Cooling appliances create significant value on the balance market and while full scale deployment would lead to significant price erosion in today's market, it could accommodate additional unbalance caused future sustainable generation. The scale of domestic demand response resources can be quantified in two simple parameters: regulation power and storage capacity. For the Dutch situation these are 700 MW, equivalent to 5% of average national power consumption and 5 GWh storage: around 20 minutes of average national power consumption. Smart appliances can deliver a 100% efficient and CO2 friendly complement to the unpredictability of e. g., large scale wind power as planned in large parts of Europe in 10 to 15 years.

Abstract: Increasing energy security and reliability concerns are intensifying the interest in microgrids. In this setting, design optimization is vital to achieve a reliable infrastructure without overbuilding. This paper considers the impact of frequency and voltage regulation on the optimal design of a conceptual, autonomous military microgrid. This microgrid comprises a solar panel and vehicles as power sources, with each vehicle incorporating a battery and generator. The power output and terminal voltage of these inverter-based sources must be regulated. The paper investigates the effects of battery DC voltage variations on a decentralized regulation scheme, and the resulting influence on optimal component sizing. To this end, controllers are first designed based on the typical assumption that the voltage on the DC side of each inverter is constant. The battery internal resistance is then considered and its impact on regulation performance is investigated. The results show that the battery internal resistance can affect the performance of both frequency and voltage regulation, and consequently must be taken into account in component sizing decisions. Thus, the paper identifies an important coupling between regulation and component sizing problems through battery characteristics, and highlights the need for a combined sizing and regulation framework for microgrid design.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic energy scheduling model for a local-area smart-grid system with a single energy source and multiple energy consumers. The tasks of the energy consumers are classified into two categories, namely, the stochastic background tasks and the deterministic dynamic tasks. The objective is to schedule the energy consumptions of the dynamic tasks to maximize the expected system utility under the given energy consumption and energy generation constraints. To make this problem tractable, using rolling horizon optimization and Gaussian approximation we transform the original stochastic optimization problem into a convex optimization problem with linear constraints. We then derive a distributed Newton's method to solve this problem, and design a message-passing mechanism for a distributed implementation of the algorithm with limited information exchange between the energy consumers and the energy source. In simulations, the proposed distributed Newton's method converges for the system under consideration, while the traditional dual decomposition method does not converge to a primary feasible solution; and thus it is a powerful practical tool for real-time control of smart-grid systems.

Abstract: Hybrid ac/dc multi-terminal micro-grids are gaining high momentum under the smart grid paradigm to integrate renewable and clean energy resources either in the transmission or distribution systems. This paper presents a robust multi-objective controller for the voltage-source-converter (VSC)-based dc-voltage power-port in hybrid ac/dc networks. The proposed controller ensures excellent tracking performance, robust disturbance rejection, and robust stability against operating point and parameter variation with a simple fixed-parameter low-order controller. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure is proposed, where feed-forward tracking and base-line robust disturbance rejection controllers are employed to decouple disturbance rejection and tracking objectives. A disturbance rejection controller is designed, based on the singular-values synthesis approach, to achieve robustness against variation in converter operation point. Further, the effect of parametric uncertainty in the effective dc-link capacitance is mitigated by modifying the robust disturbance rejection controller, via the polynomial method, to ensure that the closed-loop poles are allocated in the pre-defined region in the complex plane even under parameter variation. A theoretical analysis and comparative simulation and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control structure.

Abstract: Smart grid can be defined as a modern electric power grid infrastructure for improved efficiency, reliability and safety, with smooth integration of renewable and alternative energy sources through automated control and modern communications technologies. The increase need for more effective power electrical systems control turned the development of smart grids, the main object of study formany researchers. This paper proposes a digital system for condition monitoring, diagnosis and supervisory control applied to smart grids. The system is based on hybrid network architecture (HNA), consisting of a wired infrastructure, a wireless sensor network (WSN), a power line communications (PLC) and a controller area network (CAN). The system is based on three hardware topologies: remote data acquisition units (RDAUs), intelligent sensors modules (ISMs) and a PLC modem. The basic characteristics are: a) easy/low cost implementation, b) easy to set up by user, c) easy implementation of redundant routines (security), d) portability/versatility, and e) open system. To validate the developed system, it was implanted in one underground electric substation power distribution, characterized as an extremely hostile environment for supervisory control applications. In this application, the main challenge is to establish a communication system installed inside the substation with the outside (operations center-OC) considering that there are not commercial solutions appropriate to solve completely this problem.

Abstract: In this paper, an integrated vehicle-to-grid, grid-to-vehicle, and renewable energy sources (IntVGR) coordination algorithm is proposed. The focus of this work is to provide a multidisciplinary study on implementing the proposed IntVGR scheme over a broadband fiber-wireless communications infrastructure by co-simulating both power and communications perspectives. For the power systems perspective, results show that the scheme is able to achieve a 21% reduction in peak demand compared to uncontrolled charging, and a better performance in flattening the overall demand profile and maintaining network constraints in comparison to a benchmark scenario. The scheme has also been demonstrated to successfully coordinate PEVs to take maximum utilization of local renewable energy. For the communications perspective, the measured upstream traffic for executing the proposed IntVGR scheme on a residential area of 342 households is found to be 1-2 Mbps with an end-to-end latency level of 1 ms. The scheme has also been validated from both perspectives in a sensitivity analysis with a higher PEV adoption rate.

Abstract: PJM Interconnection operates the largest synchronized transmission system in North America, where one of the great challenges is being able to meet the system-wide voltage control performance requirements both pre-and post-contingency. Based on a characteristic analysis of the contingencies distribution, a practical method using an iteration scheme between the optimal power flow (OPF) and a contingency assessment (CA) is proposed to develop a control strategy, so that the calculated optimal voltage schedule solutions are better not only for pre-contingency system conditions, also for the post-contingency (N - 1) system conditions. At step T, a CA considering all contingencies is carried out and those that may lead to the maximized voltage violations are saved as active contingencies for step T + 1. At the same time, another CA, considering only the current active contingencies, is computed in parallel using a trial OPF result as input. According to the post-contingency indices, the new voltage constraints will be compressed and the final OPF is called again to calculate the optimal strategies. The detailed architecture of the PJM optimal voltage control (OVC) system is presented in this paper. The system has completed four-months of online operation, and the results have been evaluated using third-party software. It has been proven that the OVC system presented here will greatly improve both the pre-and post-contingency performance. The PJM OVC is a typical application of a smart transmission grid. Phase III of this study is currently under way.

Abstract: This paper presents a technique to extract load signatures non-intrusively by using the smart meter data. Load signature extraction is different from load activity identification. It is a new and important problem to solve for the applications of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). For a target appliance whose signatures are to be extracted, the proposed technique first selects the candidate events that are likely to be associated with the appliance by using generic signatures and an event filtration step. It then applies a clustering algorithm to identify the authentic events of this appliance. In the third step, the operation cycles of appliances are estimated using an association algorithm. Finally, the electric signatures are extracted from these operation cycles. The results can have various applications. One is to create signature databases for the NILM applications. Another is for load condition monitoring. Validation results based on the data collected from three actual houses and a laboratory experiment have shown that the proposed method is a promising solution to the problem of load signature collection.

Abstract: Modern smart grids, by and large, merge physical interconnections and cyber controllers. Invariably, this tight coupling results in cyber commands manifesting in the physical layer as observable changes, leading to possible disclosure of sensitive system settings. Thus, cyber event confidentiality of the smart grid is violated. Attacks on confidentiality can ultimately lead to integrity and availability attacks; with adequate knowledge of the system topology, internal settings, and how the physical layer responds to cyber commands, a malicious adversary gains knowledge to attack the system. This work shows how to develop self-obfuscating systems based on information flow security properties that can mitigate event confidentiality violations in smart grids.

Abstract: Electricity consumption for plugged-in electric loads (PELs) accounts for more use than any other single end-use service in residential and commercial buildings. PELs possess potentials to be efficiently managed for many purposes. However, few existing load identification methods are designed for PELs to handle challenges such as the diversity within each type of PELs and similarity between different types of PELs with similar front-end power supply units. Existing methods provide only absolute decisions which are not reliable when handling these challenges. This paper presents a simple yet efficient and practical hybrid supervised self-organizing map (SSOM)/Bayesian identifier for PELs. The proposed identifier can classify PELs into clusters by inherent similarities due to similar front-end power supply topologies, extract and utilize statistical information, and provide the probability of the unknown load belonging to a specific type of load. Tests based on real-world data validate that the proposed methods are accurate, robust, and applicable.

Abstract: Microgrids are known as clusters of distributed energy resources serving a group of distributed loads in grid-connected and isolated grid modes. Nowadays, the concept of microgrids has become a key subject in the smart grid area, demanding a systematic procedure for their optimal construction. According to the IEEE Std 1547.4, large distribution systems can be clustered into a number of microgrids to facilitate powerful control and operation infrastructure in future distribution systems. However, clustering large systems into a set of microgrids with high reliability and security is not reported in current literature. To fill-out this gap, this paper presents a systematic and optimized approach for designing microgrids taking into account system reliability- and supply-security-related aspects. The optimum design considers sustained and temporary faults, for system reliability via a combined probabilistic reliability index, and real and reactive power balance, for supply security. The loads are assumed to be variable and different distributed generation (DG) technologies are considered. Conceptual design, problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper. The well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as the test system. The effect of optimization coefficients on the design and the robustness of the algorithm are investigated using sensitivity studies.

Abstract: Low-voltage (LV) grid feeders with high penetration of photovoltaics (PVs) are often affected by voltage magnitude problems. To solve such issues, previous research has shown that reactive power methods, active power curtailment and grid reinforcement can be used for voltage support, yet showing several limits. We introduce the use of electric vehicle (EV) public charging stations with energy storage system (ESS) as a solution for voltage regulation in LV feeders with PV. A novel method is proposed to determine the ESS charging load required for voltage regulation and compare the results for the different locations in the feeder. With time-series simulations, we quantify the energy size required for a station ESS. A Belgian LV residential grid, modeled using real PV generation and load profiles, is used as case study. The method and simulation results show the effectiveness of using public EV charging facilities with the additional function of voltage regulation in feeders with PV.

The server will process the image, retrieve the kWh information, convert it into a text (number) and archive it against the consumer's mobile number or identity code. The way this can be implemented is illustrated.

Abstract: The paper summarizes the current status of the technical supporting systems in the control centers and substations of China Southern Power Grid (CSG). Smart grid applications can be, based on functional integration and data sharing, developed for the operation of complicated power grids. A brand new conceptual model of next generation system, named Operation Smart System (OS2), is proposed. OS2 provides an integrated framework that integrates all functionalities of the current systems in control centers and substations. These functionalities act as modules and are linked with an open and standardized service bus, called Operational Service Bus (OSB). The definition, principles, technical architecture, modules, and key technologies of OS2 are discussed in detail. A case study on a prototype system of power system operation cockpit (POC) demonstrates the feasibility of the system framework and the key technologies. It is believed that the research and development of OS2 will significantly benefit the grid operation of CSG.

Abstract: The electric spring is an emerging technology proven to be effective in i) stabilizing smart grid with substantial penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources and ii) enabling load demand to follow power generation. The subtle change from output voltage control to input voltage control of a reactive power controller offers the electric spring new features suitable for future smart grid applications. In this project, the effects of such subtle control change are highlighted, and the use of the electric springs in reducing energy storage requirements in power grid is theoretically proven and practically demonstrated in an experimental setup of a 90 kVA power grid. Unlike traditional Statcom and Static Var Compensation technologies, the electric spring offers not only reactive power compensation but also automatic power variation in non-critical loads. Such an advantageous feature enables non-critical loads with embedded electric springs to be adaptive to future power grid. Consequently, the load demand can follow power generation, and the energy buffer and therefore energy storage requirements can be reduced.

Abstract: Distributed generation, which is installed to exploit renewable energy sources, can also be used as a reactive power resource and contribute to tackle the voltage regulation problem in smart distribution grids. Adopting a decentralized approach with off-line coordination, the paper proposes an optimal set-point design for the voltage/reactive power control scheme of distributed generation. The objective is to improve the voltage profile along the feeders of a distribution system. Using only local measurements, the actual operating conditions of the feeder are firstly estimated; then, the set-point is evaluated by solving an optimal voltage profile problem. The off-line coordination avoids any modification to the architecture of existing control systems and requires communication only in the case of significant changes of the distribution system topology. The results of numerical simulations are presented for MV feeders with wind and photovoltaic generations. A comparison with standard control schemes is reported, as well as considerations about the off-line coordination among the distributed generations and the tap-changer of the HV/MV transformer.

Abstract: With the development of smart grid, residents have the opportunity to schedule their power usage in the home by themselves for the purpose of reducing electricity expense and alleviating the power peak-to-average ratio (PAR). In this paper, we first introduce a general architecture of energy management system (EMS) in a home area network (HAN) based on the smart grid and then propose an efficient scheduling method for home power usage. The home gateway (HG) receives the demand response (DR) information indicating the real-time electricity price that is transferred to an energy management controller (EMC). With the DR, the EMC achieves an optimal power scheduling scheme that can be delivered to each electric appliance by the HG. Accordingly, all appliances in the home operate automatically in the most cost-effective way. When only the real-time pricing (RTP) model is adopted, there is the possibility that most appliances would operate during the time with the lowest electricity price, and this may damage the entire electricity system due to the high PAR. In our research, we combine RTP with the inclining block rate (IBR) model. By adopting this combined pricing model, our proposed power scheduling method would effectively reduce both the electricity cost and PAR, thereby, strengthening the stability of the entire electricity system. Because these kinds of optimization problems are usually nonlinear, we use a genetic algorithm to solve this problem.

Abstract: The electric power system in Europe is fundamentally changing, due to the liberalization of the energy market, the internationalization of electric power system operations, the shift towards renewable energy sources and the increased difficulty to install new transmission lines. The transmission system operators face new problems and they require new means to solve them. One option is to resort to the use of power flow controlling devices to manage the energy flows in the transmission system and to provide a secure operation under varying circumstances. Through the use of power flow controlling devices, the TSO gains a double advantage: investments in new (overhead) transmission lines can be avoided and it allows more flexible grid operations. This paper describes the Belgian case for different stages of the grid management: investment, planning, scheduling and operations using power flow controlling devices, including practical aspects. The Belgian case study comprises two technologies: the traditional phase shifting transformer and voltage source converter HVDC, each with their advantages and disadvantages.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of information gap decision theory (IGDT) to help the distribution network operators (DNOs) in choosing the supplying resources for meeting the demand of their customers. The three main energy resources are pool market, distributed generations (DGs), and the bilateral contracts. In deregulated environment, the DNO is faced with many uncertainties associated to the mentioned resources which may not have enough information about their nature and behaviors. In such cases, the classical methods like probabilistic methods or fuzzy methods are not applicable for uncertainty modeling because they need some information about the uncertainty behaviors like probability distribution function (PDF) or their membership functions. In this paper, a decision making framework is proposed based on IGDT model to solve this problem. The uncertain parameters considered here, are as follows: price of electricity in pool market and demand of each bus. The robust strategy of DNO is determined to hedge him against the risk of increasing the total cost beyond what it is willing to pay. The effectiveness of the proposed tool is assessed and demonstrated by applying it on a large distribution network.

Abstract: Autonomous demand response (DR) programs are scalable and result in a minimal control overhead on utilities. The idea is to equip each user with an energy consumption scheduling (ECS) device to automatically control the user's flexible load to minimize his energy expenditure, based on the updated electricity pricing information. While most prior works on autonomous DR have focused on coordinating the operation of ECS devices in order to achieve various system-wide goals, such as minimizing the total cost of generation or minimizing the peak-to-average ratio in the load demand, they fall short addressing the important issue of fairness. That is, while they usually guarantee optimality, they do not assure that the participating users are rewarded according to their contributions in achieving the overall system's design objectives. Similarly, they do not address the important problem of co-existence when only a sub-set of users participate in a deployed autonomous DR program. In this paper, we seek to tackle these shortcomings and design new autonomous DR systems that can achieve both optimality and fairness. In this regard, we first develop a centralized DR system to serve as a benchmark. Then, we develop a smart electricity billing mechanism that can enforce both optimality and fairness in autonomous DR systems in a decentralized fashion.

Abstract: In a smart microgrid currents injected by distributed energy resources (DERs) and by the point of common coupling can be adapted to minimize the energy cost. Design and quality constraints usually make the problem grow fast with the number of nodes in the network. In this paper we provide a solution to the optimization problem having a significantly reduced complexity with respect to existing techniques. The efficiency of the proposed solution stems by modeling the smart microgrid as a linear network where loads are approximated as impedances. This simplification allows avoiding explicit use of power flow equations, and having a number of equation proportional to the number of DERs rather than to the total number of nodes (loads and DERs). The optimal power flow problem is then solved by a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which provides the initial point for the search of a feasible solution by a sequential convex programming procedure based on a local linear approximation of non-convex constraints. Numerical results show the merits of the proposed approach for typical smart microgrid scenarios.

Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of deploying a PowerLine Communication (PLC) network over a medium voltage (MV) power grid. The PLC network is used to connect the end nodes (ENs) of the MV grid to the service provider by means of PLC network nodes enabled as access points. In particular, a network planning problem is faced wherein we require to define the PLC network topology by deciding which MV network nodes are to be enabled as access points. An optimization problem is then formulated, which minimizes the cost of enabling the access points and maximizes the reliability of PLC network paths in a multi-objective optimization fashion. This work also considers resiliency (i.e., it guarantees the PLC network connectivity even in case of link faults) and capacity constraints (i.e., it checks that there are enough resources to transmit the estimated amount of traffic over the PLC network paths). As a byproduct, the optimization algorithm also returns the optimal routing. Simulations based on realistic MV network topologies validate the proposed approach.

Abstract: Conventional protection relays, which use local signals to locate faults, are a poor fit to modern power grids when compared to communication-based alternatives. This article presents a novelWide-Area Backup Protection (WABP) algorithm that uses information shared across wide-area communication networks. The WABP algorithm fuses and integrates information in a regional decentralized peer-to-peer negotiation architecture for enhanced effectiveness. Line decision-making agents (LDAs), focused on line-fault detection, collect distance and directional protection information on both sides of a line. If LDAs cannot detect a fault locally, wide-area information that includes directional protection and line-fault states from neighboring lines is collected to locate the fault. The LDA considers the possible presence of relay misoperations, protection failures, and/or communication failures. Regional decision-making agents (RDAs) that reside in a regional decision-making device (RDD) in the monitoring layer of a substation can negotiate in a peer-to-peer manner without a control center. The RDA serves as the manager, coordinator, and message transponder for the LDAs. The design of the WABP is described including its architecture, workflow, and its agents' functions. Simulation scenarios illustrate the correctness of the WABP multi-agent system and the higher fault-tolerance of its response to misoperations, protection failures, and communication failures.

Abstract: An approach of inverse time-domain transient analysis is devised as a possible method of locating self-clearing, sub-cycle incipient faults in distribution systems. Simplified modeling and formulation of a fault distance calculation from a substation for ground faults in circuits is made using only the discrete voltage and current samples obtained at the substation. The formula in principle seeks to find the value of a line inductance to the fault from the substation by analyzing the transient waveform of phase voltage and current. In particular, in the equivalent circuit of the faulted system, the method applies voltage injection and superposition principle, obtains net fault voltage and current, and calculates the line inductance to the fault as fault distance. The steps for implementing the formula from substation sampled data are detailed and illustrated, followed by validation test results with eleven actual transient faults.

Abstract: Over the last 15 years, significant changes have occurred in the areas of electric power systems and high performance computing (HPC). HPC has seen the maturation of cluster computing, the advent of multi-core computing, the creation of grid and cloud computing, and the sudden rise of the graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose computing. These changes have also been coupled with the slow ending of Moore's law. Electric power systems have also undergone many changes including the introduction of the advanced metering infrastructure and other advanced technologies for data collection, the inclusion of renewable/distributed power generation, and the addition of electric vehicles as stochastic loads. Clear goals have also been set for the development of the smart grid-a unique cyber-physical system (CPS) that requires the interaction of the electric power system and HPC. As such, this work explores the many ways in which HPC will be used in the smart grid and its CPS in the future including real-time and off-line analysis, data mining/storage, intelligent coordination, security, simulation, and visualization.

Abstract: This paper aims to achieve a balance of power in a group of prosumers, based on a price mechanism, i.e., to steer the difference between the total production and consumption of power to zero. We first set the information network topology such that the prosumers exchange price (power) information with their neighbors according to a chosen information network topology. Based on the exchanged information and the prosumers own measured power demand, each prosumer uses a local control strategy to turn on and off its power generator to cooperatively achieve the global balance. More specifically, the local control strategy results from a distributed model predictive control method based on dual decomposition and sub-gradient iterations. The method achieves a unique dynamic price signal for each prosumer. Simulation results with realistic data validate the method.

Abstract: This paper studies the smart control issue for an autonomous microgrid in order to maintain the secure voltages as well as maximize economic and environmental benefits. A control scheme called as multi-agent based hierarchical hybrid control is proposed versus the hierarchical control requirements and hybrid dynamic behaviors of the microgrid. The control scheme is composed of an upper level energy management agent, several middle level coordinated control agents and many lower level unit control agents. The goals of smart control are achieved by designed control strategies. The simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed smart control for an autonomous microgrid.

Abstract: An on-line method for detecting and locating a faulty node in the utility grid is proposed for smart grids. The method is based on injection of high frequency (A-Band) current signal into the grid that would impose voltages (less than 1V according to EN50065-1 standard) on the nodes to determine changes in the impedance characteristics. This detection is accomplished on-line without interrupting the power flow in the network. The developed algorithm has been implemented within an electrical power system model. This low voltage network model has been tested with different fault scenarios. The proposed procedure is able to detect the faulty nodes with high accuracy.

Abstract: The extensive connection of single phase solar generators which are also called microFITs (micro feed-in tariff), to distribution systems may lead to a phase unbalance condition, a problem further complicated due to the widespread use of single phase loads. Energy losses also change significantly when microFITs are implemented. This paper addresses these problems with respect to the connection of a large number of microFITs and single phase loads to three phase distribution systems. In this research, a probabilistic model has been utilized for estimating hourly solar irradiance, and a genetic algorithm has been employed as a means of generating a non-dominated Pareto front for minimizing the current unbalance and energy loss in the distribution system. A decision-making process has been developed in order to determine a single optimum solution from the Pareto front generated. Operational controls, such as voltage drop, transmission limits, and voltage unbalance limits, are taken into consideration in this analysis. In the context of smart grids, the proposed algorithm will facilitate the deployment of small-sized solar generators. The proposed method has been applied on an IEEE 123 bus distribution system in order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based real-time residential load management algorithm that takes into account load uncertainty in order to minimize the energy payment for each user. Unlike most existing demand side management algorithms that assume perfect knowledge of users' energy needs, our design only requires knowing some statistical estimates of the future load demand. Moreover, we consider real-time pricing combined with inclining block rate tariffs. In our problem formulation, we take into account different types of constraints on the operation of different appliances such as must-run appliances, controllable appliances that are interruptible, and controllable appliances that are not interruptible. Our design is multi-stage. As the demand information of the appliances is gradually revealed over time, the operation schedule of controllable appliances is updated accordingly. Simulation results confirm that the proposed energy consumption scheduling algorithm can benefit both users, by reducing their energy expenses, and utility companies, by improving the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load demand.

Abstract: This paper considers a smart grid cyber-security problem analyzing the vulnerabilities of electric power networks to false data attacks. The analysis problem is related to a constrained cardinality minimization problem. The main result shows that an l(1) relaxation technique provides an exact optimal solution to this cardinality minimization problem. The proposed result is based on a polyhedral combinatorics argument. It is different from well-known results based on mutual coherence and restricted isometry property. The results are illustrated on benchmarks including the IEEE 118-bus, IEEE 300-bus, and the Polish 2383-bus and 2736-bus systems.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to quantify the potential for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to meet operating reserve requirements associated with increased deployment of wind and solar generation. The paper advances prior PEV estimates in three key ways. First, we employ easily implementable scheduling strategies with very low centralized computing requirements. Second, we estimate PEV availability based on data sampled from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Third, we predict regulation demand on a per minute basis using published models from the California ISO for 20% and 33% renewable electricity supply. Our key results are as follows: First, the amount of regulation up and regulation down energy delivered by PEVs can be balanced by using a hybrid of two scheduling strategies. Second, the percentage of regulation energy that can be delivered with PEVs is always significantly higher than the percentage of conventional regulation power capacity that is deferred by PEVs. Third, regulation up is harder to satisfy with PEVs than regulation down. Fourth, the scheduling strategies we employ here have a limited impact on load following requirements. Our results indicate that 3 million PEVs could satisfy a significant portion-but not all-of the regulation energy and capacity requirements that are anticipated in California in 2020.

Abstract: The problem of optimal control of power distribution systems is becoming increasingly compelling due to the progressive penetration of distributed energy resources in this specific layer of the electrical infrastructure. Distribution systems are, indeed, experiencing significant changes in terms of operation philosophies that are often based on optimal control strategies relying on the computation of linearized dependencies between controlled (e. g., voltages, frequency in case of islanding operation) and control variables (e. g., power injections, transformers tap positions). As the implementation of these strategies in real-time controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the derivation of analytical dependency between controlled and control variables becomes a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage and power flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical derivation of node voltages and line currents as a function of the nodal power injections and transformers tap-changers positions. Compared to other approaches presented in the literature, the one proposed here is based on the use of the compound matrix of a generic multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to estimate the computational benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant improvements are also quantified versus traditional methods. The validation of the proposed method is carried out by using both IEEE 13 and 34 nodes test feeders. The paper finally shows the use of the proposed method for the problem of optimal voltage control applied to the IEEE 34 node test feeder.

Abstract: The proposed approach evaluates the effect of integrating a large number of electric vehicles (EVs) on power grid operation and control. The EV fleets could serve as electricity load when drawing energy from the grid and as energy storage (vehicle-to-grid) when delivering energy to the grid. The paper considers two operating modes for EV fleets which are consumer-controlled and grid-controlled. The power grid generation mix represents a multitude of units including thermal, hydro, and wind. The paper considers the impact of EV battery utilization on offsetting the hourly variability of wind generation units in transmission-constrained power grids. The paper considers charging/discharging schedule of EV batteries and consumer driving requirements on the optimal hourly transmission-constrained commitment and dispatch of generation units in the day-ahead scheduling. The hourly solution of the proposed method will minimize the cost of supplying the hourly load while satisfying the temporal constraints of individual components in power grids.

Abstract: Smart and green buildings have attracted much attention in recent years. Development of an effective negotiation model for facilitating the bi-directional energy trading between the utility grid and the building is important for enhancing the building intelligence. In this paper, a negotiation agent based on adaptive attitude bidding strategy (AABS) is proposed. A comprehensive set of factors for the integrated smart building and utility grid system is taken into account in developing the negotiation model. The AABS based negotiation agent turns out to be able to dynamically adjust its behavior in response to varying attitudes in the negotiation process. In addition, an improved particle swarm optimization-adaptive attitude bidding strategy (PSO-AABS) based negotiation agent is developed for adaptively adjusting the trader's decisions according to the opponent's behaviors. It turns out to be capable of making rational deals in bi-directional energy trading by maximizing the trader's payoffs with reduced negotiation time. The feasibility of the proposed negotiation agents is evaluated by the simulation results.

Abstract: Emerging smart grid technologies aim to renovate traditional power grid by integrating intelligent devices and their communications for monitoring and automation of the power grid to enable efficient demand-side energy management. In this paper, energy management in smart dc building grid powered dc electrical appliances like lighting is investigated, in particular energy savings from proposed personal lighting management strategy. Unlike conventional fluorescent lamps powered mainly by ac grid, LED luminaires are dc in nature, thus results in significant power conversion losses, if operate on traditional ac powered system, are analyzed with proposed dc distribution building grid for LED lighting. This paper continues to explore the use of smart wireless sensors for personal control of the dc grid powered networked LED lighting. Experimental results show that the proposed smart LED lighting system with an energy saving mechanism incorporated is able to achieve similar lighting performance as the conventional lighting condition, while at the same time, able to attain about 44% energy saving as compared to the original ac fluorescent system. For a low voltage dc grid being implemented, the maximum power loss and voltage drop of the developed dc distribution building grid are 2.25% and 3% respectively.

Abstract: The effectiveness of a protection scheme in any power grid is essential to the reliability of the supply. One of the main goals of the FREEDM systems is to increase supply reliability to end users. However, traditional protection methods, including over current, sequential components, and wide differential area protection, are not suitable for this system for several reasons that will be explained in the paper. A new protection strategy is presented in this paper. This protection scheme takes advantage not only of the system configuration but mostly of the solid state transformer capability and design to minimize any circuit and communication that are needed for a successful protection strategy. A real time digital simulator (RTDS) is used to model a sample FREEDM system in order to verify the proposed protection scheme. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing was performed to verify the proposed protection scheme.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to apply two dynamic state and parameter estimation techniques to real-world data. Dynamic state and parameter estimation can estimate equivalent generator internal voltages and rotor angles (dynamic states) during electromechanical dynamics. In addition, parameters such as the transient reactances and inertia can be estimated. A set of real world data recorded by Eastern Interconnection Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) regarding a generator trip event is analyzed in this paper. An estimation algorithm developed by Chow et al. was applied to estimate the states and parameters of a transfer path. An alternative estimation method based on the classic generator model and swing equation is presented in this paper and applied to the real world PMU data with the aid of digital filtering technology. Challenges in real-world data applications are identified in this paper.

Abstract: Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) offers utilities new ways to model and analyze distribution circuits. Results from two circuits introduce a new method to identify phasing of transformers and single-phase taps using voltage and kilowatt-hour measurements from AMI. In addition to phase identification, we show how to use the same approach to create or check meter-to-transformer mappings. These algorithms are based on linear regression and basic voltage drop relationships. With this approach, secondary connectivity and impedance models can be auto generated. In addition, detection of unmetered load appears possible. Also demonstrated is use of AMI to estimate primary-side voltage profiles.

Abstract: Existing traveling wave fault location systems employ the double-end method and do not make use of data from neighboring substations. If one of the data acquisition equipments at either end of a line fails to capture the fault transient, no fault location result can be obtained. A wide-area traveling wave fault location (WA-TWFL) system, which makes use of traveling wave data from various substations across the monitored network, is introduced. The WA-TWFL algorithm first identifies the area of the monitored network in which the source of the disturbance originated by analyzing the traveling wave propagation times using the extended double endmethod. Then, the faulty line, and the distance to fault, are determined using selected records from the identified area of the disturbance. This approach provides fault location reliability than the traditional TWFL algorithm. Traveling wave data models based on IEC61850, which supports open communication and interoperability between data acquisition equipment and the master station of the WA-TWFL, are also presented in this paper. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is proved using traveling wave data from an actual fault on a power grid in China.

Abstract: In this paper, an intelligent control strategy for ventilation systems in energy-efficient buildings is proposed. The design goal of the intelligent controller is to determine the optimal ventilation rate efficiently and accurately by maintaining the indoor CO2 concentration in the comfort zone with a reduced amount of energy consumption. In this study, the CO2 concentration is used as the indicator of human comfort in terms of indoor air quality. In addition, a CO2 predictive model is utilized to forecast the indoor CO2 concentration based on the occupancy pattern of buildings. Due to the high non-linearity of the model, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to derive the optimal ventilation rate. Fuzzy technique is used to represent the relationship between the ventilation rate and the corresponding power consumption for mechanical ventilation systems. As compared with the traditional ON/OFF or fixed ventilation control scheme, the performance of the proposed intelligent control system has demonstrated its advantage in energy savings. Three case studies are analyzed in different situations and using different input parameters. The corresponding simulation results confirm the viability of the proposed intelligent control strategy for ventilation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an integer linear programming (ILP) framework for the optimal placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs), in the presence of conventional measurements. Furthermore, by the proposed method, the power system remains completely observable during all possible single contingencies for lines and measurement devices. In doing so, the potential of circuit equations associated with both PMUs and conventional measurements as well as the network topology are fully utilized by a system of equations to reach the minimum possible numbers of required PMUs. The limitation of communication channels is also taken into account in the proposed ILP-based framework. The method is implemented on several IEEE test systems which have already been equipped with conventional measurements. The comparison between obtained results of the proposed method and those of other methods reveals its superiority in the modeling of robust PMU placement problem (OPP) in the presence of conventional measurements. As such, a smooth transition from the SCADA-based monitoring system to the PMU-dominated WAMS is ensured. Moreover, this method is successfully applied on three large-scale test systems, which demonstrates it can effectively be employed for robust OPP in realistic power systems.

Abstract: Channel Components Transform (CCT) is a recently developed technique to decouple interconnected power networks. This paper aims to further explore the CCT and extend its applications. Methods and algorithms are proposed to extend its application in identifying the critical generators and branches of a network from the voltage stability perspective. The proposed methods are verified by case studies conducted on multiple test systems. This paper also demonstrates the capability of the CCT to work properly when a limited number of phasor measurement units are available. For this purpose, a strategy is proposed to determine the number and location of PMU installations that are sufficient to track the modes of voltage collapse and associated critical components. The proposed allocation strategy is examined through case studies of an actual power system.

Abstract: Future smart grid capabilities promise to leverage network technologies to revolutionize the production, transmission, distribution, and consumption of electrical power. This smart grid revolution is more than just smart meters. Improvements in situational awareness are also likely to enhance security and reliability in power transmission systems. However, reliance on Internet-like communication networks also exposes vulnerabilities to increased risk from cyber-attack and other forms of Byzantine (i.e., anomalous) behavior. This article advocates the use of an agent-based decentralized protection system using peer-to-peer communications, reputation-based trust and a data retransmission scheme to combat malicious attacks and other Byzantine failures. The research presented used the electric power and communication synchronizing simulator (EPOCHS) federated simulation platform to demonstrate the added robustness provided to a special protection system in the face of an adversary by successfully defending against malicious attacks. Simulation results show promise for this approach.

Abstract: Energy storage is traditionally well established in the form of large scale pumped-hydro systems, but nowadays is finding increased attraction in medium and smaller scale systems. Such expansion is entirely complementary to the forecasted wider integration of intermittent renewable resources in future electrical distribution systems (Smart Grids). This paper is intended to offer a useful tool for analyzing potential advantages of distributed energy storages in Smart Grids with reference to both different possible conceivable regulatory schemes and services to be provided. The Smart Grid Operator is assumed to have the ownership and operation of the energy storage systems, and a new cost-based optimization strategy for their optimal placement, sizing and control is proposed. The need to quantify benefits of both the Smart Grid where the energy storage devices are included and the external interconnected grid is explored. Numerical applications to a Medium Voltage test Smart Grid show the advantages of using storage systems related to different options in terms of incentives and services to be provided.

Abstract: With the increasing use of renewable energy in the Great Britain (GB) power system, the role of electric vehicles (EVs) contributes to primary frequency response was investigated. A tool was developed to estimate the EV charging load based on statistical analysis of EV type, battery capacity, maximum travel range and battery state of charge. A simplified GB power system model was used to investigate the contribution of EVs to primary frequency response. Two control modes were considered: disconnection of charging load (case I) and discharge of stored battery energy (case II). For case II, the characteristic of the EV charger was also considered. A case study shows results for the year 2020. Three EV charging strategies: "dumb" charging, "off-peak" charging, and "smart" charging, were compared. Simulation results show that utilizing EVs to stabilize the grid frequency in the GB system can significantly reduce frequency deviations. However the requirement to schedule frequency response from conventional generators is dynamic throughout the day.

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become very popular due to climate change concerns and carbon emission reduction schemes. Accordingly, in recent years the awareness of people about EVs has increased significantly. In addition to the well-known advantages such as cleaner environment, less oil-dependency, cheaper fuel, more silent operation etc., through smartgrids, EVs offer a unique benefit called vehicle to grid (V2G) technology. In order to define the role of EVs as distributed storage devices, simulation works undertaken in Paladin Designbase 4.0 are presented in this paper. It is shown that through V2G, EVs can support better operation of smartgrids in terms of reliability and storage. In order to achieve these, the components of smartgrids shall communicate and share information via communication lines. Having a universal communication standard is vital for implementing the plug-and-play concept in smartgrids. IEC 61850, the substation automation standard, could be used for this purpose. However, it is insufficient and must be expanded to cover missing links. In this paper, authors propose an extension to the IEC 61850-7-420 standard by defining the information model for controlling the charging and discharging of EVs.

Abstract: Smart homes, as active participants in a smart grid, may no longer be modeled by passive load curves; because their interactive communication and bidirectional power flow within the smart grid affects demand, generation, and electricity rates. To consider such dynamic environmental properties, we use a multiagent-system-based approach in which individual homes are autonomous agents making rational decisions to buy, sell, or store electricity based on their present and expected future amount of load, generation, and storage, accounting for the benefits each decision can offer. In the proposed scheme, home agents prioritize their decisions based on the expected utilities they provide. Smart homes' intention to minimize their electricity bills is in line with the grid's aim to flatten the total demand curve. With a set of case studies and sensitivity analyses, we show how the overall performance of the home agents converges-as an emergent behavior-to an equilibrium benefiting both the entities in different operational conditions and determines the situations in which conventional homes would benefit from purchasing their own local generation-storage systems.

Abstract: Efficiently integrating wind energy into the smart grid is gaining momentum under renewable portfolio standard (RPS) with deep wind penetration. Due to the randomness of wind energy production, ancillary service (AS) is needed in large amount to regulate wind power for system stability and reliability. As a result, the cost of wind power depends on the AS market and may be, quite higher than that of conventional power. Therefore, it is challenging to economically integrate wind energy with current power system to satisfy RPS. With the communication, sensing and advanced control features incorporated into the smart grid, the interactions among the grid components will facilitate solving this problem. In this paper, we consider the wind energy integration of small-scale utilities installed with wind turbines and acted as distributed energy resources (DERs). Since wind energy can be integrated to serve customer load or enter a separate green energy market, we propose a theoretical framework to dynamically determine the role of wind energy and provide long-term RPS guarantee. This approach results in a simple dynamic threshold control policy which maximizes the expectation of the profit for a green utility and is easily implemented online.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel active power flow management (PFM) method for managing multiple distributed generator (DG) units connected to medium voltage distribution networks. The method uses the artificial intelligence technique of constraint programming to autonomously manage DG real power outputs and offers flexible and network agnostic characteristics. The method is assessed using multiple scenarios on two real case study networks to examine simulated closed-loop control actions under certain thermal excursions. The test cases are explored with algorithms implemented, in software, on commercially available substation computing hardware to identify computation timescales and investigate algorithm robustness when presented with measurement error. The archival value of this paper is in the specification and evaluation of a novel application of the constraint programming technique for online control of DG in thermally constrained distribution networks.

Abstract: An increasing number of retail energy markets show price fluctuations, providing users with the opportunity to buy energy at lower than average prices. We propose to temporarily store this inexpensive energy in a battery, and use it to satisfy demand when energy prices are high, thus allowing users to exploit the price variations without having to shift their demand to the low-price periods. We study the battery control policy that yields the best performance, i.e., minimizes the total discounted costs. The optimal policy is shown to have a threshold structure, and we derive these thresholds in a few special cases. The cost savings obtained from energy storage are demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, and we offer various directions for future research.

Abstract: This paper presents an aggregation charging model for large numbers of electric vehicles (EVs). A genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to obtain the stochastic feature parameters of the aggregation model, and a charging strategy based on the aggregation model is developed to reduce the power fluctuation level caused by EV charging. In addition, an updatable optimization method is proposed to track the variation of the EV charging characteristics. The proposed charging strategy and optimization method are validated by the simulation results.

Abstract: The increased non-linear loads in today's typical home are a growing concern for utility companies. This situation might be worsened by the harmonic resonance introduced by the installation of capacitor banks in the distribution network. To mitigate the harmonic distortions, passive or active filters are typically used. However, with the increasing implementation of distributed generation (DG) in residential areas, using DG systems to improve the power quality is becoming a promising idea, particularly because many DG systems, such as photovoltaic (PV), wind and fuel cells, have DG-grid interfacing converters. In this paper, the potential for using photovoltaic (PV) interfacing inverters to compensate the residential system harmonics is explored. A system model including the residential load and DG is first developed. An in-depth analysis and comparison of different compensation schemes based on the virtual harmonic damping impedance concept are then carried out. The effects of the capacitor banks in the system are also studied. The effectiveness of the harmonic compensation strategies under different conditions is verified through analysis and simulations.

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for dc fault current fast interruption in high-power dc networks. A four terminal 1.2 GW dc transmission grid is used as a test system. The study compares four semiconductor-based devices for dc fault isolation: series hybrid dc breaker, half bridge and full bridge dc chopper, and LCL thyristor converter. The study considers performance of devices, costs and losses, and also application with larger dc grids. A hybrid dc CB has lowest losses, but the component sizing crucially depends on the speed of fault detection. It is demonstrated that fast communication between various devices in the dc grid is mandatory but might be very challenging. On the other hand, dc choppers and LCL converter component sizing is not dependent on the speed of protection, and there is no need for communication across dc grids. Additionally, they offer the capability of voltage stepping and dc cable power regulation. The LCL converter provides inherent fault current interruption and needs no overrating for dc faults. It also gives better efficiency compared to dc choppers. The performance of these dc breakers is demonstrated using detailed transient PSCAD simulation for dc faults.

Abstract: Analysis and modeling of electric energy demand is indispensable for power planning, operation, facility investment, and urban planning. Because of recent development of renewable energy generation systems oriented for households, there is also a great demand for analysing the electricity usage and optimizing the way to install electricity generation systems for each household. In this study, employing statistical techniques, a method to model daily consumption patterns in households and a method to extract a small number of their typical patterns are presented. The electricity consumption patterns in a household is modeled by a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Then, using the symmetrized generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence as a distance measure of the distributions, typical patterns of the consumption are extracted by means of hierarchical clustering. The statistical modeling of daily consumption patterns allows us to capture essential similarities of the patterns. By experiments using a large-scale dataset including about 500 houses' consumption records in a suburban area in Japan, it is shown that the proposed method is able to extract typical consumption patterns.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust single-loop direct voltage control strategy featuring effective suppression of uncertain resonant modes generated due power-factor correction (PFC) capacitors and residential capacitive loads in distributed generation (DG) microgrids. The proposed controller adopts an improved uncertainty modeling approach, which facilities the realization of a robust controller based on structured singular values (mu) analysis. The resultant controller is used as a direct voltage controller where no additional damping technique, either passive or active, is required. This feature reduces the sensor requirements in the DG interface controller and enhances the bandwidth characteristics of the closed-loop voltage-controlled converter. Mathematical and comparative analyses are provided to show the advantages of proposed mu-synthesis controller over the conventional H-infinity controller in maintaining robust stability as well as robust performance of the microgrid in presence of parameter uncertainties and uncertain resonant peaks caused by connection of PFC capacitors. Systematic design approach for the proposed controller is presented. Time-domain simulation studies and comparative experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller in microgrid applications.

Abstract: The solutions offered to-date for end-user privacy in smart meter measurements, a well-known challenge in the smart grid, have been tied to specific technologies such as batteries or assumptions on data usage without quantifying the loss of benefit (utility) that results from any such approach. Using tools from information theory and a hidden Markov model for the measurements, a new framework is presented that abstracts both the privacy and the utility requirements of smart meter data. This leads to a novel privacy-utility tradeoff problem with minimal assumptions that is tractable. For a stationary Gaussian model of the electricity load, it is shown that for a desired mean-square distortion (utility) measure between the measured and revealed data, the optimal privacy-preserving solution: i) exploits the presence of high-power but less private appliance spectra as implicit distortion noise, and ii) filters out frequency components with lower power relative to a distortion threshold; this approach encompasses many previously proposed approaches to smart meter privacy.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a real-time situational awareness framework for the electrical transmission power grid using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). While WSNs are capable of cost efficient monitoring over vast geographical areas, several technical challenges exist. The low power, low data rate devices cause bandwidth and latency bottlenecks. In this paper, our objective is to design a wireless network capable of real-time delivery of physical measurements for ideal preventive or corrective control action. For network design, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the installation and operational costs while satisfying the end-to-end latency and bandwidth constraints of the data flows. We study a hybrid hierarchical network architecture composed of a combination of wired, wireless and cellular technologies that can guarantee low cost real-time data monitoring. We formulate a placement problem to find the optimal location of cellular enabled transmission towers. Further, we present evaluation results of the optimization solution for diverse scenarios. Our formulation is generic and addresses real world scenarios with asymmetric sensor data generation, unreliable wireless link behavior, non-uniform cellular coverage, etc. Our analysis shows that a transmission line monitoring framework using WSN is indeed feasible using available technologies. Our results show that wireless link bandwidth can be a limiting factor for cost optimization.

Abstract: Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers ("prosumers") distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed.

Abstract: The development of a smarter electric grid will depend on increased deployments of information and communication technology (ICT) to support novel communication and control functions. Unfortunately, this additional dependency also expands the risk from cyber attacks. Designing systems with adequate cyber security depends heavily on the availability of representative environments, such as testbeds, where current issues and future ideas can be evaluated. This paper provides an overview of a smart grid security testbed, including the set of control, communication, and physical system components required to provide an accurate cyber-physical environment. It then identifies various testbed research applications and also identifies how various components support these applications. The PowerCyber testbed at Iowa State University is then introduced, including the architecture, applications, and novel capabilities, such as virtualization, Real Time Digital Simulators (RTDS), and ISEAGE WAN emulation. Finally, several attack scenarios are evaluated using the testbed to explore cyber-physical impacts. In particular, availability and integrity attacks are demonstrated with both isolated and coordinated approaches, these attacks are then evaluated based on the physical system's voltage and rotor angle stability.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of energy imbalance management in a microgrid. The problem is investigated from the power market perspective. Unlike the traditional power grid, a microgrid can obtain extra energy from a renewable energy source (RES) such as a solar panel or a wind turbine. However, the stochastic input from the RES brings difficulty in balancing the energy supply and demand. In this study, a novel pricing scheme is proposed that provides robustness against such intermittent power input. The proposed scheme considers possible uncertainty in the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of the power market. It uses all available information on the power supply, power demand, and imbalanced energy. The parameters of the scheme are evaluated using an H-infinity performance index. It is shown that the parameters can be obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality problem, which is efficiently solvable due to its convexity. Simulation examples are given to show the favorable performance of the proposed scheme in comparison with existing area control error pricing schemes.

Abstract: Utility companies are integrating multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) technologies into existing backbone networks, including networks between substations and control centers. MPLS has mechanisms for efficient overlay technologies as well as mechanisms to enhance security: features essential to the functioning of the smart grid. However, with MPLS routing and other switching technologies innovation is restricted to the features enclosed "in the box." More specifically, there is no practical way for utility operators or researchers to test new ideas such as alternatives to IP or MPLS on a realistic scale to obtain the experience and confidence necessary for real world deployments. As a result, novel ideas go untested. Conversely, the OpenFlow framework has enabled significant advancements in network research. OpenFlow provides utility operators and researchers the programmability and flexibility necessary to enable innovation in next-generation communication architectures for the smart grid. This level of flexibility allows OpenFlow to provide all features of MPLS and also allows OpenFlow devices to co-exist with existing MPLS devices. The simulation results in this paper demonstrate that OpenFlow performs as well as MPLS, and may therefore be considered an alternative to MPLS for smart grid applications.

Abstract: This paper discusses the modeling of a multi charging station for Electric Vehicles (EVs) and its utilisation for grid support. Allowing the EVs to charge and discharge without any control may lead to voltage variations in the grid. However, if the charging/discharging of the EVs is done in an intelligent fashion, they can act as distributed energy sources and can smoothen the load profile of the distribution network by providing peak shaving and valley filling. The presented work mainly focuses on the control architecture for using the EVs' batteries as distributed energy storage systems. This enables in maintaining the node voltage within the prescribed limit by valley filling and peak shaving. The control architecture is based on fuzzy control techniques. The proposed architecture is implemented on the distribution network of Guwahati city. Dynamic load profile is used to check the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for flattening the load profile.

Abstract: This paper presents design considerations for a centralized load controller to control thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) for continuous regulation reserves (CRRs). The controller logics for setting up the baseline load, generating priority lists, issuing dispatch commands, and tuning the simplified forecaster model using measurement data are described. To study the impacts of different control parameter settings on control performance and device lifetimes, a system consisting of 1000 heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units in their heating modes is modeled to provide a +/- 1-MW CRR 24 hours a day. Four cases are modeled to evaluate the impact of forecasting errors, minimum HVAC turn-off times, response delays, and consumer overrides. The results demonstrate that a centralized TCA load controller can provide robust, good quality CRRs with reduced communication needs for the two-way communication network and inexpensive load control devices. Most importantly, because the controller precisely controls the aggregated HVAC load shapes while maintaining load diversity, the controllable and measurable load services that it provides can be used for many other demand response applications, such as peak shaving, load shifting, and arbitrage.

Abstract: High quality demand side management has become indispensable in the smart grid infrastructure for enhanced energy reduction and system control. In this paper, a new demand side management technique, namely, a new energy efficient scheduling algorithm, is proposed to arrange the household appliances for operation such that the monetary expense of a customer is minimized based on the time-varying pricing model. The proposed algorithm takes into account the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and intermittent renewable generation. Moreover, it considers the variable frequency drive and capacity-limited energy storage. Our technique first uses the linear programming to efficiently compute a deterministic scheduling solution without considering uncertainties. To handle the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and energy consumption, a stochastic scheduling technique, which involves an energy consumption adaptation variable beta, is used to model the stochastic energy consumption patterns for various household appliances. To handle the intermittent behavior of the energy generated from the renewable resources, the offline static operation schedule is adapted to the runtime dynamic scheduling considering variations in renewable energy. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to a traditional scheduling scheme which models typical household appliance operations in the traditional home scenario, the proposed deterministic linear programming based scheduling scheme achieves up to 45% monetary expense reduction, and the proposed stochastic design scheme achieves up to 41% monetary expense reduction. Compared to a worst case design where an appliance is assumed to consume the maximum amount of energy, the proposed stochastic design which considers the stochastic energy consumption patterns achieves up to 24% monetary expense reduction without violating the target trip rate of 0.5%. Furthermore, the proposed energy consumption scheduling algorithm can always generate the scheduling solution within 10 seconds, which is fast enough for household appliance applications.

Abstract: Smart grid technologies leveraging advancements in sensors, communications, and computing offer new avenues for reliability enhancements of complex power grids by increasing the up-times and reducing the down times. This paper discusses various aspects of smart grid monitoring and proposes a mathematical model to assess its impact on power grid reliability. Based on a multiple-state Markov chain model, the failure and repair rates of power components with and without monitoring provisions are determined and compared. The proposed formulation incorporates the failure rates of the monitoring systems themselves and the impact on system/component reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a scalable approach for DSM (demand side management) of PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). Essentially, our approach consists of three steps: aggregation, optimization, and control. In the aggregation step, individual PHEV charging constraints are aggregated upwards in a tree structure. In the optimization step, the aggregated constraints are used for scalable computation of a collective charging plan, which minimizes costs for electricity supply. In the real-time control step, this charging plan is used to create an incentive signal for all PHEVs, determined by a market-based priority scheme. These three steps are executed iteratively to cope with uncertainty and dynamism. In simulation experiments, the proposed three-step approach is benchmarked against classic, fully centralized approaches. Results show that our approach is able to charge PHEVs with comparable quality to optimal, centrally computed charging plans, while significantly improving scalability.

Abstract: The penetration of plug-in electric vehicles and renewable distributed generation is expected to increase over the next few decades. Large scale unregulated deployment of either technology can have a detrimental impact on the electric grid. However, appropriate pairing of these technologies along with some storage could mitigate their individual negative impacts. This paper presents a framework and an optimization methodology for designing grid-connected systems that integrate plug-in electric vehicle chargers, distributed generation and storage. To demonstrate its usefulness, this methodology is applied to the design of optimal architectures for a residential charging case. It is shown that, given current costs, maximizing grid power usage minimizes system lifecycle cost. However, depending upon the location's solar irradiance patterns, architectures with solar photovoltaic generation can be more cost effective than architectures without. Additionally, Li-ion storage technology and micro wind turbines are not yet cost effective when compared to alternative solutions.

Abstract: When wind power penetration is high, the available generation may be more than needed, especially for wind-powered microgrids working autonomously. Because the maximum peak power tracking algorithm may result in a supply-demand imbalance, an alternative algorithm is needed for load sharing. In this paper, a fully distributed control scheme is presented to coordinate the operations of multiple doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) in a microgrid. According to the proposed control strategy, each bus in a microgrid has an associated bus agent that may have two function modules. The global information discovery module discovers the total available wind generation and total demand. The load sharing control module calculates the generation reference of a DFIG. The consensus-based algorithm can guarantee convergence for microgrids of arbitrary topologies under various operating conditions. By controlling the utilization levels of DFIGs to a common value, the supply-demand balance can be maintained. In addition, the detrimental impact of inaccurate and outdated predictions of maximum wind power can be alleviated. The generated control references are tracked by coordinating converter controls and pitch angle control. Simulation results with a 5-DFIG microgrid demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: Demand Response (DR) and Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing refer to programs which offer incentives to customers who curtail their energy use during times of peak demand. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution to predict and re-engineer the electricity demand (e. g., peak load reduction and shift) in a locality at a given day/time. The system presented in this paper expands DR to residential loads by dynamically scheduling and controlling appliances in each dwelling unit. A decision-support system is developed to forecast electricity demand in the home and enable the user to save energy by recommending optimal run time schedules for appliances, given user constraints and TOU pricing from the utility company. The schedule is communicated to the smart appliances over a self-organizing home energy network and executed by the appliance control interfaces developed in this study. A predictor is developed to predict, based on the user's life style and other social/environmental factors, the potential schedules for appliance run times. An aggregator is used to accumulate predicted demand from residential customers.

Abstract: A novel energy management system (EMS) based on a rolling horizon (RH) strategy for a renewable-based microgrid is proposed. For each decision step, a mixed integer optimization problem based on forecasting models is solved. The EMS provides online set points for each generation unit and signals for consumers based on a demand-side management (DSM) mechanism. The proposed EMS is implemented for a microgrid composed of photovoltaic panels, two wind turbines, a diesel generator and an energy storage system. A coherent forecast information scheme and an economic comparison framework between the RH and the standard unit commitment (UC) are proposed. Solar and wind energy forecasting are based on phenomenological models with updated data. A neural network for two-day-ahead electric consumption forecasting is also designed. The system is tested using real data sets from an existent microgrid in Chile (ESUSCON). The results based on different operation conditions show the economic sense of the proposal. A full practical implementation of the system for ESUSCON is envisioned.

Abstract: In this paper, it is aimed to investigate the impact of the various solid-state fault current limiters (SSFCLs) on several electric power networks with the wind-turbine power generation (WTPG). Distributed generations (DGs) are predicted to perform an increasing role in the future electrical power system. Expose of the DG, can change the fault current during a grid disturbance and disturb the existing distribution system protection. Fault current limiters (FCLs) can be sorted into L-types (inductive) and R-types (resistive) by the fault current limiting impedance. In this paper, a new SSFCL has been proposed. SSFCLs can provide the fast system protection during a rigorous fault. The act of dynamic damping enhancement via the SSFCL is appraised in the presence of the wind-turbine power generation. Hence, its efficiency as a protective device for the wind-turbine system is confirmed via some case studies by time-domain simulation based on the PSCAD/EMTDC.

Abstract: In this paper the impact of load characterization on the statistical modeling of indoor powerline channels is investigated in the bandwidth 100 kHz-50 MHz. Our analysis refers to the mean properties of such channels (so that their time-varying features are ignored) and is based on: a) the use of the statistical channel simulator, which has been validated through experimental measurements, described in [23]; b) the availability of a set of experimental results about the impedance of various appliances. Our numerical and experimental results evidence that, on the one hand, for frequencies beyond 20 MHz the influence of load characterization on the accuracy of statistical channel modelling is marginal; however, on the other hand, for frequencies in the order of 0-20 MHz the properties of the loads connected to a power network can appreciably affect the properties of the channel model.

Abstract: Demand-side management, together with the integration of distributed energy generation and storage, are considered increasingly essential elements for implementing the smart grid concept and balancing massive energy production from renewable sources. We focus on a smart grid in which the demand-side comprises traditional users as well as users owning some kind of distributed energy sources and/or energy storage devices. By means of a day-ahead optimization process regulated by an independent central unit, the latter users intend to reduce their monetary energy expense by producing or storing energy rather than just purchasing their energy needs from the grid. In this paper, we formulate the resulting grid optimization problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the existence of optimal strategies. Furthermore, we present a distributed algorithm to be run on the users' smart meters, which provides the optimal production and/or storage strategies, while preserving the privacy of the users and minimizing the required signaling with the central unit. Finally, the proposed day-ahead optimization is tested in a realistic situation.

Abstract: The widespread use of distributed generation (DG), which is installed in medium-voltage distribution networks, impacts the future development of modern electrical systems that must evolve towards smart grids. A fundamental topic for smart grids is automatic distributed voltage control (ADVC). The voltage is now regulated at the MV busbar acting on the on-load tap changer of the HV/MV transformer. This method does not guarantee the correct voltage value in the network nodes when the distributed generators deliver their power. In contrast, the ADVC allows control of the voltage acting on a single generator; therefore, a better voltage profile can be obtained. In this paper, an approach based on sensitivity theory is shown to control the node voltages regulating the reactive power injected by the generators. After the theoretical analysis, a numerical example is presented to validate the theory. The proposed voltage regulation method has been developed in collaboration with Enel Distribuzione S. p. A. (the major Italian DSO), and it will be applied in the Smart Grids POI-P3 pilot project, which is financed by the Italian Economic Development Ministry. Before the real field application in the pilot project, a real-time digital simulation has been used to validate the algorithm presented. Moving in this direction, Enel Distribuzione S. p. A. built a new test center in Milan equipped with a real-time digital simulator (from RTDS Technologies).

Abstract: While a large body of work has recently focused on reducing data center's energy expenses, there exists no prior work on investigating the trade-off between minimizing data center's energy expenditure and maximizing their revenue for various Internet and cloud computing services that they may offer. In this paper, we seek to tackle this shortcoming by proposing a systematic approach to maximize green data center's profit, i.e., revenue minus cost. In this regard, we explicitly take into account practical service-level agreements (SLAs) that currently exist between data centers and their customers. Our model also incorporates various other factors such as availability of local renewable power generation at data centers and the stochastic nature of data centers' workload. Furthermore, we propose a novel optimization-based profit maximization strategy for data centers for two different cases, without and with behind-the-meter renewable generators. We show that the formulated optimization problems in both cases are convex programs; therefore, they are tractable and appropriate for practical implementation. Using various experimental data and via computer simulations, we assess the performance of the proposed optimization-based profit maximization strategy and show that it significantly outperforms two comparable energy and performance management algorithms that are recently proposed in the literature.

Abstract: This paper describes a method for estimating the impact of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging on overhead distribution transformers, based on detailed travel demand data and under several different schemes for mitigating overloads by shifting PEV charging times (smart charging). The paper also presents a new smart charging algorithm that manages PEV charging based on estimated transformer temperatures. We simulated the varied behavior of drivers from the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey, and transformer temperatures based an IEEE standard dynamic thermal model. Results are shown for Monte Carlo simulation of a 25 kVA overhead distribution transformer, with ambient temperature data from hot and cold climate locations, for uncontrolled and several smart-charging scenarios. These results illustrate the substantial impact of ambient temperatures on distribution transformer aging, and indicate that temperature-based smart charging can dramatically reduce both the mean and variance in transformer aging without substantially reducing the frequency with which PEVs obtain a full charge. Finally, the results indicate that simple smart charging schemes, such as delaying charging until after midnight can actually increase, rather than decrease, transformer aging.

Abstract: Real-time routing is a basic element of closed-loop, real-time sensing and control, but it is challenging due to dynamic, uncertain link/path delays. The probabilistic nature of link/path delays makes the basic problem of computing the probabilistic distribution of path delays NP-hard, yet quantifying probabilistic path delays is a basic element of real-time routing and may well have to be executed by resource-constrained devices in a distributed manner; the highly varying nature of link/path delays makes it necessary to adapt to in-situ delay conditions in real-time routing, but it has been observed that delay-based routing can lead to instability, estimation error, and low data delivery performance in general. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Timescale Estimation (MTE) method; by accurately estimating the mean and variance of per-packet transmission time and by adapting to fast-varying queueing in an accurate, agile manner, MTE enables accurate, agile, and efficient estimation of probabilistic path delay bounds in a distributed manner. Based on MTE, we propose the Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA) routing protocol; MTA integrates the stability of an ETX-based directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) with the agility of spatiotemporal data flow control within the DAG to ensure real-time data delivery in the presence of dynamics and uncertainties. We also address the challenges of implementing MTE and MTA in resource-constrained devices such as TelosB motes. We evaluate the performance of MTA using the NetEye and Indriya sensor network testbeds. We find that MTA significantly outperforms existing protocols, e. g., improving deadline success ratio by 89% and reducing transmission cost by a factor of 9.7 in the NetEye testbed.

Abstract: Under fixed retail rates, electricity demands have no incentive to change their usage pattern. In contrast, under time-varying rates, suppliers can reflect the actual supply cost during the peak hours in retail prices enabling end-users to respond to the prices and reduce their loads or shift their loads from the high-price hours to the low-price hours. Load shifting may increase the reliability of the system, but may increase CO2 emission if coal-fired generators are the marginal generator used during the low-price hours. CO2 emission taxation is one of ISO's options to deal with the CO2 emission problem. In this paper, a new time-varying rate design method considering the CO2 emission taxation is suggested. In addition, market power problem and non-shifting elastic loads are considered. The suggested method is applied to a test market with critical peak pricing (CPP) and real-time pricing (RTP) and the results are analyzed. Also the suggested method is applied to the Korean power system and the results are analyzed.

Abstract: The integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into the future Smart Distribution Network (SDN) has challenging issues regarding the successful development of smart grids. The SDN offers new opportunities in the improvement of the efficiency of power distribution networks. The DERs will be distributed in the existing distribution networks, interconnected in customer areas and operated on its own schedule without communication to the control center of the existing distribution system. The DER units have both positive and negative effects regarding SDN operations. With the appropriate operation of the DER units in the SDN, losses can be reduced during normal operations and they can support local loads during abnormal conditions. Thus, the positive effects of the DER units need to be enabled in the SDN by adopting advanced operation schemes. In this paper, the smart control functions for the DER units in the SDN are defined and classified. In addition, the integration schemes for the SDN with DER units are introduced. The proposed operation strategies will be implemented into the Korean Smart Distribution Management System (KSDMS) as operation schemes used for loss reduction and service restoration. A sample case study shows the effectiveness of the proposed operation schemes to achieve smart operation functions for the SDN with DER units.

Abstract: Smart grid is widely considered to be the next generation of power grid, where power generation, management, transmission, distribution, and utilization are fully upgraded to improve agility, reliability, efficiency, security, economy, and environmental friendliness. Demand response management (DRM) is recognized as a control unit of the smart grid, with the attempt to balance the real-time load as well as to shift the peak-hour load. Communications are critical to the accuracy and optimality of DRM, and hence at the core of the control performance of the smart grid. In this paper, we introduce cognitive radio into the smart grid to improve the communication quality. By means of spectrum sensing and channel switching, smart meters can decide to transmit data on either an original unlicensed channel or an additional licensed channel, so as to reduce the communication outage. Considering the energy cost taxed by spectrum sensing together with the control performance degradation incurred by imperfect communications, we formulate the sensing-performance tradeoff problem between better control performance and lower communication cost, paving the way towards a green smart grid. The impact of the communication outage on the control performance of DRM is also analyzed, which reduces the profit of power provider and the social welfare of the smart grid, although it may not always decrease the profit of power consumer. By employing the energy detector, we prove that there exists a unique optimal sensing time which yields the maximum tradeoff revenue, under the constraint that the licensed channel is sufficiently protected. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Power distribution systems should meet demands such as high reliability, efficiency, and penetration of renewable energy generators (REGs) in a smart grid. In general, power distribution systems are radial in nature. One-way power flow is the advantage of a radial system. However, the introduction of REGs causes bidirectional power flow. Furthermore, there are limits to improvements in reliability and efficiency in a radial system. Therefore, the upgrading of primary feeders from a radial to a loop configuration has been considered in the Korea Smart Distribution Project. An advanced power distribution system (APDS), in which primary feeders operate in a loop configuration, has been explored in this paper. First, the design scheme of a conventional power distribution system configuration that adopts distribution automation is introduced. Subsequently, an upgrading scheme of loop configuration using normally opened tie switches and a tie switch selection algorithm for loss minimization are described. Finally, the advantages of the upgraded configuration are reported through case studies. It is observed that the APDS configuration can integrate more REGs from the viewpoint of voltage regulation. An advanced distribution system allowing greater use of REGs will be a major contribution to smart grid implementation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the probabilistic reliability, considering demand side management (DSM) and web based on a daily interval reliability information system for a grid constrained composite power system including wind turbine generators(WTG). The proposed model can consider capacity limitations and transmission line unavailabilities and the operation of WTG modeled by multi-states. The importance of renewable energy sources is growing at a rapid rate due to environmental concerns. A web based online daily time interval reliability integrated information system (WORRIS) is applied using the methodology proposed in this paper. This paper describes the architecture of the WORRIS Version 7.0 system.

Abstract: In this paper, the design of a network of real-time close-loop wide-area decentralized power system stabilizers (WD-PSSs) is investigated. In this approach, real-time wide-area measurement data are processed and utilized to design a set of stability agents based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) method. Recent technological breakthroughs in wide-area measurement system (WAMS) make the use of the system-wide signals possible in designing power system controllers. The main design objectives of these controllers are to stabilize the system after severe disturbances and mitigate the oscillations afterward. The proposed stability agents are decentralized and autonomous. The proposed method extends the stability boundary of the system and achieves the above goals without losing any generator or load area and without any knowledge of the disturbances causing the response. This paper describes the developed framework and addresses different challenges in designing such a network. A case study is provided to illustrate and verify the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The present paper describes a methodology based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) that defines the configuration required for a monitoring system, in order to monitor voltage and current state variables from a power network. The methodology defines not only the sites where the meters should be installed, but also how their transducers (PTs and CTs) should be connected. The monitoring system's observability is verified through three different rules based on Kirchhoff's laws. A branch-and-bound algorithm and a modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used to solve the optimization problem. The objective is to reduce the cost of the whole monitoring system. It is also shown why intelligent searching methods are required for solving the optimization problem. Three different networks were used to assess the methodology's performance: IEEE 14-bus system, IEEE 30-bus system and a real power distribution feeder. The results were compared with the ones obtained through other methodologies that have already been published before.

Abstract: This paper presents a fuzzy based frequency control strategy by the Megawatt (MW) class distributed PV systems and electric vehicles (EVs). The frequency control is proposed from the view point of the frequency fluctuation problem produced by the large penetration of PV power and sudden load variation. The fuzzy based frequency control has three inputs: average insolation, change of insolation and frequency deviation. Following these three inputs, a frequency control system for the distributed PV inverters is proposed. For the case of different insolations in the different areas of the power system, a coordinated control method of the distributed PV inverters, energy storage systems (ESSs) and EVs is presented. The proposed method is simulated by considering dual power and information flows between supply and demand sides in a large power system and is found satisfactory to provide frequency control and to reduce tie-line power fluctuations.

Abstract: Demand Response Management (DRM) is a key component in the smart grid to effectively reduce power generation costs and user bills. However, it has been an open issue to address the DRM problem in a network of multiple utility companies and consumers where every entity is concerned about maximizing its own benefit. In this paper, we propose a Stackelberg game between utility companies and end-users to maximize the revenue of each utility company and the payoff of each user. We derive analytical results for the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game and prove that a unique solution exists. We develop a distributed algorithm which converges to the equilibrium with only local information available for both utility companies and end-users. Though DRM helps to facilitate the reliability of power supply, the smart grid can be succeptible to privacy and security issues because of communication links between the utility companies and the consumers. We study the impact of an attacker who can manipulate the price information from the utility companies. We also propose a scheme based on the concept of shared reserve power to improve the grid reliability and ensure its dependability.

Abstract: This paper presents methodologies for deriving reliability performance of wireless communication networks to support demand response (DR) control. First, the impact of communication impairments on a direct DR control program is investigated. Second, the outage probability of a wireless link is modelled and quantified, considering the multipath fading, shadowing, and random path loss given the location distribution of smart meters. Third, the distributions of packet delivery ratio are derived for two wireless network architectures: the single-hop infrastructure-based network and the multi-hop mesh network. Simulation results verify the above reliability models and provide important insights on the coverage of wireless communication networks considering the reliability requirements of DR programs.

Abstract: The growing population and global warming have been calling for more effective energy usage, which have stimulated the emergence of smart sustainable energy technology. The distinct feature of this newly emerging technology is the incorporation of advanced information and communication technologies (ICT), which collects more detailed information on how energy is generated, distributed, and consumed. Various smart metering technologies have also been proposed to support the optimization on sustainable energy usage. Despite the obvious benefits of these technologies, people may still hesitate to adopt them because of possible privacy breach. On the other hand, we observe that the major target information for making the sustainable energy system smart is the aggregated statistics of energy usage, not the full detailed usage profiles which would compromise customers' privacy. Thus, how to design schemes to collect aggregated statistics while preserving customers' privacy becomes an important research problem. In this paper, we propose two schemes to deal with this problem. The first one can support dynamic profiling, which can extract aggregated statistical information without compromising individual privacy. The second one aims to extract correlation information among various factors for the smart system design and can also be used as an underlying tool for baseline inference and association rule mining.

Abstract: Future distribution networks with increasing level of solar PV penetration will be managed using smart grid technologies capable of producing appropriate and timely response during normal and abnormal operational events. Distribution feeder loads vary throughout the day according to the trend of consumption of the customers. Solar PV outputs fluctuate in proportion to irradiance level of sun. Simultaneous occurrence of both of these variations would result in various operating conditions that may lead to unexpected events, and would require a large amount of network data to be processed and analyzed for decision making. It is envisaged that such data will be available in the future grids with the availability of smart technologies and advanced communication in residential dwellings, commercial buildings and industrial complexes. In this paper, an advanced intelligent computational tool is developed to characterize and analyze the large amount of data associated with wide variations in network behavior using SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) and pattern recognition. The proposed tool is capable of dealing with network asymmetry, load unbalance, single-phase solar PV integration and their impacts on upstream networks and will assist in making right and timely decision to mitigate adverse impacts of solar PV. The proposed tool has been tested with a practical three-phase distribution system in Australia and can provide an extensive assessment with less computational efforts and time.

Abstract: The oscillation of frequency in power grid is studied in this paper. The possibility association of frequencies measured at different locations are modeled by a Bayesian network with the logical structure learned using Bayesian structure learning and real measurements in the U. S. power grid. Frequency data analysis and the detection of incorrect frequency measurements (caused by equipment error or malicious attack) are performed over the logical Bayesian network structure. Such application of Bayesian network is a powerful mathematical tool in computational intelligence. Without the physical power network topology information, a two-branch search-and-score structure learning algorithm with L-1 regulation is proposed to learn the logical structure, achieving around 97% correct prediction rate for future frequency and 92% detection rate for false frequency data with 2% false alarm rate. The tool of epidemic propagation over this logical network is also exploited to analyze the propagation of frequency changes. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, such logical structure is demonstrated to be well approximated by the Small World network model. And the propagation of frequency changes is demonstrated to be described by the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model quite well. The Bayesian structure obtained from the real measurement is statistically validated using a 5-fold training data and the Pearson system.

Abstract: Operational planning of power systems, especially in terms of overall reliability and security, is a key issue in the smart grid development. Hence, it is necessary to develop new strategies to cope with increasing uncertainties arising from the fast changing ways power systems are being operated. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to determine an optimal transmission network expansion plan considering the enhancement of small-signal stability through wide-scale deployment of the existing and planned transmission system assets. The dynamic model of the transmission network operational planning (TNOP) is solved based on a combination of the Mean-Variance Mapping Optimization (MVMO), and the classic dynamic programming method embedded with a heuristic procedure. Besides, a probabilistic eigenanalysis-based recursive method is proposed to determine the optimal control strategies that are highly relevant to the enhancement of the system small-signal stability performance throughout the planning horizon. Numerical results demonstrate the viewpoint and the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing optimal strategies of minimum cost while avoiding the instability risk associated to poorly damped low-frequency electromechanical oscillations.

Abstract: This paper introduces the application of state estimation to double bus double breaker distribution substations, which are typically used in the Korean power system, to improve the reliability of substation automation systems. In spite of the recent remarkable progress in the field of sensors and equipments, it is hard to detect device malfunctions or degraded devices automatically in the supervisory monitoring system. The object of the proposed system is not the state estimation itself, but its application to the supervisory detection of the malfunction or degradation of the devices. The supervisory monitoring process consists of a two step procedure-topology processing and normal state estimation. In a substation, the on-off states of the circuit breakers determine the topology. This paper mainly presents the topology processing expert system including the knowledge representation. The expert system is operated with a predefined period to identify and correct topological errors in the distribution substations. The proposed system is now in the field test stage in the Sanchung pilot substation and it will be applied to the next generation substation automation system in Korea.

Abstract: The traditional power grid system was constructed in a centralized and radial topology where power is generated and delivered from one end to the other. Conventional methods for unidirectional power flow analysis will no longer be effective to control renewable energy sources implemented at the consumption sector efficiently; new strategies are called for to facilitate the bidirectional flow incurred by power production of the distributed energy resource units. The transformation will require intelligent distribution automation by means of decentralized power management as well as information and communications technologies to actualize smart grid modernization. In this paper, we design autonomous distribution networks that take scalability into account by dividing the legacy distribution network into a set of subnetworks. We tackle the power flow and power balance issues individually in parallel to optimize the global distribution operation by our proposed power-control method. Meanwhile, we propose an overlay multi-tier communications infrastructure for the underlying power network to analyze the traffic of data information and control message required for associated power flow operation. Based on the proposed schemes, we show that we can potentially improve the utilization of renewable energy production and achieve data traffic reduction under decentralized operations as compared to legacy centralized management.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the power dispatch problem of distributed generators (DGs) for optimal operation of a microgrid. The objective is to minimize the fuel cost during the grid-connected operation, while ensuring stable operation after islanding. To achieve this goal, the economic dispatch (ED) problem and related constraints are formulated. The constraints considered in this study are: i) reserve for variation in load demand, ii) reserve for variation in the power outputs of non-dispatchable DGs, iii) flow limits between two adjacent areas, and iv) reserve for the stable islanded operation. The first three constraints, which have been employed in ED problem for conventional power systems, are modified to apply to Microgrids. We also provide a detailed formulation of the constraint for stable islanded operation in accordance with two power-sharing principles: i) fixed droop and ii) adjustable droop. The problem is solved using a modified direct search method, and the effect of the constraints on the operational cost is investigated via numerical simulations.

Abstract: This paper aims at providing a key agreement protocol for smart grid to cope with access control of appliances/devices located inside a Home Area Network (HAN) by a set of controllers outside the HAN. The commands/packets initiated by the controllers in crisis cases should be delivered fast and immune from any interruption. The HAN controller, which acts as a gateway, should not cause any delay by decrypting and re-encrypting the packets, nor should it has any chance to modify them. Considering the required level of security and quality of service, we design our protocol with an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach. We improve and implement the Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol in two steps. First, we propose an auxiliary mechanism that is an ECC version of PAKE, and then extend it to a multilayer consensus model. We reduce the number of hash functions to one, and utilize a primitive password shared between an appliance and HAN controller to construct four valid individual consensus and authenticated symmetric keys between the appliance and upstream controllers by exchanging only 12 packets. Security analysis presents that our protocol is resilient to various attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis shows that the delay caused by the security process is reduced by more than one half.

Abstract: Optimal control of large-scale wind farm has become a critical issue for the development of renewable energy systems and their integration into the power grid to provide reliable, secure, and efficient electricity. Among many enabling technologies, the latest research results from both the power and energy community and computational intelligence (CI) community have demonstrated that CI research could provide key technical innovations into this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach based on both trajectory and frequency domain information integrated with evolutionary algorithm to achieve the optimal control of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) based wind generation. Instead of optimizing all the control parameters, our key idea is to use the sensitivity analysis to first identify the critical parameters, the unified dominate control parameters (UDCP), to reduce the optimization complexity. Based on such selected parameters, we then use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal values to achieve the control objective. Simulation analysis and comparative studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of a framework for reliability analysis of substation automation (SA) system functions. The framework is based on probabilistic relational models which combines probabilistic reasoning offered by Bayesian networks together with architecture models in form of entity relationship diagrams. In the analysis, both the physical infrastructure, and the logical structure of the system, is regarded in terms of qualitative modeling and quantitative analysis. Moreover, the framework treats the aspect of failures caused by software. An example is detailed with the framework applied to an IEC 61850-based SA system. The logical structure, including functions and their relations, is modeled in accordance with Pieces of Information for COMmunication (PICOM) defined in the IEC 61850 standard. By applying PICOMs as frame of reference when modeling functions the model instantiation becomes more standardized compared to subjectively defining functions. A quantitative reliability analysis is performed on a function for tipping a circuit breaker in case of mismatch between currents. The result is presented both in terms of a qualitative architecture model and a quantitative result showing the probability of successful operation during a period of one year.

Abstract: The anticipated proliferation of cyber components for collecting information and controlling operations of smart grids increases their vulnerability to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.

Abstract: Advances in smart grid technology have yet to coalesce into a comprehensive solution integrating the landscape of future power systems. The microgrid concept may offer a solution for combining advanced components and enabling technologies within an infrastructure that must expand to meet emerging demands. As autonomous power system entities, microgrids require robust real-time power management and control to simultaneously operate jointly with the utility, provide reliable service, and help achieve customer-driven objectives utilizing local power system assets. In this paper, a decentralized control architecture for microgrids is presented, along with a simulation environment appropriate for on-going investigations into real-time, agent-based decision-making. Challenges faced by operating self-organizing multi-agent system (MAS) are presented, as well as results for a representative power management scenario for a multi-asset microgrid capable of operating in grid-interconnected or islanded mode. The system and formulations presented demonstrate the viability and capability of decentralized agent-based control for microgrids and illustrate their potential towards achieving smart grid goals.

Abstract: This study estimates total world market volumes of HTS power industry, one of the main smart grid equipment in the future when the market penetration ratio reaches 100% in the future. The results of this paper are based on the GOULDEN Report providing the total market volumes of conventional power industry for the world market. This study determines the market penetration ratio using the judgment method with market penetration S-curve induced from Delphi method and Product Life Cycle from 2011 (expected to be a launching year, not the actual year) to 2050 (expected to be a final target year). For this purpose, HTS market penetration ratio of each stage, so called innovation, early adapters, early/late majority and laggard stage, is analyzed using S-curve and thus calculated the total future market volumes of HTS equipment. In conclusion, this paper shows the quantitative analysis for HTS cable, FCL, transformer and rotational machine in the world market.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the stochastic reliability of smart grids with two classes of energy users-traditional energy users and opportunistic energy users (e. g., smart appliances or electric vehicles), and investigate the procurement of energy supply from both conventional generation (base-load and fast-start) and wind generation via multi-timescale scheduling. Specifically, in day-ahead scheduling, with the distributional information of wind generation and demand, we characterize the optimal procurement of the energy supply from base-load generation and the day-ahead price; in real-time scheduling, with the realizations of wind generation and the demand of traditional energy users, we optimize real-time price to manage opportunistic demand so as to achieve system-wise reliability and efficiency. More specifically, we consider two different models for opportunistic energy users: non-persistent and persistent, and characterize the optimal scheduling and pricing decisions for both models by exploiting various computational and optimization tools. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling and pricing schemes can effectively manage opportunistic demand and enhance system reliability, thus have the potential to improve the penetration of wind generation.

Abstract: Many operations in power grids, such as fault detection and event location estimation, depend on precise timing information. In this paper, a novel Time Synchronization Attack (TSA) is proposed to attack the timing information in smart grid. Since many applications in smart grid utilize synchronous measurements and most of the measurement devices are equipped with global positioning system (GPS) for precise timing, it is highly probable to attack the measurement system by spoofing the GPS. The effectiveness of TSA is demonstrated for three applications of phasor measurement unit (PMU) in smart grid, namely transmission line fault detection, voltage stability monitoring and event locationing. The validity of TSA is demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Abstract: Smart grid can be visualized as an intelligent control system over sensors and communication platforms. Recently, wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) have shown its advantages for smart grid by providing rich surveillance information for grid failure detection and recovery, energy source monitoring, asset management, security, etc. On the other hand, cognitive radio (CR) networks have been identified as a key wireless technology to reduce the communication interferences and improve the bandwidth efficiency for smart grid communication. There is an essential need to use the CR communication platform to support large-size and time-sensitive multimedia delivery for future smart grid system. In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous characteristics of smart grid traffic including multimedia and propose a priority-based traffic scheduling approach for CR communication infrastructure based smart grid system according to the various traffic types of smart grid such as control commands, multimedia sensing data and meter readings. Specifically, we develop CR channel allocation and traffic scheduling schemes taking into consideration of channel switch and spectrum sensing errors, and solve a system utility optimization problem for smart grid communication system. Our solutions are demonstrated through both analyzes and simulations. This research opens a new vista of future smart grid communications.

Abstract: In this study, Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm is developed for the prediction of the optimal sizing coefficient of Small Autonomous Hybrid Power System (SAHPS) in remote areas. BBO algorithm is used to evaluate optimal component sizing and operational strategy by minimizing the total cost of SAHPS, while guaranteeing the availability of energy. Due to the complexity of the SAHPS design with nonlinear integral planning, BBO algorithm is used to solve the problem. The developed BBO Algorithm has been applied to design the wind/PV/hydro hybrid energy systems to supply a colony located in the area of Jaipur, Rajasthan (India) during the period of January, 2010 to January 2011. It is clear from the results that the proposed BBO method has excellent convergence property, requires less computational time and can avoid the shortcoming of premature convergence of other optimization techniques to obtain a better solution.

Abstract: Power networks and information systems become more and more interdependent to ensure better supports for the functionality as well as improve the economy. However, power networks also tend to be more vulnerable due to the cascading failures from their interdependent information systems, i.e., the failures in the information systems can cause the failures of the coupled portion in power networks. Therefore, the accurate vulnerability assessment of interdependent power networks is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network nodes. In this paper, we study the Interdependent Power Network Disruptor (IPND) optimization problem to identify critical nodes in an interdependent power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its interdependent communication network. First, we show the IPND problem is NP-hard to be approximated within the factor of (2 - epsilon). Despite its intractability, we propose a greedy framework with novel centrality functions based on the networks' interdependencies, to efficiently solve this problem in a timely manner. An extensive experiment not only illustrates the effectiveness of our approach on networks with different topologies and interdependencies, but also highlights some important observations which help to sharpen the robustness of interdependent networks in the future.

Abstract: The target for South Korea's domestic energy consumption is to increase the proportion of the total energy consumption supplied by renewable energy to 11% by 2030. Increasing renewable energy generation has become a natural trend, thereby making it an essential factor to be considered in research for the development of a smart grid. The power system of Jeju Island is connected to the mainland (the Korean Peninsula) through HVDC #1, with another line, HVDC #2, presently under construction. The purpose of the first HVDC construction was essentially to supply a portion of the power supply to the Jeju area. However, if the construction of HVDC #2 is completed, the role of the Jeju HVDC system in the Jeju power system will be changed significantly. If flexibility through the operation of an HVDC system is increased, more wind farms can be built on Jeju Island. In addition, depending on the operation of HVDC #1 and #2, the stability of the Jeju power system will be changed greatly. In this paper, the operation of the HVDC lines and its impacts are analyzed.

Abstract: This paper presents an information-theoretic approach to address the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problemin electric power systems. Different from the conventional 'topological observability' based approaches, this paper advocates a much more refined, information-theoretic criterion, namely the mutual information (MI) between PMU measurements and power system states. The proposed MI criterion not only includes observability as a special case, but also rigorously models the uncertainty reduction on power system states from PMU measurements. Thus, it can generate highly informative PMU configurations. The MI criterion can also facilitate robust PMU placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU outages. We propose a greedy PMU placement algorithm, and show that it achieves an approximation ratio of (1 - 1/e) for any PMU placement budget. We further show that the performance is the best that one can achieve, in the sense that it is NP-hard to achieve any approximation ratio beyond (1 - 1/e) Such performance guarantee makes the greedy algorithm very attractive in the practical scenario of multi-stage installations for utilities with limited budgets. Finally, simulation results demonstrate near-optimal performance of the proposed PMU placement algorithm.

Abstract: The imposed communication network brings more vulnerabilities to the evolving smart grid. Therefore, defensive techniques such as intrusion detection will need to be deployed in this already complicated system. Deployment and runtime cost due to the defensive trust systems will affect the original function of smart grid system without careful planning and design. This paper is an effort to address this important issue. In particular, the set packing algorithm is used to optimize the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a trust node aware optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing in the communications of the nodes. Also, an algorithm to identify new trust node(s) is presented to address the fault tolerance requirement of the smart grid system. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach is promising by providing secure, efficient, and reliable communications in the smart grid network.

Abstract: In this paper we focus our attention on the long-term load forecasting problem, that is the prediction of energy consumption for several months ahead (up to one or more years), useful in order to ease the proper scheduling of operative conditions (such as the planning of fuel supply). While several effective techniques are available in the short-term framework, no reliable methods have been proposed for long-term predictions. For this purpose, we describe in this work a new procedure, which exploits the Empirical Mode Decomposition method to disaggregate a time series into two sets of components, respectively describing the trend and the local oscillations of the energy consumption values. These sets are then used for training Support Vector Regression models. The experimental results, obtained both on a public-domain and on an office building dataset, allow to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The necessity to promote smart grid (SG) has been recognized with a strong consensus. The SG integrates electrical grids and communication infrastructures and forms an intelligent electricity network working with all connected components to deliver sustainable electricity supplies. Many advanced communication technologies have been identified for SG applications with a potential to significantly enhance the overall efficiency of power grids. In this paper, the challenges and applications of communication technologies in SG are discussed. In particular, we identify three major challenges to implement SG communication systems, including standards interoperability, cognitive access to unlicensed radio spectra, and cyber security. The issues to implement SG communications on an evolutional path and its future trends are also addressed. The aim of this paper is to offer a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art researches on SG communications.

Abstract: Development of "Q" and "R" matrices for designing a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is still a research challenge. The theory says they should belong to the group of positive definite matrices, so we need to find out the most suitable amongst them in order to obtain the desired response. In this paper biogeography based optimization (BBO) technique has been applied to come up with the best "Q" and "R" matrices such that the frequency excursion following a disturbance in a microgrid is minimized. As all the states in a practical system may not be measurable hence, we have used Kalman estimator to estimate them. These estimated states along with other measured states are used by the LQR to produce the desired control signal. The microgrid is made smarter by using the agent based scheme integrated with a master controller and a proper communication protocol. The simulation results show that the proposed approach improves the microgrid frequency response and also gives a new alternative method for frequency control of a smart microgrid.

Abstract: The Development of smart grids offers new opportunities to improve the efficiency of operating and controlling distribution systems. It allows network operators to optimize the use of dispersed generation resources and enables real-time communication between customers and utility service providers to allow optimization and balancing of energy usage. Such an improvement in the flexibility and control of the distribution network is only possible if the control center operator has more accurate knowledge of the real-time situation of the network. The Korean Smart Distribution Management System (KSDMS) project was started in 2009 to achieve advanced distribution operation for potential smart grid systems in Korea. In this paper, we summarize two KSDMS design strategies for situational awareness in real-time distribution operation. One is the preparation of standardized data acquisition networks. In the KSDMS, numerous data related to the voltage, current, faults, power quality and load profiles of the network are gathered using a standardized communication method based on IEC 61850. The other is a real-time security analysis tools for smart distribution systems, designed to provide the distribution operator with accurate real-time situational information and predictive operation. We present a database design which can be used commonly for all security analysis programs in KSDMS.

Abstract: We propose a decentralized security framework for smart grids that supports data aggregation and access control. Data can be aggregated by home area network (HAN), building area network (BAN), and neighboring area network (NAN) in such a way that the privacy of customers is protected. We use homomorphic encryption technique to achieve this. The consumer data that is collected is sent to the substations where it is monitored by remote terminal units (RTU). The proposed access control mechanism uses attribute-based encryption (ABE) which gives selective access to consumer data stored in data repositories and used by different smart grid users. RTUs and users have attributes and cryptographic keys distributed by several key distribution centers (KDC). RTUs send data encrypted under a set of attributes. Since RTUs are maintained in the substations they are well protected in control rooms and are assumed to be trusted. Users can decrypt information provided they have valid attributes. The access control scheme is distributed in nature and does not rely on a single KDC to distribute the keys which makes the approach robust. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work on smart grids, which integrates these two important security components (privacy preserving data aggregation and access control) and the first paper which addresses access control in smart grids.

Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling of specific Smart Grid (SG) communication requirements from a data networking research perspective, as a general approach to the study of different access technologies suitable for the last mile (LM). SGLM networks serve customers' Energy Services Interfaces. From functional descriptions of SG, a traffic model is developed. It is then applied to the study of an access architecture based on leased lines from local broadband access providers. This permits consideration of the potential starvation of domestic traffic, which is avoided by applying well-known traffic management techniques. From previous results obtained for a purpose-built WiMAX SGLM network, the intuition that a leased broadband access yields lower latencies is verified. In general, the proposed traffic model simplifies the design of benchmarks for the comparison of candidate access technologies.

Abstract: In smart grids, smart meters may potentially be attacked or compromised to cause certain security risks. It is challenging to identify malicious meters when there are a large number of users. In this paper, we explore the malicious meter inspection (MMI) problem in neighborhood area smart grids. We propose a suite of inspection algorithms in a progressive manner. First, we present a basic scanning method, which takes linear time to accomplish inspection. The scanning method is efficient when the malicious meter ratio is high. Then, we propose a binary-tree-based inspection algorithm, which performs better than scanning when the malicious meter ratio is low. Finally, we employ an adaptive-tree-based algorithm, which leverages advantages of both the scanning and binary-tree inspections. Our approaches are tailored to fit both static and dynamic situations. The theoretical and experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the adaptive tree approach.

Abstract: In this paper, a modified dynamic phasor estimation method for protection relays is proposed to calculate the dynamic phasor of a fundamental frequency component with time-variant amplitude. The fault current is assumed to be the combination of a decaying dc offset, a decaying fundamental frequency component and harmonics with constant amplitude. The exponential functions of the decaying dc offset and fundament frequency component are replaced by Taylor series. Then, the LS (Least Square) technique is used to estimate the magnitudes and the time constants of decaying components. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by using computer-simulated signals based on simple equations and fault current signals collected from DFIG wind farm model in MATLAB Simulink. The test results indicate that the proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the decaying amplitude and the time constant of the fundamental frequency component.

Abstract: Future power grid systems are envisioned to be integrated with many distributed renewable energy sources (DRES). Energy storage is a key technology to enable reliable and cost-effective renewable energy. Given the fact that a large-scale energy storage device is usually costly to install and operate, we are naturally led to the following question: How much storage is necessary to guarantee the stability of a power grid network with DRESs? This paper represents a first step in systematically exploring the tradeoff between the capacity of energy storage devices and the outage probability, i.e., the probability of the occurrence of imbalance between the supply and demand. We first propose a secure scheduling and dispatch (SSD) algorithm that is capable of maintaining the grid stability in the presence of volatility in the power generation. We then derive a closed-form bound to quantify the tradeoff between the storage capacity and the outage probability. Under mild assumptions, we show that the outage probability decreases exponentially with respect to the square of the storage capacity. This finding implies that energy storage is an effective and economically viable solution to maintain the stability of a smart grid network, even in the presence of many volatile and intermittent renewable energy sources. The impact of correlation in energy generation on the stability of a smart grid network is also investigated.

Abstract: In this paper, multiuser selection scheme is employed in dynamic home area networks (HANs) for smart grid communications, to reduce the effects of fading at the receiver part of smart meter. The performance of multiuser selection scheme is evaluated in two cases: in the absence of interference and in the presence of multiuser interference (MUI). In the former case, the closed-form capacity outage probability as well as the numerical values of the bit error rate (BER) are obtained via the probability density function (PDF) of signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classic indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channel. In the latter case, the multiuser interference cancellation coefficient as a random variable is added for the calculation of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). In addition, due to free space path loss and log-normal shadowing, the sum of MUI is treated as another log-normal-distributed random variable by exploiting central limit theorem. Numerical results show that the performance of multiuser selection scheme in HANs of smart grid is due to several factors, i.e., total number of devices in HANs, traffic intensity, modulation scheme, and multiuser interference cancellation coefficient, etc.

Abstract: The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) that are currently under development for future smart grid systems can enable load aggregators to have bidirectional communications with both the grid and Electric Vehicles (EVs) to obtain real-time price and load information, and to adjust EV charging schedules in real time. In addition, Energy Storage (ES) can be utilized by the aggregator to mitigate the impact of uncertainty and inaccurate prediction. In this paper, we study a problem of scheduling EV charging with ES from an electricity market perspective with joint consideration for the aggregator energy trading in the day-ahead and real-time markets. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to provide optimal solutions as well as a simple polynomial-time heuristic algorithm based on LP rounding. In addition, we present a communication protocol for interactions among the aggregator, the ES, the power grid, and EVs, and demonstrate how to integrate the proposed scheduling approach in real-time charging operations. Extensive simulation results based on real electricity price and load data have been presented to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to show how several key parameters affect its performance.

Abstract: The smart grid features ubiquitous interconnections of power equipments to enable two-way flows of electricity and information for various intelligent power management applications, such as accurate relay protection and timely demand response. To fulfill such pervasive equipment interconnects, a full-fledged communication infrastructure is of great importance in the smart grid. There have been extensive works on disparate layouts of communication infrastructures in the smart grid by surveying feasible wired or wireless communication technologies, such as power line communications and cellular networks. Nevertheless, towards an operable, cost-efficient and backward-compatible communication solution, more comprehensive and practical understandings are still urgently needed regarding communication requirements, applicable protocols, and system performance. Through such comprehensive understandings, we are prone to answer a fundamental question, how to design, implement and integrate communication infrastructures with power systems. In this paper, we address this issue in a case study of a smart grid demonstration project, the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) systems. By investigating communication scenarios, we first clarify communication requirements implied in FREEDM use cases. Then, we adopt a predominant protocol framework, Distributed Network Protocol 3.0 over TCP/IP (DNP3 over TCP/IP), to practically establish connections between electric devices for data exchanges in a small-scale FREEDM system setting, Green Hub. Within the real-setting testbed, we measure the message delivery performance of the DNP3-based communication infrastructure. Our results reveal that diverse timing requirements of message deliveries are arguably primary concerns in a way that dominates viabilities of protocols or schemes in the communication infrastructure of the smart grid. Accordingly, although DNP3 over TCP/IP is widely considered as a smart grid communication solution, it cannot satisfy communication requirements in some time-critical scenarios, such as relay protections, which claim a further optimization on the protocol efficiency of DNP3.

Abstract: Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a technology that would allow consumers to exhibit price elasticity of demand under smart-grid environments. The market power of the generation and transmission companies can be mitigated when consumers respond to price signals. Such responses by consumers can also result in reductions in price spikes, consumer energy bills, and emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In this paper, we use the Electricity Market Complex Adaptive System (EMCAS), an agent-based model that simulates restructured electricity markets, to explore the impact of consumers' price elasticity of demand on the performance of the electricity market. An 11-node test network with eight generation companies and five aggregated consumers is simulated for a period of one month. Results are provided and discussed for a case study based on the Korean power system.

Abstract: The energy resource scheduling is becoming increasingly important, as the use of distributed resources is intensified and massive gridable vehicle (V2G) use is envisaged. This paper presents a methodology for day-ahead energy resource scheduling for smart grids considering the intensive use of distributed generation and V2G. The main focus is the comparison of different EV management approaches in the day-ahead energy resources management, namely uncontrolled charging, smart charging, V2G and Demand Response (DR) programs in the V2G approach. Three different DR programs are designed and tested (trip reduce, shifting reduce and reduce+shifting). Other important contribution of the paper is the comparison between deterministic and computational intelligence techniques to reduce the execution time. The proposed scheduling is solved with a modified particle swarm optimization. Mixed integer non-linear programming is also used for comparison purposes. Full ac power flow calculation is included to allow taking into account the network constraints. A case study with a 33-bus distribution network and 2000 V2G resources is used to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is the core component in a smart grid that exhibits a highly complex network configuration. AMI comprises heterogeneous cyber-physical components, which are interconnected through different communication media, protocols, and security measures. They are operated using different data delivery modes and security policies. The inherent complexity and heterogeneity in AMI significantly increases the potential of security threats due to misconfiguration or absence of defense, which may cause devastating damage to AMI. Therefore, there is a need for creating a formal model that can represent the global behavior of AMI configuration in order to verify the potential threats.
In this paper, we present SmartAnalyzer, a security analysis tool, which offers manifold contributions: (i) formal modeling of AMI configuration that includes device configurations, topology, communication properties, interactions among the devices, data flows, and security properties; (ii) formal modeling of AMI invariants and user-driven constraints based on the interdependencies among AMI device configurations, security properties, and security control guidelines; (iii) verifying the AMI configuration's compliance with security constraints using a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver; (iv) reporting of potential security threats based on constraint violations, (v) analyzing the impact of potential threats on the system; and (vi) systematic diagnosing of SMT unsatisfiable traces and providing necessary remediation plans. The accuracy and scalability of the tool are evaluated on an AMI testbed and various synthetic test networks.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is emerging as an attractive paradigm in smart grid, and provides power and information services by periodically collecting power status of battery vehicles (BVs). During a BV's interaction with power grid, it may be in one of the following states: charging, fully-charged (FC), and discharging. In this paper, we identify that there are unique security challenges in a BV's different battery states. Accordingly, we propose a battery status-aware authentication scheme (BASA) to address the issue for V2G networks. In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator. In addition, we perform comprehensive security analysis, which shows that BASA achieves both privacy preservation and security protection during battery state transitions. The analysis also indicates that battery status awareness is crucial for BVs' secure operations for V2G networks in smart grid.

Abstract: This paper presents the Euclidean norm based new power quality index (PQI), which is directly related to the distortion power generated from nonlinear loads, to apply for a practical distribution power network by improving the performance of the previous PQI proposed by the authors. The proposed PQI is formed as a combination of two factors, which are the electrical load composition rate (LCR) and the Euclidean norm of total harmonic distortions (THDs) in measured voltage and current waveforms. The reduced multivariate polynomial (RMP) model with the one-shot training property is applied to estimate the LCR. Based on the proposed PQI, the harmonic pollution ranking, which indicates how much negative effect each nonlinear load has on the point of common coupling (PCC) with respect to distortion power, is determined. Its effectiveness and validity are verified by the experimental results from its prototype's implementation in a laboratory with a single-phase 3 kW photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected inverter, which contributes to a small distortion in voltage at the PCC, and practical nonlinear loads. Then, the harmonic current injection model based time-domain simulations are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed PQI under the other conditions with different nonlinear loads.

Abstract: Demand response is a key feature of the smart grid. The addition of bidirectional communication to today's power grid can provide real-time pricing (RTP) to customers via smart meters. A growing number of appliance companies have started to design and produce smart appliances which embed intelligent control modules to implement residential demand response based on RTP. However, most of the current residential load scheduling schemes are centralized and based on either day-ahead pricing (DAP) or predicted price, which can deviate significantly from the RTP. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme based on the optimal stopping rule as a real-time distributed scheduling algorithm for smart appliances' automation control. It determines the best time for appliances' operation to balance electricity bill reduction and inconvenience resulting from the operation delay. It is shown that our scheme is a distributed threshold policy when no constraint is considered. When a total power constraint exists, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be implemented in either a centralized or distributed fashion. Our scheme has low complexity and can be easily implemented. Simulation results validate proposed scheduling scheme shifts the operation to off-peak times and consequently leads to significant electricity bill saving with reasonable waiting time.

Abstract: This paper focuses on system monitoring and alarm processing and the use of those alarms for economic decision in the nodal electricity market. The task of an Intelligent Economic Alarm Processor (IEAP) is to analyze thousands of alarm messages and extract useful information that explains cause-effect sequences associated with the unexpected contingencies. A graphical Fuzzy Reasoning Petri-nets (FRPN) model that uses fuzzy logic parameters to effectively tackle the uncertainties is built. The economic alarm processor module then processes the fault event signal, analyzes the impact on the market operation activities and different participants, and gives recommendations to optimize the total economic impact under fault scenarios. A contingency-based strategic bidding model concept is proposed to help the market participants take advantages of the latest system operation information and maximize their benefits over the competitors.

Abstract: Due to the recent global trend toward stricter restrictions on both greenhouse gases emission and energy consumption, there is an emerging attention on electric vehicles (EVs). It is anticipated that proliferation of EV will be expanded rapidly in the near future. Accordingly, there is a need to analyze the consumer preferences for the EVs as the basic data for developing the relevant industries' strategies in the newly emerging market of EVs or establishing the government policies to popularize EVs. This paper analyzes the consumer preferences for the EV on the basis of the stated preference data from consumers in Korea. A conjoint method and a mixed logit model using the Bayesian approach were used to estimate the preferences of consumers. The stated preference data of the conjoint method is collected through a face-to-face survey conducted in June 2009. The consumer preferences on the key attributes that affect the choices of EV are estimated by a mixed logit model. Marginal willingness to pay is calculated to quantitatively analyze the consumer preferences on the key attributes. The results of this paper show that the consumers have greater preference for EV with swappable battery rather than unswappable battery, and for lump-sum payment rather than installment of the subsidies.

Abstract: This paper illustrates the development of an intelligent local area signals based controller for damping low-frequency oscillations in power systems. The controller is trained offline to perform well under a wide variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural network based system identification eliminates the need to develop accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement units at generating stations within an area of the system. These representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the system "seen" by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with simulations of the system. Results obtained on the 68-bus New England/New York benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations without additional control effort.

Abstract: Decentralized inverter control is essential in distributed generation (DG) microgrids for low deployment/operation cost and high reliability. However, decentralized inverter control suffers from a limited system stability mainly because of the lack of communications among different inverters. In this paper, we investigate stability enhancement of the droop based decentralized inverter control in microgrids. Specifically, we propose a power sharing based control strategy which incorporates the information of the total real and reactive power generation of all DG units. The information is acquired by a wireless network (such as a WiFi, ZigBee, and/or cellular communication network) in a decentralized manner. Based on the desired power sharing of each DG unit and the acquired information of total generation, additional control terms are added to the traditional droop controller. We evaluate the performance of the proposed control strategy based on small-signal stability analysis. As timely communication may not be established for a microgrid with low-cost wireless communication devices, two kinds of analytical models are developed with respect to negligible and nonnegligible communication delays, respectively. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the system stability under the proposed control strategy with respect to different communication delays.

Abstract: In this paper a new approach using Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is presented for placing Distributed Generators (DGs) in radial distribution systems. The approach is making use of a multiple objective planning framework, named an Improved Multi-objective HS (IMOHS), to evaluate the impact of DG placement and sizing for an optimal development of the distribution system. In this study, the optimum sizes and locations of DG units are found by considering the power losses and voltage profile as objective functions. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated in two distribution networks, where the qualitative comparisons are made against a well-known technique, known as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Furthermore, the results obtained are compared with those available in the literature.

Abstract: Smart sensing and wireless communication technologies enable the electric power grid system to deliver electricity more efficiently through the dynamic analysis of the electricity demand and supply. The current solution is to extend the traditional static electricity pricing strategy to a time-based one where peak-time prices are defined to influence electricity usage behavior of customers. However, the time-based pricing strategy is not truly dynamic and the electricity resource cannot be optimally utilized in real time. In this paper, we propose a usage-based dynamic pricing (UDP) scheme for smart grid in a community environment, which enables the electricity price to correspond to the electricity usage in real time. In the UDP scheme, to simplify price management and reduce communication overhead, we introduce distributed community gateways as proxies of the utility company to timely respond to the price enquiries from the community customers. We consider both community-wide electricity usage and individual electricity usage as factors into price management: a customer gets higher electricity unit price if its own electricity usage becomes larger under certain conditions of the community- wide collective electricity usage. Additionally, we protect the privacy of the customers by restricting the disclosure of the individual electricity usage to the community gateways. Lastly, we provide privacy and performance analysis to demonstrate that the UDP scheme supports real-time dynamic pricing in an efficient and privacy-preserving manner.

Abstract: In this paper, a communication-based load scheduling protocol is proposed for in-home appliances connected over a home area network. Specifically, a joint access and scheduling approach for appliances is developed to enable in-home appliances to coordinate power usage so that the total energy demand for the home is kept below a target value. The proposed protocol considers both "schedulable" appliances which have delay flexibility, and "critical" appliances which consume power as they desire. An optimization problem is formulated for the energy management controller to decide the target values for each time slot, by incorporating the variation of electricity prices and distributed wind power uncertainty. We model the evolution of the protocol as a two-dimensional Markov chain, and derive the steady-state distribution, by which the average delay of an appliance is then obtained. Simulation results verify the analysis and show cost saving to customers using the proposed scheme.

Abstract: A major source of inefficiency in power grids is the underutilization of generation capacity. This is mainly because load demand during peak hours is much larger than that during off-peak hours. Moreover, extra generation capacity is needed to maintain a security margin above peak load demand. As load demand keeps increasing and two-way communications are enabled by smart meters (SMs), demand response (DR) has been proposed as an alternative to installing new power plants in smart grids. DR makes use of real-time schemes to allow users to modify their load demand patterns according to their energy consumption costs. In particular, when load demand is high, energy consumption cost will be high and users may decide to postpone certain amount of their consumption needs. This strategy may effectively reduce the peak load demand and increases the off-peak demand, and hence could increase existing generation capacity utilization and reduce the need to install extra generation plants. In this paper, we consider a third-party managing the energy consumption of a group of users, and formulate the load scheduling problem as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem (CMOP). The optimization objectives are to minimize energy consumption cost and to maximize a certain utility, which can be conflicting and non-commensurable. We then develop two evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to obtain the Pareto-front solutions and the epsilon-Pareto front solutions to the CMOP, respectively, which are validated by extensive simulation results.

Abstract: Powerline communications (PLC) is a favorable technique for many smart grid applications. By transmitting information over the existing powerline infrastructure, PLC has the benefit of low deployment cost. However, due to low transmit power, limited bandwidth, and harsh channel conditions, reliable long-distance and high-capacity PLC is challenging. Relay-aided (RA-) PLC is promising in addressing these issues. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the amplify-and-forward (AF) RA-PLC system from an information-theoretic perspective. The capacity of AF-based RA-PLC is analyzed for frequency-selective PLC channels. The capacity bounds are derived, and the optimal power allocation between the transmitting nodes and the optimal power distribution over the signal frequency band are obtained. The capacity benefits and features of AF-based RA-PLC are evaluated with two prevalent powerline channel models. Based on the signal attenuation model, the capacity of AF-based RA-PLC is compared with direct-link (DL-) PLC, and the effect of relay location is revealed. In addition, based on the transmission line (TL) model, the effects of branch density and load impedance on the capacity of AF-based RA-PLC are evaluated.

Abstract: The increasing incorporation of renewable energy sources and the emergence of new forms and patterns of electricity consumption are contributing to the upsurge in the complexity of power grids. A bottom-up-agent-based approach is able to handle the new environment, such that the system reliability can be maintained and costs reduced. However, this approach leads to possible conflicting interests between maintaining secure grid operation and the market requirements. This paper proposes a strategy to solve the conflicting interests in order to achieve overall optimal performance in the electricity supply system. The method is based on a cooperative game theory to optimally allocate resources from all (local) actors, i.e., network operators, active producers, and consumers. Via this approach, agent-based functions, for facilitating both network services and energy markets, can be integrated and coordinated. Simulations are performed to verify the proposed concept on a medium voltage 30-bus test network. Results show the effectiveness of the approach in optimally harmonizing functions of power routing and matching.

Abstract: Data communications infrastructure will play an important role to transfer various information in smart grid. In this paper, we consider the reliability of the smart grid data communications infrastructure and its impact on the power consumption and supply optimizations. For optimizing the power consumption, we consider a deferrable load scheduling method which is modeled by using a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) model, taking into account the unavailability of the home area network (HAN) and neighborhood area network (NAN) gateways. For optimizing the power supply, we consider an economic dispatch method which is modeled by using stochastic programming (SP), taking into account the unavailability of the exact power demand and supply information. The power consumption and supply costs are analyzed. In addition, we show how these costs can be reduced through the deployment of component redundancy in the smart grid data communications infrastructure.

Abstract: Applications of cyber technologies improve the quality of monitoring and decision making in smart grid. These cyber technologies are vulnerable to malicious attacks, and compromising them can have serious technical and economical problems. This paper specifies the effect of compromising each measurement on the price of electricity, so that the attacker is able to change the prices in the desired direction (increasing or decreasing). Attacking and defending all measurements are impossible for the attacker and defender, respectively. This situation is modeled as a zero-sum game between the attacker and defender. The game defines the proportion of times that the attacker and defender like to attack and defend different measurements, respectively. From the simulation results based on the PJM 5-Bus test system, we can show the effectiveness and properties of the studied game.

Abstract: The elastic behavior of the demand consumption jointly used with other available resources such as distributed generation (DG) can play a crucial role for the success of smart grids. The intensive use of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and the technical and contractual constraints result in large-scale non linear optimization problems that require computational intelligence methods to be solved.
This paper proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based methodology to support the minimization of the operation costs of a virtual power player that manages the resources in a distribution network and the network itself. Resources include the DER available in the considered time period and the energy that can be bought from external energy suppliers. Network constraints are considered. The proposed approach uses Gaussian mutation of the strategic parameters and contextual self-parameterization of the maximum and minimum particle velocities.
The case study considers a real 937 bus distribution network, with 20310 consumers and 548 distributed generators. The obtained solutions are compared with a deterministic approach and with PSO without mutation and Evolutionary PSO, both using self-parameterization.

Abstract: PMU data are expected to be GPS-synchronized measurements with highly accurate magnitude and phase angle information. However, this potential accuracy is not always achieved in actual field installations due to various causes. It has been observed in some PMU measurements that the voltage and current phasors are corrupted by noise and bias errors. This paper presents a novel method for detection and correction of errors in PMU measurements with the concept of calibration factors. The proposed method uses nonlinear optimal estimation theory to calculate calibration factor using a traditional model of an untransposed transmission line with unbalanced load. This method is intended to work as a prefiltering scheme that can significantly improve the accuracy of the PMU measurement for further use in system state estimation, transient stability monitoring, wide area protection, etc. Case studies based on simulated data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Flywheel energy storage (FES) has attracted new interest for uninterruptable power supply (UPS) applications in a facility microgrid. Due to technological advancements, the FES has become a promising alternative to traditional battery storage technologies. This paper aims at developing a tool to demonstrate the use of FES units for securing critical loads during a utility outage in a microgrid environment. The FES is modeled, simulated and evaluated in the MATLAB/SIMULINK (R) environment. A data center is used to represent a facility microgrid case study. It illustrates how an FES can help improve the load serving capability and provide a highly reliable ride-through capability for critical loads during a utility disturbance. In comparison with batteries, the application of FES for power security is new on the horizon. This limits the availability of experimental data. The simulation model presented in this paper will enable the analysis of short-term ride-through applications of FES during an islanded operation of a facility microgrid. As a result, it can provide a guideline for facility engineers in a data center or other types of facility microgrids to better design their backup power systems based on FES technology, which can be used in combination with traditional fuel-based generators.

Abstract: The dynamical behavior of power systems under stress frequently deviates from the predictions of deterministic models. Model-free methods for detecting signs of excessive stress before instability occurs would therefore be valuable. The mathematical frameworks of "fast-slow systems" and "critical slowing down" can describe the statistical behavior of dynamical systems that are subjected to random perturbations as they approach points of instability. This paper builds from existing literature on fast-slow systems to provide evidence that time series data alone can be useful to estimate the temporal distance of a power system to a critical transition, such as voltage collapse. Our method is based on identifying evidence of critical slowing down in a single stream of synchronized phasor measurements. Results from a single machine, stochastic infinite bus model, a three machine/nine bus system and the Western North American disturbance of 10 August 1996 illustrate the utility of the proposed method.

Abstract: Many commercial office buildings have become micro smart grids with on-site power generations, storage devices, and uncertain demands. Due to the pervasive nonlinearity and randomness of such a multi-energy system, simulation is usually the only faithful way to accurately describe the system dynamics and for performance evaluation. However, simulation is usually time-consuming and each sample path provides only noisy observations. Thus finding the optimal energy management policy is nontrivial. In this paper, a joint schedule problem is considered to schedule solar power, wind power, combined cooling, heating, and power generation, high temperature chiller, liquid desiccant fresh air unit, battery, and power grid in order to satisfy the electricity load, sensible heat load, and latent heat load in buildings with the minimal expected cost. We make two major contributions in this paper. First, three simulation-based policy improvement (SBPI) methods are developed to improve from given base policies. Second, the performance of these methods are systematically analyzed through numerical experiments. We show that when there are sufficient computing budget, the SBPI methods improve the given base policies. Different methods are recommended for problems with different computing budget. Sensitivity analysis of the policy and the value of accurate information are also discussed.

Abstract: This paper discusses how micro-grids availability during natural disasters and in their aftermath can be assessed. The analysis focuses on two critical groups of components that allow micro-grids to improve power supply availability: distributed generators and local energy storage. For distributed generators and, due to their importance during natural disasters, this paper presents a novel focus by exploring the importance of lifelines for system availability. Renewable energy sources are identified as valuable distributed generation assets during disasters because they do not require lifelines; yet, their variable generation nature leads to the need for significant local energy storage. Additional local energy storage may be desirable as a backup solution to address potential failures that would blackout the load because they reduce the impact of lifeline performance during disasters on micro-grid availability. Analysis of micro-grids availability is performed based on Markov state space models and calculated using minimal cut sets approximations. This calculation method has the advantage of being very simple, not requiring extensive knowledge in the subject or computational needs. Results are verified with numerical experiments using Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: Overcurrent relays are widely used for power systems protection. Transmission side uses more directional type relays, while distribution systems, e. g., radial and ring-main sub-transmission systems use nondirectional types. The fault direction may be forward (between relay and grid), or reverse (between relay and source), the normal power flow being from source to the grid. Traditional directional overcurrent relays utilize the reference voltage phasor for estimating the direction of the fault. This requires measurement of both current and voltage using respective sensors. This makes the directional overcurrent relays more costly than the nondirectional type. In this paper, a novel current-only directional detection possibility is highlighted along with theoretical, test signal analysis, challenges and associated solutions. Possible utilizations of the current-only directional relay in the distribution side protection are described, which is a key focus area for enabling the smart grid.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical active power management strategy for a medium voltage (MV) islanded microgrid including a multihybrid power conversion system (MHPCS). To guarantee excellent power management, a modular power conversion system is realized by parallel connection of small MHPCS units. The hybrid system includes fuel cells (FC) as main and supercapacitors (SC) as complementary power sources. The SC energy storage compensates the slow transient response of the FC stack and supports the FC to meet the grid power demand. The proposed control strategy of the MHPCS comprises three control loops; dc-link voltage controller, power management controller, and load current sharing controller. Each distributed generation (DG) unit uses an adaptive proportional resonance (PR) controller for regulating the load voltage, and a droop control strategy for average power sharing among the DG units. The performance of the proposed control strategy is verified by using digital time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

Abstract: Our objective is to allocate power to air conditioners in a fair manner when the demand for power exceeds the supply or when the load in regions of the network exceeds the capacity of the transmission links. This is an alternative to the current practice of brown outs or black outs and to the proposed pricing mechanisms that curtail demand. The procedure operates on a smart grid. Customers request a thermostat setting for their air conditioner, and the power company sets the thermostat to fairly allocate the available power. We describe 1) simple techniques to predict changes in power consumption for modest changes in the setting of a thermostat in each residence, 2) algorithms to apply two fairness metrics used in communications networks to power allocation, 3) an algorithm to control power to different parts of a capacity constrained distribution network, and 4) a practical procedure to apply these techniques.

Abstract: An effective protection scheme against high impedance faults (HIFs) has to efficiently confront the issues of detection and location simultaneously. In Part I of this study the issue of detection is investigated, while in Part II a method that deals with the exact location of HIF position using an installed power line communication (PLC) system is elaborated. This method comprises specific test signal injections into the power grid after a HIF alarm is set. Using impulse responses that are recorded by the PLC devices, the location of the fault may be derived. A flowchart that describes the usage of the complete method for HIF detection and location is presented. The impulse responses that correspond to several fault cases are shown and the methodology that may lead to the fault location is explained. The effect of the fault type and its impedance on the efficacy of the method is highlighted. Finally, the model is applied to a line that is part of the Greek rural distribution system and its validity is tested.

Abstract: In addition to providing for a more reliable distribution infrastructure, the smart grid promises to give the end users better pricing and usage information. It is thus interesting for them to be ready to take advantage of features such as dynamic energy pricing and real-time choice of operators. In this work, we propose a system to monitor and control an office environment and to couple it with the smart grid. The idea is to schedule the operation of devices according to policies defined by the users, in order to minimize the cost of operation while leaving unaffected user comfort and productivity. The implementation of the system and its testing in a living lab environment show interesting economic savings of an average of about 35% and in some cases even overall energy savings in the order of 10% for a building equipped with renewable generation plants, and economic and energy savings of 20% and 10%, respectively, for a building without local renewable installations.

Abstract: In this paper, statistical charging load modeling of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in electricity distribution networks is studied. Usefulness of National Travel Survey data in the modeling is investigated, and a novel modeling methodology is proposed where detailed car use habits are taken into account and statistical distributions of charging energies can be produced. Using the modeling methodology some example calculation results of a Finnish case study are presented with further analysis and sensitivity studies. The example calculations are made mostly from viewpoint of the Finnish distribution networks and their modeling traditions but the method can be applied internationally when relevant travel survey data is available. Example calculations are analyzed in order to assess reasonability and practical usability of the models. The models produced by the methodology can easily be used in network calculation tools commonly used by distribution network operators.

Abstract: Smart home integrates disaster protection, medical care, entertainment and energy-saving systems, making the living environment more secure and comfortable. This paper investigates the demand response achieved by the "smart energy management system" in a smart home environment, and aims to obtain the optimal temperature scheduling for air-conditioning according to the day-ahead electricity price and outdoor temperature forecasts. Because the retail electricity price and temperature are predicted 24 h in advance and there exists uncertainty, the predicted retail electricity prices and temperatures are modeled by the fuzzy set. The immune clonal selection programming is employed to determine the day-ahead 24-h temperature schedule for air-conditioning. The electricity expense is hence minimized while comfort is still retained. The simulation result shows the applicability of the proposed method.

Abstract: Preserving the availability and integrity of the power grid critical infrastructures in the face of fast-spreading intrusions requires advances in detection techniques specialized for such large-scale cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we present a security-oriented cyber-physical state estimation (SCPSE) system, which, at each time instant, identifies the compromised set of hosts in the cyber network and the maliciously modified set of measurements obtained from power system sensors. SCPSE fuses uncertain information from different types of distributed sensors, such as power system meters and cyber-side intrusion detectors, to detect the malicious activities within the cyber-physical system. We implemented a working prototype of SCPSE and evaluated it using the IEEE 24-bus benchmark system. The experimental results show that SCPSE significantly improves on the scalability of traditional intrusion detection techniques by using information from both cyber and power sensors. Furthermore, SCPSE was able to detect all the attacks against the control network in our experiments.

Abstract: Intelligent management of energy consumption is one of the key issues for future energy distribution systems, smart buildings, and consumer appliances. The problem can be tackled both from the point of view of the utility provider, with the intelligence embedded in the smart grid, or from the point of view of the consumer, thanks to suitable local energy management systems (EMS). Conserving energy, however, should respect the user requirements regarding the desired state of the environment, therefore an EMS should constantly and intelligently find the balance between user requirements and energy saving. The paper proposes a solution to this problem, based on explicit high-level modeling of user intentions and automatic control of device states through the solution and optimization of a constrained Boolean satisfiability problem. The proposed approach has been integrated into a smart environment framework, and promising preliminary results are reported.

Abstract: A Home Energy Management (HEM) system plays a crucial role in realizing residential Demand Response (DR) programs in the smart grid environment. It provides a homeowner the ability to automatically perform smart load controls based on utility signals, customer's preference and load priority. This paper presents the hardware demonstration of the proposed HEM system for managing end-use appliances. The HEM's communication time delay to perform load control is analyzed, along with its residual energy consumption.

Abstract: Occurrence of high impedance faults (HIFs) in rural overhead power distribution networks may cause safety and economic issues for both public and the utility. Such faults may not be detected by the conventional protection schemes, so the development of a more sophisticated method is necessary. The forthcoming evolution of power networks to smart grids creates opportunities for new technologies to be implemented to that purpose. Utilities may transmit data that are necessary for the system operation using specific frequency ranges. A novel method utilizing these is proposed in this work. The monitoring of the network's input impedance in these frequency ranges can be used for detection of HIF occurrence, because such faults impose significant changes in its value. The proposed method is applied to single branch topologies, as well as to an existing topology of a Greek rural distribution system. Significant conclusions are derived in both cases. Moreover, the influence of several parameters, such as fault impedance and location and earth's electromagnetic properties on the method's efficacy is examined. Also, it is shown that the implementation of the proposed method may be drastically simplified by focusing on the monitoring of specific frequencies rather than the entire frequency range under study.

Abstract: This paper uses a charging selection concept for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to maximize user convenience levels while meeting predefined circuit-level demand limits. The optimal PEV-charging selection problem requires an exhaustive search for all possible combinations of PEVs in a power system, which cannot be solved for the practical number of PEVs. Inspired by the efficiency of the convex relaxation optimization tool in finding close-to-optimal results in huge search spaces, this paper proposes the application of the convex relaxation optimization method to solve the PEV-charging selection problem. Compared with the results of the uncontrolled case, the simulated results indicate that the proposed PEV-charging selection algorithm only slightly reduces user convenience levels, but significantly mitigates the impact of the PEV-charging on the power system. We also develop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the PEV-charging selection problem in a decentralized manner, i.e., the binary charging decisions (charged or not charged) are made locally by each vehicle. Using the proposed distributed optimization algorithm, each vehicle is only required to report its power demand rather than report several of its private user state information, mitigating the security problems inherent in such problem. The proposed decentralized algorithm only requires low-speed communication capability, making it suitable for real-time implementation.

Abstract: In this paper, a hierarchical control scheme is proposed for enhancement of sensitive load bus (SLB) voltage quality in microgrids. The control structure consists of primary and secondary levels. The primary control level comprises distributed generators (DGs) local controllers. Each of these controllers includes a selective virtual impedance loop which is considered to improve sharing of fundamental and harmonic components of load current among the DG units. The sharing improvement is provided at the expense of increasing voltage unbalance and harmonic distortion. Thus, the secondary control level is applied to manage the compensation of SLB voltage unbalance and harmonics by sending proper control signals to the primary level. DGs compensation efforts are controlled locally at the primary level. The system design procedure for selecting proper control parameters is discussed. Simulation results are provided in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: Wind and solar power are well known intermittent power sources with high availability uncertainties. Hence, whenever they are integrated to distribution systems, these power sources can increase significantly the complexity of system operation. This paper presents an impact analysis of distributed energy resources integration on distribution systems, focusing mainly on reliability aspects. Therefore, an interesting algorithm to correctly determine the amount of capacity that may be transferred to other feeders is presented and discussed, taken into consideration the presence of distributed generation. The methodology is tested in a typical Brazilian distribution system, assuming the integration of a diesel-based combined heat and power unit, wind turbines, and solar panels. The results provide general insights regarding the benefits of applying distributed generation to alleviate load transfer restrictions.

Abstract: Microgrids are receiving attention due to the increasing need to integrate distributed generations and to insure power quality and to provide energy surety to critical loads. Since renewables need to be in the mix for energy surety, a high renewable-energy penetrated microgrid is analyzed in this paper. The standard IEEE 34 bus distribution feeder is adapted and managed as a microgrid by adding distributed generation and load profiles. The 25 kV system parameters are scaled down to 12 kV and renewable sources including solar PV and wind turbines, an energy storage system, and a diesel generator for islanded mode have been added to the 34-bus system. The distribution generations (DG) and renewables are modeled in detail using PSCAD software and practical constraints of the components are considered. The monitoring of the microgrid for measuring power quality and control requirements for these DGs and storage are modeled to maintain the power quality of the system when loads are varied. Renewable sources are modeled with seasonal variation at different locations. The microgrid is monitored at number of buses and the power quality issues are measured and indexes are calculated. This paper proposes a generalized approach to design (determine the capacity requirements) and demonstrates the management of microgrids with metrics to meet the power quality indexes.

Abstract: This paper sets forth a novel intelligent residential air-conditioning (A/C) system controller that has smart grid functionality. The qualifier "intelligent" means the A/C system has advanced computational capabilities and uses an array of environmental and occupancy parameters in order to provide optimal intertemporal comfort/cost trade-offs for the resident, conditional on anticipated retail energy prices. The term "smart-grid functionality" means that retail energy prices can depend on wholesale energy prices. Simulation studies are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed A/C system controller.

Abstract: In the context of the smart grid, this paper focuses on control and management strategies for integration of distributed energy resources in the power system. This work conceptualizes a hierarchical framework for the control of microgrids-the building blocks of the smart grid-and develops the notion of potential functions for the secondary controller for devising intermediate set points to ensure feasibility of operation. A potential function is defined for each controllable unit of the microgrid such that minimizing the potential function corresponds to achieving the control goal. The set points are dynamically updated using communication within the microgrid. This strategy is generalized to include both local and system-wide constraints. Case studies are presented that show effectiveness of the proposed approach in stabilizing a microgrid in response to disturbances such as load change, line outage, and generator malfunctioning.

Abstract: This paper presents mathematical optimization models of residential energy hubs which can be readily incorporated into automated decision making technologies in smart grids, and can be solved efficiently in a real-time frame to optimally control all major residential energy loads, storage and production components while properly considering the customer preferences and comfort level. Novel mathematical models for major household demand, i.e., fridge, freezer, dishwasher, washer and dryer, stove, water heater, hot tub, and pool pumps are formulated. Also, mathematical models of other components of a residential energy system including lighting, heating, and air-conditioning are developed, and generic models for solar PV panels and energy storage/generation devices are proposed. The developed mathematical models result in Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problems with the objective functions of minimizing energy consumption, total cost of electricity and gas, emissions, peak load, and/or any combination of these objectives, while considering end-user preferences. Several realistic case studies are carried out to examine the performance of the mathematical model, and experimental tests are carried out to find practical procedures to determine the parameters of the model. The application of the proposed model to a real household in Ontario, Canada is presented for various objective functions. The simulation results show that savings of up to 20% on energy costs and 50% on peak demand can be achieved, while maintaining the household owner's desired comfort levels.

Abstract: A decentralized voltage control is proposed for distributed generation (DG) units to provide short and long-term voltage support in distribution networks. Local controllable zones are used to determine the voltage control boundaries for each DG unit. The number of zones and their size depend on the number, location and size of the DG units, and can be reconfigured in real time in response to network topology changes. The performance and value of the proposed control approach are demonstrated under various operating scenarios. The study is based on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution network implemented in DIgSILENT PowerFactory.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) is very important in the future smart grid, aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours. However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation.

Abstract: This paper presents a nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NILM) strategy for energy management systems in smart buildings. Compared to purely data-driven methods, this paper introduces a prior-knowledge-based model-driven framework. The prior-knowledge includes front-end power supply circuit identification, electrical operating principle, and customer usage. The focus of this paper is on a comprehensive study on front-end power supply circuit topologies and on the commercial power supply market. The former forms the basis of the proposed hierarchical taxonomy from the power electronics' point of view, and the latter study guarantees that the proposed taxonomy represents the majority of appliance loads in the real world. Under the proposed taxonomy, the advantage of the model-driven hierarchical feature extraction is discussed, and initial analysis shows that optimized features can be obtained from this method, which drives a much simpler AND more feasible solution in differentiating the subtle differences between similar loads.

Abstract: Understanding the need for improvement in monitoring and protection in high performance charging technology for a growing demand of EVs/PHEVs, this research manuscript presents a part of an ongoing project and proposes a novel low cost dual purpose triangular neural network based module for power quality monitoring and protection (M&P) and elicits its performance in times of abnormalities or malfunction in a high performance off-board level 3 bi-directional charger for electric vehicles. Firstly, design and implementation of the low cost dual purpose triangular neural network based device for monitoring the power quality and hence, protecting the grid has been explained and its performance has been presented through numerical investigations. Going a step further, the device has also been experimentally tested using an in-house electric vehicle containing a commercially available battery charger and the measured results are analyzed. Secondly, a high-performance vector-controlled bi-directional off-board level-3 charger for faster and efficient charging has been developed and investigations have been performed on the healthy charger to analyze its performance. The primary aim of developing this charger was to elicit the usage and performance of the previously developed M&P device to protect the grid in case of some typical charger malfunction problem in such a charger, which is not detectable by conventional low cost sensors employed with such chargers. Once the module detects any abnormalities in the charger's operation, information gathered can be used to tune the controller in the charger to obtain a constant improved performance of the charger or the power transfer can be terminated.

Abstract: Most of the research on Hybrid Power Systems (HPS) is to provide an economical and sustainable power to the rural electrification. This paper focuses on the design of an HPS for the building which is a part of the urban electrification. In the developing countries, the rate of increase in the demand is more than the rate of increase in the supply, which is a major challenge resulting in very frequent outages. There are number of motives to build integrated and synergistic renewable energy based HPS including environmental, economic, and social benefits. Most of these HPS topologies use inverters to interface the renewable sources to the buildings with an offering of low quality power. Hence, modern sustainability initiatives call for a design for both new HPS and retrofitting of an existing HPS topology. With this aspect, this paper describes the topology of retrofitting HPS with dc Motor-Synchronous Generator set instead of the use of inverter to an existing building power system. This can improve the power quality, reliability of the supply, and ensures stable plant operation. The proposed HPS topology can be used in small-to-medium sized isolated constructions like green buildings, industries, and universities. Different renewable energy sources like Photo Voltaics (PV), Wind Power (WP), and Fuel Cells (FC) are integrated to form HPS. An energy management and control algorithm is proposed to use the energy sources optimally to upgrade these buildings with more reliability and efficiency. The modeling and simulation is done using MATLAB/Simulink.

Abstract: Smart energy management is an important problem in Smart Grid network, and demand response (DR) is one of the key enabling technologies. If each home uses automated demand response which would opportunistically schedule devices that are flexible to run at any time in a large time window, towards the slots with lower electricity prices, peaks at these slots may happen. We denote such peaks as rebound peaks. We address the potential rebound peak problems of automated DR algorithms, and provide possible solutions. We illustrate why a rebound peak is possible via the insights we obtain from the optimal automated DR algorithm. We show that if the utility electricity supply cost is assumed to be a homogeneous function in the energy consumption over a certain time span, a system of multiple homes and utility company has the lowest total electricity supply cost if the electricity consumption from all the homes is flat over the time span. We study multiple approaches to reduce the rebound peak, and accordingly propose algorithms for DR at each home. Effectiveness of the approaches is verified by numerical results.

Abstract: The need for energy efficient and intelligent systemic solutions, has lead many researchers around the world to investigate and evaluate the existing technologies in order to create solutions that would be adopted for the near future intelligent homes and buildings, aiding in smart grid initiatives. In this paper an algorithm based on the adaptable learning system principles is presented. The proposed algorithm utilizes the adaptable learning system concepts. The Observe, Learn, and Adapt (OLA) algorithm proposed is the result of integration of wireless sensors and artificial intelligence concepts towards the same objective: adding more intelligence to a programmable communicating thermostat (PCT), for better energy management and conservation in smart homes. A house simulator was developed and used as an "expert system shell" to assist in implementation and verification of the OLA algorithm. The role of PCT is to provide consumer with a means to manage and reduce energy use, while accommodating their every day schedules, preferences and needs. In this paper, the actual results of learning and adaptability of a PCT equipped with OLA, as a result of the occupant's pattern/schedule changes, and in general, the overall system improvements with respect to energy consumption and savings are demonstrated via simulation for the zone controlled home equipped with OLA and Knowledge Base, versus a home without zone control, Knowledge Base nor OLA.

Abstract: In this paper, the problem of grid-to-vehicle energy exchange between a smart grid and plug-in electric vehicle groups (PEVGs) is studied using a noncooperative Stackelberg game. In this game, on the one hand, the smart grid, which acts as a leader, needs to decide on its price so as to optimize its revenue while ensuring the PEVGs' participation. On the other hand, the PEVGs, which act as followers, need to decide on their charging strategies so as to optimize a tradeoff between the benefit from battery charging and the associated cost. Using variational inequalities, it is shown that the proposed game possesses a socially optimal Stackelberg equilibrium in which the grid optimizes its price while the PEVGs choose their equilibrium strategies. A distributed algorithm that enables the PEVGs and the smart grid to reach this equilibrium is proposed and assessed by extensive simulations. Further, the model is extended to a time-varying case that can incorporate and handle slowly varying environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time energy management algorithm for hybrid ac/dc microgrids involving sustainable energy and hybrid energy storage. This hybrid storage system consists of super capacitors (SC) for ultra-fast load matching beside lithium-ion batteries for relatively long term load buffering. The energy management algorithm aims mainly at managing the energy within the system such that the effect of pulsed (short duration) loads on the power system stability is minimized. Moreover, an average annual saving of around 7% is achieved by shifting loads to off-peak hours. The expected energy needed during a future peak, the time of its occurrence and the current state of charge of both elements of the hybrid storage system are all examples of the inputs to the algorithm. A nonlinear regression technique is used to obtain mathematical models for the uncertain quantities including load and sustainable energy curves. The results show a significant improvement for the system in terms of voltage and power stability by applying the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Providing ancillary services for future smart microgrid can be a challenging task because of lack of conventional automatic generation control (AGC) and spinning reserves, and expensive storage devices. In addition, strong motivation to increase the penetration of renewable energy in power systems, particularly at the distribution level, introduces new challenges for frequency and voltage regulation. Thus, increased attention has been focused on demand response (DR), especially in the smart grid environment, where two-way communication and customer participation are part of. This paper presents a comprehensive central DR algorithm for frequency regulation, while minimizing the amount of manipulated load, in a smart microgrid. Simulation studies have been carried out on an IEEE 13-bus standard distribution system operating as a microgrid with and without variable wind generation. Simulation results show that the proposed comprehensive DR control strategy provides frequency (and consequently voltage) regulation as well as minimizing the amount of manipulated responsive loads in the absence/presence of wind power generation.

Abstract: The integration of photovoltaic (PV) generating stations in the power grids requires the amount of power available from the PV to be estimated for power systems planning on yearly basis and operation control on daily basis. To determine the PV station maximum output power, the PV panels must be placed at an optimal tilt angle to absorb maximum energy from the sun. This optimal tilt angle is a nonlinear function of the location, time of year, ground reflectivity and the clearness index of the atmosphere. This paper proposes a neural network (NN) to estimate the optimal tilt angle at a given location and thus an estimate of the amount of energy available from the PV in a microgrid.

Abstract: The study of today's cyber-physical system (CPS) has been an important research area. Internet data centers (IDCs) are energy consuming CPSs that support the reliable operations of many important online services. Along with the increasing Internet services and cloud computing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations had been surging significantly. Such mass power consumption has brought extremely heavy burden on IDC operators. While most previous work only consider about dynamical optimization of IDC under electricity markets, the reaction of IDC toward electricity market has been overlooked. Due to the fact that IDCs are usually large-volume users in the electricity market, they might have market power to affect the electricity price. In this paper, we study how to address the challenge of interactions between IDC operation and electricity market price. To this end, we propose a supply function to model the market power of IDC and formulate a total electricity cost minimization problem as a non-linear programming. Then we present CMC algorithm inspired by the economics concept. CMC algorithm not only solves the optimization problem efficiently, but also uncovers the impetus of the work load distribution. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize the total electricity cost of IDCs by adaptively handling the interaction between IDCs and smart grid.

Abstract: Evolving faults are faults beginning in one phase of a distribution circuit and spreading to another phase after a few cycles. This paper develops a time-domain algorithm for estimating the location of such faults. The algorithm is divided into two parts, namely, the single line-to-ground portion of the fault and the line-to-line-to-ground portion of the fault. The arc voltage that exists during faults is taken into consideration while deriving this methodology. For the single line-to-ground portion of the fault, the distance to the fault is estimated in terms of the loop or self-reactance between the monitor and the fault. On the other hand, for the line-to-line-to-ground and line-to-line portion of the fault the distance is estimated in terms of the positive-sequence reactance. The reactance-to-fault estimate is more robust than that of the resistance-to-fault, because it is unaffected by fault resistance. Two evolving fault cases and two line-to-line fault cases are analyzed in detail and the error in the location estimates is found to be below 10% in each case. Ten additional cases are analyzed and linear regression analysis is conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the fault location estimates.

Abstract: This paper presents a smart residential electric power supply system, which is named smart gateway grid (SGG). It can enable residential distributed generations (DGs) and energy storage system (ESS) to participate in system operation, which will improve the reliability of power supply and help households secure a high quality service while reducing the cost of consumption. The SGG operation modes and associated transition strategies are analyzed in the paper. And the control strategy is developed to guarantee the whole system operating satisfactorily. To meet the demand of the typical U. S. household, a low cost and high efficiency SGG configuration is designed as a case study. Finally, analysis, simulation, and experimental results are presented and they show that the proposed SGG has the attractive features.

Abstract: This paper presents a series of analyses whose goal is to understand the effectiveness with which time-of-use (TOU) rates can economically incent off-peak charging in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). The total cost of fueling PHEV under modeled and real-world TOU rates is compared to the total cost of fueling PHEV under constant rates. Time-resolved vehicle energy consumption and fueling cost is derived for a variety of PHEV designs from travel survey data and charging behavior models. A decision tree model of PHEV consumer choices is proposed with effectiveness and cost metrics defined at each decision point. Results show that gasoline PHEV that charge off-peak incur higher gasoline costs than PHEV that charge at-will. These additional fueling costs reduce the magnitude of the economic incentives for off-peak charging that TOU rates can provide to PHEV consumers. These results are then used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of model and real-world TOU rates and to discuss implications for modeling PHEV total fueling cost.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to develop and propose an integrated classification method for the determination of office buildings' energy and thermal comfort rating classes. The applications of five clustering techniques: Hierarchical, K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Fuzzy, and Neural algorithms to a large building dataset are tested in order to investigate the appropriate method for establishing energy and thermal comfort classifications. For the clustering results testing, three internal validity indices: the Silhouette, the Davies Bouldin, and the Dunn Index have been applied, in order to select the appropriate number of clusters and the most efficient algorithm for each case. The proposed classification approach is also evaluated through comparisons with the methodologies that are recommended by the European standards. The classification results are used for a parametric study of common buildings' characteristics in each rating class, in order to provide with a tool for adopting improvement recommendations for buildings' energy efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, an agent based intelligent energy management system is proposed to facilitate power trading among microgrids and allow customers to participate in demand response. The proposed intelligence uses demand response, and diversity in electricity consumption patterns of the customers and availability of power from distributed generators as the vital means in managing power in the system. A new priority index is proposed for customers participating in the market based on frequency and size of load participating in demand response. In order to validate the proposed method, a case study with two interconnected microgrids is simulated. Based on extensive simulation results of the system developed using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE), it has been found that multi-agent based demand response is successful in reducing the system peak in addition to cost benefit for the customers with high priority index.

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy scheduling model and optimization algorithms for residential electricity consumers who attempt to optimally schedule their electricity consumption, generation and storage in a dynamic pricing environment. We describe an optimization problem which integrates electric, thermodynamic, economic, comfort, and possibly environmental parameters. We present the algorithmic solution and provide simulations results, based on a robust optimization approach which minimizes the impact of stochastic input on the objective function. We argue that the scheduling problem is complex enough to be beyond the analytical capabilities of average residential customers. This result supports the need of scheduling controllers deployed as Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS).

Abstract: This paper presents a centralized control system that coordinates parallel operations of different distributed generation (DG) inverters within a microgrid. The control design for the DG inverters employs a new Model Predictive Control algorithm that allows faster computational time for large power systems by optimizing the steady-state and the transient control problems separately. An overall energy management system is also implemented for the microgrid to coordinate load sharing among different DG units during both grid-connected and islanded operations. The design concept of the proposed control system is evaluated through simulation studies under different test scenarios. The impact of the increased penetration of DG units on the distribution grid is also investigated using the proposed microgrid. The simulation results show that the operations of the DG units within the microgrid can be coordinated effectively under the proposed control system to ensure stable operation of the overall microgrid.

Abstract: In this paper, the application of high reliability distribution system (HRDS) in the economic operation of a microgrid is studied. HRDS, which offers higher operation reliability and fewer outages in microgrids, is applied to looped networks in distribution systems. The microgrid model in this study is composed of distributed energy resources (DER) including distributed generation (DG), controllable loads, and storage. The microgrid would utilize the local DER as well as the main grid for supplying its hourly load economically which is subject to power quality and reliability requirements. The HRDS implemented at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is used as a case study along with the local DER to increase the load point reliability and decrease the operation cost of the IIT microgrid. The availability of distribution lines, main grid supply, and microgrid generation is considered using the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation in the microgrid scenarios. The reliability indices based on frequency and duration of outages are measured at the microgrid level and the load point level, and the potential system enhancements are discussed for improving the economic operation of the IIT microgrid.

Abstract: This letter presents a technique to assess the overall network performance of sampled value process buses based on IEC 61850-9-2 using measurements from a single location in the network. The method is based upon the use of Ethernet cards with externally synchronized time stamping, and characteristics of the process bus protocol. The application and utility of the method is demonstrated by measuring latency introduced by Ethernet switches. Network latency can be measured from a single set of captures, rather than comparing source and destination captures. Absolute latency measures will greatly assist the design testing, commissioning and maintenance of these critical data networks.

Abstract: Transmission of control information in home local networks is gaining increasing importance. Especially in the context of smart grids several applications already exist and evolve that demand the transmission of control information in home networks. Important examples are the so called smart homes and intelligent buildings, where household appliances and sensor devices are interconnected. They are remotely controlled by an automated energy management system (EMS) according to the demands of the overlying smart grid. This paper presents a methodology for the evaluation of wireless smart homes and home automation networks (HANs) in indoor scenarios. The methodology is applied to investigate the performance of actual wireless technologies that can be used to interconnect devices in a smart home environment. The technologies are compared with each other by investigating the performance in realistic European indoor scenarios. Additionally, they are evaluated with respect to their reliable indoor coverage range. The main intention of this paper is to provide a decision guideline, which wireless standard is most suitable for a certain smart home scenario.

Abstract: The planning and development of distribution networks with a substantial penetration of microgrids connected to the medium voltage (MV) network form the main themes of this paper. The impact of microgrids is assessed in terms of their effect on optimal network topology, losses, reliability, reserve connections, network upgrade and expansion savings. The earning base of the distribution system operator also comes under scrutiny. A suburban MV cable network is planned using a network planning algorithm developed by the authors, first with optimal routing for demand-only nodes and then with a 33% penetration of randomly located microgrids. The network is then expanded to meet the requirements of a future planning horizon, in order to compare the expanded and upgraded optimum MV network topology with and without microgrids. Apart from visually depicting the topological differences, the savings such microgrids can give to the long term distribution network investment and running costs are quantified in terms of the investment costs, loss costs and interruption costs. When networks are planned with optimal rather than full backup, the introduction of microgrids is shown to have a considerable saving impact on all cost components except the cost per unit power transfer in the distribution network.

Abstract: In this paper, the price elasticity of electrical demand is studied in a smart grid framework where electricity loads are scheduled by distributed Energy Management Controller (EMC) units. It is shown that different price responsive behaviors of electricity loads are results from interactions between their utilities to customers as a function of time and electricity prices. Based on this observation, a parametric utility model is introduced, from which the price elastic behaviors of aggregated loads are effectively modeled as a set of multi-dimensional demand-price functions. The developed demand elasticity model is further utilized in determining the optimal price signal for Real-Time Pricing (RTP) based Demand Response (DR) programs. Considering price elastic behaviors of customers, it is shown that the optimal real-time prices to induce the desired power consumption behaviors from customers for social welfare maximization can be effectively pre-calculated by utility company using the developed demand elasticity model without the need for excessive information exchange among end users and utility companies. Typical results of the proposed methods are further illustrated through numerical examples from a 6-bus test system.

Abstract: Smart grid is a modern infrastructure for improving the efficiency and reliability of power grid by integrating automated control, sensing and metering technologies, modern communication infrastructure and modern energy management techniques. Security and quality-of-service (QoS) are two most critical requirements for the communications network in smart grid. Frequency hopping (FH) technology, due to its inherent security, is a promising candidate technology in the physical layer of smart gird communication infrastructure. Unfortunately, all the existing FH systems can support only a single level of QoS due to the fact that traditional FH sequence sets can provide the same level of Hamming cross-correlation. In this paper, an FH-based communication network is developed for smart grid, particularly the advanced smart metering (AMI), to address the above two key challenges. A novel type of FH sequence set which meets the multi-level QoS requirement is designed. Then, the data traffic in AMI is investigated and modeled as a general Poisson process which is validated by real measurements of power consumptions. With the proposed sequence set and data model, the analytic performance in terms of error probabilities for the proposed FH communication with M-ary frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation is derived for a slow Rayleigh fading channel. The analytic results are validated by numerical simulation results.

Abstract: For grid-connected microgrids with high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation, overvoltage caused by reverse power flow is a major factor that limits PV power output. To tackle the challenge, this paper proposes a new online overvoltage prevention (OOP) control strategy to maintain PV terminal voltages within specified range while maximizing the PV energy yields. The proposed method is based on a precise active power limit prediction using the dynamic Thevenin equivalent. The active power output of PV array can be modulated in real time such that the voltage at a point of interconnection (POI) is always maintained within a specified range without triggering overvoltage protection. Simulation results using the IEEE 33-bus single-phase test system and IEEE 34-bus three-phase system have validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed control method.

Abstract: This paper presents a system architecture for load management in smart buildings which enables autonomous demand side load management in the smart grid. Being of a layered structure composed of three main modules for admission control, load balancing, and demand response management, this architecture can encapsulate the system functionality, assure the interoperability between various components, allow the integration of different energy sources, and ease maintenance and upgrading. Hence it is capable of handling autonomous energy consumption management for systems with heterogeneous dynamics in multiple time-scales and allows seamless integration of diverse techniques for online operation control, optimal scheduling, and dynamic pricing. The design of a home energy manager based on this architecture is illustrated and the simulation results with Matlab/Simulink confirm the viability and efficiency of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) as an essential network component of smart grid, provides services by periodically collecting the charging status of a battery vehicle (BV). A BV is normally associated with a default interest group (e. g., power grid operator). When the BV accesses its default charging or communication point, it works in the home mode. The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis. It is shown that AP3A can resist major attacks for security protection and privacy preservation, and can be an efficient authentication approach for V2G networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a dc arc model to simplify the study of a critical issue in dc microgrids: series faults. The model is derived from a hyperbolic approximation of observed arc voltage and current patterns, which permit analyzing the arc in terms of its resistance, power, energy, and quenching condition. Recent faults staged by the authors on a dc microgrid yielded enough data to develop an arc model for three fault types: constant-gap speed, fixed-gap distance, and accelerated gap. The results in this paper compare experimental and simulation results for the three fault types. It is concluded that because the instantaneous voltage, current, power, and energy waveforms produced by the model agree well with experimental results, the model is suitable for transient simulations.

Abstract: Aiming at photovoltaic (PV)-storage urban building integrated system, this paper proposes a DC microgrid with multi-layer control and smart grid communications. The paper focuses on power balancing, with load shedding and PV constrained production, and takes into account the grid availability and grid vulnerability by smart grid messages. The system behavior modeling by MATLAB Stateflow leads to the whole control strategy design, which concerns the power balancing and imposed power limits by the utility grid, while providing interface for energy management. Experimental results evaluate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy. As further development of this control design, an intelligent multi-layer supervision is suggested. This supervision, able to exchange data with the smart grid, deals with the end-user demand, forecast of photovoltaic production, prediction of load consumption, and energy management. The major technical contribution of this paper is linked to the proposed control design that permits better DC microgrid integration (avoids undesired injection, mitigates fluctuations in grid power, reduces grid peak consumption) and provides possibility to reduce the negative impact on the utility grid thanks to the supervision interface. The power balancing control interface provides possibility for advanced energy management with low speed communication.

Abstract: This paper presents a control strategy for automatic reconnection of a microgrid after an intentional islanding. Remote signals of voltage and frequency at both sides of the coupling circuit breaker are communicated to the generating site, and used as additional signals to the voltage and speed control loops, respectively. The proposed automation strategy is simulated on a real MW-scale microgrid located at a rural area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and supplied by two small hydro synchronous generators. The results show that a smooth reconnection of the microgrid to the utility grid can be achieved when the proposed automation is utilized.

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic modeling and control strategy for a sustainable microgrid primarily powered by wind and solar energy. A current-source-interface multiple-input dc-dc converter is used to integrate the renewable energy sources to the main dc bus. Potential suitable applications range from a communication site or a residential area. A direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous wind generator is used with a variable speed control method whose strategy is to capture the maximum wind energy below the rated wind speed. This study considers both wind energy and solar irradiance changes in combination with load power variations. As a case study a 30-kW wind/solar hybrid power system dynamic model is explored. The examined dynamics shows that the proposed power system is a feasible option for a sustainable microgrid application.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the real-time price-based demand response (DR) management for residential appliances via stochastic optimization and robust optimization approaches. The proposed real-time price-based DR management application can be imbedded into smart meters and automatically executed on-line for determining the optimal operation of residential appliances within 5-minute time slots while considering uncertainties in real-time electricity prices. Operation tasks of residential appliances are categorized into deferrable/non-deferrable and interruptible/non-interruptible ones based on appliances' DR preferences as well as their distinct spatial and temporal operation characteristics. The stochastic optimization adopts the scenario-based approach via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the expected electricity payment for the entire day, while controlling the financial risks associated with real-time electricity price uncertainties via the expected downside risks formulation. Price uncertainty intervals are considered in the robust optimization for minimizing the worst-case electricity payment while flexibly adjusting the solution robustness. Both approaches are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems and solved by state-of-the-art MILP solvers. The numerical results show attributes of the two approaches for solving the real-time optimal DR management problem for residential appliances.

Abstract: This paper proposes a communication-assisted protection strategy implementable by commercially available micro-processor-based relays for the protection of medium-voltage microgrids. Even though the developed protection strategy benefits from communications, it offers a backup protection strategy to manage communication network failures. The paper also introduces the structure of a relay that enables the proposed protection strategy. Comprehensive simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategy under different fault scenarios, in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

Abstract: Centralized generation is being supplemented or replaced fast by distributed generation, a new way of thinking about electricity generation, transmission and distribution. Understanding the significance and prospects of self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) in distributed wind power generation (DWPG), this paper firstly presents a comprehensive suitability analysis of commercially available niche copper-rotor induction motor (CRIM) and conventional aluminum-rotor induction motor (ARIM) to be used as induction generators in the above application, through experimental investigations performed on two industrial 7.5 hp CRIM and ARIM. The results of the performance analyses on the two machines provide data for development of a novel control scheme comprising of wavelet transforms and particle swarm optimization technique, proposed next, to alleviate the problem of voltage regulation (VR) associated with the SEIGs. The developed controller for VR is implemented on a low cost embedded system, hence making it economical and flexible for patenting. The developed embedded system is validated initially through an actuator performing mechanical switching of requisite capacitances and finally by integrating it with another actuator, namely, the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), for efficient voltage regulation. Finally, the tested results are presented.

Abstract: A smart building energy system usually contains multiple energy sources such as power grids, autonomous generators, renewable resources, storage devices, and schedulable loads. Storage devices such as batteries, ice/heat storage units, and water tanks play an important role in reducing energy cost in building energy systems since they can help sufficiently utilize renewable energy resources and time-of-use electricity prices. It is important to plan, schedule, and coordinate all the storage devices together with schedulable loads in a building facilitated by microgrid technology. To consider the above problem with uncertainties in solar radiation and demand profiles, a stochastic optimization problem is formulated and solved by the scenario tree method. The best combination and the optimal capacities of storage devices for specific building energy systems are then determined. Furthermore, the optimal operating strategy of building energy systems can be obtained. The performance analysis on the storage devices is conducted and the numerical results show that thermal storage devices (e. g., ice storage units, water tanks) are good for saving energy costs but batteries may not be economical due to their high investment cost and short lifetime. It is also observed that the aforementioned uncertainties have an impact on selecting which type and capacity of storage device should be used.

Abstract: A microgrid is capable of providing highly reliable power supply to sensitive loads like semiconductor fabrication or computer data processing equipment. This is especially required when the sensitive loads are located in distribution systems that also contain several single-phase and/or nonlinear loads. Voltage source inverter (VSI) based distributed energy resources can provide power quality conditioning support. They require filters to accurately detect unbalance and harmonics in the system. The state-of-the-art filtering techniques in three-phase power systems involve employing complex bandpass filters that pass frequencies within a band without much attenuation. Such methods however give good dynamic performance only when there is a wide separation between the desired and undesired frequencies. In power distribution systems containing imbalances and harmonic generating loads, the gap between the two frequencies may be very small, and therefore such methods don't offer good performance. This paper proposes improved methods of filtering signals in three-phase, three-wire power systems, especially when there is a narrow gap between the desired and undesired frequencies. The proposed techniques contain both complex bandpass and bandstop sections and are designed on three-phase space-vector quantities. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate these novel filtering concepts.

Abstract: A home energy management (HEM) system is an integral part of a smart grid that can potentially enable demand response applications for residential customers. This paper presents an intelligent HEM algorithm for managing high power consumption household appliances with simulation for demand response (DR) analysis. The proposed algorithm manages household loads according to their preset priority and guarantees the total household power consumption below certain levels. A simulation tool is developed to showcase the applicability of the proposed algorithm in performing DR at an appliance level. This paper demonstrates that the tool can be used to analyze DR potentials for residential customers. Given the lack of understanding about DR potentials in this market, this work serves as an essential stepping-stone toward providing an insight into how much DR can be performed for residential customers.

Abstract: Demand response is seen as a key technology to help the introduction of large volumes of intermittent renewable energy and to help mitigate the effects of the increasing load on the electricity distribution grid. A large and diverse number of control mechanisms are proposed for demand response, while multiple industrial companies are designing their own proprietary solutions. This situation demands for standardized and generalized interfaces for smart devices, i.e., interfaces based on as few indicators as possible that reflect the flexibility state, while hiding all implementation details and specifics of the device. Electric domestic hot water buffers are devices that inherently contain a lot of flexibility, i.e., the charging can be shifted without impact on the comfort of the user. This article presents four key indicators for domestic hot water buffers that meet above requirements: P, the rated power, E-max, the energy required to fully charge the buffer, SoC, the state of charge, and E-min, the energy required before the SoC increases. The correct behavior of these key indicators has been validated by means of simulations and measurements on a lab prototype. The integration of the smart buffer into a time of use demand response system is demonstrated with a test setup and measurement results.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust system-oriented control design approach for distributed generation (DG) converters in microgrids. The conceptual design of the proposed interface is to provide control system robustness against system-level interactions without strict knowledge of complete microgrid system dynamics. To increase the robustness against converter-microgrid interactions, the microgrid system is modeled by a dynamic equivalent circuit, which might include uncertainties induced due to microgrid impedance variation and interactions with the equivalent microgrid bus-voltage. The equivalent microgrid model along with local load interactions and uncertainties are augmented with the DG interface power circuit model to develop a robust voltage controller. To account for power angle interaction dynamics, an angle feed-forward control approach is adopted, where the angle of the equivalent microgrid bus, as seen by each DG unit, is estimated and used for feed-forward control. Unlike conventional droop controllers, the proposed scheme yields two-degree-of-freedom controller, resulting in stable and smooth power sharing performance over a wide range for the static droop gain and also at different loading conditions. A theoretical analysis and comparative simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: Modern power systems require increased intelligence and flexibility in the control and optimization to ensure the capability of maintaining a generation-load balance, following serious disturbances. This issue is becoming more significant today due to the increasing number of microgrids (MGs). The MGs mostly use renewable energies in electrical power production that are varying naturally. These changes and usual uncertainties in power systems cause the classic controllers to be unable to provide a proper performance over a wide range of operating conditions. In response to this challenge, the present paper addresses a new online intelligent approach by using a combination of the fuzzy logic and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques for optimal tuning of the most popular existing proportional-integral (PI) based frequency controllers in the ac MG systems. The control design methodology is examined on an ac MG case study. The performance of the proposed intelligent control synthesis is compared with the pure fuzzy PI and the Ziegler-Nichols PI control design methods.

Abstract: The connection of wind power generation into ac microgrids (MGs) is steadily increasing. This incorporation can bring problems onto the power quality and dynamics of the electrical grid due to the lack of controllability over the wind. In this work, a flywheel energy storage (FES) is used to mitigate problems introduced by wind generation into MGs. A dynamic model of the FES device is briefly presented and a technique to control the power exchanged between the device and the power system is proposed. The control technique has three modes, namely: voltage control (VC), frequency control (FC), and active power stabilization (APS). Simulation tests on the behavior of the FES device are analyzed when it works in combination with wind generation in the electrical microgrid. Results show an acceptable performance of the proposed control techniques along with a high effectiveness to smooth the active power fluctuations of wind generation.

Abstract: Remote metering is a key task in smart grid to collect the power load information for the pricing in power market. A wireless communication infrastructure is assumed for the smart meter network. The dynamics of the power market are assumed to be a Markov decision process (MDP) by modeling the power load evolution as a two-state Markov chain. The fundamental elements of the MDP are discussed and the optimal strategy is obtained from dynamic programming. Due to the curse of dimensions, the myopic strategy is proposed to significantly simplify the algorithm. The validity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations. For example, for price insensitive power users, the average price and power generation errors are reduced by 60% and 40% using the myopic approach, compared with the simple round robin schedule, in certain circumstances.

Abstract: An optimization problem called "the feeder addition problem" is defined to determine potential locations for adding interties between feeders in a legacy radial distribution system to improve the reliability in the islanded mode of operation-a desired feature under the Smart Grid Initiative. Numerical bounds are established on the growth of the feeder addition problem. The feeder addition problem in a popular test system is handled using two different optimization methods to balance cost and reliability for utility applications. To approximate the power output of the distributed generation sources considered, an empirical equation incorporating the capacity factors of renewable energy-based distributed generation sources and results of an industry survey is used. Both optimization methods are shown to improve the system reliability for cases where the distributed generation output exceeded feeder demand.

Abstract: The characteristic behavior of physically compact, multiterminal dc networks under electrical fault conditions can produce demanding protection requirements. This represents a significant barrier to more widespread adoption of dc power distribution for microgrid applications. Protection schemes have been proposed within literature for such networks based around the use of non-unit protection methods. This paper shows however that there are severe limitations to the effectiveness of such schemes when employed for more complex microgrid network architectures. Even current differential schemes, which offer a more effective, though costly, protection solution, must be carefully designed to meet the design requirements resulting from the unique fault characteristics of dc microgrids. This paper presents a detailed analysis of dc microgrid behavior under fault conditions, illustrating the challenging protection requirements and demonstrating the shortcomings of non-unit approaches for these applications. Whilst the performance requirements for the effective operation of differential schemes in dc microgrids are shown to be stringent, the authors show how these may be met using COTS technologies. The culmination of this work is the proposal of a flexible protection scheme design framework for dc microgrid applications which enables the required levels of fault discrimination to be achieved whilst minimizing the associated installation costs.

Abstract: Vanadium redox batteries (VRBs) have proven to be a viable energy storage technology for portable microgrids due to their rechargeability and high energy density. VRBs exhibit parasitic load loss during operation due to pumping of electrolyte across the membrane during charging and discharging cycles, as well as required temperature control in the form of heating, ventilation and air conditioning. This paper focuses on empirically characterizing VRB efficiency based on known climatic operating conditions and load requirements. A model is created to determine system performance based on known climatic and load data collected and analyzed over an extended time period. A case study is performed using known data for a week time period to characterize system performance, which was compared to actual system performance observed during this same time period. This model allows for appropriate sizing of the PV array and discretionary loads based on required energy density of the system.

Abstract: This paper presents a model for calculating the optimal size of an energy storage system (ESS) in a microgrid considering reliability criterion. A larger ESS requires higher investment costs while reduces the microgrid operating cost. The optimal ESS sizing problem is proposed which minimizes the investment cost of the ESS, as well as expected microgrid operating cost. Utilizing the ESS, generation shortage due to outage of conventional units and intermittency of renewable units is handled; hence microgrid reliability criterion is satisfied. A practical model for ESS is utilized. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is utilized to formulate the problem. Illustrative examples show the efficiency of the proposed model.

Abstract: In this paper, the concept and system structure of the self-healing urban power grid (UPG) are presented. The proposed method has five operating states and four subcontrols, which are emergency control, restorative control, corrective control and preventive control. The entire self-healing UPG is controlled by the multiagent system (MAS). The agent system has three layers, each of which comprises several agents. This paper discusses the design and function of each agent, as well as the agents' structures and their communication methods. A practical test case based on the urban power grid in Jiangning County in China is employed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed agent-based system to perform self-healing functionality. Research findings indicate that the self-healing control system proposed in this paper can intelligently adjust the operating state to eliminate all the potential threats, and thus achieving the desired operation objectives.

Abstract: The vehicle electrification will have a significant impact on the power grid due to the increase in electricity consumption. It is important to perform intelligent scheduling for charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs). However, there are two major challenges in the scheduling problem. First, it is challenging to find the globally optimal scheduling solution which can minimize the total cost. Second, it is difficult to find a distributed scheduling scheme which can handle a large population and the random arrivals of the EVs. In this paper, we propose a globally optimal scheduling scheme and a locally optimal scheduling scheme for EV charging and discharging. We first formulate a global scheduling optimization problem, in which the charging powers are optimized to minimize the total cost of all EVs which perform charging and discharging during the day. The globally optimal solution provides the globally minimal total cost. However, the globally optimal scheduling scheme is impractical since it requires the information on the future base loads and the arrival times and the charging periods of the EVs that will arrive in the future time of the day. To develop a practical scheduling scheme, we then formulate a local scheduling optimization problem, which aims tominimize the total cost of the EVs in the current ongoing EV set in the local group. The locally optimal scheduling scheme is not only scalable to a large EV population but also resilient to the dynamic EV arrivals. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the locally optimal scheduling scheme can achieve a close performance compared to the globally optimal scheduling scheme.

Abstract: The scientific principle of "mechanical springs" was described by the British physicist Robert Hooke in the 1660's. Since then, there has not been any further development of the Hooke's law in the electric regime. In this paper, this technological gap is filled by the development of "electric springs." The scientific principle, the operating modes, the limitations, and the practical realization of the electric springs are reported. It is discovered that such novel concept has huge potential in stabilizing future power systems with substantial penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in a practical power system setup fed by an ac power source with a fluctuating wind energy source. The electric spring is found to be effective in regulating the mains voltage despite the fluctuation caused by the intermittent nature of wind power. Electric appliances with the electric springs embedded can be turned into a new generation of smart loads, which have their power demand following the power generation profile. It is envisaged that electric springs, when distributed over the power grid, will offer a new form of power system stability solution that is independent of information and communication technology.

Abstract: This paper investigates load control and demand response in a smart grid environment where a bidirectional communication link between the operator and the smart flexible devices supports command and data flow. Two control schemes are investigated that can provide energy management, taking into account user's comfort, via binary on-off policies of the smart flexible devices. A dynamic control algorithm is introduced that considers real time network characteristics and initiates command flow when critical parameters exceed predefined thresholds. To sustain fairness in the system, priority based and round robin scheduling algorithms are proposed. A continuous control algorithm is also explored to define the higher bounds of energy savings. To quantify the discomfort of users that participate in this type of services, a heuristic consumer utility metric is proposed and measurements with a flexible device (air conditioning unit) are performed to model empirically possible time intervals of the control scheme. Reciprocal fair energy management schemes are investigated being both operator and user centric. It is shown that great energy and cost savings can be achieved providing the required degrees of freedom to the smart grid to self-adapt during peak hours.

Abstract: Based on the traditional network expansion planning formulation, a new formulation is built by taking into consideration the curtailment of renewable energy generation (REG), e.g., wind farm generation. The objective is to minimize the total cost of building new circuits and to curtail the output of REG generation. Loss in REG generation curtailment is computed according to its annual output duration curve. In the proposed formulation, operational conditions under peak and trough load levels, the different outputs of REG, and the N-1 security criterion are altogether considered. The whole formulation is solved by Benders' decomposition method. The proposed method is tested on a practical network. Network expansion schemes obtained from the classical and the proposed methods are compared and analyzed. Test results show that network investment can be reduced or deferred by deploying the autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS). Although some of the wind farm generation is curtailed, the loss is smaller than the reduction of network investment cost. The present work shows the potential of installing an active control system as an alternative of network reinforcement to accommodate increasing REG connections.

Abstract: A large integration of renewable energy sources such as wind power generation and photovoltaic generation causes some problems in power systems, e.g., distribution voltage rise and frequency fluctuation. Battery energy storage system (BESS) is one of the effective solutions to these problems. Due to a high cost of the BESS, an application of controllable loads such as electric vehicle (EV) and heat pump water heater (HPWH) to the power system control is considered in this paper for reduction of the required capacity of the BESS. This paper proposes a new supplementary load frequency control (LFC) method by use of a number of both the EVs and the HPWHs as controllable loads. The effectiveness of the proposed LFC method is shown by numerical simulations conducted on the power system model with a large integration of wind power generation and photovoltaic generation.

Abstract: Smart power grids with high penetration of intermittent, nondispatchable distributed energy resources (ING), and cyber networks with real-time pricing require new tools for automatic generation control (AGC). The main drawbacks of the intermittency are increased use of expensive spinning reserves, normally gas-fired units, and wear and tear of thermal units because of pulsating turbine valves of steam units for load regulation. This paper presents a new AGC structure to overcome the drawback of intermittency in smart power grids. The constant pressure steam (CPS), hydro, and variable pressure steam (VPS) units are controlled to follow low frequency load dynamic based on a one-step ahead load target. The distributed community storage (DCS) together with load dynamic response (DR) and aggregated DRs as virtual generator (DR/VG) assets are used to control high-frequency load fluctuations. The INGs and nuclear units are used as base loads.

Abstract: Due to the proliferation of harmonic producing-loads, harmonic resonance has become a major hurdle for performing power factor compensation in commercial power systems, such as office towers and shopping complexes. This paper presents an intelligent power factor compensation controller that can perform power factor correction without exciting harmonic resonance under varying demand conditions. Practical and robust control algorithms are proposed for the purpose of easy implementation in a micro-controller. In addition, the controller relies on common low cost sensing devices and does not require additional measurements. As a result, the proposed controller can be constructed as a retrofitting device to replace existing power factor correction controllers with little effort. Analysis of representative case studies is conducted to illustrate how the proposed controller performs.

Abstract: Monitoring/control infrastructures are often assumed to be fully reliable in power system reliability studies. However, recent investigations on blackouts have revealed the crucial impacts of monitoring/control system malfunctions. This paper addresses the impact of situational awareness and controllability on power system reliability assessment. A methodology is proposed to simulate a situation in which a limitation of either or both monitoring and control functions could spread the consequence of power system events throughout the grid. It is assumed that the monitoring/control infrastructure is based on a wide-area measurement system (WAMS). While the proposed methodology is applicable to a variety of strategies for grid operations, certain assumptions are made for the simulation purposes. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied and a scenario reduction technique is considered for overcoming computational burdens. The performance of the proposed approach is simulated and analyzed on 9-bus and the IEEE 57-bus systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses ac microgrid stability under high penetration of converter-interfaced loads (CILs). According to the Nyquist admittance ratio criterion, destabilizing interaction dynamics are yielded among the interfacing voltage-source inverter (VSI) of the ac microgrid and CILs. Active stabilization techniques are proposed to maintain the overall system stability from the VSI side using admittance-based small signal analysis. Sensitivity and robustness analyses are presented to assess the dynamic coupling among active damping and voltage tracking controllers of the interfacing VSI. A complete Matlab/Simulink model of an ac microgrid with multiple CILs is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active compensation techniques.

Abstract: The rapid increase of phasor measurements on the high voltage power system has opened opportunities for new applications to enhance the operation of the grid. To take advantage of the high sampling rates of these measurement data, these applications will require a high-bandwidth, networked communication system. The specifications for this next generation communication system that will overlay the continental power grids are under intense discussion at this time by organizations like the North-American Synchro-Phasor Initiative (NASPI). In this paper we present a method to simulate, design and test the adequacy of a communication system for a particular transmission grid. The main difference from typical communication system studies is that we formulate the communication requirements from the power grid application requirements, that is, the communication design, simulation and testing is from the viewpoint of the anticipated power applications. The method is demonstrated on a WECC 225 bus and a Polish 2383 bus transmission system models.

Abstract: Smart grid initiatives are becoming more and more achievable through the use of information infrastructures that feature peer-to-peer communication, monitoring, protection and automated control. The analysis of smart grid operation requires considering the reliability of the cyber network as it is neither invulnerable nor failure free. This paper quantitatively evaluates the reliability of modern power systems, which incorporates the impact of cyber network failures on the reliability of the power network. In this paper, four types of interdependencies are defined and a new concept of statemapping is proposed to map the failures in the cyber network to the failures of the power network. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the impact of direct cyber-power interdependencies on the reliability indices, two optimization models are introduced to maximize the data connection in the cyber network and minimize the load shedding in the power network. The effectiveness of proposed reliability evaluation method is shown by a smart microgrid application. The methodology presented in this paper is a start point to optimize the future power grid which has increasingly interdependencies between cyber and power networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces new analytical techniques for performing vulnerability analysis of state estimation when it is subject to a hidden false data injection cyber-attack on a power grid's SCADA system. Specifically, we consider ac state estimation and describe how the physical properties of the system can be used as an advantage in protecting the power system from such an attack. We present an algorithm based on graph theory which allows determining how many and which measurement signals an attacker will attack in order to minimize his efforts in keeping the attack hidden from bad data detection. This provides guidance on which measurements are vulnerable and need increased protection. Hence, this paper provides insights into the vulnerabilities but also the inherent strengths provided by ac state estimation and network topology features such as buses without power injections.

Abstract: The paper presents a new Fast Gauss-Newton algorithm (FGNWA) for the detection of islanding condition in distributed generation systems (DGs) when they are disconnected from the main supply system or there are small load unbalances in the distribution network. During islanding conditions power system parameters like frequency, voltage magnitude, phase change, total harmonic distortion, and various sequence voltage, current, and power components do change and hence by monitoring these changes accurately, an islanding condition can be detected. A forgetting factor weighted error cost function is minimized by the well known Gauss-Newton (GN) algorithm and the resulting Hessian matrix is approximated by ignoring the off-diagonal terms to yield the new FGNW algorithm to estimate, in a recursive and decoupled manner, all the above voltage and current signal parameters accurately for realistic power systems even in the presence of significant noise. A number of test cases considering both islanding and nonislanding, for realistic, hybrid distribution networks has demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of the islanding detection scheme, when a fuzzy expert system (FES) is used in conjunction with the proposed FGNW algorithm.

Abstract: It is foreseen that a future smart grid has to handle more dynamic and distributed electricity supply and consumption. In that case, a robust automation system becomes essential. To monitor the status of the power system, a large amount of sensors are deployed in both the transmission grid and distribution grid. The sensors generate massive amount of data periodically for automation. This paper studies how the data measured on transmission lines can be delivered efficiently to substations. It has been demonstrated that the traditional way of data transmission is not sufficient and direct wireless links should be used to reduce the delay in information delivery. Furthermore, optimal placement of these direct wireless links is studied aiming at minimizing the delay in information delivery. The associated energy consumption in data transmission is also investigated.

Abstract: The adoption of smart meters may bring new privacy concerns to the general public. Given the fact that metering data of individual homes/factories is accumulated every 15 min, it is possible to infer the pattern of electricity consumption of individual users. In order to protect the privacy of users in a completely de-centralized setting (i.e., individuals do not communicate with one another), we propose a novel protocol, which allows individual meters to report the true electricity consumption reading with a pre-determined probability. Load serving entities (LSE) can reconstruct the total electricity consumption of a region or a district through inference algorithm, but their ability of identifying individual users' energy consumption pattern is significantly reduced. Using simulated data, we verify the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate performance advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: To secure the network communication for the smart grid, it is important that a secure key management scheme is needed. The focus of this paper is on the secure key distribution for the smart grid. In this paper, we first overview the key management scheme recently proposed by Wu-Zhou and show it is vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack. Then we propose a new key distribution protocol and demonstrate it is secure and efficient for smart grid network. Applying traditional PKI to the smart grid requires significant work and maintenance of the public key. By using Kerberos to smart grid may lose authentication from the third party due to power outages. Therefore, we propose a scheme for a smart grid using a trusted third party which not only has no issue on key revocation, but also the third party can be easily duplicated in case power outages occur.

Abstract: Reliability evaluation of phasor measurement unit (PMU) is a primary key element in the reliability evaluation of wide-area monitoring system (WAMS). In this paper, a comprehensive reliability evaluation method based on Monte Carlo dynamic fault tree (MCDFT) analysis is proposed to conduct the reliability evaluation on PMU. The reliability model of PMU is constructed using dynamic fault tree modeling and analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the reliability indices of PMU. The validity and advantages of the proposed MCDFT reliability evaluation of PMU were verified with simulation and comparison studies. Importance analysis showed that basic components in the GPS receiver and CPU hardware modules have high impacts on the reliability of PMU. Sensitivity and redundancy design analysis are then applied to conclude that the redundancy design of GPS receiver and CPU hardware would be the best measure for improving the reliability of PMU. Finally, a self-adaptive wide-area damping control scheme is taken as an example for the application of PMU reliability.

Abstract: This paper presents a concept, method, and implementation of utilizing phasor measurement unit (PMU) information to monitor the wide-area security of a power system. The close dependency of major transmission paths requires an approach that takes that interaction into account while establishing operational transfer capability, and evaluates grid reliability and security on a system-wide basis. Thus, the concept of wide-area security region, which considers all essential constraints, including thermal, voltage stability, transient stability, and small signal stability, is proposed. This approach expands the idea of traditional transmission system nomograms to a multidimensional case, involving multiple system limits and parameters such as transmission path constraints, zonal generation or load, etc., considered concurrently. In this paper, the security region boundary is represented using piece-wise approximation with the help of linear inequalities (so called hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space, consisting of system parameters that are critical for security analysis. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are conducted to build the security region and the hyperplanes can be applied in real time with phasor information for on-line security assessment. Numerical simulations have been performed for the full size Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system model, which comprises 15 126 buses and 3034 generators. Simulation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, and proved that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the wide-area situation awareness for a bulk power system like WECC.

Abstract: This paper proposes an accurate and precise genetic algorithm(GA) for frequency estimation of electrical power system (EPS) signals. The problem of estimating the frequency of a distorted electrical signal is modeled as an optimization problem. A regularization technique is used to guide the GA to a plausible solution from a practical point of view when the signal has significant output distortions. In this approach, the GA using regularization (GAR) enables the balanced investigation of a number of potential solutions, largely exploring the search space from one side, and weighing the suitable solutions according to practical purposes from the other side. The GAR is programmed in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. This is made possible due to 1) the implicit parallelism of FPGAs in computing their instructions and 2) the suitable choice of steps of GARs to explore this parallelism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an EPS was simulated having typical operation conditions. The relatively high robustness exhibited by the GAR to harmonics and noise makes it a promising equipment in the challenge of construction of smart power grids.

Abstract: Recently, the concept of microgrids (clusters of distributed generation, energy storage units, and reactive power sources serving a cluster of distributed loads in grid-connected and isolated grid modes) has gained a lot of interest under the smart grid vision. However, there is a strong need to develop systematic procedure for optimal construction of microgrids. This paper presents systematic and optimized approaches for clustering of the distribution system into a set of virtual microgrids with optimized self-adequacy. The probabilistic characteristics of distributed generation (DG) units are also considered by defining two new probabilistic indices representing real and reactive power of the lines. Next, the advantages of installing both distributed energy storage resources (DESRs) and distributed reactive sources (DRSs) are investigated to improve the self-adequacy of the constructed micro-grids. The new strategy facilitates robust infrastructure for smart distribution systems operational control functions, such as self-healing, by using virtual microgrids as building blocks in future distribution systems. The problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper. The well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as a test case and through several sensitivity studies, the effect of the total DESRs or DRSs capacities on the design and the robustness of the algorithm are investigated.

Abstract: In this paper, comparative study between wavelet transform (WT) and S-transform (ST) based on extracted features for detection of islanding and power quality (PQ) disturbances in hybrid distributed generation (DG) system is presented. The hybrid system consists of DG resources like photovoltaic, fuel cell, and wind energy systems connected to grid. The negative sequence component of the voltage signal is used in islanding detection of these resources from the grid. Voltage signal extracted directly at the point of common coupling is considered for detection of PQ disturbances. Further, the effect of variation of grid impedances on islanding and PQ disturbances and effect of islanding on the coherency between the energy resources is also presented in this paper. The study for different scenarios of DG system is presented in the form of time-frequency analysis. The energy content and standard deviation of ST contour and WT signal is also reported in order to validate the graphical results. The results demonstrate the advantages of S-transform over WT in detection of islanding and different disturbances under noise-free as well as noisy scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, the coordinated integration of aggregated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) fleets and renewable energy sources (wind energy) in power systems is studied by stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (Stochastic SCUC) model, which minimizes the expected grid operation cost while considering the random behavior of the many PEVs. PEVs are mobile and distributed devices with deferrable options for the supply/utilization of energy at various times and locations. The increased utilization of PEVs, which consume electricity rather than fossil fuel for driving, offers unique economic and environmental opportunities, and brings out new challenges to electric power system operation and planning. The storage capability of PEVs could help power systems mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources and reduce grid operation costs. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables PEVs to have bi-directional power flows once they are connected to the grid, i.e., they can either inject power to, and draw power from, the grid which adds further complexity to power system operations. PEVs signify customers' random behavior when considering their driving patterns, locational energy requirements, topological grid interconnections, and other constraints imposed by the consumers. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for analyzing the impact of PEVs on the grid operation cost and hourly wind energy dispatch.

Abstract: The energy sector is moving into the era of distributed generation (DG) and microgrids (MGs). The stability and operation aspects of converter-dominated DG MGs, however, are faced by many challenges. Important among these, are: 1) the absence of physical inertia; 2) comparable size of power converters; 3) mutual interactions among generators; 4) islanding detection delays; and 5) large sudden disturbances associated with transition to islanded mode, grid restoration, and load power changes. To overcome these difficulties, this paper presents a new large-signal-based control topology for DG power converters that is suitable for both grid-connected and islanding modes of operation without any need to reconfigure the control system and without islanding detection. To improve MG stability, the proposed control structure is realized via two steps. First, an emulated inertia and damping functions are adopted. Second, to guarantee stability and high performance of the MG system during sudden harsh transients such as islanding, grid reconnection, and large load power changes, a nonlinear MG stabilizer is proposed. An augmented converter model is developed and used to design the MG stabilizer via the adaptive backstepping (AB) technique to guarantee large-angle stability and robustness against unmodeled dynamics. Theoretical analysis and evaluation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in achieving stable and smooth operation of a MG system in grid-connected, islanding, and transition modes.

Abstract: The passive nature of power distribution networks has been changing to an active one in recent years as the number of small-scale Distributed Generators (DGs) connected to them rises. The consensus of recent research is that current slow central network control based upon Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is no longer sufficient and Distributed Network Operators (DNOs) wish to adopt novel management mechanisms coupled with advanced communication infrastructures to meet the emerging control challenges. In this paper, we address this issue from the communication perspective by exploiting the effectiveness of using a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network as the key component of the underlying communication infrastructure to support a recently suggested active network management solution. The key factors that would affect the communication performance over satellite links are discussed and an analytical LEO network model is presented. The delivery performance of several major data services for supporting the management solution is evaluated against a wide range of satellite link delay and loss conditions under both normal and emergency traffic scenarios through extensive simulation experiments. Our investigation demonstrates encouraging results which suggests that a LEO network can be a viable communication solution for managing the next-generation power energy networks.

Abstract: Wide area monitoring (WAM), wide area protection (WAP), and wide area control (WAC) systems will enhance the future of smart grid operation in terms of reliability and security. In part I of this paper, a proposed architecture for a hybrid ac/dc smart grid hardware test-bed system was presented. Design details of the various components and their connectivity in the overall system architecture were identified. In part II of the paper, the focus is on the design of monitoring, control, and protection systems and their integrated real-time operation. Various control scenarios for system startup and continuous operation are examined. We have developed a control system based on wide area measurements. The advanced measurement system based on synchrophasors was also implemented using DAQs real-time synchronous data. The developed system features a wide variety of capabilities such as online system parameters calculation and online voltage stability monitoring. These are implemented as an experimental case to enhance wide area monitoring systems. Moreover, the protection system was designed inside of the real-time software environment to monitor the real-time wide area data, and make a comprehensive and reliable coordination for the whole system. Ideas related to the interaction of a dc microgrid involving sustainable energy sources with the main ac grid have been also implemented and presented. The implemented system is explicit and achievable in any research laboratory and for real-time real-world smart grid applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully distributed state estimation algorithm for wide-area monitoring in power systems. Through iterative information exchange with designated neighboring control areas, all the balancing authorities (control areas) can achieve an unbiased estimate of the entire power system's state. In comparison with existing hierarchical or distributed state estimation methods, the novelty of the proposed approach lies in that: 1) the assumption of local observability of all the control areas is no longer needed; 2) the communication topology can be different than the physical topology of the power interconnection; and 3) for DC state estimation, no coordinator is required for each local control area to achieve provable convergence of the entire power system's states to those of the centralized estimation. The performance of both DC and AC state estimation using the proposed algorithm is illustrated in the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how reactive power injection from distributed generators can be used to mitigate the voltage/VAR control problem of a distribution network. Firstly, power flow equations are formulated with arbitrarily located distributed generators in the network. Since reactive power injection is limited by economic viability and power electronics interface, we formulate voltage/VAR control as a constrained optimization problem. The formulation aims to minimize the combined reactive power injection by distributed generators, with constraints on: 1) power flow equations; 2) voltage regulation; 3) phase imbalance correction; and 4) maximum and minimum reactive power injection. The formulation is a nonconvex problem thereby making the search for an optimal solution extremely complex. So, a suboptimal approach is proposed based on methods of sequential convex programming (SCP). Comparing our suboptimal approach with the optimal solution obtained from branch and bound method, we show the trade-off in quality of our solution with runtime. We also validate our approach on the IEEE 123 node test feeder and illustrate the efficacy of using distributed generators as distributed reactive power resource.

Abstract: In this paper we present a FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems)-based control design for electromechanical oscillation damping in large power systems, facilitated by aggregate models that can be constructed using Synchronized phasor measurements. Our approach consists of three steps, namely-1. Model Reduction, where Synchrophasors are used to identify second-order models of the oscillation clusters of the power system retaining the inter-ties on which FACTS devices such as Thyristor Controlled Series Compensators (TCSC) are installed, 2. Aggregate Control, where feedback controllers are designed to achieve a desired closed-loop transient response between every pair of clusters, and finally 3. Control Inversion, where the aggregate control design is distributed and tuned to actual TCSC controllers in the full-order model until its inter-area responses match the respective inter-machine responses of the reduced-order system. It is shown that the inversion problem can be posed equivalently as decomposing the swing dynamics into fast and slow states, and designing the controllers such that the slow dynamics can optimally track a desired closed-loop signal designed for the aggregate model. Application of the approach to two-area power systems is demonstrated through topological examples inspired by the US west coast grid.

Abstract: The vision of a smart grid is predicated upon pervasive use of modern digital communication techniques to today's power system. As wide area measurements and control techniques are being developed and deployed for a more resilient power system, the role of communication network is becoming prominent. Power system dynamics gets influenced by the communication delays in the network. Therefore, extensive integration of power system and communication infrastructure mandates that the two systems be studied as a single distributed cyber-physical system. This paper proposes a power system and communication network co-simulation framework (GECO) using a global event-driven mechanism. The accuracy is tunable based on the time-scale requirements of the phenomena being studied. This co-simulation can improve the practical investigation of smart grid and evaluate wide area measurement and control schemes. As a case study, a communication-based backup distance relay protection scheme is co-simulated and validated on this co-simulation framework.

Abstract: In the future smart grid, both users and power companies can potentially benefit from the economical and environmental advantages of smart pricing methods to more effectively reflect the fluctuations of the wholesale price into the customer side. In addition, smart pricing can be used to seek social benefits and to implement social objectives. To achieve social objectives, the utility company may need to collect various information about users and their energy consumption behavior, which can be challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method to tackle this problem. We assume that each user is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) as part of its smart meter. All smart meters are connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure. This allows two-way communication among smart meters and the utility company. We analytically model each user's preferences and energy consumption patterns in form of a utility function. Based on this model, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism which aims to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the aggregate utility functions of all users minus the total energy cost. Our design requires that each user provides some information about its energy demand. In return, the energy provider will determine each user's electricity bill payment. Finally, we verify some important properties of our proposed VCG mechanism for demand side management such as efficiency, user truthfulness, and nonnegative transfer. Simulation results confirm that the proposed pricing method can benefit both users and utility companies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of providing intra-hour load balancing services using aggregated heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads. A directload control algorithm is presented. A temperature-priority-list method is used to dispatch the HVAC loads optimally to maintain customer-desired indoor temperatures and load diversity. Realistic intra-hour load balancing signals are used to evaluate the operational characteristics of the HVAC load under different outdoor temperature profiles and different indoor temperature settings. The number of HVAC units needed is also investigated. Modeling results suggest that the number of HVAC units needed to provide a +/- 1-MW load balancing service 24 hours a day varies significantly with baseline settings, high and low temperature settings, and outdoor temperatures. The results demonstrate that the intra-hour load balancing service provided by HVAC loads meets the performance requirements and can become a major source of revenue for load-serving entities where the two-way communication smart grid infrastructure enables direct load control over the HVAC loads.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) is considered to be one of the most incentive smart grid functions to enhance power system reliability and control. For the purpose of system security, DR has been utilized to deal with contingent events. In this way, load shedding conducted by the DR program is no longer sorely considered as the last defense line to save system frequency, it should be considered as part of the available fast response resources to cooperate with spinning reserve for balancing generation and demand under some specific conditions. This paper proposes an overall frequency restoration plan considering the DR and spinning reserve. The frequency restoration is designed using the DR as the first option to intercept frequency decline for a large disturbance, followed by the scheduled spinning reserve to raise frequency back to the pre-disturbance level. The proposed scheme is especially developed to intelligently deploy DR for coordinating with different spinning reserve constraints and contingency scenarios. Tests of the proposed frequency restoration scheme are evaluated by simulation where the system data was retrieved from frequency events in a utility. Test results show that the proposed spinning reserve and DR deployment could effectively restore frequency under various contingency scenarios.

Abstract: Despite their undoubted advantages, Distributed Generation (DG) systems can negatively impact some aspects of the distribution system operation. In this paper, impacts of inverter-based DGs on fuse-recloser coordination in the fuse-saving protection scheme are thoroughly studied. Various fault conditions with different fault resistances and the effects of different DG locations are investigated. Also, the effects of DG reactive power injection, known as a DG potential ancillary service, on the protection scheme are studied. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the impact of DG on the protection coordination, a simple and effective control strategy is proposed. This strategy limits the DG output current according to the DG terminal voltage. Extensive simulations at different fault conditions and different DG penetration levels showed that the proposed control method is able to eliminate DG's contribution during the fault, and consequently eliminate its impact on the fuse-recloser coordination. In comparison to other methods, this strategy is inexpensive, easy to implement, does not limit DG capacity during normal condition, and does not require any change in the original protection system. The simulation results also demonstrated that the proposed method is robust against non-fault transient disturbances such as load switching, starting of induction motors, etc.

Abstract: The heterogeneity of domestic loads presents distribution network operators with operational uncertainties which may become problematic as generation capacity shrinks and network infrastructure ages. High resolution meter advances recorded by increasingly ubiquitous Smart Meters can be seen as representing base loads along with aggregations of multiple domestic appliances-in this letter, a Bayesian formulation of the finite mixture probability distribution is employed to enumerate and capture generalizations of these, from which compact representations of domestic load profiles can be formed.

Abstract: Automated metering is expected to be an integral part of the modern energy grid. Automated metering entails transport of metering data from the energy consumer's premises to the data management systems of the energy provider and potentially information in the other direction. This paper describes a practical mesh networking solution based on extensions proposed to the routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) to realize automated metering communications. This solution comprises self-organizing algorithms to enable smart meters to automatically discover connectivity and recover from loss of connectivity. Results from a theoretical analysis, simulation based experiments and measurements carried out from a network deployed in our office premises are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed solution. In particular, we study the impact of these algorithms on the network discovery latency, recovery latency, and packet delivery ratio. Findings from this study demonstrate that this solution can improve scalability and performance of the network. Moreover, this solution is practical from an implementation perspective.

Abstract: This paper describes a wireless sensor-actuator network to monitor and manage thermostatically controlled loads, mainly heating and cooling loads, which accounts for around 50% of the residential electricity consumption. A decentralized system is proposed to modify the electrical power demand according to a target demand profile and a set of prefixed constraints, maintaining minimum comfort levels and minimizing the infrastructure requirements. This solution offers the residential customers a flexible, powerful and low-cost tool to modify their power demand profile, avoiding any additional wiring and extending the wireless sensor-actuator networks technology towards small customers, with around 30% share of the global electricity consumption. The proposed system has been implemented and assessed in a university environment, where heating and cooling loads have been monitored and controlled. Acquired data are also included in this paper as well as an example of the forced switching-off time periods applied on the controlled loads, leading to approximately 15% reduction of the peak power demand.

Abstract: With more and more renewable energy generation (REG) connections, busbar voltage violation and line overloading problems may occur for some parts of a distribution network. However, building new circuits to accommodate REG may have high monetary and environmental costs. This paper considers distribution automation as a supplementary scheme to traditional primary asset investments and analyzes the operational benefits from introducing an autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS) to a practical distribution system with rich renewable sources. The benefits are quantified in terms of optimal power flow control and investment deferral, and the resulting quantification will inform distribution network operators of the trade-offs between investment in the automation system and in the primary assets, thus helping them to make cost-effective investment decisions. Time-series-based simulation for over an entire year is implemented to calculate the benefits of active power loss and curtailment reductions for AuRA-NMS over the current practice. Part I of this paper illustrates the current schemes for voltage control and constraint management, advanced voltage control and constraint management enabled by the distribution automation, and the annual benefit by introducing the AuRA-NMS to the system with different considerable new DG integrations. Part II analyzes the investment deferral benefit by deploying AuRA-NMS.

Abstract: In this paper a decentralized reactive power control scheme is proposed to optimally control the switched capacitor in the system in order to minimize system losses and maintain acceptable voltage profile. The proposed technique is based on placing a remote terminal unit (RTUs) at each DG and each at line capacitor. These RTUs being coordinated together through communication protocols form a multiagent system. Novel decentralized algorithm is proposed to estimate the voltage profile change as a result of injecting reactive power at the capacitor bus. Simulation results are presented to show the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed framework for demand response and user adaptation in smart grid networks. In particular, we borrow the concept of congestion pricing in Internet traffic control and show that pricing information is very useful to regulate user demand and hence balance network load. User preference is modeled as a willingness to pay parameter which can be seen as an indicator of differential quality of service. Both analysis and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the dynamics and convergence behavior of the algorithm. Based on this algorithm, we then propose a novel charging method for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in a smart grid, where users or PHEVs can adapt their charging rates according to their preferences. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the dynamic behavior of the charging algorithm and impact of different parameters on system performance.

Abstract: Hybrid ac/dc power networks are recently emerged in distribution generation (DG) systems with widespread acceptance under the smart grids environment. However, system-level dynamic interactions might be yielded due to the active control nature and tight regulation of power converters to meet load/generation requirements. This paper presents an assessment and mitigation strategies of such interactions in hybrid networks. A typical and comprehensive hybrid network composed of a DG power park, dc microgrid, islanded ac microgrid interfaced by voltage-source converter (VSC), and a grid-connected VSC is considered. Mathematical modeling and analysis of the input/output admittances of these entities are provided to evaluate the overall system stability based on the Nyquist admittance ratio criterion. It can be shown that the tight regulation of VSCs introduces incremental negative admittances reflected to the common dc link which significantly degrades the system stability. Therefore, active compensators are proposed to actively reshape the input dc-side admittance of the VSCs so that the Nyquist criterion is satisfied. Time-domain-large signal model of a typical hybrid network is implemented to validate the analytical results.

Abstract: A massive introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the transportation sector would likely increase the total electricity consumption. Depending on how and when the PEVs are charged, the effects on the power demand will vary. Previous studies have shown that uncontrolled charge of PEVs can cause problems for the distribution system in some areas. This paper proposes an approach to control PEVs charging based on the charging behavior estimated from the demographical statistical data. In this approach, three different charge strategies are designed and the impacts of PEVs charging on the distribution system is assess using standard load flow calculations. A case study using the proposed approach examines the real situation in Gothenburg, a city on the west coast of Sweden. The results from the study show that the impacts on the distribution system due to PEVs vary between different areas. By controlling the charging, the impacts can be reduced but the choice of control methods must be chosen carefully. Furthermore, the results indicate that a well-developed public charging infrastructure could reduce the stress on the residential distribution systems since part of the charging can be done in commercial areas.

Abstract: Distributed generation is expected to increase sharply as more and more renewable are integrated to power system with the realization of smart grid, consequently complex distribution smart grid is given. The traditional protection devices cannot be able to protect complex power system configuration due to many fault current loops will feed the fault point. Relays based on standalone decisions cannot provide reliable and correct action when used on a complex distribution system. This paper proposes new protection philosophy using wireless technology. Data sharing among relays to obtain reliable and accurate decision are introduced. Wireless Token Ring Protocol (WTRP) as a wireless local area network (LAN) protocol inspired by the IEEE 802.4 Token Bus Protocol is used for data sharing. WTRP is selected to improve efficiency by reducing the number of retransmissions due to collisions. WTRP architecture and protocol are described to verify operation. MATLAB simulation program is used to simulate the data exchange protocol between relays in a ring for a specified amount of time.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified operational value index of energy storage in the smart grid electricity market environment. Given the heterogeneity of many storage service providers enabled by smart grid technologies, this unified value index will allow for comparison across different technology choices. It is also argued that implicit forms of energy storage, such as demand response, should be valued and utilized. A cross-market cooptimization is proposed to maximize the operational value of energy storage under the deregulated electricity market environment. For numerical illustration a case study is conducted in a modified 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS), which includes flywheels, battery storage in the form of plug-in electric vehicles, and price responsive thermal load.

Abstract: This paper investigates the distribution system impacts of electric vehicle (EV) charging. The analysis is based on a large number of operational distribution networks in The Netherlands. Future load profiles have been constructed by adding different EV charging profiles to household loads and solving the power flows to assess the network impacts on various network levels. The results indicate that controlled charging of EVs leads to significant reduction of overloaded network components that have to be replaced, but the impact varies per network level. Overall, in the uncontrolled charging scenarios roughly two times more replacements are needed compared to the controlled charging scenario. Furthermore, it was shown that for the controlled charging scenario the overall reduction in net present value due to energy losses and the replacement of overloaded network components is approximately 20% in comparison with the uncontrolled charging scenario. The results suggest that the deployment of a flexible and intelligent distribution network is a cost-beneficial way to accommodate large penetrations of EVs.

Abstract: Because of society's full dependence on electricity and high cost of system outages, one important goal is to increase the reliability of the power system, which means that a salient attractive feature of smart grid is its self-healing ability. Smart grids will develop and enhance the automation of distribution by operating in a distributed manner through new digital technologies such as monitoring, automatic control, two-way communication, and data management. In this work, the smart grid concept and technologies have been applied to construct a self-healing framework for use in smart distribution systems. The proposed multiagent system is designed to locate and isolate faults, then decide and implement the switching operations to restore the out-of-service loads. The proposed control structure has two layers: zone and feeder. The function of zone agents in the first layer is monitoring, making simple calculations, and implementing control actions. Feeder agents in the second layer are assigned to negotiation. The constraints include voltage limits, line current limits, and radial topology. Load variation has been taken into consideration to avoid the need for further reconfigurations during the restoration period. The results of the simulation conducted using the new framework demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control structure.

Abstract: An experiment is carried out to measure the power consumption of households. The analysis on the real measurement data shows that the significant change of power consumption arrives in a Poisson manner. Based on this experiment, a novel wireless communication scheme is proposed for the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grid that can significantly improve the spectrum efficiency. The main idea is to transmit only when a significant power consumption change occurs. On the other hand, the policy of transmitting only when change occurs may bring a security issue; i.e., an eavesdropper can monitor the daily life of the house owner, particularly the information of whether the owner is at home. Hence, a defense scheme is proposed to combat this vulnerability by adding artificial spoofing packets. It is shown by numerical results that the defense scheme can effectively prevent the security challenge.

Abstract: Demand side management (DSM) is one of the important functions in a smart grid that allows customers to make informed decisions regarding their energy consumption, and helps the energy providers reduce the peak load demand and reshape the load profile. This results in increased sustainability of the smart grid, as well as reduced overall operational cost and carbon emission levels. Most of the existing demand side management strategies used in traditional energy management systems employ system specific techniques and algorithms. In addition, the existing strategies handle only a limited number of controllable loads of limited types. This paper presents a demand side management strategy based on load shifting technique for demand side management of future smart grids with a large number of devices of several types. The day-ahead load shifting technique proposed in this paper is mathematically formulated as a minimization problem. A heuristic-based Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) that easily adapts heuristics in the problem was developed for solving this minimization problem. Simulations were carried out on a smart grid which contains a variety of loads in three service areas, one with residential customers, another with commercial customers, and the third one with industrial customers. The simulation results show that the proposed demand side management strategy achieves substantial savings, while reducing the peak load demand of the smart grid.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel integration of wind farm energy storage (ES) systems within microgrids. The main feature of the method is that the voltage and frequency control of the microgrid is shared by the wind generators through droop characteristics. Therefore, the control structure is suitable when the wind generators supply significant part of the load. The paper modifies the standard droop method in order to force the generators to share the load according to their available wind power and not just the generator rating. The paper focuses on islanded microgrid application; however, the method is applicable when there is a controlled connection to the main grid via a power converter, and also for HVDC connection. The proposed control methods are derived for doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) and validated using PSCAD/EMTDC simulations. The ride-through in case of a 3-phase fault on the local grid will also be simulated.

Abstract: Increasing expansion of power systems and grids are accompanied nowadays by innovation in smart grid solutions to maintain systems stability. This paper proposes an intelligent wide area synchrophasor based system (IWAS) for predicting and mitigating transient instabilities. The IWAS incorporates artificial neural networks (ANN) for transient stability prediction. The ANN makes use of the advent of phasor measurements units (PMU) for real-time prediction. Coherent groups of generators-which swing together-is identified through an algorithm based on PMU measurements. A remedial action scheme (RAS) is applied to counteract the system instability by splitting the system into islands and initiate under frequency load shedding actions. The potential of the proposed approach is tested using New England 39 bus system.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to formulate a customer-oriented demand response (DR) program in the electricity market using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). AHP could represent the mutual importance degrees of load reduction criteria from the various viewpoints of load-holders. Thus, the proposed DR program (DRP) could provide the reasonable decision-support process for load-holders, because the participation or nonparticipation is determined by the incentive payments corresponding to the specific load reduction conditions. The proposed DRP has the objective to maintain the system reliability at the emergency period, and it is designed as an incentive-based program (IBP) considering the real-time and by-directional operation. The modified IEEE 24-bus system for the case study is used to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the proposed approach, and the load profiles with the proposed DRP and the required incentive payments are obtained. The results show not only the enhancement to the system reliability but also the economic benefits within Pareto-improvement.

Abstract: Forecasting electricity prices plays a significant role in making optimal scheduling decisions in competitive electricity markets. Predominantly, price forecasting is performed from a "point forecasting" perspective, i.e., forecasting the exact values of future prices. However, in some applications, such as demand-side management, operation decisions are made based on certain price thresholds. It is, hence, desirable to obtain the "classes" of future prices, which can be cast as an electricity price classification problem. In this paper, we investigate the application and effectiveness of several data mining approaches for electricity market price classification. In addition, we propose a new data model for forming the initial data set for price classification. Simulation results for New York, Ontario, and Alberta electricity market prices are provided. Finally, the application of the generated numerical results to a demand-side management case study is demonstrated.

Abstract: This paper proposes application of wireless sensor networks in distributed generation. Furthermore, in order to have a reliable communication with minimal end-to-end delay during the event of next hop node failure, the paper proposes a Find Reliable Link (FRL) scheme. Power sharing can be improved significantly in a conventional decentralized power control by correcting the distributed generators reference signals with wireless sensor networks as proposed in this paper. Even a low bandwidth communication among the distributed generators and control center can overcome the system operation challenges posed by network line parameters, failure of distributed generators and power shortage in the system. In order to ensure reliable communication between the sensor nodes or distributed generators and control center, the paper proposes the FRL scheme. The scheme aims to enable the system to make a quick recovery from sensor node failures or link failure due to obstacles thereby reducing the end-to-end delay. The proposed communication scheme is verified by implementing it in Qualnet 5.0. A detail data traffic analysis is presented to demonstrate how reliability is improved in the proposed communication method. Closed loop simulation of communication network with distributed power sources also validates the reliability of the proposed schemes.

Abstract: The concept of microgrid hierarchical control is presented recently. In this paper, a hierarchical scheme is proposed which includes primary and secondary control levels. The primary level comprises distributed generators (DGs) local controllers. The local controllers mainly consist of power, voltage and current controllers, and virtual impedance control loop. The central secondary controller is designed to manage the compensation of voltage unbalance at the point of common coupling (PCC) in an islanded microgrid. Unbalance compensation is achieved by sending proper control signals to the DGs local controllers. The design procedure of the control system is discussed in detail and the simulation results are presented. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed control structure in compensating the voltage unbalance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a coordinated control of distributed energy storage system (ESS) with traditional voltage regulators including the on-load tap changer transformers (OLTC) and step voltage regulators (SVR) to solve the voltage rise problem caused by the high photovoltaic (PV) penetration in the low-voltage distribution network. The main objective of this coordinated control is to relieve the tap changer transformer operation stress, shave the distribution network peak load and decrease the transmission and distribution resistive power losses under high solar power penetration. The proposed control method limits the energy storage depth of discharge in order to meet a more than ten-year cycle life. A benchmark distribution network model was developed in the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the simulation results from the studied cases verified the proposed coordinated control strategy. The experimental implementation of proposed control algorithms were developed based on a power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) test bed with a 22 kWh ESS, a smart meter, Labview controller, and RTDS. The experimental results were consistent with those obtained from simulation study.

Abstract: Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are set to be the defining trend in road transportation for the 21st century. Unfortunately, the process of charging a large number of PHEVs will put a prohibitive amount of stress on conventional power grids. As per current estimates, it will not be possible to satisfy the peak demand of charging millions of PHEVs with current infrastructure. Additionally, to ensure stability of the power grid, the demand needs to be closely matched with supply all the time. This is difficult to ensure in a dynamic scenario like PHEV charging, where it is not possible to predict the load in the future. This problem is further complicated by the introduction of intermittent sources of alternate energy like wind power. This paper proposes an IT infrastructure for managing energy usage of PHEVs. The paper introduces a generalized currency of energy called a token, which entitles its owner to produce or consume a certain amount of electrical energy. Furthermore, the paper propose an IT infrastructure to manage tokens produced by millions of PHEVs and power stations. Simulation results for the system that consider the behavior of millions of PHEVs using data in prior work and traces from the Australian power grid for the last five years are also presented.

Abstract: A grounding grid of a substation is essential for reducing the ground potential rises inside and outside the substation during a short-circuit event. The performance of a grounding grid is affected by a number of factors, such as the soil conductivity and grounding rod corrosion. Industry always has a strong desire for a reliable and cost-effective method to monitor the condition of a grounding grid to ensure personnel safety and prevent equipments damage. In view of the increased adoption of telecom and sensor technologies in power industry through the smart grid initiative, this paper proposes an online condition monitoring scheme for grounding grids. The scheme monitors touch and step voltages in a substation through a sensor network. The voltages are created by a continuously-injected, controllable test current. The results are transmitted to a database through wireless telecommunication. The database evaluates the grid performance continuously by comparing the newly measured results with the historical data. Many of the limitations of the offline measurement techniques are overcome. Computer simulation studies have shown that the proposed scheme is highly feasible and technically attractive.

Abstract: In the upcoming smart grid environment many more measurements will be available, which can be locally processed by the so-called substation state estimator (SSE). Distribution substations serve energy to a large set of feeders, each one delivering power to a certain number of secondary transformers. In this context, the SSE may have to deal with a huge network model, comprising several hundred or even thousand buses. Taking advantage of the weak electrical coupling existing among the set of feeders connected to the same or adjacent substations, a two-stage procedure is proposed in this paper to efficiently solve the SSE. In the first stage the overall SE is decomposed into f + s WLS subproblems (f and s being the total number of feeders and substations, respectively), which are then solved in a decoupled manner. The second stage, involving a linear WLS problem, consists of coordinating the solution provided by each subsystem (feeder or substation). The proposed solution scheme has a number of advantages, as shown by the case studies.

Abstract: This paper deals with load control in a multiple-residence setup. The utility company adopts a cost function representing the cost of providing energy to end-users. Each residential end-user has a base load, two types of adjustable loads, and possibly a storage device. The first load type must consume a specified amount of energy over the scheduling horizon, but the consumption can be adjusted across different slots. The second type does not entail a total energy requirement, but operation away from a user-specified level results in user dissatisfaction. The research issue amounts to minimizing the electricity provider cost plus the total user dissatisfaction, subject to the individual constraints of the loads. The problem can be solved by a distributed subgradient method. The utility company and the end-users exchange information through the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)-a two-way communication network-in order to converge to the optimal amount of electricity production and the optimal power consumption schedule. The algorithm finds near-optimal schedules even when AMI messages are lost, which can happen in the presence of malfunctions or noise in the communications network. The algorithm amounts to a subgradient iteration with outdated Lagrange multipliers, for which convergence results of wide scope are established.

Abstract: Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS)-based closed-loop power system control faces lots of challenges such as network effects in WAMS communication which include network-induced delays, data packet dropouts and packet disordering, etc. As of now, design of wide area feedback controller robust against those network effects typically relies on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) methods. However, because LMIs methods results in conservative controller and sometimes feasible solution cannot be found although they exist, it is still difficult to implement wide area feedback control in real power systems. In order to overcome those problems, a more practical scheme is presented in this paper for WAMS-based closed-loop power system control. In the new scheme, a GPS receiver is configured at the wide area feedback controller/actuator which can calculate feedback signals' delays by comparing the time differences between their own clocks and time stamps of feedback signals. Then, by using synchronized sampling technology again, trajectories of power systems are extrapolated to compensate those network effects in WAMS communication. Therefore, in the new scheme, hardware technologies (e.g., GPS-based synchronized sampling technologies) instead of complicated LMIs methods are used to deal with network effects in WAMS communication. So the new control scheme can overcome the conservative nature from LMIs methods and can be implemented practically in real power systems. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: The paper presents an in-depth analysis of the automatic reconfiguration and self-healing principles of the next generation (3G) smart grid of a real metropolitan distribution network. The large network is to be divided dynamically and remotely controlled into three smaller subnetworks to further increase the reliability of electrical power distribution secondary networks. When one subsection is experiencing difficulties, there is no longer the need to de-energize the entire network. A time-domain (EMTP) model has been developed and validated by comparing simulations with recordings of actual transient events. Different switching and fault scenarios are investigated using this model. Analysis of the results provides important conclusions on equipment rating, relay protection coordination, voltage regulation, switching and operation strategies which are discussed in the paper. A subset of these results is presented for illustration. This extensive study of a complex urban network suggests that: 1) before implementation of smart grid principles, it would be prudent to supplement steady-state analysis with time-domain analysis to avoid problems, such as installation of improperly rated equipment, and improper relay-protection coordination; and 2) EMTP-type programs may be used to conduct the time-domain analysis, despite the enormous number of elements contained in an urban network.

Abstract: This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) for real-time operation of a microgrid. The proposed operational strategy is mainly focused on generation scheduling and demand side management. In generation scheduling, schedule coordinator agent executes a two-stage scheduling: day-ahead and real-time scheduling. The day-ahead scheduling finds out hourly power settings of distributed energy resources (DERs) from a day-ahead energy market. The real-time scheduling updates the power settings of the distributed energy resources by considering the results of the day-ahead scheduling and feedback from real-time operation of the microgrid in real-time digital simulator (RTDS). A demand side management agent performs load shifting before the day-ahead scheduling, and does load curtailing in real-time whenever it is necessary and possible. The distributed multiagent model proposed in this paper provides a common communication interface for all components of the microgrid to interact with one another for autonomous intelligent control actions. Furthermore, the multiagent system maximizes the power production of local distributed generators, minimizes the operational cost of the microgrid, and optimizes the power exchange between the main power grid and the microgrid subject to system constraints and constraints of distributed energy resources. Outcome of simulation studies demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed multiagent approach for real-time operation of a microgrid.

Abstract: To mitigate the threat of malware intrusions on networked embedded systems, it is desirable to provide remote attestation assurances for them. Embedded systems have special limitations concerning cost, power efficiency, computation, and memory that influence how this goal can be achieved. Moreover, many types of applications require integrity guarantees for the system over an interval of time rather than just at a given instant. We propose a Cumulative Attestation Kernel (CAK) that addresses these concerns. We demonstrate the value of CAKs for Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and show how to implement a CAK in less than one quarter of the memory available on low end flash MCUs similar to those used in AMI deployments. Regarding this prototype, we present the first formal proof we are aware of that a system is tolerant to power supply interruptions. We also discuss how to provide cumulative attestation for devices with tighter memory constraints by offloading computation and storage onto a Cumulative Attestation Coprocessor (CAC).

Abstract: Grid-wide monitoring of utility assets is essential for maintaining a healthy and reliable power grid. Electric current is an important parameter for grid monitoring. Expensive and large current sensors that require field calibration inhibit utilities from implementing an intelligent monitoring infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel technique and algorithm for current sensing using small, low-cost "stick-on" current sensors that do not require clamping around the utility conductor. Thus, the proposed sensor can be used for monitoring many different utility conductors (not just overhead-conductors). The challenge pertaining to error in current measurement due to the presence of other current carrying assets in proximity has been tackled. The new current sensing technique is shown to discriminate far magnetic fields from the near-field of interest; eliminate expensive calibration requirements for the sensor, and provide accurate current measurements in a noisy magnetic field environment. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed concept. The proposed technique for current sensing promises development of low-cost smart sensors that will be an integral part of the future smart grid.

Abstract: In future smart grids, consumers of electricity will be enabled to react to electricity prices. The aggregate reaction of consumers can potentially shift the demand curve in the market, resulting in prices that may differ from the initial forecasts. In this paper, a hybrid forecasting framework is proposed that takes such dynamics into account when forecasting electricity price and demand. The proposed framework combines a multi-input multioutput (MIMO) forecasting engine for joint price and demand prediction with data association mining (DAM) algorithms. In this framework, a DAM-based rule extraction mechanism is used to determine and extract the patterns in consumers' reaction to price forecasts. The extracted rules are then employed to fine-tune the initially generated demand and price forecasts of a MIMO engine. Simulation results are presented using Australia's and New England's electricity market data.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to present a new and completely distributed algorithm for service restoration with distributed energy storage support following fault detection, location, and isolation. The distributed algorithm makes use of intelligent agents, which possess three key characteristics, namely autonomy, local view, and decentralization. The switch agents will detect, locate and isolate the fault, then restore the load. The distributed energy storage agent will support the system in grid-connected as well as islanded operation. Important restoration issues such as load priority restoration and islanding coordination of multiple distributed energy storage systems will be discussed. Two case studies on the modified IEEE 34 node test feeder will be presented.

Abstract: Many countries have provided incentives for homeowners, businesses and other entities to install solar photovoltaics (PV) to offset generation from other sources, to reduce the pollution caused by the combustion of fossil fuels. Where incentives are high, significant amounts of solar PV are being installed. The term, high penetration solar, has been defined a number of different ways; sometimes comparing the amount of generation to the peak load on a feeder or to the lowest load on a feeder. In this paper we will use it to mean two things: a high enough localized penetration to cause potential voltage issues and a high enough aggregate penetration on a feeder or other section of the electric grid to cause potential voltage issues. The purpose of the paper will be to discuss some of the problems occurring at various voltage levels of the system and solutions that can be or are being introduced to address the issues that high penetration solar PV creates.

Abstract: A novel advanced protection system was developed and demonstrated on SCE's 12 kV Circuit of the Future. This system used fiber optic communications to coordinate the operation of fault interrupting switches located along the circuit. One of the creative components of this project is the study of the circuit with a superconducting fault current limiter (FCL) connected in series with the feeder. The details of the FCL are described in this paper. Knowledge gained from this demonstration was used to design a second generation advanced distribution protection system. This system replaced fiber with radio communications and looped two radial 12 kV circuits together to reduce cost and improve reliability. This system shows promise in helping with protection of circuits with high penetrations of photovoltaic generation. Implementation is planned in 2013 as part of SCE's Irvine Smart Grid Demonstration.

Abstract: The contribution of this paper has been focused on investigating a new microgrid architecture that integrates the solid-state transformer with zonal dc microgrids. By utilizing the dc and ac links of the solid-state transformer, both ac and dc networks can access the distribution system, which renders the coordinate management of the power and guarantees high power supply reliability. In addition, the presented system together with the proposed power management strategy can minimize the effect of newly established zonal dc microgrid to the existing power grid, of which promises a better stability. To this end, this paper takes the photovoltaic and battery as the typical renewable energy resource and energy storage device, and develops a simulation platform for system study. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.

Abstract: This paper proposes a synchrophasor-assisted simple scheme suitable for on-line anticipation of the impending long-term voltage instability in the power system. The proposed scheme utilizes the bus voltage magnitude and the consecutive bus voltage deviations in the system. These two criteria are combined by means of their weighted sum, to define a Synchrophasor Based Voltage Instability Monitoring Index (SVIMI). A new algorithm is also developed for updation of the criteria weights. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated on New England (NE) 39-bus system and Northern Regional Power Grid (NRPG) 246-bus Indian system. The test results are also compared with two existing voltage stability monitoring schemes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper introduces an experimental platform (SYSLAB) for the research on advanced control and power system communication in distributed power systems and one of its components-an intelligent office building (PowerFlexHouse), which is used to investigate the technical potential for active load management. It also presents in detail how to implement a thermal model predictive controller (MPC) for the heaters' power consumption prediction in the PowerFlexHouse. It demonstrates that this MPC strategy can realize load shifting, and using good predictions in MPC-based control, a better matching of demand and supply can be achieved. With this demand side control study, it is expected that MPC strategy for active load management can dramatically raise energy efficiency and improve grid reliability, when there is a high penetration of intermittent energy resources in the power system.

Abstract: Controlled charging of electric vehicles offers a potential solution to accommodating large numbers of such vehicles on existing distribution networks without the need for widespread upgrading of network infrastructure. Here, a local control technique is proposed whereby individual electric vehicle charging units attempt to maximise their own charging rate for their vehicle while maintaining local network conditions within acceptable limits. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the technique on a test distribution network. The results of the method are also compared to those from a centralized control method whereby EV charging is controlled by a central controller. The paper outlines the advantages and disadvantages of both strategies in terms of capacity utilization and total energy delivered to charging EVs.

Abstract: An algorithm for the optimal voltage regulation of distribution secondary networks with distributed generators (DGs) is proposed in the paper. Based on the epsilon decomposition of the sensitivity matrix (inverse of Jacobian) obtained from the solution of the Newton-Raphson power flow problem, a large secondary network is divided into several small subnetworks. From the epsilon decomposition, the range of influence of each DG on the voltage of the entire network is determined. When voltage at particular nodes exceeds normal operating limits, the nearest DGs can be located and commanded to control the voltage. The control action can be coordinated using communications in a small-size subnetwork. The voltage regulation is achieved by solving a small linear programming optimization problem with an objective function that makes every DG to optimize its generation. The algorithm is tested with a model of a real heavily-meshed secondary network. The results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively control the voltage in a distributed manner. It is also discussed in the paper how to choose the value of epsilon for the system decomposition.

Abstract: Developers of the smart grid have proposed a number of independent smart grid architectures. This has resulted in a lack of common vision and understanding of the common smart grid reference architecture. In particular, there is a lack of understanding of various inter-domain relationships and dependencies among technical and business domains within the smart grid. This paper presents an inter-domain analysis of these complex dependencies among the business and technical domains of the smart grid using Domain-Link Matrices. This inter-domain analysis clarifies and bridges the technical architecture to the business architecture. The aim is to maintain the rationale for the solutions developed in the technical domains in order to solve the problems of the business domains; and, as such, this analysis contributes toward further development and refinement of the smart grid reference architecture.

Abstract: The term wide area measurement system (WAMS) implies a system including new digital metering devices (e.g., phasor measurement unit) together with communication system which is designed for monitoring, operating, and controlling power systems. Generally, a WAMS process includes three main functions: data acquisition, data transmitting, and data processing performed by measurement devices, communication systems, and energy management systems, respectively. While these three functions are seriously interdependent, most researches carried out on this topic investigate these functions independently. In this paper, meters placement and their required communication infrastructure for state estimation program are co-optimized simultaneously. To perform this, these two planning issues are jointly formulated in a single genetic algorithm (GA) problem. Then, three IEEE test networks without any conventional measurements and communications are used to investigate the advantages of considering dependability of optimization of these two sections. The results confirm that the proposed method is advantageous over the techniques optimizing each section independently. The results indicate that while the total number of measurement devices for system observability may increase (and therefore, the observability is improved), the total cost for the plan is reduced.

Abstract: Light duty plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) technology holds a promising future due to its "friendliness" to the environment and potential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. However, the likely significant growth of PHEVs will bring new challenges and opportunities for power system infrastructures. This paper studies the impacts of PHEV charging patterns on power system operations and scheduling. The stochastic unit commitment model described in this paper considers coordination of thermal generating units and PHEV charging loads, as well as the penetration of large-scale wind power. The proposed model also addresses ancillary services provided by vehicle-to-grid techniques. Daily electricity demands by various types of PHEVs are estimated on the basis of a PHEV population projection and transportation survey. The stochastic unit commitment model is used to simulate power system scheduling with different charging patterns for PHEVs. The results show that a smart charging pattern can reduce the operating costs of a power system and compensate for the fluctuation in wind power. The proposed model also can serve as a foundation and tool to perform long-term cost-benefit analysis and to assist policy making.

Abstract: The data collected by smart meters contain a lot of useful information. One potential use of the data is to track the energy consumptions and operating statuses of major home appliances. The results will enable homeowners to make sound decisions on how to save energy and how to participate in demand response programs. This paper presents a new method to breakdown the total power demand measured by a smart meter to those used by individual appliances. A unique feature of the proposed method is that it utilizes diverse signatures associated with the entire operating window of an appliance for identification. As a result, appliances with complicated middle process can be tracked. A novel appliance registration device and scheme is also proposed to automate the creation of appliance signature database and to eliminate the need of massive training before identification. The software and system have been developed and deployed to real houses in order to verify the proposed method.

Abstract: Power distribution networks are changing its traditional operation paradigm, due to the introduction of the smart grid concept, which encompasses, among others, continuous demand variations, as well as continuous dispatch variations of the distributed generation units. The latter may be controllable or noncontrollable. This paradigm shift means to switch from a fixed radial operative topology network to a more dynamical configuration, which changes during the day and hour by hour. In this sense, the massive incorporation of new telecontrol and telecommunication technologies allows a dynamic operation in real-time (RT) of distribution networks. In order to achieve an optimal network operation, it is required a continuous RT monitoring, control and economic dispatch by means of a smart distribution management system (DMS). The named system must count on high performance algorithms and RT information systems. This paper presents three very efficient algorithms (in terms of speed, robustness and accuracy), which are: load estimation, ac power flow, and optimal reconfiguration for loss minimization. Furthermore, these algorithms have been tested in many real and large scale distribution networks for several utilities and have presented remarkable features for its implementation in a DMS for smart distribution grids (SDGs).

Abstract: This paper proposes and develops a new distributed slack bus (DSB) model, in the sequence-components frame, for power-flow analysis of an islanded active distribution network (ADN) dominated by electronically coupled distributed energy resource (DER) units. The power-flow analysis distributes the system slack among several participating sources since, unlike the grid-connected systems, the reference bus DER unit is anticipated to have a limited power capacity. The main application of the DSB model is for a fast power-flow analysis of an islanded ADN to enable its real-time energy management and prevent DER capacity violation in between two consecutive optimal power-flow runs. Unlike the existing DSB models, the proposed model incorporates i) the participation of DER units with different control strategies (PQ and PV) in the system real and reactive slack compensation and ii) the DER power capacity limits. Based on a new definition of the "participating sources," the power-flow equations are augmented to incorporate the system real and reactive power slack as state variables. The proposed DSB formulation is incorporated in a sequence-frame power-flow solver (SFPS). Case studies are conducted to evaluate the impacts of adopting the proposed DSB model in the SFPS tool.

Abstract: This paper investigates the operation and protection issues on distribution systems with high penetration of residential PV systems. Residential PV systems represent small scale resources and therefore they have different impacts on a distribution circuit than larger scale resources. The paper considers a typical residential distribution system and shows that determining the fault current profile and voltage variations on such systems becomes more challenging. However, the impacts on system protection and voltage variation are not severe on such systems, and thus, high level penetration can be accommodated provided that proper revisions are made to the protection and voltage control schemes.

Abstract: The paper proposes the modeling and the optimal management of a hot-temperature (sodium nickel chloride) battery system coupled with wind generators connected to a medium voltage grid. A discrete-time model of the storage device reproducing the battery main dynamics (i.e., state of charge, temperature, current, protection, and limitation systems) has been developed. The model has been validated through some experimental tests. An optimal management strategy has been implemented based on a forward dynamic programming algorithm, specifically developed to exploit the energy price arbitrage along the optimization time horizon ("generation shifting"). Taking advantage of this strategy wind generation performances can be enhanced and adapted to load demand, obtaining an increased economic gain measured by the difference between the economic revenue obtained with and without the proposed generation shifting policy.

Abstract: Monitoring systems are expected to play a major role in active distribution grids, and the design of the measurement infrastructure is a critical element for an effective operation. The use of any available and newly installed, though heterogeneous, metering device providing more accurate and real-time measurement data offers a new paradigm for the distribution grid monitoring system. In this paper the authors study the meter placement problem for the measurement infrastructure of an active distribution network, where heterogeneous measurements provided by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and other advanced measurement systems such as Smart Metering systems are used in addition to measurements that are typical of distribution networks, in particular substation measurements and a-priori knowledge. This work aims at defining a design approach for finding the optimal measurement infrastructure for an active distribution grid. The design problem is posed in terms of a stochastic optimization with the goal of bounding the overall uncertainty of the state estimation using heterogeneous measurements while minimizing the investment cost. The proposed method is also designed for computational efficiency so to cover a wide set of scenarios.

Abstract: Reconfiguration of radial distribution networks is the basis of supply restoration after faults and of load balancing and loss minimization. The ability to automatically reconfigure the network quickly and efficiently is a key feature of autonomous and self-healing networks, an important part of the future vision of smart grids.
We address the reconfiguration problem for outage recovery, where the cost of the switching actions dominates the overall cost: when the network reverts to its normal configuration relatively quickly, the electricity loss and the load imbalance in a temporary suboptimal configuration are of minor importance.
Finding optimal feeder configurations under most optimality criteria is a difficult optimization problem. All known complete optimal algorithms require an exponential time in the network size in the worst case, and cannot be guaranteed to scale up to arbitrarily large networks. Hence most works on reconfiguration use heuristic approaches that can deliver solutions but cannot guarantee optimality. These approaches include local search, such as tabu search, and evolutionary algorithms.
We propose using optimal informed search algorithms in the A* family, introduce admissible heuristics for reconfiguration, and demonstrate empirically the efficiency of our approach. Combining A* with admissible cost lower bounds guarantees that reconfiguration plans are optimal in terms of switching action costs.

Abstract: The implementation of smart grids will fundamentally change the approach of assessing and mitigating system voltage deficiencies on an electric distribution system. Many distribution companies have historically identified customer level voltage deficiencies utilizing a reactive approach that relies upon customer complaints. The monitoring capabilities of a smart grid will allow utilities to proactively identify events that exceed the voltage threshold limitations set forth by ANSI Std. C84.1 before they become a concern to end-users. This proactive approach can reduce customer complaints and possibly operational costs. This paper describes an approach for determining voltage threshold limits as a function of duration for proactive voltage investigations utilizing smart grid monitoring equipment. The described approach was applied to a smart grid located in Boulder, Colorado. This paper also describes the results of this two-year study.

Abstract: Smart and energy-efficient buildings have recently become a trend for future building industry. The major challenge in the control system design for such a building is to minimize the power consumption without compromising the customers comfort. For this purpose, a hierarchical multiagent control system with an intelligent optimizer is proposed in this study. Four types of agents, which are switch agent, central coordinator-agent, local controller-agent, and load agent, cooperate with each other to achieve the overall control goals. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized to optimize the overall system and enhance the intelligence of the integrated building and microgrid system. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) based platform is designed for customers to input their preferences and monitor the results. Two sets of case studies are carried out and corresponding simulation results are presented in this paper.

Abstract: Time of use (TOU) pricing is considered by many to be a key part of creating a more energy-efficient and renewable-energy-friendly grid. TOU pricing is also an integral part of the smart grid and is already available to customers of some electric utilities. With TOU pricing becoming a reality, intelligent dispatching systems that utilize energy storage devices (ESDs) to maximize the use of renewable resources, such as energy produced by small, customer owned wind generators and roof-top solar generators, and grid energy while determining the most economic dispatch schedule could play an important role for both the customer and the utility. The purpose of this work is to create an algorithm upon which these dispatching systems can be based. The details of one proposed algorithm are presented. Several case studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm from both a technical standpoint and an economic standpoint. The case studies show that while the algorithm developed is successful from a technical standpoint, the high cost of energy storage at this time limits its widespread deployment.

Abstract: As solar photovoltaic power generation becomes more commonplace, the inherent intermittency of the solar resource poses one of the great challenges to those who would design and implement the next generation smart grid. Specifically, grid-tied solar power generation is a distributed resource whose output can change extremely rapidly, resulting in many issues for the distribution system operator with a large quantity of installed photovoltaic devices. Battery energy storage systems are increasingly being used to help integrate solar power into the grid. These systems are capable of absorbing and delivering both real and reactive power with sub-second response times. With these capabilities, battery energy storage systems can mitigate such issues with solar power generation as ramp rate, frequency, and voltage issues. Beyond these applications focusing on system stability, energy storage control systems can also be integrated with energy markets to make the solar resource more economical. Providing a high-level introduction to this application area, this paper presents an overview of the challenges of integrating solar power to the electricity distribution system, a technical overview of battery energy storage systems, and illustrates a variety of modes of operation for battery energy storage systems in grid-tied solar applications. The real-time control modes discussed include ramp rate control, frequency droop response, power factor correction, solar time-shifting, and output leveling.

Abstract: Electric mobility is considered as a promising option for future individual transportation in terms of lower CO2-emissions and reduced dependence on fossil fuels. In order to analyze its impacts effectively, an agent based model is proposed. It integrates three domains which are mainly affected by electric mobility. Vehicle fleet evolution and vehicle energy demand simulations are combined with a transportation simulation, thus determining the daily behavior of electric vehicles and providing individual battery energy levels at the different locations of the vehicles during the day. Further, a power system model combined with a charging control algorithm is included in order to study general effects in electricity networks and to provide insights into new electric vehicle load patterns, as well as into changes in transport behavior. It is shown that network congestion can be mitigated using control signals. The paper describes the method and the integration of the three different domains and shows results of the integrated analysis tool.

Abstract: The processing and communication capabilities of the smart grid provide a solid foundation for enhancing its efficiency and reliability. These capabilities allow utility companies to adjust their offerings in a way that encourages consumers to reduce their peak hour consumption, resulting in a more efficient system. In this paper, we propose a method for scheduling a community's power consumption such that it becomes almost flat. Our methodology utilizes distributed schedulers that allocate time slots to soft loads probabilistically based on precalculated and predistributed demand forecast information. This approach requires no communication or coordination between scheduling nodes. Furthermore, the computation performed at each scheduling node is minimal. Obtaining a relatively constant consumption makes it possible to have a relatively constant billing rate and eliminates operational inefficiencies. We also analyze the fairness of our proposed approach, the effect of the possible errors in the demand forecast, and the participation incentives for consumers.

Abstract: Smart grid technologies are gaining acceptance and are being integrated into power distribution systems as a result of public and private investment and funding. However, costs of these technologies appear to be a clear obstacle in the widespread integration and maximal use of these technologies. In this paper, the utilization of dollar pricing signals is proposed and illustrated for power distribution engineering. A signal modeled after locational marginal pricing from transmission engineering is proposed to provide pricing data locally in distribution systems. The calculation, utilization, advantages, and shortcomings of the concept are presented. A main conclusion is that the use of a distribution locational marginal price signal fits well with an electronically controlled power distribution system.

Abstract: This paper presents a management system for a utility connected low-voltage microgrid composed of three nodes: a wind turbine, a battery and a variable load. These nodes are not commercial equipment but emulators. Each unit is composed of two identical voltage sources in back-to-back configuration. The microgrid is managed by a three-layered hierarchical automation system: the RMU layer, the iNode layer and the iSocket layer. The automation system permits two possible control modes: a centralized mode and a distributed mode. It has been developed an active and reactive power control that can be used for both management modes. Communications among the iNode and the iSockets are according to IEC 61850 standard. To implement IEC 61850 it has been used MMS-EASE Lite solution from SISCO, Inc. A commercial IEC 61850 SCADA has also been used.

Abstract: The grid faces a number of challenges related to large-scale integration of intermittent distributed generation (DG) such as photovoltaics (PV). Power quality challenges include voltage regulation issues, flicker, and frequency volatility. Operational challenges include the need for extension of the command-and-control infrastructure to millions of devices anticipated on the low-voltage (service) side of the distribution network. This paper presents an advanced grid-tied inverter controls concept designed to address such challenges. This controls concept is based on reproducing favorable characteristics of traditional generators that result in load-following tendencies, and is accordingly dubbed Generator Emulation Controls (GEC). Traditional generators are analyzed with specific focus on such favorable characteristics as inertial dynamics and controlled impedance. Details of GEC are then presented, and its implementation is outlined based on the evolution of conventional grid-tied inverter controls. This is followed by an examination of the system impact of GEC-operated devices. GEC allows DG inverters to perform voltage regulation support, reactive power compensation, and fault ride-through. GEC also allows DG inverters to form scalable inverter-based microgrids, capable of operating in grid-tied mode or separating and supporting an islanded load. Simulation results are presented to examine the impact on voltage regulation and power losses across a distribution feeder. Two experimental test beds are used to demonstrate voltage regulation support, transient suppression, and microgridding capabilities.

Abstract: Design and development of fault diagnosis schemes (FDS) for electric power distribution systems are major steps in realizing the self-healing function of a smart distribution grid. The application of the FDS in the electric power distribution systems is mainly aimed at precise detecting and locating of the deteriorated components, thereby enhancing the quality and reliability of the electric power delivered to the customers. The impacts of two types of the FDS on distribution system reliability are compared and presented in this paper. The first type is a representative of the FDS which diagnoses the deteriorated components after their failing. However, the second type is a representative of the FDS which can diagnose the failing components prior to a complete breakdown and while still in the incipient failure condition. To provide quantitative measures of the reliability impacts of these FDS, the comparative and sensitivity case studies are conducted on a typical Finnish urban distribution network.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance and reliability issues as encountered by the present EV technology. The research work presented in this paper is based on an ongoing project which has a twofold research motivation: 1) use of wavelet analysis to determine transients in electric vehicles; and 2) application the information obtained during transient detection to address the performance and reliability concerns. The novel wavelet based transient detection unit designed and developed as part of this project is discussed in this paper. The prototype is developed on a low-cost embedded system in order to provide an economical solution. Significance of the developed transient detection unit is also illustrated in this paper by developing applications that ensure a robust and reliable drivetrain with enhanced performance. Firstly, the information gathered from the transient detection unit is used to determine in-vehicle electrical faults. Secondly, this transient detector is used to facilitate the optimization of hybrid energy storage system (battery/ultra-capacitor combination) and to ensure smooth battery operation.

Abstract: Robust system control design and seamless transition between various modes of operation are paramount for multifunctional converters in microgrid systems. This paper proposes a control system for single-phase (1 Phi) bidirectional PWM converters for residential power level microgrid systems which is robust and can tolerate transitions between the different modes of operation. This is achieved by means of a common inner ac current-loop. Each of the operating modes has an individually designed outer loop performing the corresponding regulation tasks, most commonly including the ac voltage and the dc voltage regulation. A modified 1 Phi, phase-locked loop (PLL) system is used for system-level operation with both small steady-state error and fast response; and a novel islanding detection algorithm based on PLL stability is proposed to facilitate the transition between grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode. Finally, a frequency-response based design procedure for the proposed control system is presented in detail for all operating modes, and its performance is verified experimentally using a DSP-controlled 6 kW 120 V rms (ac)/ 300 V (dc) laboratory converter prototype.

Abstract: In this paper, the basic functions of an electric vehicle charging service provider are described with a focus on the associated optimization problems. A novel method of planning the charging of electric drive vehicles including electricity grid constraints, both voltage and power, is shown. The method establishes an individual charging plan for each vehicle and avoids distribution grid congestion while satisfying the requirements of the individual vehicle owners. The concepts proposed in this paper are tested on a simulated electricity grid. It is shown that both power and voltage constraints due to electric vehicle charging can be avoided using the proposed method.

Abstract: Energy trading in day-ahead electricity markets can be highly risky, especially for entities with considerable stochastic energy penetration. This is because of the uncertain energy prices, balancing prices, stochastic energy availability, and demand. In this work, coordinating unidirectional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services with energy trading is proposed to mitigate these trading risks. This coordination is possible due to the recent advances in smart grid technologies. The case of a load-serving entity (LSE) that owns thermal and wind plants, and is obligated to serve a load with a significant number of electric vehicles (EVs) is investigated. The problem of energy trading in coordination with V2G services is formulated as a mixed-integer stochastic linear program. The objective is to maximize the LSE's profits while maintaining its risks within acceptable levels. The conditional value at risk is used as a risk control measure. A case study that compares coordinated vs. uncoordinated EV charging is presented. The simulation results demonstrate the benefits of coordinating V2G services with other generation assets for the LSE and the EV owners as well as the impact of this coordination on the environment.

Abstract: In recent years, load management (LM) programs are introduced as an impressive option in all energy policy decisions. Under deregulation, the scope of LM programs has considerably been expanded to include demand response programs (DRPs). Basically, DRPs are divided into two main categories namely, incentive-based programs (IBPs) and time-based rate (TBR) programs. In this paper, an economic model of responsive loads is derived based upon price elasticity of demand and customers' benefit function. In order to investigate the economic-driven and environmental-driven measures of demand response programs, a new linearized formulation of cost-emission based unit commitment problem associated with DRPs (UCDR) is presented. Here, UCDR is modeled as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. The proposed model is applied to determine loads provided by DRPs and schedule commitment status of generating units. Moreover, the optimum value of incentive as a crucial issue for implementing DRPs is derived. Several analyses are conducted to investigate the impact of some important factors such as elasticity on the UCDR problem. The strategy success index (SSI) is employed to prioritize DRPs from the independent system operator (ISO) perspective. The conventional 10-unit test system is used to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: To achieve a high penetration level of intermittent renewable energy, the operation and control of power systems need to account for the associated high variability and uncertainty. Power system stability and security need to be ensured dynamically as the system operating condition continuously changes. A wide-area measurement based dynamic stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF) control algorithm using the adaptive critic designs (ACDs) is presented in this paper. The proposed DSOPF control replaces the traditional AGC and secondary voltage control, and provides a coordinated AC power flow control solution to the smart grid operation in an environment with high short-term uncertainty and variability. The ACD technique, specifically the dual heuristic dynamic programming (DHP), is used to provide nonlinear optimal control, where the control objective is explicitly formulated to incorporate power system economy, stability and security considerations. The proposed DSOPF controller dynamically drives the power system to its optimal operating point by continuously adjusting the steady-state set points sent by the traditional OPF algorithm. A 12-bus test power system is used to demonstrate the development and effectiveness of the proposed DSOPF controller.

Abstract: As electric vehicles (EVs) take a greater share in the personal automobile market, their penetration may bring higher peak demand at the distribution level. This may cause potential transformer overloads, feeder congestions, and undue circuit faults. This paper focuses on the impact of charging EVs on a residential distribution circuit. Different EV penetration levels, EV types, and charging profiles are considered. In order to minimize the impact of charging EVs on a distribution circuit, a demand response strategy is proposed in the context of a smart distribution network. In the proposed DR strategy, consumers will have their own choices to determine which load to control and when. Consumer comfort indices are introduced to measure the impact of demand response on consumers' lifestyle. The proposed indices can provide electric utilities a better estimation of the customer acceptance of a DR program, and the capability of a distribution circuit to accommodate EV penetration.

Abstract: This paper presents a fault location technique for two-terminal multisection compound transmission lines, which combine overhead lines with underground power cables, using synchronized phasor measurements acquired by global positioning system (GPS) based phasor measurement units (PMUs) or digital relays with embedded PMU or by fault-on relay data synchronization algorithms. The technique is extended from a two-terminal fault location method with synchronized phasor measurements as inputs. A novel fault section selector is proposed to select the fault line section in advance. The proposed technique has the ability to locate a fault no matter where the fault is on overhead line or underground power cable. The adopted technique has a solid theoretical foundation and is direct and simple in terms of computational complexity. Both extensive simulation results and field test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Millions of electric vehicles (EVs), especially plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs), will be integrated into the power grid in the near future. Due to their large quantity and complex charging behavior, the impact of substantial PHEVs charging on the power grid needs to be investigated. Since the charging behavior of PHEVs in a certain regional transmission network or a local distribution network is determined by different uncertain factors, their overall charging demand tends to be uncertain and in this situation probabilistic power flow (PPF) can be applied to analyze the impact of PHEVs charging on the power grid. However, currently there is no suitable model of the overall charging demand of PHEVs available for PPF calculations. In this paper, a methodology of modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs is proposed. The proposed methodology establishes a single PHEV charging demand model, and then employs queuing theory to describe the behavior of multiple PHEVs. Moreover, two applications are given, i.e., modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs at an EV charging station and in a local residential community, respectively. Comparison between PPF calculations and Monte Carlo simulation are made on a modified IEEE 30-bus system integrated with the two demand models proposed.

Abstract: The nature of transport and energy use is radically changing along with the upward trend of electric vehicles. The rapid technological development of electrical vehicles opens new opportunities from the electricity distribution point of view. Efficiency can be improved by implementing energy storages to the grid and cutting the load peaks by feeding power on peak hours from the energy storages to the grid. Electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) properties provide an opportunity to meet this challenge. In this paper, the challenge is approached from the economic perspective of an electricity distribution company. The key target of the paper is to determine whether there is economic potential for energy storages in networks in general. To this end, a generic model is introduced to analyze the feasibility of electric vehicles as energy storages in distribution networks. The methodological framework presented in the paper provides an opportunity for distribution system planners to estimate the preliminary feasibility of energy storages. The focus is on the discharging (vehicle to grid) perspective. The paper answers, for instance, the question of how to define the feasible level of energy storages (batteries) in the distribution system. In the paper, for background information, an extensive literature review is provided on electric vehicles.

Abstract: DC microgrids are gaining high momentum under the smart grid environment. DC microgrid stability can be an issue under high penetration of tightly regulated power converters used to interface distributed resources and loads. This paper addresses dc microgrid stability under high penetration of tightly regulated power electronic converters; and proposes three simple and computationally efficient active damping solutions that can be implemented to stabilize a controlled voltage-source converter (VSC) interfacing a dc- microgrid to an ac system. The proposed active damping methods depend on reshaping the VSC impedance by injecting internal-model-based active damping signal at the outer, intermediate and inner control loops of the voltage-oriented VSC interface. Small signal analysis is conducted to assess the system stability under different compensation schemes. Moreover, the reshaped source impedance of the VSC interface and the modified voltage-tracking dynamics are derived under different compensation schemes. Sensitivity and robustness analyses are provided to assess the dynamic coupling among active damping and voltage tracking controllers. Evaluation results, based on a detailed model of a dc microgrid with multiple tightly regulated converter-interfaced loads, are provided to validate the developed models and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed techniques.

Abstract: This work presents a two-stage model for the data analysis of electricity consumption. The first stage divides the consumption in two parts: weather- and illumination-related, and residual consumption, where weather-related consumption refers to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Given the hourly total consumption, we obtain the hourly weather-related and illumination-related electricity consumption, and subtract this out to get residual consumption. The second stage of the model is a flexible, agent-based analytical tool that allows disaggregation of residual consumption into a sum of consumptions by different groups of appliances. This tool can be used for a variety of applications including an optimization of demand-side management and/or a development of a set of desirable patterns for schedules of electricity-related activities in households (within an acceptable range of course) in order to minimize negative effects of high peak demand.

Abstract: This manuscript focuses on a novel actively controlled hybrid magnetic battery/ultracapacitor based energy storage system (ESS) for vehicular propulsion systems. A stand-alone battery system might not be sufficient to satisfy peak power demand and transient load variations in hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV, PHEV). Active battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be different than that of the ultracapacitor, which will result in flexibility of design as well as cost and size reduction of the battery pack. In addition, the ultracapacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power and it can be used with high C-rates. Hence, the battery is not subjected to supply peak and sharp power variations, and the stress on the battery will be reduced and the battery lifetime would be increased. Utilizing ultracapacitor results in effective capturing of the braking energy, especially in sudden braking conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for calculating frequency at an electrical load in simulations of electro-mechanical transients. The method is designed for simulation studies that require accurate models of sensors such as phasor measurement units and F-Net devices, which measure frequency at locations away from generating plants. These sensors are poised to become critical components in the control systems of electrical power grids, and therefore simulation tools that incorporate accurate models of these devices are essential. The method proposed here corrects two drawbacks of using numerically computed phase angle derivatives to approximate frequency. First, it eliminates spurious spikes in frequencies calculated at loads. Second, it eliminates instabilities induced by the simulator in studies of frequency responsive loads. The proposed method is derived from a simplified model of the generators and loads in an electrical system, but in the final analysis does not depend critically on these simplifications and is therefore applicable to more sophisticated models. The method is demonstrated with the simplified model applied to the IEEE 14 and 300 bus systems.

Abstract: Batteries and supercapacitors (SC) complement one another; a battery has a relatively high energy density but a low power density, whereas an SC has a relatively high power density but a low energy density. In order to offset their opposing limitations, an active battery/SC hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using a dc/dc converter has been proposed. The major problem concerning an active HESS is in how to control the current flow in order to achieve two objectives: the minimization of the magnitude/fluctuation of the current flowing in and out of the battery and the energy loss seen by the SCs. This problem has not been analytically investigated for an optimal solution regarding these two goals. In this paper, we present an optimal energy management scheme for active HESS. In order to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem concerning these two objectives. Observing that the feasibility and optimality of the solution critically depends on the boundary parameters of the problem, we present an algorithm that effectively adjusts the parameter values. The proposed algorithm is based on the multiplicative-increase- additive-decrease principle, which guarantees a feasible optimal solution. Through MATLAB simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can optimally minimize the magnitude/fluctuation of the battery current and the SC energy loss.

Abstract: In this paper, modeling and control system design of a three-phase VSC system are investigated. The linear model and the control design are developed in the stationary-frame. The model shows a highly coupled system along alpha and beta coordinates when using a Delta-Y transformer vs. two completely decoupled subsystems in the case of Y-Y transformer. This issue was often overlooked in literature. The developed model includes the phase shift caused by the Delta-Y transformer to address its effect on the steady-state and the dynamic behaviors under balanced and unbalanced distorted three phase conditions. Linear state-space model of the closed-loop system is developed to study the dynamics and stability of the two configurations. Modal analysis shows that the phase shift introduced by the Delta-Y configuration can reduce the ultimate gain of the open loop system by 62% as compared to the system interfaced using Y-Y configuration. The developed linear model has been simulated inMATLAB/SIMULINK and validated using a detailed switching model in PSCAD/EMTDC under balanced and unbalanced three-phase conditions. The proposed control method can provide fast active and reactive power control with a minimum harmonics distortion in the line current.

Abstract: Present-day urban vehicle usage data recorded on a per second basis over a one-year period using GPS devices installed in 76 representative vehicles in the city of Winnipeg, Canada, allow predicting the electric load profiles onto the grid as a function of time for future plug-in electric vehicles. For each parking occurrence, load profile predictions properly take into account important factors, including actual state-of-charge of the battery, parking duration, parking type, and vehicle powertrain. Thus, the deterministic simulations capture the time history of vehicle driving and parking patterns using an equivalent 10 000 urban driving and parking days for the city of Winnipeg. These deterministic results are then compared to stochastic methods that differ in their treatment of how they model vehicle driving and charging habits. The new stochastic method introduced in this study more accurately captures the relationship of vehicle departure, arrival, and travel time compared to two previously used stochastic methods. It outperforms previous stochastic methods, having the lowest error at 3.4% when compared to the deterministic method for an electric sedan with a 24-kWhr battery pack. For regions where vehicle usage data is not available to predict plug-in electric vehicle load, the proposed stochastic method is recommended. In addition, using a combination of home, work, and commercial changing locales, and Level 1 versus Level 2 charging rates, deterministic simulations for urban run-out-of-charge events vary by less than 4% for seven charging scenarios selected. Using the vehicle usage data, charging scenarios simulated have no significant effect on urban run-out-of-charge events when the battery size for the electric sedan is increased. These results contribute towards utilities achieve a more optimal cost balance between: 1) charging infrastructure; 2) power transmission upgrades; 3) vehicle battery size; and 4) the addition of new renewable generation to address new electric vehicle loads for addressing energy drivers.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G), the provision of energy and ancillary services from an electric vehicle (EV) to the grid, has the potential to offer financial benefits to EV owners and system benefits to utilities. In this work a V2G algorithm is developed to optimize energy and ancillary services scheduling. The ancillary services considered are load regulation and spinning reserves. The algorithm is developed to be used by an aggregator, which may be a utility or a third party. This algorithm maximizes profits to the aggregator while providing additional system flexibility and peak load shaving to the utility and low costs of EV charging to the customer. The formulation also takes into account unplanned EV departures during the contract periods and compensates accordingly. Simulations using a hypothetical group of 10000 commuter EVs in the ERCOT system using different battery replacement costs demonstrate these significant benefits.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to become very popular worldwide within the next few years. With possibly millions of such vehicles operating across the country, one can establish a distributed electricity storage system that comprises of the EVs' batteries with a huge total storage capacity. This can help the power grid by providing various ancillary services, once an effective vehicle- to-grid (V2G) market is established. In this paper, we propose a new game-theoretic model to understand the interactions among EVs and aggregators in a V2G market, where EVs participate in providing frequency regulation service to the grid. We develop a smart pricing policy and design a mechanism to achieve optimal frequency regulation performance in a distributed fashion. Simulation results show that our proposed pricing model and designed mechanism work well and can benefit both EVs (in terms of obtaining additional income) and the grid (in terms of achieving the frequency regulation command signal).

Abstract: The increasing use of power electronics in power systems causes a high injection of harmonic components which can in turn interfere with utility equipment and customer loads. Therefore, the correct estimation and measurement of harmonics have become an important issue. If the power frequency of the signal is steady and near the nominal value, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be used and good estimation performance is achieved. However, there are considerable power frequency variations on isolated systems such as shipboard power systems, micro-grids and smart-grids. When these variations occur there may be significant errors in the estimates using the DFT. In order to deal with this problem, this work presents a novel technique based on demodulation of the power line signal and subsequent filtering for harmonics estimation. The main features of the proposed harmonic estimation technique are: precise and accurate estimation of harmonics of off-nominal frequencies and fast estimation of harmonics (about two cycles of the fundamental component). Simulation results show that the proposed technique performs well in comparison with the DFT and can be a good candidate to replace it in cases where the power frequency is subject to considerable variations.

Abstract: Many alternative fuel vehicle technologies, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are currently being developed. Among the key reasons for their development is the increasing demand for fuel, which has resulted in increased fuel costs and brought attention to resource limitations. Fuel is also directly related to emissions and there is a conscious effort to minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. When evaluating the operational success of these technologies, it is important to consider the energy cycle of the vehicle. Source-to-wheel (STW) efficiency and emissions analysis is proposed in this paper to provide a value for comparing current and proposed vehicle technologies. The STW cycle includes the raw material production stage, transportation and storage stages of energy sources, energy transportation/storage/distribution stage, and finally the vehicle operations stage. The STW calculation is divided into two sections for ease of analysis. They are the cycle from the source of the energy to the vehicle and the cycle from when the energy is delivered to the vehicle to the work done at the wheels. They are referred to as the source-to-vehicle (STV) and vehicle-to-wheel (VTW) cycles, respectively. The impact of the vehicle manufacturing stage on this analysis will be addressed and the different approaches to integrating PHEVs into the current fleet of vehicles will also be discussed.

Abstract: DC power systems can be made more reliable by considering the load as an important energy asset. Currently the ability to manage the total system is available only through a centralized controller, which limits flexibility, reconfigurability, and reliability. These limitations can be avoided while still providing system level coordination through the use of distributed controls based on local information. All elements of the power system including source, loads, and the network itself have influence, interaction, and coupling to all other elements. Therefore, it is necessary to model and control a microgrid as a system of systems that share some common aspects, such as voltage levels, but can operate independently. Using local information in the form of the bus voltage, these techniques do not rely on a centralized controller, which improves system reliability. However, it is important to design the microgrid in such a manner as to take advantage of the energy not just from the generation sources, but also the energy stored in the individual points-of-load as well.

Abstract: This paper proposes a voltage support scheme for traction networks, which compensates for the voltage drop along the catenary line to which locomotives are connected. The proposed method is based on the injection of capacitive reactive power through the current controlled active line-side converter of locomotives. Comparing the catenary voltage with its reference value, the error is fed to a gain-scheduled PI-controller. The controller generates the q-axis reference value of the converter current, which is responsible for reactive power injection. The gain scheduling is carried out through identifying the parameters of the catenary line. The catenary parameters identification is performed by harmonic current injection and analyzing its impact on the catenary voltage. The performance of the proposed control strategy is evaluated in MATLAB/PLECS environment for a traction network consisting of one locomotive and two substations and moreover, for a two-locomotive three-substation traction network.

Abstract: It is well known that a power network can be represented as a multinode, multibranch Thevenin circuit connecting loads to generators. This paper shows that eigen-decomposition can be performed on the Thevenin impedance matrix, creating a set of decoupled single-node, single-branch equivalent circuits. The decoupled circuits can reveal important characteristics of a power system. By applying the transform to calculated or measured voltage phasor data, a technique for tracking the modes of voltage collapse and for identifying areas vulnerable to voltage collapse has been developed. Case studies conducted on multiple power systems have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition to voltage stability applications, the proposed transform presents a new approach for processing and interpreting multilocation phasor data.

Abstract: One of the most important features in the smart gird is to integrate the state-of-the-art communication technologies into power systems. In offshore wind farms, data communications would rely on wireless techniques. The wireless optical communication technology has several advantages over the RF counterpart. However, the impact of atmospheric turbulence on optical signals must be well understood first. In this paper, the performance of wireless optical links subject to weak influence is investigated. Three types of metrics (amount of fading, outage probability, and bit error rate) are analytically and numerically evaluated.

Abstract: This paper proposes a simulated annealing (SA) approach to address energy resources management from the point of view of a virtual power player (VPP) operating in a smart grid. Distributed generation, demand response, and gridable vehicles are intelligently managed on a multiperiod basis according to V2G users' profiles and requirements. Apart from using the aggregated resources, the VPP can also purchase additional energy from a set of external suppliers. The paper includes a case study for a 33 bus distribution network with 66 generators, 32 loads, and 1000 gridable vehicles. The results of the SA approach are compared with a methodology based on mixed-integer nonlinear programming. A variation of this method, using ac load flow, is also used and the results are compared with the SA solution using network simulation. The proposed SA approach proved to be able to obtain good solutions in low execution times, providing VPPs with suitable decision support for the management of a large number of distributed resources.

Abstract: With high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), stability of the electric grid becomes a challenging task. A greater penetration level would demand a proper coordination amongst the various EVs as they charge or discharge to the grid. Coordination here refers to controlling the charging and discharging patterns of different EVs depending on their individual battery states and the present grid condition. Therefore, a good coordination between EVs is required for making the grid stable. With high penetration of EVs, the vehicle to grid (V2G) concept can be explored where excess energy of the battery can be supplied back to the grid in controlled fashion. Discharging EVs' battery energy to the grid in coordination can make V2G utilization as distributed energy storage. Charging EVs in coordination can flatten the voltage profile of a distribution node. In this work, a typical distribution system of a city is modeled to demonstrate V2G capabilities such as meeting peak demand and voltage sag reduction. The simulation of the distribution system with V2G capabilities are tested using fuzzy logic controller (FLC). Two controllers have been developed, namely the charging station controller and the V2G controller. Together they decide the proper energy flow between the EVs and the grid. Energy discharge to the grid from EVs or energy required for charging EVs is controlled and tested for the real time scenario.

Abstract: Due to the characteristics of electric power generation, transmission and distribution in the U. S., experts have identified local distribution as a likely part of the chain to be adversely affected by unregulated PEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) charging. This paper presents a study performed to assess the impact of PEV charging on a local residential distribution transformer.
Due to the fact that transformer insulation life is mostly affected by the hot-spot temperature, a dynamic thermal model was used for prediction of the transformer hot-spot temperature with the information on power load and ambient temperature, thus the aging of insulation can be predicted. Then, with the results from a Monte Carlo-based mass simulation model for PEV energy consumption, different charging scenarios were conducted to study the impact of PEV charging on transformer insulation life.

Abstract: Current policies in the U.S. and other countries are trying to stimulate electric transportation deployment. Consequently, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) adoption will presumably spread among vehicle users. With the increased diffusion of PEVs, lithium-ion batteries will also enter the market on a broad scale. However, their costs are still high and ways are needed to optimally deploy vehicle batteries in order to account for the higher initial outlay. This study analyzed the possibility of extending the lifecycle of PEV batteries to a secondary, stationary application. Battery usage can be optimized by installing used battery packs in buildings' microgrids. Employed as decentralized storage, batteries can be used for a microgrid's power supply and provide ancillary services (A/S). This scenario has been modeled with the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM), which identifies optimal equipment combinations to meet microgrid requirements at minimum cost, carbon footprint, or other criteria. Results show that used PEV batteries can create significant monetary value if subsequently used for stationary applications.

Abstract: Rapid increase in electric power demand, introduction of RPS mandates, and a push towards electrification in the transportation sector is expected to increase power system stresses and disturbances. To tackle these power system issues and maintain high system reliability, it is essential to have information about the condition of assets present on the grid. Presently, due to the absence of low cost flexible grid wide monitoring solutions, complete information of the system is not achievable. This paper deals with the development of a new class of sensors called the smart "stick-on" sensors. These are low cost, self-powered, universal sensors that provide a flexible monitoring solution for grid assets. These sensors can be mass deployed due to low cost, need low maintenance as they are self-powered, and can be used for monitoring a variety of grid assets. This paper also presents the details on the network architecture, interoperability and integration, and different design aspects of the stick-on sensor, such as novel energy harvesting techniques, power management, wide operating range, and reliability. It is envisioned that the smart stick-on sensors shall be an enabling technology for monitoring a variety of grid assets and prove to be an essential element of the Smart Grid.

Abstract: Observability of bulk power transmission network by means of minimum number of phasor measurement units (PMUs), with the aid of the network topology, is a great challenge. This paper presents a novel equivalent integer linear programming method (EILPM) for the exhaustive search-based PMU placement. The state estimation implemented based on such a placement is completely linear, thereby eliminating drawbacks of the conventional SCADA-based state estimation. Additional constraints for observability preservation following single PMU or line outages can easily be implemented in the proposed EILPM. Furthermore, the limitation of communication channels is dealt with by translation of nonlinear terms into linear ones. Optimal PMU placement is carried out on the IEEE 118-bus test system in different scenarios. The comparison between obtained results of EILPM and those of other methods reveals optimality of the solutions. Moreover, the proposed method is successfully applied on the Iranian National Grid, which demonstrates it can effectively be employed for practical power networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a spatial and temporal model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station located near a highway exit. Most previous studies have assumed a fixed charging location and fixed charging time during the off-peak hours for anticipating electric vehicle charging demand. Some other studies have based on limited charging scenarios at typical locations instead of a mathematical model. Therefore, from a distribution system perspective, electric vehicle charging demand is still unidentified quantity which may vary by space and time. In this context, this study proposes a mathematical model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station. The mathematical model is based on the fluid dynamic traffic model and the M/M/s queueing theory. Firstly, the arrival rate of discharged vehicles at a charging station is predicted by the fluid dynamic model. Then, charging demand is forecasted by the M/M/s queueing theory with the arrival rate of discharged vehicles. This mathematical model of charging demand may allow grid's distribution planners to anticipate a charging demand profile at a charging station. A numerical example shows that the proposed model is able to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of charging demand in a highway charging station.

Abstract: Smart grid provides the technology for modernizing electricity delivery systems by using distributed and computer-based remote sensing, control and automation, and two-way communications. Potential benefits of the technology are that the smart grid's central control will now be able to control and operate many remote power plant, optimize the overall asset utilization and operational efficiently. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for the smart grid to handle uncertainties arising from condition monitoring and maintenance of power plant. The approach uses an adaptive maintenance advisor and a system-maintenance optimizer for designing/implementing optimized condition-based maintenance activities, and collectively handles operational variations occurring in each substation. The system-maintenance optimizer generates the initial maintenance plans for each substation with multiobjective optimization by considering only the design or average operational conditions. During operation, the substation will experience aging, control shifts, changing weather and load factors, and uncertain measurements. Residing on each host substation, the maintenance advisor will assess the adequacy of initial maintenance plans; and estimate the reliability changes caused by operational variations on the substation using a hierarchical fuzzy system. The advisor will also alert the maintenance optimizer on whether a reoptimization of its maintenance activities should be initiated for meeting the overall grid-reliability requirement. Three scenarios will be studied in this paper, which will demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach for handling operational variations occurring in an offshore substation with manageable computational complexity.

Abstract: In all areas of engineering, modelers are constantly pushing for more accurate models and their goal is generally achieved with increasingly complex, data-mining-based black-box models. On the other hand, model users which include policy makers and systems operators tend to favor transparent, interpretable models not only for predictive decision-making but also for after-the-fact auditing and forensic purposes. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off between the accuracy and the transparency of data-mining-based models in the context of catastrophe predictors for power grid response-based remedial action schemes, at both the protective and operator levels. Wide area severity indices (WASI) are derived from PMU measurements and fed to the corresponding predictors based on data-mining models such as decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), neural networks (NNET), support vector machines (SVM), and fuzzy rule based models (Fuzzy_DT and Fuzzy_ID3). It is observed that while switching from black-box solutions such as NNET, SVM, and RF to transparent fuzzy rule-based predictors, the accuracy deteriorates sharply while transparency and interpretability are improved. Although transparent automation schemes are historically preferred in power system control and operations, we show that, with existing modeling tools, this philosophy fails to achieve the "3-nines" accuracy figures expected from a modern power grid. The transparency and accuracy trade-offs between the developed catastrophe predictors is demonstrated thoroughly on a data base with more than 60 000 instances from a test (10%) and an actual (90%) system combined.

vehicle-to-grid (v2g)
Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has the potential of reducing the cost of owning and operating electric vehicles (EVs) while increasing utility system flexibility. Unidirectional V2G is a logical first step because it can be implemented on standard J1772 chargers and it does not degrade EV batteries from cycling. In this work an optimal combined bidding formulation for regulation and spinning reserves is developed to be used by aggregators. This formulation takes into account unplanned departures by EV owners during contract periods and compensates accordingly. Optional load level and price constraints are also developed. These algorithms maximize profits to the aggregator while increasing the benefits the customers and utility. Simulations over a three month period on the ERCOT system show that implementation of these algorithms can provide significant benefits to customers, utilities, and aggregators. Comparisons with bidirectional V2G show that while the benefits of unidirectional V2G are significantly lower, so are the risks.

Abstract: The ability of smart meters to control domestic demand during system emergencies was investigated. Direct load control through the smart meters is unlikely to be able to provide primary frequency response because of communication delays. An alternative load control scheme that used a local frequency measurement from the smart meters was investigated. An experimental rig was developed, using commercially available components, to test and demonstrate the load control scheme. The amount of load to be controlled to limit the frequency drop of the Great Britain system to a set of minimum allowable frequencies was found using a simulation program. Operating speeds and the limitations of the components of the load controller in providing primary response are discussed. It is shown that if smart meters are to play any role in primary response then the speed at which the system frequency is measured must be increased very considerably (from around 3 s to 200 ms). This has important implications as the U.K. is now finalizing the specification for more than 20 million smart electricity meters that will be installed by 2020.

Abstract: Large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) is anticipated in the foreseeable future. Heavy intermittent charging load of EVs will create bottlenecks in supplying capacity and expose power system to severe security risks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method to control EV charging loads in response to time-of-use (TOU) price in a regulated market. First, an optimized charging model is formulated to minimize the charging cost. Then, a heuristic method is implemented to minimize the charging cost considering the relation between the acceptable charging power of EV battery and the state of charge (SOC). Finally, the charging cost and energy demand in different time intervals are compared for both typical charging pattern and optimized charging pattern. Results show that the optimized charging pattern has great benefit in reducing cost and flatting the load curve if the peak and valley time periods are partitioned appropriately.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method based on the cost-benefit analysis for optimal sizing of an energy storage system in a microgrid (MG). The unit commitment problem with spinning reserve for MG is considered in this method. Time series and feed-forward neural network techniques are used for forecasting the wind speed and solar radiations respectively and the forecasting errors are also considered in this paper. Two mathematical models have been built for both the islanded and grid-connected modes of MGs. The main problem is formulated as a mixed linear integer problem (MLIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming). The effectiveness of the approach is validated by case studies where the optimal system energy storage ratings for the islanded and grid-connected MGs are determined. Quantitative results show that the optimal size of BESS exists and differs for both the grid-connected and islanded MGs in this paper.

Abstract: Electricity cost is becoming a major portion of Internet data center (IDC)'s operation cost and large-scale IDCs are becoming important consumers of regional electricity markets. IDC's energy efficiency is gaining more attention by data center operators and electricity market operators. Effective IDC electric demand management solutions are eagerly sought by all stakeholders. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model based IDC electric demand management solution is proposed, which integrates both the impacts of locational marginal electricity prices and power management capability of IDC itself. Dynamic voltage/frequency scaling of individual server, cluster server ON/OFF scheduling, and dynamic workload dispatching are optimized while complying with all the IDC system-wide and individual heterogeneous servers' operation constraints according to the IDC applications' temporal variant workload. Reduced electricity cost can be achieved together with guaranteed QoS requirement and reliability consideration by using the proposed model. World Cup '98 data is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. According to the experimental evaluation, electricity cost could be cut by more than 20% in a peak workload period and by more than 80% in a light workload period. Besides, more than 6% electricity cost could be cut by considering the impact of electricity price difference. Experimental results also reveal that higher QoS requirement and reliability consideration could result in higher electricity cost.

Abstract: Using data from high-resolution wide-area GPS-synchronized measurements to detect and analyze disturbances within a synchronous electrical interconnection is not trivial. Deterministic methods often fall prey to the non-stationary noisy nature of this type of data. This paper dwells on the location of noteworthy events within "blue-sky" ambient data taken from particularly noisy environments. The statistical processing used to detect and analyze power system events is congealed into a concise and tunable algorithm that is applicable to a multitude of data types. The data analyzed herein is drawn from FNET, a wide-area measurement system deployed worldwide at standard end-user distribution voltages.

Abstract: The paper presents a study of the profile of the load imposed on a power system by grid-charging of the onboard battery pack of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The study uses a large database of field-recorded driving cycles stamped with parking times and locations to predict realistic driving habits of drivers in an urban setting. A fuzzy-logic inference system is designed to emulate the decision-making process of a driver when deciding to charge the vehicle's battery. The charging load is then estimated on an hourly basis for a number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles with different storage capacities. Level-1 and level-2 charging regimes as well as two scenarios for charging, namely charging at home and charging at home and work, are considered. The load profile is presented as an hourly probability of charging for each vehicle type. The results demonstrate how penetration of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles affects the load on a utility network.

Abstract: This paper proposes an operating framework for aggregators of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). First, a minimum-cost load scheduling algorithm is designed, which determines the purchase of energy in the day-aheadmarket based on the forecast electricity price and PEV power demands. The same algorithm is applicable for negotiating bilateral contracts. Second, a dynamic dispatch algorithm is developed, used for distributing the purchased energy to PEVs on the operating day. Simulation results are used to evaluate the proposed algorithms, and to demonstrate the potential impact of an aggregated PEV fleet on the power system.

Abstract: As a key component of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charger system, the front-end ac-dc converter must achieve high efficiency and power density. This paper presents a topology survey evaluating topologies for use in front end ac-dc converters for PHEV battery chargers. The topology survey is focused on several boost power factor corrected converters, which offer high efficiency, high power factor, high density, and low cost. Experimental results are presented and interpreted for five prototype converters, converting universal ac input voltage to 400 V dc. The results demonstrate that the phase shifted semi-bridgeless PFC boost converter is ideally suited for automotive level I residential charging applications in North America, where the typical supply is limited to 120 V and 1.44 kVA or 1.92 kVA. For automotive level II residential charging applications in North America and Europe the bridgeless interleaved PFC boost converter is an ideal topology candidate for typical supplies of 240 V, with power levels of 3.3 kW, 5 kW, and 6.6 kW.

Abstract: Smart grid initiative is based on several pillars among which integrating a wide variety of distributed generation (DG) is of particular importance. The connection of a large number of DG units among loads may result in a severe voltage regulation problem and the utility-side voltage regulators might no longer be able to use conventional control techniques. In addition, smart grid should provide new digital technologies such as monitoring, automatic control, and two way communication facilities to improve the overall performance of the network. These technologies have been applied in this paper to construct a distributed control that has the capability to provide proper voltage regulation in smart distribution feeders. The functions of each controller have been defined according to the concept of intelligent agents and the characteristics of the individual DG unit as well as utility regulators. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control structure, a real time simulation model has been proposed. The simulation results show that distributed control structure has the capability to mitigate the interference between DG facilities and utility voltage regulators.

Abstract: Researchers have proposed that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) performing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) ancillary services can accrue significant economic benefits without degrading vehicle performance. However, analyses to date have not evaluated the effect that automatic generator control signal energy content and call rate has on V2G ancillary service reliability and value. This research incorporates a new level of detail into the modeling of V2G ancillary services by incorporating probabilistic vehicle travel models, time-series automatic generation control signals, and time series ancillary services pricing into a non-linear dynamic simulation of the driving and charging behavior of PHEVs. Stochastic results are generated using Monte-Carlo methods. Results show that in order to integrate a V2G system into the existing market and power grid the V2G system will require: 1) an aggregative architecture to meet current industry standard reliability requirements; 2) the construction of low energy automatic generation control signals; 3) a lower percent call for V2G even if the pool of contracted ancillary service resources gets smaller; 4) a consideration of vehicle performance degradation due to the potential loss of electrically driven miles; and 5) a high-power home charging capability.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of electricity cost management for Internet service providers with a collection of spatially distributed data centers. As the demand on Internet services drastically increases in recent years, the electricity consumed by Internet data centers (IDCs) has been skyrocketing. While most existing research focuses on reducing electric energy consumption of IDCs at one specific location, the problem of reducing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the present multi-electricity-market environment, where the price of electricity may exhibit temporal and spatial diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing the quality of service (i.e., service level objectives) such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of critical importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost under multiple electricity markets environment while guaranteeing the quality of service geared to the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price. The problem is modeled as a constrained mixed-integer programming and an efficient solution algorithm is proposed. Extensive evaluations based on real-world electricity price data for multiple IDC locations illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Exchange of event information among multiple interconnected power system operators has become imperative for integrated and secure operation of the system. Considerable literature is reported on the standardization of power system data, while limited work has been done on the standardization of events. In this paper, we define a high level event ontology for power systems comprising seven concepts, namely, event, event extractor, event consumer, time, measurement, location, and level. These concepts are then developed with details extracted from the operating procedures followed by national and regional load dispatch centers in the Indian national grid. The methodology adopted for designing concrete sub-ontologies from the high level event ontology is also reported. The proposed event ontology has wide applications in the areas of i) event driven architecture (EDA) which facilitates the integration of event driven applications within and across the utilities, and ii) complex event processing (CEP) which facilitates development of sense-and-respond software capable of processing events extracted from large volumes of real-time data streams.

Abstract: Over the past decade key technologies have progressed so that mass-market viable plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are now set to reach the first of many major vehicle markets by 2011. PEV-grid interactions comprise a mix of industries that have not interacted closely in the past. A number of these commercial participants have utilized the same basic business model for nearly a century. The various participants include vehicle manufacturers, utilities, and supplier firms who have radically different business models, regulatory and legal environments, geographical scope, and technical capabilities. This paper will provide a survey of PEV technology trends and other factors. From an analysis of these factors this paper synthesizes and provides a likely scenario for PEV-grid interaction over the next decade.

Abstract: This paper develops a modeling and control paradigm for the aggregate charging dynamics of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The central goal of the paper is to derive a control policy that can adapt the aggregate charging power of PEVs to highly intermittent renewable power. The key assumption here is that the grid is able to directly control the charging power of PEVs in real-time, through broadcasting a universal control signal. Using the transport-based load modeling principle, we develop a partial differential equation model for the collective charging of PEVs. We use real driving data to simulate the model and validate it against a PEV Monte Carlo simulation model. Adopting the sliding mode control theory, we then develop a robust output tracking controller for the system. The controller uses the real-time error between power supply and demand as the only measured signal, and attempts to suppress it despite the variation of the population of PEVs on the grid. We examine the performance of the controller using numerical simulations on a real wind power trajectory.

Abstract: Numerous recent studies have assessed the feasibility of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode of discharging, which provides an option to use the energy stored in a battery in electric vehicles to support the power grid. This paper aims at demonstrating the potential benefits of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as dynamically configurable dispersed energy storage acting in a vehicle-to-building (V2B) operating mode. V2B is a concept that is practically viable today being far simpler than V2G, and it may be implemented on a 3-5 year time horizon while V2G may take 10-15 years to gain wider acceptance. Based on the battery characteristics, the benefits of using BEVs/PHEVs as energy storage for demand side management (DSM) and outage management (OM) are discussed in detail. This paper is also focused on the implementation issues of DSM and OM in the smart distribution grid. A strategy for adopting BEVs/PHEV uses in the V2B mode under the peak load and during outage condition is proposed and demonstrated with test cases and numerical results.

Abstract: The anticipation of a large penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the market brings up many technical problems that need to be addressed. In the near future, a large number of PHEVs in our society will add a large-scale energy load to our power grids, as well as add substantial energy resources that can be utilized. An emerging issue is that a large number of PHEVs simultaneously connected to the grid may pose a huge threat to the overall power system quality and stability. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station. The authors used the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to intelligently allocate electrical energy to the PHEVs connected to the grid. A mathematical framework for the objective function (i.e., maximizing the average state-of-charge at the next time step) is also given. The authors considered real-world constraints such as energy price, remaining battery capacity, and remaining charging time. The authors also simulated the real-world parking deck scenarios according to the statistical analysis based on the transportation data. The authors characterized the performance of EDA using a Matlab simulation, and compared it with other optimization techniques.

Abstract: To integrate large scale renewable energy sources in the power grid, the battery energy storage performs an important role for smoothing their natural intermittency and ensuring grid-wide frequency stability. Electric vehicles have not only large introduction potential but also much available time for control because they are almost plugged in the home outlets as distributed battery energy storages. Therefore, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is expected to be one of the key technologies in smart grid strategies. This paper proposes an autonomous distributed V2G control scheme. A grid-connected electric vehicle supplies a distributed spinning reserve according to the frequency deviation at the plug-in terminal, which is a signal of supply and demand imbalance in the power grid. As a style of EV utilization, it is assumed that vehicle use set next plug-out timing in advance. In such assumption, user convenience is satisfied by performing a scheduled charging for the plug-out, and plug-in idle time is available for the V2G control. Therefore a smart charging control is considered in the proposed scheme. Satisfaction of vehicle user convenience and effect to the load frequency control is evaluated through a simulation by using a typical two area interconnected power grid model and an automotive lithium-ion battery model.

Abstract: Efficient resource allocation is an important problem that aims for a "greener" and more environmentally friendly electric power grid. The smart behavior of the newly emerged grid, combined with two-way communication between users and the operator allows for actions like measurement, monitoring, prediction, and control signaling so as to maximize social welfare. We introduce a framework for optimal resource allocation in smart grids that also considers the uncertainty in message signaling. This introduces communication network externalities, added on top of the existing transmission network ones. The task at hand resembles the so called local public goods problem in mathematical economics terminology, a problem impractical to solve using centralized mechanisms. We propose an iterative, decentralized algorithm for its solution. The algorithm is scalable for deployment in large networks since it requires only messages per network user per iteration, where is the number of users. Moreover, it is guaranteed to converge, does not require revelation of private information from each user and all algorithm actions can be realized by programmable smart devices of the grid.

Abstract: This paper presents the modeling, design, and novel control strategy development for a hybrid switched-capacitor bidirectional dc/dc converter, applicable for a hybrid electric vehicle energy storage system. The proposed control strategy is based on the power profile of the traction motor and the gradient of battery current. Features of voltage step-down, voltage step-up, and bidirectional power flow are integrated into a single circuit, and are verified on an experimental prototype. The developed control strategy enables simpler dynamics, compared to a standard buck converter with input filter, good regulation capability, low EMI, lower source current ripple, ease of control, and continuous input current waveform in both buck and boost modes of operation.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries exhibit high levels of energy and power density among electrochemical batteries. These attributes make them suitable as the energy storage system in electric, hybrid electric vehicle, and plug-in vehicles (EV/HEV/PHEV). One of the important requirements in automotive batteries is to monitor their real time state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH). Open circuit voltage, as one parameter used for predicting the SOC in the battery, is not readily available during charge and discharge cycles. In this paper a new method for prediction of the terminal voltage in li-ion batteries based on the impulse response concept has been proposed. By obtaining the impulse response of the li-ion battery, one can use the terminal current to predict the output voltage of the battery. Online comparison of the predicted and measured terminal voltage provides a tool for online monitoring of the SOH and SOC.

Abstract: This paper considers the interconnections between the new European 2 x 25 kV-50 Hz high speed/high capacity (HS/HC) railway lines and the existing railways in various countries. The paper is focused on the interconnection between the two different supply systems employed in the Italian railway lines: 25 kV ac and 3 kV dc. The interconnection point was simulated by modeling all appliances in the border region and considering both the ac and dc sides. The goal of this analysis is the evaluation of the interferences between the two systems and of the effectiveness of the measures adopted to mitigate their effects.

Abstract: Most of energy control or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are very dependent on advanced technologies and on traditional security mechanisms for protecting the a system against anomalous events. Security mechanisms are not enough to be used in critical systems, since they can only detect anomalous events occurring at a certain moment in time. For this reason it becomes of paramount importance the usage of intelligent systems with capability for preventing anomalous situations and reacting against them on time. This type of systems are, for example, early warning systems (EWS). In this paper, we propose an EWS based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) (under the ISA100.11a standard) and reputation for controling network behavior. The WSN are organized into clusters where a cluster head (CH) is designated. This CH will contain a Reputation Manager Module. The usability of this approach is also analyzed considering a smart grid scenario.

Abstract: Energy infrastructure is a critical underpinning of modern society that any compromise or sabotage of its secure and reliable operation has an enormous impact on people's daily lives and the national economy. The massive northeastern power blackout of August 2003 and the most recent Florida blackout have both revealed serious defects in both system-level management and device-level designs of the power grid in handling attacks. At the system level, the control area operators lack the capability to 1) obtain real-time status information of the vastly distributed equipment; 2) respond rapidly enough once events start to unravel; and 3) perform coordinated actions autonomously across the region. At the device level, the traditional hardware lacks the capability to 1) provide reliable frequency and voltage control according to system demands and 2) rapidly reconfigure the system to a secure state through switches and power-electronics based devices. These blackouts were a wake-up call for both the industry and academia to consider new techniques and system architecture design that can help assure the security and reliability of the power grid. In this paper, we present a hardware-in-the-loop reconfigurable system design with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination schemes at both local and system levels that would tackle the vulnerabilities of the grid. The new system design consists of five key components: 1) a location-centric hybrid system architecture that facilitates not only distributed processing but also coordination among geographically close devices; 2) the insertion of intelligence into power electronic devices at the lower level of the power grid to enable a more direct reconfiguration of the physical makeup of the grid; 3) the development of a robust collaboration algorithm among neighboring devices to handle possible faulty, missing, or incomplete information; 4) the design of distributed algorithms to better understand the local state of the power grid; and 5) the adoption of a control-theoretic real-time adaptation strategy to guarantee the availability of large distributed systems. Preliminary evaluation results showing the advantages of each component are provided. A phased implementation plan is also suggested at the end of the discussion.

Abstract: In this paper a novel coordinated voltage control scheme is proposed to enable voltage regulator to efficiently regulate the voltage of multiple feeders in the presence of DGs. The proposed technique is based on placing a remote terminal unit (RTUs) at each DG and each line capacitor. These RTUs coordinate together, through communication, and form a multi-agent system. Detailed analysis is given for the estimation of the voltage profile based on the RTUs readings. The conditions under which the usage of one voltage regulator for the regulation of multiple-feeders fails are presented along with proposed solutions for such situation. Simulation results show that this technique enable a considerable increase in the allowed DG injected power to the system.

Abstract: Smart grid (SG) communication has recently received significant attentions to facilitate intelligent and distributed electric power transmission systems. However, communication trust and security issues still present practical concerns to the deployment of SG. In this paper, to cope with these challenging concerns, we propose a lightweight message authentication scheme features as a basic yet crucial component for secure SG communication framework. Specifically, in the proposed scheme, the smart meters which are distributed at different hierarchical networks of the SG can first achieve mutual authentication and establish the shared session key with Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol. Then, with the shared session key between smart meters and hash-based authentication code technique, the subsequent messages can be authenticated in a lightweight way. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can satisfy the desirable security requirements of SG communications. In addition, extensive simulations have also been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of low latency and few signal message exchanges.

Abstract: We study the economic impact of a potential class of integrity cyber attacks, named false data injection attacks, on electric power market operations. In particular, we show that with the knowledge of the transmission system topology, attackers may circumvent the bad data detection algorithms equipped in today's state estimator. This, in turn, may be leveraged by attackers for consistent financial arbitrage such as virtual bidding at selected pairs of nodes. This paper is a first attempt to formalize the economic impact of malicious data attacks on real-time market operations. We show how an attack could systematically construct a profitable attacking strategy, in the meantime being undetected by the system operator. Such a result is also valuable for the system operators to examine the potential economic loss due to such cyber attack. The potential impact of the false data injection attacks is illustrated on real-time market operations of the IEEE 14-bus system.

Abstract: The use of synchrophasor data for observation and control is expected to enhance the operation and efficiency of the next generation of power systems. However, the specific characteristics of the data generated by synchrophasors makes them particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks. This paper presents a set of strategies to protect the anonymity of synchrophasor data against passive traffic analysis attacks. Considering the periodic nature of synchrophasor data, we propose defense mechanisms based on packet concatenation and random packet drops as a countermeasure against attacks that may use the timing as well as data volume information to compromise the network. In contrast to existing defenses against traffic analysis attacks, our scheme can be easily deployed using the current networking infrastructure as it is based on end-to-end principles and does not require any specialized routers. The proposed defense mechanisms are evaluated using both analysis and simulations.

Abstract: The smart grid moves new power grid automation systems from being proprietary and closed to the current state of information technology (IT) which is highly interconnected and open. But open and interconnected automation platforms bring about major security challenges. The power grid automation network has inherent security risks due to the fact that the systems and applications for the power grid were originally designed without much consideration of cybersecurity. This paper first introduces scope and functionalities of power grid, its automation and control system, and communications. Potential cyberattacks and their adverse impacts on power grid operation are discussed, a general SCADA cyberattack process is presented. This paper discusses the major challenges and strategies to protect smart grid against cyberattacks and finally proposes a conceptual layered framework for protecting power grid automation systems against cyberattacks without compromising timely availability of control and signal data. The proposed "bump-in-the-wire" approach also provides security protection for legacy systems which do not have enough computational power or memory space to perform security functionalities. The on-site system test of the developed prototype security system is briefly presented as well.

Abstract: In the efforts to modernize the electrical power grid, data communication over existing power lines is emerging as an important new application. This paper introduces an S-parameters model for a 3-phase transmission line. Such a model does not exist in the literature at present. The model reduces to that of a conventional 2-port network if only one phase is used for data communication. Testing of a 115 kV, 100 km-long transmission line have confirmed the theory. Furthermore, the bit error rate was found to be suitable for data communications under normal circumstances, except in the presence of adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g., lightning).

Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the novel idea of applying the next generation wireless technology, cognitive radio network, for the smart grid. In particular, system architecture, algorithms, and hardware testbed are studied. A microgrid testbed supporting both power flow and information flow is also proposed. Control strategies and security considerations are discussed. Furthermore, the concept of independent component analysis (ICA) in combination with the robust principal component analysis (PCA) technique is employed to recover data from the simultaneous smart meter wireless transmissions in the presence of strong wideband interference. The performance illustrates the gain of bringing the state of the art mathematics to smart grid.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of Petri nets for modeling coordinated cyber-physical attacks on the smart grid. Petri nets offer more flexibility and expressiveness than traditional attack trees to represent the actions of simultaneous attackers. However, Petri net models for attacks on very large critical infrastructures such as the smart grid require a great amount of manual effort and detailed expertise in cyber-physical threats. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel hierarchical method to construct large Petri nets from a number of smaller Petri nets that can be created separately by different domain experts. The construction method is facilitated by a model description language that enables identical places in different Petri nets to be matched. The new modeling approach is described for an example attack on smart meters, and its efficacy is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept Python program.

Abstract: As electric vehicles (EVs) take a greater share in the personal automobile market, their penetration will cause overload conditions at the distribution transformer. This paper focuses on the impacts of charging EVs on residential distribution networks including the transformer. The cost to accommodate a large-scale EV penetration by upgrading distribution transformers can be prohibitive. To alleviate the potential new load peaks with minimal infrastructure investments, a demand response strategy is proposed as a load shaping tool that allows improvement in distribution transformer usage. With the proposed strategy, consumers' preferences, load priorities, and privacy can be taken into account.

Abstract: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems control and monitor industrial and critical infrastructure functions, such as electricity, gas, water, waste, railway, and traffic. Recent attacks on SCADA systems highlight the need of stronger SCADA security. It is important to analyze the security risks and develop appropriate security solutions to protect such systems. However, a key problem is the lack of proper modeling tools to evaluate the security of SCADA systems. As widely accepted in academic and industrial communities, it is impractical to conduct security experiments on live systems. A modeling simulation tool would enable the simulation of SCADA systems with the benefit of testing different attack and security solutions. This paper proposes a simulation tool for building SCADA simulations that supports the integration of external devices and applications. A key benefit of this tool is the ability to test the effect of attacks on real devices and applications, even though using a simulated environment. The paper further describes two case studies that demonstrate how the tool can be efficiently used to create SCADA simulations and perform malicious attacks.

Abstract: Malicious attacks against power systems are investigated, in which an adversary controls a set of meters and is able to alter the measurements from those meters. Two regimes of attacks are considered. The strong attack regime is where the adversary attacks a sufficient number of meters so that the network state becomes unobservable by the control center. For attacks in this regime, the smallest set of attacked meters capable of causing network unobservability is characterized using a graph theoretic approach. By casting the problem as one of minimizing a super-modular graph functional, the problem of identifying the smallest set of vulnerable meters is shown to have polynomial complexity. For the weak attack regime where the adversary controls only a small number of meters, the problem is examined from a decision theoretic perspective for both the control center and the adversary. For the control center, a generalized likelihood ratio detector is proposed that incorporates historical data. For the adversary, the trade-off between maximizing estimation error at the control center and minimizing detection probability of the launched attack is examined. An optimal attack based on minimum energy leakage is proposed.

Abstract: Cybersecurity of the substations in a power system is a major issue as the substations become increasingly dependent on computer and communication networks. This paper is concerned with anomaly detection in the computer network environment of a substation. An anomaly inference algorithm is proposed for early detection of cyber-intrusions at the substations. The potential scenario of simultaneous intrusions launched over multiple substations is considered. The proposed detection method considers temporal anomalies. Potential intrusion events are ranked based on the credibility impact on the power system. Snapshots of anomaly entities at substations are described. Simulation results using the modified IEEE 118-bus system have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method for systematic identification. The result of this research is a tool to detect cyber-intrusions that are likely to cause significant damages to the power grid.

Abstract: The advent of the smart grid promises to usher in an era that will bring intelligence, efficiency, and optimality to the power grid. Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards. Each of these will expose the power grid to cybersecurity threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for supporting the optimal communication routing and improving system security through the identification of malicious network traffic.

Abstract: The smart grid's heavy reliance on cyber resources introduces numerous security concerns. The substantial attack surface presented by the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) along with the dissemination of sensitive data including privacy, billing, and control information will provide attackers with significant economic incentive. In addition, the scale and complexity of the architecture will stress the capabilities of many security controls such as public key encryption (PKI), authentication, and access control. The aforementioned concerns produce a requirement for increased risk management including security models that have the capability to scale to such a complex environment. A security model is introduced to represent various privilege states in a large architecture and evaluates viable paths that an attacker could exploit. The resulting model is used to produce a quantitative information-based exposure metric to evaluate the completeness of implemented security mechanisms. Various applications are proposed to show how the metric can enhance current risk management processes by identifying information dependencies of the deployed security mechanisms. Finally, the applicability of the proposed methodologies has been evaluated through a simulation study using realistic AMI infrastructure to demonstrate the utility of the proposed metric.

Abstract: The data collected by a home smart meter can potentially reveal sensitive private information about the home resident(s). In this paper, we study how home energy resources can be used to protect the privacy of the collected data. In particular we: a) introduce a power mixing algorithm to selectively protect a set of consumption events; b) develop a range of different privacy protection metrics; c) analyze real smart metering data sampled twice a minute over a period of 13 days; and d) evaluate the protection offered by different power mixing algorithms. Major factors which determine the efficiency of the proposed power mixing algorithms are identified, such as battery capacity and power, and user preferences for privacy-based allocations of battery energy quotas.

Abstract: Multicast has been envisioned to be useful in many smart grid applications such as demand-response, wide area protection, in-substation protection and various operation and control. Since the multicast messages are related to critical control, authentication is necessary to prevent message forgery attacks. In this paper, we first identify the requirements of multicast communication and multicast authentication in the smart grid. Based on these requirements, we find that one-time signature based multicast authentication is a promising solution, due to its short authentication delay and low computation cost. However, existing one-time signatures are not designed for the smart grid and they may have high storage and bandwidth overhead. To address this problem, we propose a new one-time signature scheme which can reduce the storage cost by a factor of 8 and reduce the signature size by 40% compared with existing schemes. Thus, our scheme is more appropriate for smart grid applications where the receivers have limited storage (e. g., home appliances and field devices) or where data communication is frequent and short (e. g., phasor data). These gains are at the cost of increased computations in signature generation and/or verification and fortunately our scheme can flexibly allocate the computations between the sender and receiver based on their computing resources. We formulate the computation allocation as a nonlinear integer programming problem to minimize the signing cost under a certain verification cost and propose a heuristic solution to solve it.

Abstract: With the development of power system deregulation and smart metering technologies, price-based demand response (DR) becomes an alternative solution to improving power system reliability and efficiency by adjusting the load profile. In this paper, we simulate an electricity market with DR from different types of commercial buildings by using agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) techniques. We focus on the consumption behavior of commercial buildings with different levels of DR penetration in different market structures. The results indicate that there is a noticeable impact from commercial buildings with price-responsive demand on the electricity market, and this impact differs with different scales of DR participation under different levels of market competitions.

Abstract: With the increase in use of information technology in advanced demand side management and given the growth in power consumption in the computation and communications sectors, a new class of cyberintrusion plans is emerging that aims to alter the load through the Internet and by means of automatic and distributed software intruding agents. These attacks work by compromising direct load control command signals, demand side management price signals, or cloud computation load distribution algorithms to affect the load at the most crucial locations in the grid in order to cause circuit overflow or other malfunctions and damage the power system equipment. To gain insights into these less-examined yet important intrusion strategies, in this paper, we identify a variety of practical loads that can be volnurable to Internet-based load altering attacks. In addition, we overview a collection of defense mechanisms that can help in blocking these attacks or minimizing the damage caused by them. Our simulation results based on the standard setting in the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System show that our proposed cost-efficent load protection strategy can significantly reduce the cost of load protection while it guarantees that no Internet-based load altering attack may overload the power distribution system.

Abstract: The control center in smart grids requires the collaboration among different specialized groups to ensure the safety, reliability, greenness and efficiency of power system. However, each specialized group is interested in different aspects of the network model. In order to improve the teamwork and timeliness, the fundamental models should be managed in a unified way. This paper summarizes the requirements for data management of fundamental models, presents a concept of three-mode models, and designs the architecture of generic model access services. With the generic model access services, the differences of real-world model databases will be shielded, and the future virtual model can be managed as versions. The upper applications can obtain the fundamental model information through the data broker component and business model data through the business data organizing component.

Abstract: Modern power grid is the most complex human-made system, which is monitored by wide-area monitoring system (WAMS). Providing time-synchronized data of power system operating states, WAMS will play a crucial role in next generation smart grid protection and control. WAMS helps secure efficient energy transmission as well as reliable and optimal grid management. As the key enabler of a smart grid, numerous sensors such as PMU and current sensors transmit real-time dynamic data, which is usually protected by encryption algorithm from malicious attacks, over wide-area-network (WAN) to power system control centers so that monitoring and control of the whole system is possible. Security algorithms for power grid need to consider both performance and energy efficiency through code optimization techniques on encryption and decryption. In this paper, we take power nodes (sites) as platforms to experimentally study ways of energy consumptions in different security algorithms. First, we measure energy consumptions of various security algorithms on CrossBow and Ember sensor nodes. Second, we propose an array of novel code optimization methods to increase energy consumption efficiency of different security algorithms. Finally, based on careful analysis of measurement results, we propose a set of principles on using security algorithms in WAMS nodes, such as cryptography selections, parameter configuration, and the like. Such principles can be used widely in other computing systems with energy constraints.

Abstract: Much interest and research have emerged to implement and improve the smart grid. The smart grid is the power infrastructure whose intellectual capability is enhanced with communication networks. In addition to communication networks, a bidirectional flow of both power and information enables the customers to actively participate in the whole procedure of power generation, transport, distribution, and consumption. In this paper, we propose the concept of collaborative customer to combine two or more customers into a single customer community, under which the customers collaborate on a power-sharing to reduce their expenditure for electricity power. However, the collaboration can be easily disrupted in the presence of malicious or selfish behaviors. In order to address the security issue, we present a brand-new security scheme, called the voucher scheme, for securely trading the right on power usage among members of a collaborative customer. When the voucher scheme is enabled, a power customer who wants to use extra power issues a certificate, called voucher that is immune to various security attacks, to a power customer who is willing to transfer its right on power usage to the former customer, so that both the customers can have monetary benefits. We formally define the security model for the voucher scheme and prove that the scheme is secure in the random oracle model. We then present a performance evaluation study to see the effectiveness of the scheme with respect to the benefit of the power-sharing and the robustness of the security. The study indicates that the proposed voucher scheme can promote a power trading for collaborative customer, protect the collaboration among customers from malicious or selfish behaviors, and consequently reduce the overproduction of electric power in the smart grid.

Abstract: Communication networks play a critical role in smart grid, as the intelligence of smart grid is built based on information exchange across the power grid. In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.

Abstract: It is essential to estimate how much power can be delivered from vehicles to grid, called achievable power capacity (APC), for practical vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. We propose a method of estimating the APC in a probabilistic manner. Its probability distribution is obtained from the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, and hence represented with two parameters, i.e., mean and covariance. Based on the probability distribution of the APC, we calculate the power capacity that V2G regulation providers (or V2G aggregators) are contracted to provide grid operators with, called the contracted power capacity (CPC). Four possible contract types between a grid operator and a V2G regulation provider are suggested and, for each contract type, a profit function is developed from the APC and the penalty imposed to the V2G aggregator. The CPCs for four contract types are chosen to maximize the corresponding profit functions. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the estimated probability distribution of APC and the effectiveness of the profit functions.

Abstract: "Vehicle-to-grid" (V2G) power will be a new green energy scheme in which electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles communicate with the smart grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate. Due to high vehicular speed, sporadic connection, limited communication range, and large volume of data that need to be transmitted, V2G communications have the crucial requirements of fast authentication and encryption/decryption. This paper proposes a unique batch authentication protocol UBAPV2G that takes into account the characteristics of vehicle communication. The performance analysis shows that UBAPV2G can achieve less authentication delay, less computational cost, and less communication traffic, and security analysis shows that UBAPV2G is strong enough to defend against security attacks. The experimental results also demonstrate that UBAPV2G can achieve less authentication delay for large number of packets. Thus, UBAPV2G protocol is suitable for the stringent requirement of real time V2G communications.

Abstract: While security is generally perceived as an important constituent of communication systems, this paper offers a viable security-communication trade-off particularly tailored to smart grids. These systems, often composed of embedded nodes with highly constrained resources, require, e.g., metering data to be delivered efficiently while neither jeopardizing communication nor security. Data aggregation is a natural choice in such settings, where an additional challenge is to facilitate per-hop and end-to-end security as well as a mechanism to protect the valid nodes from exhaustion threats. The prime contribution of this paper is to include into the security design framework issues related to aggregation, wireless fading and shadowing channels, physical layer parameters (such as choice of modulation, packet length, channel coder), medium access control parameters (such as average number of transmissions), routing parameters (such as choice of route). Relying on analysis and corroborating simulations, unprecedented design guidelines are derived which determine the operational point beyond which aggregation is useful as well quantifying the superiority of our protocol enriched with a protection mechanism against nonintended packets (malicious or nonmalicious) w.r.t. nonaggregated and/or unsecured solutions.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are important components of the smart grid (SG) for their capability of providing better ancillary services and facilitating the adoption of renewable resources. The operation of the V2G networks is based on continuously monitoring the status of individual battery vehicle (BV) as well as a carefully designed incentive scheme to attract sufficient participating BVs. However, the close monitoring tends to raise privacy concerns from the BV owners about identity and location information leakage, which have not been considered in previous works. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V2G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V2G network into practice. In V2G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protection rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable. To protect privacy of BVs in V2G networks, we present P-2, a secure communication architecture which achieves privacy-preserving for both BVs' monitoring and rewarding processes. Extensive performance analysis shows that P-2 only incurs moderate communication and computational overheads.

Abstract: From the perspective of global warming mitigation and depletion of energy resources, renewable energy such as wind generation (WG) and photovoltaic generation (PV) are getting attention in distribution systems. Additionally, all electric apartment houses or residence such as dc smart houses are increasing. However, due to the fluctuating power from renewable energy sources and loads, supply-demand balancing of power system becomes problematic. The smart grid is a solution to this problem. This paper presents a methodology for optimal operation of a smart grid to minimize the interconnection point power flow fluctuation. To achieve the proposed optimal operation, we use distributed controllable loads such as battery and heat pump. By minimizing the interconnection point power flow fluctuation, it is possible to reduce the electric power consumption and the cost of electricity. This system consists of a photovoltaic generator, heat pump, battery, solar collector, and load. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, results are used in simulation presented.

Abstract: Current transformers (CTs) are used to measure line currents in a power network for indicative and protective purposes. However, due to magnetic hysteresis in the cores, traditional CTs may saturate when they detect large fault currents. Thus, a more efficient and accurate device is required. This paper aims at designing a more economical device, a microsensor to measure power network currents. The characteristics of this new design are measured and discussed. The new component will not be saturated for fault currents as high as 40 kA and can be used directly with an intelligent protective system or a digital meter for smart metering of electric power networks if it is designed with an integrated circuit (IC) chip.

Abstract: Internet Data Center (IDC) supports the reliable operations of many important online services. As the demand of Internet services and cloud computing keep increasing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations had been surging significantly. Such mass power consumption has brought heavy burden on IDC operators. Recently there are extensive research on power management for IDCs. However, one important challenge faced by IDC operators has been overlooked. How to handle the uncertainties in IDC operations is a challenging task. The uncertainties come from both the dynamic workload and time-varying electricity prices. In this paper, we systematically investigate the problem of minimizing the operation risk of IDCs against those uncertainties at the same time guaranteeing quality of service under deregulated electricity market environment. We propose a novel hedging scheme and model the operation risk minimization problem as a bilevel programming. We also design an optimal hedging algorithm. We conduct extensive evaluations based on real-life workload data from Google and electricity price data from deregulated electricity market for multiple IDC locations. Results show that our scheme can significantly reduce the operation risk by countering the uncertainties.

Abstract: The traditional power grid has been designed in a hierarchical fashion, with energy pushed from the large scale production factories towards the end users. With the increasing availability of micro and medium scale generating facilities, the situation is changing. Many end users can now produce energy and share it over the power grid. Of course, end users need incentives to do so and want to act in an open decentralized energy market. In the present work, we offer a novel analysis of the medium and low voltage power grids of the North Netherlands using statistical tools from the complex network analysis field. We use a weighted model based on actual grid data and propose a set of statistical measures to evaluate the adequacy of the current infrastructure for a decentralized energy market. Further, we use the insight gained by the analysis to propose parameters that tie the statistical topological measures to economic factors that influence the attractiveness of participating in such decentralized energy market, thus identifying the important topological parameters to work on to facilitate such open decentralized markets.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel load management solution for coordinating the charging of multiple plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in a smart grid system. Utilities are becoming concerned about the potential stresses, performance degradations and overloads that may occur in distribution systems with multiple domestic PEV charging activities. Uncontrolled and random PEV charging can cause increased power losses, overloads and voltage fluctuations, which are all detrimental to the reliability and security of newly developing smart grids. Therefore, a real-time smart load management (RT-SLM) control strategy is proposed and developed for the coordination of PEV charging based on real-time (e.g., every 5 min) minimization of total cost of generating the energy plus the associated grid energy losses. The approach reduces generation cost by incorporating time-varying market energy prices and PEV owner preferred charging time zones based on priority selection. The RT-SLM algorithm appropriately considers random plug-in of PEVs and utilizes the maximum sensitivities selection (MSS) optimization. This approach enables PEVs to begin charging as soon as possible considering priority-charging time zones while complying with network operation criteria (such as losses, generation limits, and voltage profile). Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of SLM for the modified IEEE 23 kV distribution system connected to several low voltage residential networks populated with PEVs.

Abstract: We present methods for analyzing commercial and industrial facility 15-min-interval electric load data. These methods allow building managers to better understand their facility's electricity consumption over time and to compare it to other buildings, helping them to "ask the right questions" to discover opportunities for demand response, energy efficiency, electricity waste elimination, and peak load management. We primarily focus on demand response. Methods discussed include graphical representations of electric load data, a regression-based electricity load model that uses a time-of-week indicator variable and a piecewise linear and continuous outdoor air temperature dependence and the definition of various parameters that characterize facility electricity loads and demand response behavior. In the future, these methods could be translated into easy-to-use tools for building managers.

Abstract: Due to the large-scale implementation of distributed generation, the power delivery system is changing gradually from a "vertically" to a "horizontally" controlled and operated structure. This transition has prompted the emergence of the active distribution network (ADN) concept as an efficient and flexible distribution system to deal with various challenging issues. This paper addresses a multiagent system (MAS) as a suitable technology to manage autonomous control actions and perform the coordination in an ADN. In this agent-based ADN a smart power router is implemented, which can flexibly integrate network areas and optimally manage power flows. Operational and control functions of the power router has been investigated in a laboratory experiment. In this lab setup, a configuration of the power router is established in a combination of a three-inverter system and an agent. The experiments show that the ADN can operate in an efficient and flexible way with the support of the power router interface. The control function of the inverters and the operation of MAS are thoroughly verified.

Abstract: Smart grids have become one of the important and challenging topics due to the numerous benefits it can bring to the power system. In this context, distributed generation (DG) is expected to play a significant role. The smart grid can have multiple configurations depending on the smart grid operating strategy and system conditions. In smart grids, DG could be operated either grid connected or islanded. Such flexible and variable configuration results in variable fault current levels which could impact the operation of the existing protective devices on the distribution system. In this paper, it is proposed to optimally size thyristor-controlled impedance (TCI) of both inductive and capacitive type to manage the fault current levels under different smart grid configurations. The salient benefit is to avoid damage and delayed operation of protective devices due to the variability in fault currents with synchronous-based DG. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem and the optimum size and type of the TCI is determined using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Results show that by optimally locating and sizing TCI, fault current levels under various smart grid configurations can be managed and thus avoiding protective device coordination failure and damage.

Abstract: The arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) is expected to be one of the most essential components in smart grid systems for providing physical security and safety against electrical fire hazards caused by arc faults. As AFCIs are widely deployed as a part of mandatory installation requirements, a hierarchy consisting of multilevel AFCIs has been established, where a portable AFCI is connected serially to an outlet box AFCI. However, this multilevel AFCI structure causes serious problems when the AFCI detects arc faults in the surveillance area of its descendant AFCIs. This can cause de-energizing of the entire area covered by the upper-level AFCI, which may lead to blackouts over large areas. This paper proposes an integrated security framework comprised of physical and logical security measures as a solution for this problem. Firstly, the problem is tackled through communication between the hierarchy levels. Since the proposed system deals with physical security and safety, the communication must guarantee reliable message delivery within the specified deadlines. A controller area network (CAN) is chosen as the communication technology because it provides deterministic message delivery that meets the system requirements. Moreover, CAN has the advantages of verified performance and cost competitiveness through accelerated industrial adoption. Along with the physical security framework, a logical security framework is also proposed with group key management that prevents unauthorized access. Finally, this paper reports an integrated methodology for optimizing the design parameters satisfying the bandwidth and security demands of physical and logical measures because both demands competitively share a common communication resource.

Abstract: In this paper, the hourly demand response (DR) is incorporated into security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) for economic and security purposes. SCUC considers fixed and responsive loads. Unlike fixed hourly loads, responsive loads are modeled with their intertemporal characteristics. The responsive loads linked to hourly market prices can be curtailed or shifted to other operating hours. The study results show that DR could shave the peak load, reduce the system operating cost, reduce fuel consumptions and carbon footprints, and reduce the transmission congestion by reshaping the hourly load profile. Numerical simulations in this paper exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: A novel wide area backup protection algorithm to identify fault branch based on the fault steady state component is proposed. Under normal conditions of the power system, subsets of buses called protection correlation regions (PCRs) are formed on the basis of the network topology and phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement. After the fault occurs, by analyzing the fault steady state component of differential current in each PCR, the fault correlation region is confirmed and then a fault correlation factor (FCF), is calculated in real time to locate the fault branch. The simulation results for the 10-generator 39-bus system verify that this method is able to easily identify fault branch with limited measurement points.

Abstract: The increasing use of intermittent renewable energy sources to decarbonize electric power generation is expected to introduce dynamic instability to the mains. This situation is of particular concern for mini-grids or isolated grids in which wind and/or solar power sources are the dominant or the sole power sources. In this paper, we utilize the photo-electro-thermal theory to develop a design methodology for LED lighting systems for weakly regulated voltage sources, with the objectives of minimizing the fluctuation of the human luminous perception and adopting reliable LED driver with long lifetime and robustness against extreme weather conditions. The proposed LED system, practically verified in a 10 kVA small power grid driven by an ac voltage source and a wind energy simulator, can be considered as a smart load with its load demand following the power generation. A typical swing of 40 V in the mains will cause only 15% actual light variation in a 132 W LED system when compared with 40% change in 150 W high-pressure-sodium lamp system. The design methodology enables future large-scale LED systems to be designed as a new generation of smart loads that can adapt to the voltage and power fluctuations arising from the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources.

Abstract: A significant increase in the penetration of distributed generation has resulted in a possibility of operating distribution systems with distributed generation in islanded mode. However, overcurrent protection of an islanded distribution system is still an issue due to the difference in fault current when the distribution system is connected to the grid and when it is islanded. This paper proposes the use of adaptive protection, using local information, to overcome the challenges of the overcurrent protection in distribution systems with distributed generation. The trip characteristics of the relays are updated by detecting operating states ( grid connected or island) and the faulted section. The paper also proposes faulted section detection using time overcurrent characteristics of the protective relays. Simulation results show that the operating state and faulted section can be correctly identified and the protection system settings can be updated to clear the faults faster.

Abstract: Power electronic-based FACTS devices such as STATCOMs are sometimes essential for voltage support in transmission networks. They can also be used for continuous operation of doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines during faults. However, these devices are quite expensive and therefore cannot be used extensively. This paper explores the potential of a low-cost solution that utilizes the reactive power and voltage support capabilities of plug-in vehicles parked in charging stations (SmartParks) so that they can behave as virtual STATCOMs. For this solution, a 12-bus multimachine power system is considered wherein one of the conventional units is replaced by a 400 MW wind farm. Twelve SmartParks are developed and integrated into the test system. First, they are connected to a weak bus in the system and used in voltage control mode. Their performance is compared with a STATCOM of a similar rating. Next, the SmartParks are connected to the wind farm bus, and a coordinated reactive power control strategy is proposed to improve the fault-ride-through capability of the wind farm without exceeding the current limits of rotor and grid-side converters. The entire study is carried out in real time on a real-time digital simulator platform.

Abstract: The problem of causally scheduling power consumption to minimize the expected cost at the consumer side is considered. The price of electricity is assumed to be time-varying. The scheduler has access to past and current prices, but only statistical knowledge about future prices, which it uses to make an optimal decision in each time period. The scheduling problem is naturally cast as a Markov decision process. Algorithms to find decision thresholds for both noninterruptible and interruptible loads under a deadline constraint are then developed. Numerical results suggest that incorporating the statistical knowledge into the scheduling policies can result in significant savings, especially for short tasks. It is demonstrated with real price data from Commonwealth Edison that scheduling with mismatched modeling and online parameter estimation can still provide significant economic advantages to consumers.

Abstract: System state estimation and control are important issues to ensure the stability and reliability of the smart grid system. In this paper, the problem of how to securely estimate the system state and control the smart grid is studied. In the setup studied, the sensor(s) and the controller communicate with each other through a wireless channel subjected to monitoring by an eavesdropper. The channel capacity requirement that ensures negligible information leakage to the eavesdropper about the system state and control messages is studied from the information theoretic perspective. Two scenarios with single sensor or multiple sensors are studied. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the capacity requirement in typical configurations of the smart grid.

Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) will play a key role in the extension of the smart grid towards residential premises, and enable various demand and energy management applications. Efficient demand-supply balance and reducing electricity expenses and carbon emissions will be the immediate benefits of these applications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an in-home energy management (iHEM) application. The performance of iHEM is compared with an optimization-based residential energy management (OREM) scheme whose objective is to minimize the energy expenses of the consumers. We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM. On the other hand, iHEM application is more flexible as it allows communication between the controller and the consumer utilizing the wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN). We evaluate the performance of iHEM under the presence of local energy generation capability, prioritized appliances, and for real-time pricing. We show that iHEM reduces the expenses of the consumers for each case. Furthermore, we show that packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter of the WSHAN improve as the packet size of the monitoring applications, that also utilize the WSHAN, decreases.

Abstract: The control-by-price concept fits well with controlling small-scale generation, storage and demand. In this paper, we investigate the required information and communications systems that are needed to realize the control-by-price concept for such units. We first present a proposal for overall infrastructure and subsystem design and secondly focus on the design and implementation of the end-user price-responsive controller, interfaces, and communications. The design and its applicability on existing devices is verified through laboratory tests with two cases: electric space heating thermostat control and a small combined heat and power unit. The results show that the price-responsive controller reduces the end user's electricity cost, or increases his income respectively, by about 7%. At the same time, the price-responsive controller provides an interface for the transmission system operator to utilize distributed energy resources and flexible demand as a regulating resource. Furthermore, the results illustrate and verify the applicability of the concept and the proposed infrastructure for controlling distributed energy resources and flexible demand.

Abstract: Data injection attacks to manipulate system state estimators on power grids are considered. A unified formulation for the problem of constructing attacking vectors is developed for linearized measurement models. Based on this formulation, a new low-complexity attacking strategy is shown to significantly outperform naive relaxation. It is demonstrated that it is possible to defend against malicious data injection if a small subset of measurements can be made immune to the attacks. However, selecting such subsets is a high-complexity combinatorial problem given the typically large size of electrical grids. To address the complexity issue, a fast greedy algorithm to select a subset of measurements to be protected is proposed. Another greedy algorithm that facilitates the placement of secure phasor measurement units (PMUs) to defend against data injection attacks is also developed. Simulations on the IEEE test systems demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: To support a high penetration of intermittent solar and wind power generation, many regions are planning to add new high capacity transmission lines. These additional transmission lines strengthen grid synchronization, but will also increase the grid's short circuit capacity, and furthermore will be very costly. With a highly interconnected grid and variable renewable generation, a small grid failure can easily start cascading outages, resulting in large scale blackout. We introduce the "digital grid," where large synchronous grids are divided into smaller segmented grids which are connected asynchronously, via multileg IP addressed ac/dc/ac converters called digital grid routers. These routers communicate with each other and send power among the segmented grids through existing transmission lines, which have been repurposed as digital grid transmission lines. The digital grid can accept high penetrations of renewable power, prevent cascading outages, accommodate identifiable tagged electricity flows, record those transactions, and trade electricity as a commodity.

Abstract: This paper presents a new scheme for load curtailment in the power system required for its self-healing under critical contingencies, which may pose a threat to frequency as well as the voltage stability of the system. The load shedding requirement in the system has been calculated based on the computed disturbance power as well as the voltage stability condition of the system, with the aid of real-time data, assumed to be available from the synchrophasor based wide area monitoring and control system (WAMCS). This scheme assesses voltage stability based on a dynamic voltage stability criterion, formulated using a Voltage Stability Risk Index (VSRI). Suitable locations for the load curtailments have been chosen according to the VSRI, calculated at each load bus. Performance of the proposed scheme has been tested on New England 39-bus system and a practical 246-bus Indian system. The results are compared with a conventional under frequency load shedding scheme and an adaptive load shedding scheme.

Abstract: This paper explores integrating a reputation-based trust mechanism with an agent-based backup protection system to help protect against malicious or byzantine failures. A distributed cooperative trust system has the potential to add an additional layer of protection designed to operate with greater autonomy. This trust component enables the agents in the system to make assessments using an estimate of the trustworthiness of cooperating protection agents based on their responsiveness and the consistency of their responses when compared with their peers. Results illustrate the improved decision-making capability of agents who incorporate this cooperative trust method in the presence of failures in neighboring relays.

Abstract: In terms of scope and granularity of data, two kinds of connectivity models are broadly in vogue for representing power network data, namely, node-breaker model and bus-branch model. This paper examines both the connectivity models from the perspective of common information model (CIM). Although CIM is primarily designed for most detailed node-breaker representation, with certain extensions CIM can be leveraged to achieve a standard, interoperable bus-branch model representation and exchange format. To facilitate this, it is proposed to introduce new class called TopologyBranch. By decoupling the connectivity information and the equipment parameter information, a mechanism for efficient exchange of time varying system models with minimum information transfer between the power control centers is described in this paper. The proposed CIM bus-branch connectivity model has wide applications in an interoperable, decentralized, hierarchical structure of control centers. Three illustrative examples including one on a practical 20-substation model of the 400 kV transmission network of Maharasthra state, India, are then presented for demonstrating the benefits.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel appliance commitment algorithm that schedules thermostatically controlled household loads based on price and consumption forecasts considering users' comfort settings to meet an optimization objective such as minimum payment or maximum comfort. The formulation of an appliance commitment problem is described using an electrical water heater load as an example. The thermal dynamics of heating and coasting of the water heater load is modeled by physical models; random hot water consumption is modeled with statistical methods. The models are used to predict the appliance operation over the scheduling time horizon. User comfort is transformed to a set of linear constraints. Then, a novel linear-sequential-optimization-enhanced, multiloop algorithm is used to solve the appliance commitment problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm is fast, robust, and flexible. The algorithm can be used in home/building energy-management systems to help household owners or building managers to automatically create optimal load operation schedules based on different cost and comfort settings and compare cost/benefits among schedules.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time optimization approach based on the Newton-type algorithm (NTA) and the least-squares (LS) method for power system frequency estimation. A nonlinear Newton algorithm is used to track the modulation effect of frequency variation on the online estimation of the phase angle. The LS curve fitting technique extracts the instantaneous power system frequency from the time-varying phase angle estimation by the NTA. A very low sampling rate is adopted to implement the introduced NTA-LS optimization technique. The presented slow sampling NTA-LS approach is a very efficient real-time algorithm which rectifies the need for wide-bandwidth sensors and promises to reduce the hardware complexity in the phasor and frequency measurement applications. The performance of the proposed method is validated by simulations in MATLAB-Simulink. Real-time implementation results are presented which prove robustness and accuracy of the NTA-LS method under time-varying conditions and in the simulated "real-life" field environment.

Abstract: The paper presents a new approach for islanding detection in distributed generation (DG) using rate of change of phase angle difference (ROCPAD). The process starts with retrieving the voltage and current signals at the DG end and estimating the phasors (amplitude, phase, and frequency) using synchronous transformation based algorithm. The next step is to compute the phase angle difference and the ROCPAD for registering islanding detection. The proposed algorithm is compared with the widely used rate of change of frequency relays (ROCOF) and found working effectively in the situations where ROCOF fails. The proposed ROCPAD relay is tested on standard microgrid structures with possible variations in operating parameters and the results indicate that the ROCPAD relay can reliably detect islanding conditions in large microgrids.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust hierarchical control system of distributed generation converters for robust microgrid operation and seamless transfer between grid-connected and isolated modes. The proposed control scheme employs 1) an internal model voltage controller with a variable structure control element to provide means for mitigating fast and dynamic voltage disturbances, such as dynamic voltage disturbance during mode transition and normal operation, and 2) a droop-based power-sharing controller with an active damping feature to mitigate large power-angle swings and oscillations associated with large-signal disturbances (e.g., mode transition and heavy loading conditions). The proposed voltage and power sharing controllers provide high disturbance rejection performance against voltage disturbances and power angle swings, respectively. Accordingly, robust microgrid operation with seamless transfer in the transition mode has been obtained. Comparative experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid ac/dc micro grid to reduce the processes of multiple dc-ac-dc or ac-dc-ac conversions in an individual ac or dc grid. The hybrid grid consists of both ac and dc networks connected together by multi-bidirectional converters. AC sources and loads are connected to the ac network whereas dc sources and loads are tied to the dc network. Energy storage systems can be connected to dc or ac links. The proposed hybrid grid can operate in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. The coordination control algorithms are proposed for smooth power transfer between ac and dc links and for stable system operation under various generation and load conditions. Uncertainty and intermittent characteristics of wind speed, solar irradiation level, ambient temperature, and load are also considered in system control and operation. A small hybrid grid has been modeled and simulated using the Simulink in the MATLAB. The simulation results show that the system can maintain stable operation under the proposed coordination control schemes when the grid is switched from one operating condition to another.

Abstract: High voltage direct current (HVDC) links are interties, characterized by good controllability, large adjustable capacity and fast responses, and have inherent advantage in damping interarea oscillations over power system stabilizers (PSS) and flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS). In this paper, a systematic and practical means to design the multiple HVDC damping control system, which aims to enhance the damping of certain interarea modes and minimize the interactions between different control loops, is provided. In the proposed procedure, the wide-area feedback signals that have the good observability of target modes are preselected by an index based on residue analysis firstly. Then the interactions between the candidate control loops, in which the setting power reference of the HVDC as the input and the preselected wide-area signals as the output, are investigated by relative gain array (RGA) analysis. According to the RGA results, a suitable input-output pairing for multiple HVDC damping controller is determined. The transfer function residues used in the feedback signal preselection and the RGA calculation are identified by Prony analysis in the transient stability program and electromagnetic transient program respectively. Finally, the damping controller parameters are optimized by time-domain simulations. The application in China Southern Power Grid (CSG) is illustrated as the case study.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in power grids is known to be challenging, due to the massive scale and spatial coupling therein. In this study, we explore multiscale network inference for fault detection and localization. Specifically, we model the phasor angles across the buses as a Markov random field (MRF), where the conditional correlation coefficients of the MRF are quantified in terms of the physical parameters of power systems. Based on the MRF model, we then study decentralized network inference for fault diagnosis, through change detection and localization in the conditional correlation matrix of the MRF. Particularly, based on the hierarchical topology of practical power systems, we devise a multiscale network inference algorithm that carries out fault detection and localization in a decentralized manner. Simulation results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This study establishes a new approach to analyzing the economic impacts of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) regulation reserves by simulating the restrictions arising from unpredictable mobility requests by vehicle users. A case study for Germany using average daily values (in the following also called the "static" approach) and a dynamic simulation including different mobility use patterns are presented. Comparing the dynamic approach with the static approach reveals a significant difference in the power a vehicle can offer for ancillary services and provides insights into the necessary size of vehicle pools and possible adaptations required in the regulation market to render V2G feasible. In the static approach it is shown that negative secondary control is economically the most beneficial for electric vehicles because it offers the highest potential for charging with "low-priced" energy from negative regulation reserves. A Monte Carlo simulation using stochastic mobility behavior results in a 40% reduction of the power available for regulation compared to the static approach. Because of the high value of power in the regulation market, this finding has a strong impact on the resulting revenues. Further, we demonstrate that, for the data used, a pool size of 10 000 vehicles seems reasonable to balance the variation in each individual's driving behavior. In the case of the German regulation market, which uses monthly bids, a daily or hourly bid period is recommended. This adaptation would be necessary to provide individual regulation assuming that the vehicles are primarily used for mobility reasons and cannot deliver the same amount of power every hour of the week.

Abstract: The future electricity network has to be able to manage energy coming from different grids as well as from renewable energy sources (RES) and other distributed generation (DG) systems. Advanced power electronic converters can provide the means to control power flow and ensure proper and secure operation of future networks. This paper presents analysis, design, and experimental validation of a back-to-back three-phase ac-dc-ac multilevel converter employed for universal and flexible power management (UNIFLEX-PM) of future electrical grids and its advanced control technique. The proposed system has been successfully tested for bidirectional power flow operation with different grid operating conditions such as voltage unbalance, frequency variation, harmonic distortion, and faults due to short circuits.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of secure key management for smart grid. Since existing key management schemes are not suitable for deployment in smart grid, in this paper, we propose a novel key management scheme which combines symmetric key technique and elliptic curve public key technique. The symmetric key scheme is based on the Needham-Schroeder authentication protocol. We show that the known threats including the man-in-the-middle attack and the replay attack can be effectively eliminated under the proposed scheme. The advantages of the new key management scheme include strong security, scalability, fault-tolerance, accessibility, and efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new "intelligent operation" concept for high-voltage SF gas circuit breakers, in which the moving contacts are self-adaptively controlled from one position to an adjacent position to improve the circuit breaker life cycles. To analyze the concept intelligent operation, a new model of high-voltage SF gas circuit breaker is developed, and the moving characteristics of the new type circuit breaker are computed based on the newly designed model. Then both mechanical and electrical wears are quantitatively analyzed according to the breaker's new moving characteristic. Finally, we demonstrate the life cycle improvement of the new type of high-voltage SF gas circuit breaker. Our analysis can also be used to estimate the remaining life cycle of a breaker based on the tallied data collected by our intelligent modules.

Abstract: State estimation is a key element in today's power systems for reliable system operation and control. State estimation collects information from a large number of meter measurements and analyzes it in a centralized manner at the control center. Existing state estimation approaches were traditionally assumed to be able to tolerate and detect random bad measurements. They were, however, recently shown to be vulnerable to intentional false data injection attacks. This paper fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks, a special type of false data injection attacks, and analyzes their damage to power system operation in different time steps with different attacking resource limitations. Based on damaging effect analysis, we differentiate two attacking goals from the adversary's perspective, i.e., immediate attacking goal and delayed attacking goal. For the immediate attacking goal, this paper identifies the most damaging LR attack through a max-min attacker-defender model. Then, the criterion of determining effective protection strategies is explained. The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested on a 14-bus system. To the author's best knowledge, this is the first work of its kind, which quantitatively analyzes the damage of the false data injection attacks to power system operation and security. Our analysis hence provides an in-depth insight on effective attack prevention with limited protection resource budget.

Abstract: Restructuring in power systems has introduced new complexities and difficulties in controlling of these systems. Therefore, new control strategies should be investigated in operation of power systems. On the other hand, communication infrastructure (CI) is responsible for establishing any control strategy. The purposes of this study are twofold: firstly, to design a communication infrastructure for any given power network with determined measurements; secondly, to compare communication infrastructures for centralized and decentralized control strategies in power grids. The comparison criteria are communication network cost, delay (latency), and reliability. In this study, hybrid state estimation (HSE), as one of the most important wide area measurement systems (WAMS), is opted. Communication infrastructures are designed for two different control strategies; centralized and decentralized (multi-area) HSE. These strategies have been investigated in IEEE 118-bus test network. Some new concepts, that help us to compare any two given communication infrastructures with each other, are introduced. Finally, two designed communication infrastructures for these two strategies are compared with each other. The results show that, although communication infrastructure investments are almost the same in both cases, decentralizing, as a cause of decentralized control strategy, results in improvement of latency and reliability of CI.

Abstract: There is increasing requests for noncontrollable distribution generation (DG) interconnections in the medium and low voltage networks. Many studies have suggested that with proper system planning, DG could provide benefits such as reliability enhancement, investment deferment, and reduced losses. However, without network reinforcements, the allowable interconnection capacity in a network is often restricted due to fault current level, voltage variation, and power flow constraints. This paper aims to address the issue of optimizing network operation and use for accommodating DG integrations. A new DG interconnection planning study framework that includes a coordinated feeder reconfiguration and voltage control to calculate the maximum allowable DG capacity at a given node in the distribution network is presented. A binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) technique is employed to solve the discrete nonlinear optimization problem and possible uncertainties associated with volatile renewable DG resource and loads are incorporated through a stochastic simulation approach. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Numerical examples suggest that the method and procedure used in the current DG interconnection impact study should be modified in order to optimize the existing grid operation and usage to facilitate customer participation in system operation and planning.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has been proposed as a way to increase the adoption rate of electric vehicles (EVs). Unidirectional V2G is especially attractive because it requires little if any additional infrastructure other than communication between the EV and an aggregator. The aggregator in turn combines the capacity of many EVs to bid into energy markets. In this work an algorithm for unidirectional regulation is developed for use by an aggregator. Several smart charging algorithms are used to set the point about which the rate of charge varies while performing regulation. An aggregator profit maximization algorithm is formulated with optional system load and price constraints analogous to the smart charging algorithms. Simulations on a hypothetical group of 10 000 commuter EVs in the Pacific Northwest verify that the optimal algorithms increase aggregator profits while reducing system load impacts and customer costs.

Abstract: An approach for power system harmonic phasor analysis under asynchronous sampling is proposed in this paper. It is based on smoothing sampled data by windowing the signal with the four-term fifth derivative Nuttall (FFDN) window, and then calculating harmonic phasors in the frequency domain with an improved fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm. The applicable rectification formulas of the IFFT are obtained by using the polynomial curve fitting, dramatically reducing the computation load. The FFDN window can effectively inhibit the spectral leakage and the picket fence effect can be modified by the IFFT algorithm under asynchronous sampling, and the overall algorithm can easily be implemented in embedded systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method was analyzed by means of simulations and practical experiments for multifrequency signals with the fluctuation of the fundamental frequency and with the presence of white noise and interharmonics.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the problem of load-time variation in power line communication (PLC) systems and to analyze asynchronous impulsive noise and related channel variations due to switch commutations. A numerical model of the time-varying communication channel is developed by using scattering parameters in the wavelet domain. The proposed method uses the N-port description of the elements that constitute a time-varying PLC system in terms of real matrices with constant elements. This represents a valid alternative to the time domain description usually adopted for analyzing time-varying networks. The comparison with results obtained from other numerical models and with experimental data has confirmed the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: As the number of plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) increases, so might the impacts on the power system performance, such as overloading, reduced efficiency, power quality, and voltage regulation particularly at the distribution level. Coordinated charging of PHEVs is a possible solution to these problems. In this work, the relationship between feeder losses, load factor, and load variance is explored in the context of coordinated PHEV charging. From these relationships, three optimal charging algorithms are developed which minimize the impacts of PHEV charging on the connected distribution system. The application of the algorithms to two test systems verifies these relationships approximately hold independent of system topology. They also show the additional benefits of reduced computation time and problem convexity when using load factor or load variance as the objective function rather than system losses. This is important for real-time dispatching of PHEVs.

Abstract: Demand response has become a key feature of the future smart grid. In addition to having advanced communication and computing infrastructures, a successful demand response program must respond to the needs of a power system. In other words, the efficiency and security of a power system dictate the locations, amounts and speeds of the load reductions of a demand response program. In this paper, we propose an event-driven emergency demand response scheme to prevent a power system from experiencing voltage collapse. A technique to design such a scheme is presented. This technique is able to provide key setting parameters such as the amount of demand reductions at various locations to arm the demand response infrastructure. The validity of the proposed technique has been verified by using several test power systems.

Abstract: Here we develop an approach to predict power grid weak points, and specifically to efficiently identify the most probable failure modes in static load distribution for a given power network. This approach is applied to two examples: Guam's power system and also the IEEE RTS-96 system, both modeled within the static dc power flow model. Our algorithm is a power network adaption of the worst configuration heuristics, originally developed to study low probability events in physics and failures in error-correction. One finding is that, if the normal operational mode of the grid is sufficiently healthy, the failure modes, also called instantons, are sufficiently sparse, i.e., the failures are caused by load fluctuations at only a few buses. The technique is useful for discovering weak links which are saturated at the instantons. It can also identify generators working at the capacity and generators under capacity, thus providing predictive capability for improving the reliability of any power network.

Abstract: Smart grid is an intelligent power generation, distribution, and control system. ZigBee, as a wireless mesh networking scheme low in cost, power, data rate, and complexity, is ideal for smart grid applications, e. g., real-time system monitoring, load control, and building automation. Unfortunately, almost all ZigBee channels overlap with wireless local area network (WLAN) channels, resulting in severe performance degradation due to interference. In this paper, we aim to develop practical ZigBee deployment guideline under the interference of WLAN. We identify the "Safe Distance" and "Safe Offset Frequency" using a comprehensive approach including theoretical analysis, software simulation, and empirical measurement. In addition, we propose a frequency agility-based interference avoidance algorithm. The proposed algorithm can detect interference and adaptively switch nodes to "safe" channel to dynamically avoid WLAN interference with small latency and small energy consumption. Our proposed scheme is implemented with a Meshnetics ZigBit Development Kit and its performance is empirically evaluated in terms of the packet error rate (PER) using a ZigBee and Wi-Fi coexistence test bed. It is shown that the empirical results agree with our analytical results. The measurements demonstrate that our design guideline can efficiently mitigate the effect of WiFi interference and enhance the performance of ZigBee networks.

Abstract: In the islanded operating condition, the microgrid has to maintain the power balance independently of a main grid. Because of the specific characteristics of the microgrid, such as the resistive lines and the high degree of power-electronically interfaced generators, new power control methods for the generators have been introduced. For the active power control in this paper, a variant of the conventional P/f droop control strategy is used, namely the voltage-droop controller. However, because of the small size of the microgrid and the high share of renewables with an intermittent character, new means of flexibility in power balancing are required to ensure stable operation. Therefore, a novel active load control strategy is presented in this paper. The aim is to render a proof of concept for this control strategy in an islanded microgrid. The active load control is triggered by the microgrid voltage level. The latter is enabled by using the voltage-droop control strategy and its specific properties. It is concluded that the combination of the voltage-droop control strategy with the presented demand dispatch allows reliable power supply without interunit communication for the primary control, leads to a more efficient usage of the renewable energy and can even lead to an increased share of renewables in the islanded microgrid.

Abstract: A novel device for the transmission of digital information over power lines is introduced. The transmission circuit is passive, using a resonator circuit to create a narrowband disturbance in the system. This disturbance can be detected over great distances and, in many cases, through distribution transformers. This makes it a promising solution to power-line communication problems in distribution systems that are sparsely populated over large geographical expanses. Modulation algorithms are introduced. We discuss results obtained using a prototype to transmit signals on a real distribution system.

Abstract: The introduction of remotely controlled network devices is transforming the way the power system is operated and studied. The ability to provide real and reactive power support can be achieved at the end-user level. In this paper, a framework and algorithm to coordinate this type of end-user control is presented. The algorithm is based on a layered architecture that would follow a chain of command from the top layer (transmission grid) to the bottom layer (distribution grid). At the distribution grid layer, certain local problems can be solved without the intervention of the top layers. A reactive load control optimization algorithm to improve the voltage profile in distribution grid is presented. The framework presented in this paper integrates agent-based technologies to manage the data and control actions required to operate this type of architecture.

Abstract: Power system islanding can improve the continuity of power supply. Synchronous islanded operation enables the islanded system to remain in phase with the main power system while not electrically connected, so avoiding out-of-synchronism re-closure. Specific consideration is required for the multiple-set scenario. In this paper a suitable island management system is proposed, with the emphasis being on maximum island flexibility by allowing passive islanding transitions to occur, facilitated by intelligent control. These transitions include: island detection, identification, fragmentation, merging and return-to-mains. It can be challenging to detect these transitions while maintaining synchronous islanded operation. The performance of this control system in the presence of a variable wind power in-feed is also examined. A Mathworks SimPowerSystems simulation is used to investigate the performance of the island management system. The benefit and requirements for energy storage, communications and distribution system protection for this application are considered.

Abstract: Wide-area analysis and control of large-scale electric power systems are highly dependent on the idea of aggregation. For example, one often hears power system operators mentioning how northern Washington oscillates against southern California in response to various disturbance events. The main question here is whether we can analytically construct dynamic electromechanical models for these conceptual, aggregated generators representing Washington and California, which in reality are some hypothetical combinations of thousands of actual generators. In this paper we address this problem, and present a concise overview of several new results on how to construct simplified interarea models of large power networks by using dynamic measurements available from phasor measurement units (PMUs) installed at specific points on the transmission line. Our examples of study are motivated by widely encountered power transfer paths in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), namely, a two-area radial system representing the WA-MT flow, and a star-connected three-area system resembling the Pacific AC Intertie.

Abstract: This paper proposes a wavelet-based method to obtain the characteristics of frequency and voltage derivatives for disturbance analysis. Frequency and voltage derivatives are important indicators to reflect the degree of disturbances and manifest power system dynamics. However, current computational methods for the indicators have noticeable drawbacks with respect to the accuracy. Wavelet transform-based multiresolution analysis (WT-based MRA) is introduced to obtain the characteristics of the indicators by computed maximum wavelet coefficients (WCs). Results from numerical experiments show a superior performance of WT-based MRA over the existing methods. Generation loss and load change as two major types of disturbances are studied to verify the proposed method. The disturbances are simulated in PSS/E for IEEE New England 39-bus system. The relationship of maximum WCs and power variation is discussed. Maximum WCs can provide enough information to distinguish the location of generation loss and estimate the load power variation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel sectionalizing method for the build-up strategy in power system restoration. Power system restoration is the procedure of restoring power system elements after a partial or a complete blackout. Because of its economic and political importance, different strategies have been developed for a secure as well as fast restoration. One of the most practical and economical is the build-up strategy that includes the process of restoring separated parts (islands) in the power system and interconnecting them afterwards. This paper intends to develop a systematic algorithm for sectionalizing a power system considering various constraints such as black-start capability of generators, power supply-demand balance and independence of islands. Moreover, utilizing the Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS), each island will be fully observable in this method which is a crucial requirement for the restoration process. The New England 39 bus power system is used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm and verify the results. The proposed method is also applied to the IEEE 118 bus system as a large-scale power system to prove its capability in practical systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the power management scheme for a power electronics based low voltage microgrid in islanding operation. The proposed real and reactive power control is based on the virtual frequency and voltage (omega' - E') frame, which can effectively decouple the real and reactive power flows and improve the system transient and stability performance. Detailed analysis of the virtual frame operation range is presented, and a control strategy to guarantee that the microgrid can be operated within the predetermined voltage and frequency variation limits is also proposed. Moreover, a reactive power control with adaptive voltage droop method is proposed, which automatically updates the maximum reactive power limit of a DG unit based on its current rating and actual real power output and features enlarged power output range and further improved system stability. Both simulation and experimental results are provided in this paper.

Abstract: Fault location is an important application among intelligent monitoring and outage management tasks used for realization of self healing networks, one of the most attractive features of smart grids. The data gathered from various intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) installed throughout the power system could be utilized for smart approaches to locating faults in both transmission and distribution systems. This paper discusses issues associated with improving accuracy of fault location methods in smart grids using an abundance of IED data. Two examples of how the gathered data from different IEDs is used to improve fault location accuracy in transmission and distribution systems are discussed in detail.

Abstract: This paper presents experiences from a pilot study focusing on daily demand response from households, utilizing smart metering, remote load control, pricing based on the hourly spot price combined with a time of day network tariff, and a token provided to the customers indicating peak hours. The observed demand response was 1 kWh/h for customers with standard electrical water heaters. By aggregating this response, the potential for demand response from 50% of Norwegian households can be estimated at 1000 MWh/h (4.2% of registered peak load demand in Norway). A cost-effective realization of this potential should have high focus when considering smart metering technology. From a market perspective, a potential load reduction of this size should be bid into the day ahead market. Demand response to price (the day after) will not affect the price, but might create imbalances and the need for activating balancing resources, creating additional costs.

Abstract: The paper describes the performances of a phasor measurement unit (PMU) prototype based on a synchrophasor estimation algorithm conceived for the monitoring of active distribution networks, as well as its experimental application during some intentional islanding and reconnection tests of an urban medium voltage power network. With respect to typical applications in transmission networks, the use of PMUs in distribution networks requires very low values of total vector error (TVE), which involves particular low values of phase errors of the synchrophasor estimates. These requirements are met by a specifically developed PMU, the characteristics and experimental characterization of which are illustrated in the paper. Three of these PMUs have been then used to monitor experimental tests carried out to assess the capability of a urban distribution network to operate autonomously when fed by a local 80 MW combined-cycle power plant. The information provided by the installed PMUs significantly facilitate the operator maneuvers and appear to be useful for the development of an improved control and management system of the active distribution network.

Abstract: This paper proposes a wavelet-based data compression approach for the smart grid (SG). In particular, wavelet transform (WT)-based multiresolution analysis (MRA), as well as its properties, are studied for its data compression and denoising capabilities for power system signals in SG. Selection of the Order 2 Daubechies wavelet and scale 5 as the best wavelet function and the optimal decomposition scale, respectively, for disturbance signals is demonstrated according to the criterion of the maximum wavelet energy of wavelet coefficients (WCs). To justify the proposed method, phasor data are simulated under disturbance circumstances in the IEEE New England 39-bus system. The results indicate that WT-based MRA can not only compress disturbance signals but also depress the sinusoidal and white noise contained in the signals.

Abstract: Once a fault in microgrids has been cleared, it is necessary to restore the unfaulted but out-of-service loads as much as possible in a timely manner. This paper proposes a novel fully distributed multiagent based load restoration algorithm. According to the algorithm, each agent makes synchronized load restoration decision according to discovered information. During the information discovery process, agents only communicate with their direct neighbors, and the global information is discovered based on the Average-Consensus Theorem. In this way, total net power, indexes and demands of loads that are ready for restoration can be obtained. Then the load restoration problem can be modeled and solved using existing algorithms for the 0-1 Knapsack problem. To achieve adaptivity and stability, a distributed algorithm for coefficient setting is proposed and compared against existing algorithms and a particle swarm optimization based algorithm. Theoretically, the proposed load restoration algorithm can be applied to systems of any size and structure. Simulation studies with power systems of different scale demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper a load dispatch model for the system consisting of both thermal generators and wind turbines is developed. The stochastic wind power is included in the model as a constraint. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the presented model has a set of closed-form solutions. The availability of closed-form solutions is helpful to gain more fundamental insights, such as the impact of a particular parameter on the optimal solution. Moreover, the feasible ranges of optimal solutions are given in the case that the output power of thermal turbines is restricted. Furthermore, the probability distribution and the average of solutions are derived. This is called the wait-and-see approach in the discipline of stochastic programming. The present work shows that the effects of random wind speed on the generated power can be readily assessed.

Abstract: In response to disturbances, a self-healing system reconfiguration that splits a power network into self-sufficient islands can stop the propagation of disturbances and avoid cascading events. This paper proposes an area partitioning algorithm that minimizes both real and reactive power imbalance between generation and load within islands. The proposed algorithm is a smart grid technology that applies a highly efficient multilevel multi-objective graph partitioning technique. Thus, it is applicable to very large power grids. The proposed algorithm has been simulated on a 200- and a 22,000-bus test systems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the voltage profile of an island after the system reconfiguration compared with the algorithm that only considers real power balance. In doing so, the algorithm maintains the computational efficiency.

Abstract: A smart power grid is an integration of the advanced measurement, communication, computer, and control techniques. Among all the state-of-the-art technologies in building a smart power grid, the phasor measurement unit (PMU) is an important and promising one. Nowadays in China, most ultrahigh- and high-voltage buses are all equipped with PMUs. This paper reports an application of PMU data on locating the disturbance source for the low-frequency oscillation that has happened several times in the interconnected big power grids in China recently. The posterior analysis by the Electric Power System Research Institute of China (CEPRI) has confirmed that these low-frequency oscillations are caused by the resonance phenomena. It is urgent to find the disturbance source in case it happens again. However, there have been no systematic and effective methods to locate the disturbance in a very large power system. The trial and error method has been implemented via the digital simulations, but in vain. To overcome this problem, a novel method is developed in this paper to locate the disturbance source with the help of PMUs. The method takes advantage of the PMU measurements to reduce the searching area for locating the disturbance source. Case studies show the efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper describes an optimization model to adjust the hourly load level of a given consumer in response to hourly electricity prices. The objective of the model is to maximize the utility of the consumer subject to a minimum daily energy-consumption level, maximum and minimum hourly load levels, and ramping limits on such load levels. Price uncertainty is modeled through robust optimization techniques. The model materializes into a simple linear programming algorithm that can be easily integrated in the Energy Management System of a household or a small business. A simple bidirectional communication device between the power supplier and the consumer enables the implementation of the proposed model. Numerical simulations illustrating the interest of the proposed model are provided.

Abstract: The power grid dynamics in North America is online detected by the North American power grid frequency monitoring network, and the measured frequency signals by frequency disturbance recorders (FDRs) contain the white noise and spikes that affect the analysis to those signals. In this paper, an interference model is built to depict the FDR frequency signals. Since those contaminated and complicated FDR frequency signals cannot be denoised satisfactorily by a conventional median filter with fixed window size, it is necessary that an adaptive median filter is designed and employed to eliminate noise and spikes. Furthermore, the accurate event start time (EST) is very important to analyze the dynamic process of a power grid and to locate the hypocenter of both the load trip event and the generation trip event, and hence a simple and useful algorithm also is presented to estimate the EST. Two event cases from North American power grids are employed to validate our idea.

Abstract: The Internet has evolved into a ubiquitous communication medium for information exchanges, services requests, and commodity purchasing. This paper proposes the concept, architecture, and the customer incentives for implementing a new demand-side management system called Online Purchase Electricity Now (OPEN). The new system allows customers to directly order the electricity via the Internet as if purchasing a book online. Utility companies, after consolidating the customers' orders, decide an optimal generation and distribution scheme to satisfy customers' demands. The time epoch between the customers' order and the actual generation acts as the lead time during which virtual energy will be scheduled for production. Such a virtual energy provisioning system can improve the reliability and stability of the electric grid which is increasingly integrated with distributed energy resources. Bayesian theory, hypothesis testing, and dynamic pricing are employed to justify the feasibility and applicability of the OPEN system.

Abstract: A new adaptive control strategy, intended to improve the ride-through capability of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems under unbalanced network conditions and parameter uncertainties, is introduced. The proposed strategy resorts to a model reference adaptive control plus a resonant filter. The resonant filter scheme is based on a unique synchronous reference frame that prevents the use of the customary sequence component detector, increasing the controller bandwidth accordingly. Several tests are conducted to compare the proposed scheme against existing HVDC controllers, showing an improved performance regarding: 1) elimination of the 2 omega ripple on the dc voltage arising during ac-side imbalances; 2) accurate and decoupled active and reactive power tracking when converter parameters are not perfectly known.

Abstract: Most of the existing demand-side management programs focus primarily on the interactions between a utility company and its customers/users. In this paper, we present an autonomous and distributed demand-side energy management system among users that takes advantage of a two-way digital communication infrastructure which is envisioned in the future smart grid. We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach can reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the total energy demand, the total energy costs, as well as each user's individual daily electricity charges.

Abstract: Microgrid power systems are becoming increasingly common in a host of applications. In this work, the mitigation of the adverse affects of pulsed-power loads on these systems is considered. In microgrid power systems, pulsed loads are particularly problematic since the total system inertia is finite. Examples include ships and aircraft with high-power radars, pulsed weapons, and electromagnetic launch and recovery systems. In these systems, energy is collected from the system over a finite time period, locally stored, and then rapidly utilized. Herein, a new strategy to accommodate these loads is presented. This strategy is based on identifying the optimal charging profile. Using simulation and experiment, it is shown the proposed strategy is highly effective in reducing the adverse impact of pulsed-power loads.

Abstract: The application of power electronics to facilitate the transmission or conversion of electric energy has been well known. This paper presents a different class of power electronic applications-the power electronic circuits are deployed to create small but discernible signals online. The signals are utilized for monitoring, power line communication and other information-oriented purposes. We use the term "power electronic (PE) signaling technology" to designate the technologies involved in these applications. The objective of this paper is to survey and review the developments in this fascinating field. Several highly successful PE signaling technologies and their applications are illustrated. It is believed that signaling-oriented power electronic techniques will have many potential applications in power systems and can be a major source of innovation for the smart grid initiative.

Abstract: Research on smart grid technologies has been advancing over the last years, producing novel practices concerning mainly the power distribution networks. However, in many countries these networks still operate in their traditional form, without offering the real-time operational characteristics which are essential for the utilization of the aforementioned practices. On the other hand, due to the extent of urban power distribution networks, as well as the substantial cost of medium voltage equipment, the full upgrade of these networks is in most cases not a feasible option. In this work, alternative options of selective automation upgrade in power distribution networks are offered, corresponding to the desired operational status of these networks. More specifically, the essential upgrades are analyzed for the implementation of reliability improvement and loss reduction techniques on such a network.

Abstract: Recent research shows that 20%-30% of building energy consumption can be saved through optimized operation and management without changing the building structure and the hardware configuration of the energy supply system. Therefore, there is a huge potential for building energy savings through efficient operation. Microgrid technology provides an opportunity and a desirable infrastructure for improving the efficiency of energy consumption in buildings. The key to improve building energy efficiency in operation is to coordinate and optimize the operation of various energy sources and loads. In this paper, the scheduling problem of building energy supplies is considered with the practical background of a low energy building. The objective function is to minimize the overall cost of electricity and natural gas for a building operation over a time horizon while satisfying the energy balance and complicated operating constraints of individual energy supply equipment and devices. The uncertainties are captured and their impact is analyzed by the scenario tree method. Numerical testing is performed with the data of the pilot low energy building. The testing results show that significant energy cost savings can be achieved through integrated scheduling and control of various building energy supply sources. It is very important to fully utilize solar energy and optimize the operation of electrical storage. It is also shown that precooling is a simple way to achieve energy savings.

Abstract: Microgrids are a rapidly growing sector of smart grids, which will be an essential component in the trend toward distributed electricity generation. In the operation of a microgrid, forecasting the short-term load is an important task. With a more accurate short-term loaf forecast (STLF), the microgrid can enhance the management of its renewable and conventional resources and improve the economics of energy trade with electricity markets. However, STLF for microgrids is a complex forecast process, mainly because of the highly nonsmooth and nonlinear behavior of the load time series. In this paper, characteristics of the load time series of a typical microgrid are discussed and the differences with the load time series of traditional power systems are described. In addition, a new bilevel prediction strategy is proposed for STLF of microgrids. The proposed strategy is composed of a feature selection technique and a forecast engine (including neural network and evolutionary algorithm) in the lower level as the forecaster and an enhanced differential evolution algorithm in the upper level for optimizing the performance of the forecaster. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction strategy is evaluated by the real-life data of a university campus in Canada.

Abstract: Wind power generation is taking an increasing share of the overall energy production in many power systems. While its low marginal operating cost reduces the overall cost of meeting the demand for electrical energy, the stochastic and intermittent nature of wind generation increases the uncertainty that the system operators face and obliges them to procure additional reserve capacity. This paper presents a methodology for quantifying fully the effect of wind power generation on the various components of the cost of operating the system.

Abstract: Emerging new technologies like distributed generation, distributed storage, and demand-side load management will change the way we consume and produce energy. These techniques enable the possibility to reduce the greenhouse effect and improve grid stability by optimizing energy streams. By smartly applying future energy production, consumption, and storage techniques, a more energy-efficient electricity supply chain can be achieved. In this paper a three-step control methodology is proposed to manage the cooperation between these technologies, focused on domestic energy streams. In this approach, (global) objectives like peak shaving or forming a virtual power plant can be achieved without harming the comfort of residents. As shown in this work, using good predictions, in advance planning and real-time control of domestic appliances, a better matching of demand and supply can be achieved.

Abstract: Recent developments in smart grid technology have spawned interest in the use of phasor measurement units to help create a reliable power system transmission and distribution infrastructure. Wide-area monitoring systems (WAMSs) utilizing synchrophasor measurements can help with understanding, forecasting, or even controlling the status of power grid stability in real-time. A power system frequency monitoring network (FNET) was first proposed in 2001 and was established in 2004. As a pioneering WAMS, it serves the entire North American power grid through advanced situational awareness techniques, such as real-time event alerts, accurate event location estimation, animated event visualization, and post event analysis. Several papers published in the past several years discussed the FNET structure and its functionality. This paper presents some of the latest implementations of FNET's applications, which add significant capacities to this system for observing power system problems.

Abstract: Demand response (DR) is becoming an integral part of power system and market operations. Smart grid technologies will further increase the use of DR in everyday operations. Once the volume of the DR reaches a certain threshold, the effect of the DR events on the distribution and transmission system operations will be hard to ignore. This paper proposes changing the business process of DR scheduling and implementation by integrating DR with distribution grid topology. Study cases using OATI webDistribute show the potential DR effect on distribution grid operations and the distribution grid changing the effectiveness of the DR. These examples illustrate the need of integrating demand response with the distribution grid.

Abstract: Catastrophe precursors are essential prerequisites for response-based remedial action schemes, at both the protective and the operator levels. In this paper, wide-area-severity indices (WASI) derived from PMU measurements serve as the basis for building fast catastrophe predictors using random-forest (RF) learning. Given the randomness in the ensemble of decision trees (DTs) stacked in the RF model, it can provide at the recall stage not only an early assessment of the stable/unstable status of an ongoing contingency but also a probability outcome which quantifies the confidence level of the decision. This methodology, which to the best of our knowledge is new to the dynamic security assessment (DSA) of power systems, is also very effective in evaluating the importance of and interaction among the various WASI input features. Our research unexpectedly showed that the ensemble of trees in the RF is very robust in the presence of small changes in the training data and generalize across widely different network dynamics. Thus, the same RF performed very well on a large database with more than 60 000 instances from a test system (10%) and an actual (90%) system combined. One such a general RF (with 210 trees) boosted the reliability of a 9-cycle catastrophe predictor to 99.9%, compared to only 70% when a single conventionally trained DT is used.

Abstract: Recently, smart grids are attracting attention. Already, a smart grid based on an ac grid is proposed. However, no study on research is presented or published on a smart grid based on a dc grid. This paper presents an ac/dc hybrid smart power system. The proposed system has advantages of both dc and ac grids. The proposed power system consists of a wind generator and several controllable loads. The controllable loads have different capacities. Therefore, by applying power consumption control with the droop characteristic, the dc bus voltage is maintained within the acceptable range. As controllable loads, electric water heater and electric vehicle are assumed. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulation results.

Abstract: Load curve data refers to the electric energy consumption recorded by meters at certain time intervals at delivery points or end user points, and contains vital information for day-to-day operations, system analysis, system visualization, system reliability performance, energy saving and adequacy in system planning. Unfortunately, it is unavoidable that load curves contain corrupted data and missing data due to various random failure factors in meters and transfer processes. This paper presents the B-Spline smoothing and Kernel smoothing based techniques to automatically cleanse corrupted and missing data. In implementation, a man-machine dialogue procedure is proposed to enhance the performance. The experiment results on the real British Columbia Transmission Corporation (BCTC) load curve data demonstrated the effectiveness of the presented solution.

Abstract: The implementation of highly realistic real-time, massive, online, multi-time frame simulations is proposed as a means for building a common vision of smart grid functions among politicians, regulators, managers, operators, engineers, and technicians. These massive simulations will include hundreds of participants that play roles of reliability coordinators, transmission operators, distribution operators, power plant operators, and substation operators. These highly visible drills can demonstrate how the new smart grid systems, people, and processes can all work together economically and reliably. The industry, especially smart grid system designers, can get feedback from low cost, safe, and easily configurable simulations instead of waiting for expensive and hardwired deployments. Direct load control of millions of customer appliances is identified as a silver bullet to build self-healing and maximal flow smart grids that can accommodate large penetrations of intermittent wind and solar generation and rapid load growth due to plug-in electric vehicles. The paper recommends that up to 50% of load be controlled with minimal inconvenience to customers to potentially enhance angle, voltage, frequency, and thermal stability. An expert operator decision model is described with a view to helping system developers build operator-centered and friendly smart grid control systems.

Abstract: We describe algorithmic enhancements to a decision-support tool that residential consumers can utilize to optimize their acquisition of electrical energy services. The decision-support tool optimizes energy services provision by enabling end users to first assign values to desired energy services, and then scheduling their available distributed energy resources (DER) to maximize net benefits. We chose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near-optimal schedules within manageable computation times. We improve the basic formulation of cooperative PSO by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles. The improved DER schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated DER scheduling. This is computed by comparing the end-user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all DER, against the costs when each DER schedule is solved separately. This comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs, available DER and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem, or instead, decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations.

Abstract: In industrial applications, a feedback loop is used in order to transmit control and diagnostic informations from the motor back to the inverter. The implementation of such feedback loop requires the use of extra cabling between both sides and that may have length exceeding few hundred meters. In this paper, the motor feeder cable is used for data transmission instead of the separated extra cable by using the power line communication (PLC) technology. However, beside the fact that feeder cables are not designed for data transmission, they are also polluted by the inverter's outcome. Therefore, PLC modems developed for domestic applications may not be suitable. The aim of this study is to underline the possibility of communicating in such an environment. Limitations and difficulties that obstruct transmission are revealed. Also, possible solutions are discussed such as the use of a pulsewidth modulation filter in mean to overcome those limitations.

Abstract: Real-time electricity pricing models can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages compared to the current common flat rates. In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios. Therefore, the deployment of the proposed optimal energy consumption scheduling schemes is beneficial for both end users and utility companies.

Abstract: A modern power grid needs to become smarter in order to provide an affordable, reliable, and sustainable supply of electricity. For these reasons, considerable activity has been carried out in the United States and Europe to formulate and promote a vision for the development of future smart power grids. However, the majority of these activities emphasized only the distribution grid and demand side leaving the big picture of the transmission grid in the context of smart grids unclear. This paper presents a unique vision for the future of smart transmission grids in which their major features are identified. In this vision, each smart transmission grid is regarded as an integrated system that functionally consists of three interactive, smart components, i.e., smart control centers, smart transmission networks, and smart substations. The features and functions of each of the three functional components, as well as the enabling technologies to achieve these features and functions, are discussed in detail in the paper.

Abstract: Existing and forthcoming devices at the residential level have the ability to provide reactive power support. Inverters which connect distributed generation such as solar panels and pluggable hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to the grid are an example. Such devices are not currently utilized by the power system. We investigate the integration of these end-user reactive-power-capable devices to provide voltage support to the grid via a secure communications infrastructure. We determine effective locations in the transmission system and show how reactive power resources connected at those buses can be controlled. Buses belong to reactive support groups which parallel the regions of the secure communications architecture that is presented. Ultimately, our goal is to present how the smart grid can enable the utilization of available end-user devices as a resource to mitigate power system problems such as voltage collapse.

Abstract: Increasing complexity of power grids, growing demand, and requirement for greater reliability, security and efficiency as well as environmental and energy sustainability concerns continue to highlight the need for a quantum leap in harnessing communication and information technologies. This leap toward a "smarter" grid is widely referred to as "smart grid." A framework for cohesive integration of these technologies facilitates convergence of acutely needed standards, and implementation of necessary analytical capabilities. This paper critically reviews the reliability impacts of major smart grid resources such as renewables, demand response, and storage. We observe that an ideal mix of these resources leads to a flatter net demand that eventually accentuates reliability challenges further. A gridwide IT architectural framework is presented to meet these challenges while facilitating modern cybersecurity measures. This architecture supports a multitude of geographically and temporally coordinated hierarchical monitoring and control actions over time scales from milliseconds and up.

Abstract: There is virtually universal agreement that it is necessary to upgrade the electric grid to increase overall system efficiency and reliability. Much of the technology currently in use by the grid is outdated and in many cases unreliable. There have been three major blackouts in the past ten years. The reliance on old technology leads to inefficient systems, costing unnecessary money to the utilities, consumers, and taxpayers. To upgrade the grid, and to operate an improved grid, will require significant dependence on distributed intelligence and broadband communication capabilities. The access and communications capabilities require the latest in proven security technology for extremely large, wide-area communications networks. This paper discusses key security technologies for a smart grid system, including public key infrastructures and trusted computing.

Abstract: Recently, many utility companies have been adding synchrophasor measurement capability to their systems. Synchrophasors can provide operators with additional information about current system state, and can be used to improve the accuracy of state estimation. Currently, many transmission operators do not have the ability to process, store, and utilize the data from their own phasor measurement units (PMUs) locally; instead, they rely on larger data concentrators located elsewhere. We present a design for a phasor system, called the flexible integrated phasor system (FIPS), to provide a more flexible, lower cost alternative to provide independent system operators and transmission owners ready access to their phasor data. This provides a robust foundation for a variety of smart applications.

Abstract: In order to design an efficient communication scheme and examine the efficiency of any networked control architecture in smart grid applications, we need to characterize statistically its information source, namely the power grid itself. Investigating the statistical properties of power grids has the immediate benefit of providing a natural simulation platform, producing a large number of power grid test cases with realistic topologies, with scalable network size, and with realistic electrical parameter settings. The second benefit is that one can start analyzing the performance of decentralized control algorithms over information networks whose topology matches that of the underlying power network and use network scientific approaches to determine analytically if these architectures would scale well. With these motivations, in this paper we study both the topological and electrical characteristics of power grid networks based on a number of synthetic and real-world power systems. The most interesting discoveries include: the power grid is sparsely connected with obvious small-world properties; its nodal degree distribution can be well fitted by a mixture distribution coming from the sum of a truncated geometric random variable and an irregular discrete random variable; the power grid has very distinctive graph spectral density and its algebraic connectivity scales as a power function of the network size; the line impedance has a heavy-tailed distribution, which can be captured quite accurately by a clipped double Pareto lognormal distribution. Based on the discoveries mentioned above, we propose an algorithm that generates random topology power grids featuring the same topology and electrical characteristics found from the real data.

Abstract: In September 2001, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored a workshop to develop a roadmap on communication and control technologies for distributed energy resources. From this and subsequent activities with industry, academia, and other research institutions, the concepts and vision of an interactive and adaptable electricity system emerged; a vision that is now commonly referred to as smart grid. Supported by significant federal investment announced in 2009, the DOE, its national laboratories, and industry partners are now making significant strides in smart grid deployments, demonstrations, and research. An imperative underlying these activities is that they contribute to ensuring the steps taken in transitioning toward a smart grid retain a system with dependable performance to the economy and society it services. This paper summarizes the status of current smart grid related efforts, explains smart grid priorities, and describes the direction of research and development activities supported by the DOE.

Abstract: For vehicle-to-grid (V2G) frequency regulation services, we propose an aggregator that makes efficient use of the distributed power of electric vehicles to produce the desired grid-scale power. The cost arising from the battery charging and the revenue obtained by providing the regulation are investigated and represented mathematically. Some design considerations of the aggregator are also discussed together with practical constraints such as the energy restriction of the batteries. The cost function with constraints enables us to construct an optimization problem. Based on the developed optimization problem, we apply the dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal charging control for each vehicle. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the optimality of the proposed charging control strategy with variations of parameters.

Abstract: In this paper we assume that time synchronized measurements will be ubiquitously available at all high-voltage substations at very high rates. We examine how this information can be utilized more effectively for real-time operation as well as for subsequent decision making. This new information available in real time is different, both in quality and in quantity, than the real-time measurements available today. The promise of new and improved applications to operate the power system more reliably and efficiently has been recognized but is still in conceptual stages. Also, the present system to handle this real-time data has been recognized to be inadequate but even conceptual designs of such infrastructure needed to store and communicate the data are in their infancy. In this paper, we first suggest the requirements for an information infrastructure to handle ubiquitous phasor measurements recognizing that the quantity and rate of data would make it impossible to store all the data centrally as done today. Then we discuss the new and improved applications, classified into two categories: one is the set of automatic wide-area controls and the other is the set of control center (EMS) functions with special attention to the state estimator. Finally, given that the availability of phasor measurements will grow over time, the path for smooth transition from present-day systems and applications to those discussed here is delineated.

Abstract: Demand response (DR), distributed generation (DG), and distributed energy storage (DES) are important ingredients of the emerging smart grid paradigm. For ease of reference we refer to these resources collectively as distributed energy resources (DER). Although much of the DER emerging under smart grid are targeted at the distribution level, DER, and more specifically DR resources, are considered important elements for reliable and economic operation of the transmission system and the wholesale markets. In fact, viewed from transmission and wholesale operations, sometimes the term "virtual power plant" is used to refer to these resources. In the context of energy and ancillary service markets facilitated by the independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission organizations (RTOs), the market products DER/DR can offer may include energy, ancillary services, and/or capacity, depending on the ISO/RTO market design and applicable operational standards. In this paper we first explore the main industry drivers of smart grid and the different facets of DER under the smart grid paradigm. We then concentrate on DR and summarize the existing and evolving programs at different ISOs/RTOs and the product markets they can participate in. We conclude by addressing some of the challenges and potential solutions for implementation of DR under smart grid and market paradigms.

Abstract: Certain smart grid technologies can reduce the number of customers affected by prolonged outages, and thereby increase reliability through automated switching to restore service. Such technologies are useful, but reactive in nature, performing their function only after a fault occurs and an outage has been detected. They must presume that nonfaulted feeder sections and alternative feeders are healthy and capable of carrying increased power flow. Research at Texas A&M University has demonstrated that sophisticated, automated real-time analysis of feeder electrical waveforms can be used to predict failures and assess the health of distribution lines and line apparatus. Reliability can be substantially improved by detecting, locating, and repairing incipient failures before catastrophic failure, often before an outage occurs. Requirements for data and computation are substantially greater than for devices like digital relays and power-quality meters, but feasible with modern electronics. This paper provides selected examples of failures that have been predicted by intelligent distribution fault anticipation (DFA) algorithms. The data requirements and processing analysis to detect these failures are discussed. The problems related to full-scale deployment of the proposed system in a utility-wide application are presented. The authors use experience gained from their long-term research to propose concepts for overcoming these impediments.

Abstract: Considerable developments in the real-time telemetry of demand-side systems allow independent system operators (ISOs) to use reserves provided by demand response (DR) in ancillary service markets. Currently, many ISOs have designed programs to utilize the reserve provided by DR in electricity markets. This paper presents a stochastic model to schedule reserves provided by DR in the wholesale electricity markets. Demand-side reserve is supplied by demand response providers (DRPs), which have the responsibility of aggregating and managing customer responses. A mixed-integer representation of reserve provided by DRPs and its associated cost function are used in the proposed stochastic model. The proposed stochastic model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) problem. The first-stage involves network-constrained unit commitment in the base case and the second-stage investigates security assurance in system scenarios. The proposed model would schedule reserves provided by DRPs and determine commitment states of generating units and their scheduled energy and spinning reserves in the scheduling horizon. The proposed approach is applied to two test systems to illustrate the benefits of implementing demand-side reserve in electricity markets.

Abstract: Synchronized phasor measurements have become a mature technology with several international manufacturers offering commercial phasor measurement units (PMUs) which meet the prevailing industry standard for synchrophasors. With the occurrence of major blackouts in many power systems around the world, the value of data provided by PMUs has been recognized, and installation of PMUs on power transmission networks of most major power systems has become an important current activity. This paper provides a brief introduction to the PMU and wide-area measurement system (WAMS) technology and discusses the uses of these measurements for improved monitoring, protection, and control of power networks.
