3,,"In order to ensure the reliable operation of the electric power grid, infrastructure with increasing levels of distributed generation deployment, various entities and subsystems (e.g., ISOs, distribution utilities, micro-grids) needs a higher level coordination. Such coordination requires a formal decentralized control and management architecture that creates mechanisms for the operation and planning of numerous entities. A key function in power system operations and planning is the determination of total transfer capability (TTC), or the maximum amount of power that can be transferred from a set of source points to a set of sink points. This paper develops an algorithm for the decentralized computation of TTC through the application of the domain decomposition method (DDM). DDM decouples the correlation among interconnected control areas by taking advantage of the Schur complement matrix to form the power transfer distribution factor matrix. The decentralized TTC evaluation requires sparse information exchange among control areas. It is efficient and fully parallelizable. We demonstrate the decentralized TTC evaluation method on the IEEE 118-bus test case.",WOS:000382477600002,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Zhang, X.

4,,"The Holomorphic Embedding Load-Flow Method (HELM) solves the power-flow problem to obtain the bus voltages as rational approximants, that is, a ratio of complex-valued polynomials of the embedding parameter. The proof of its claims (namely that: 1) it is guaranteed to find a solution if it exists; 2) it is guaranteed to find only a high-voltage (operable) solution; and 3) that it unequivocally signals if no solution exists) are rooted in complex analysis and the theory developed by Antonio Trias and Herbert Stahl. HELM is one variant of the holomorphic embedding method (HEM) for solving nonlinear equations, the details of which may differ from those available in its published patents. In this paper we show that the HEM represents a distinct class of nonlinear equation solvers that are recursive, rather than iterative. As such, for any given problem, there are an infinite number of HEM formulations, each with different numerical properties and precision demands. The objective of this paper is to provide an intuitive understanding of HEM and apply one variant to the power-flow problem. We introduce one possible PV bus model compatible with the HEM and examine some features of different holomorphic embeddings, giving step-by-step details of model building, germ calculation, and the recursive algorithm.",WOS:000382477600046,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Rao, S., Feng, Y., Tylavsky, D.

6,,"This paper presents tighter formulations and dynamic global cutting plane solution approaches for accelerating network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problems, as the computational bottleneck of NCUC problems is always a concern to independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission owners (RTOs). Specifically, this paper explores tighter mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based NCUC formulations, via locally ideal reformulation for piece-wise linear cost functions of generators and valid cover inequalities by linking system load balance/power flow constraints with generation capacity limits. The paper also discusses an enhanced solution approach by dynamically generating global cutting planes at infeasible/sub-optimal nodes of the branch-and-cut (BAC) tree, which would prevent similar infeasible/suboptimal nodes from being explored repeatedly. Since the major computational complexity of NCUC is caused by the large number of binary UC variables, the proposed strategies, being directly related to binary UC variables, could quickly identify infeasible/suboptimal binary solutions, reduce the search space in the BAC tree, and in turn improve the computational performance. Numerical case studies show that the proposed approach could significantly reduce the overall computational time as compared to the traditional NCUC approach.",WOS:000382477600072,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Wu, L.","Clarkson Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA",30,10.1109/Tpwrs.2015.2502594,Sep,0885-8950,5,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,branch-and-cut,locally ideal formulation,ncuc,constrained unit commitment,lagrangian-relaxation,market,scuc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Du8qb,,4097-4107,5727,Journal Article,,,Accelerating NCUC Via Binary Variable-Based Locally Ideal Formulation and Dynamic Global Cuts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Accelerating NCUC Via Binary Variable-Based Locally Ideal Formulation and Dynamic Global Cuts,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000382477600072,31,,,2016,,Clarkson Univ,USA
20,,"Optimal Power Flow (OPF) dispatches controllable generation at minimum cost subject to operational constraints on generation and transmission assets. The uncertainty and variability of intermittent renewable generation is challenging current deterministic OPF approaches. Recent formulations of OPF use chance constraints to limit the risk from renewable generation uncertainty, however, these new approaches typically assume the probability distributions which characterize the uncertainty and variability are known exactly. We formulate a robust chance constrained (RCC) OPF that accounts for uncertainty in the parameters of these probability distributions by allowing them to be within an uncertainty set. The RCC OPF is solved using a cutting-plane algorithm that scales to large power systems. We demonstrate the RRC OPF on a modified model of the Bonneville Power Administration network, which includes 2209 buses and 176 controllable generators. Deterministic, chance constrained (CC), and RCC OPF formulations are compared using several metrics including cost of generation, area control error, ramping of controllable generators, and occurrence of transmission line overloads as well as the respective computational performance.",WOS:000382477600048,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Lubin, M., Dvorkin, Y. and Backhaus, S.","MIT, Ctr Operat Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",44,10.1109/Tpwrs.2015.2499753,Sep,0885-8950,5,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,chance constrained optimization,distributionally robust optimization,optimal power flow,optimization methods,power system economics,wind power integration,wind power uncertainty,wind power variability,unit commitment,systems,approximations,optimization,uncertainty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Du8qb,,3840-3849,5741,Journal Article,,,A Robust Approach to Chance Constrained Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,A Robust Approach to Chance Constrained Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Generation,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000382477600048,31,,,2016,,MIT,USA

Credibility of the multiple hypotheses is determined using the available evidence from these devices. The proposed methodology is able to handle i) multiple faults, ii) protection miscoordination, and iii) missing outage reports from smart meters and fault indicators.

31,,"High penetration of distributed energy resources presents several challenges and opportunities for voltage regulation in power distribution systems. A local reactive power (VAR) control framework will be developed that can fast respond to voltage mismatch and address the robustness issues of (de-)centralized approaches against communication delays and noises. Using local bus voltage measurements, the proposed gradient-projection based schemes explicitly account for the VAR limit of every bus, and are proven convergent to a surrogate centralized problem with proper parameter choices. This optimality result quantifies the capability of local VAR control without requiring any real-time communications. The proposed framework and analysis generalize earlier results on the droop VAR control design, which may suffer from under-utilization of VAR resources in order to ensure stability.

Recently, worst scenario based robust optimization approaches are employed to consider uncertainties. This paper proposes a non-conservative robust SCUC model and an effective solution approach. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, the commitment and dispatch solution obtained in this paper can be directly used in day-ahead market as it overcomes two issues, conservativeness and absence of robust dispatch, which are the two largest obstacles to applying robust SCUC in real markets. Secondly, a new concept recourse cost requirement, similar to reserve requirement, is proposed to define the upper bound of re-dispatch cost when uncertainties are revealed. Thirdly, a novel decomposition approach is proposed to effectively address the well-known computational challenge in robust approaches.

51,,"Traditionally, electric system operators have dispatched generation to minimize total production costs, ignoring the flexibility of the transmission system. Implementation of smart-grid systems could allow operators to co-optimize flexible transmission alongside generation dispatch; the technologies that would enable such co-optimization are still regulated as part of the monopoly transmission system. One particular flexible transmission asset is variable impedance flexible AC transmission system (FACTS). This paper 1) points out the positive externality problem existing in a recent market design proposal with active transmission participation, and 2) proposes a sensitivity-based method to estimate the marginal market value of FACTS adjustments to overcome this positive externality problem. The marginal value would suggest efficient impedance adjustments to the operator and provide the right financial incentives for the FACTS owners to operate their assets in a socially optimal way. Revenue adequacy is demonstrated under specific conditions and more broadly investigated through simulation studies. An analytical example on a two-bus system as well as a numerical study on the IEEE 118-bus system are presented.

Next, we use the BA area model to design an adaptive automatic generation control (AGC) scheme, with self-tuning gain, that decreases the amount of regulation needed and potentially reduces the associated costs. In particular, we use the BA area model to derive a relationship between the actual frequency response characteristic (AFRC) of the BA area, the area control error, the system frequency, and the total generation. We make use of this relationship to estimate the AFRC online, and set the frequency bias factor equal to the online estimation. As a result, the AGC system is driven by the exact number of MW needed to restore the system frequency and the real power interchange to the desired values.

57,,"The increased level of demand that is associated with the restoration of service after an outage, Cold Load Pick-Up (CLPU), can be significantly higher than pre-outage levels, even exceeding the normal distribution feeder peak demand. These high levels of demand can delay restoration efforts and in extreme cases damage equipment. The negative impacts of CLPU can be mitigated with strategies that restore the feeder in sections, minimizing the load current. The challenge for utilities is to manage the current level on critical equipment while minimizing the time to restore service to all customers. Accurately modeling CLPU events is the first step in developing improved restoration strategies that minimize restoration times.

60,,"We consider the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem, formulated as a nonconvex Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) with complex variables. ACOPF may be solved to global optimality with a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation in cases where its QCQP formulation attains zero duality gap. However, when there is positive duality gap, no optimal solution to the SDP relaxation is feasible for ACOPF. One way to find a global optimum is to partition the problem using a spatial branch-and-bound method. Tightening upper and lower variable bounds can improve solution times in spatial branching by potentially reducing the number of partitions needed. We propose special-purpose closed-form bound tightening methods to tighten limits on nodal powers, line flows, phase angle differences, and voltage magnitudes.

This paper presents a fully parallel stochastic SCUC approach to obtain an efficient and fast solution for a large-scale power system with wind energy uncertainty. Variables duplication and auxiliary problem principle (APP) techniques are adopted to fully decompose the original stochastic optimization problem into three major solution modules: the unit commitment (UC) module solves multiple single UC problems; the optimal power flow (OPF) module handles multiple hourly DC-OPF problems; and the bridge module builds a connection between the UC and OPF modules. These three modules are conducted for both base case and scenarios, and can be totally solved in a parallel manner. Numerical case studies on a modified IEEE 118-bus system and a practical 1168-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach which will offer the power system a secure and economic operation under various uncertainties.",WOS:000382477600021,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Wang, C.

However, the issue of multiple solutions in DCOPF, which is a tool used in the existing OPA risk assessment models and a linear programming (LP) problem, has not been considered. In this letter, we show that the risk may be seriously under-estimated if we do not consider the existence of multiple solutions. The risk is evaluated by generating two dispatch plans based on a bilevel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for DCOPF.

It is demonstrated that the LFAC is superior to the conventional 60 Hz AC system in terms of power transfer capability and voltage stability. An existing power system can increase its power transfer capability by up to more than eleven times if it operates at 5 Hz. In low operating frequency conditions, the transmission overhead line reactance is significantly lowered and thus results in less voltage drop along the line. If the system operating frequency is in the range of 1 to 10 Hz, the voltage profile along a transmission line is comparable to the surge impedance loading at the no-load condition or approaches that of the HVDC system at the full-load condition. More importantly, the V-P and Q-V characteristic curves show that the dependency of voltage on the real and reactive power flow is greatly reduced. In other words, the sensitivity of voltage on reactive power variations is diminished and results in a more stable voltage and a higher stability margin for the LFAC system compared to the conventional 60 Hz system.",WOS:000382477600051,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Ngo, T., Lwin, M. and Santoso, S.","Univ Texas Austin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Austin, TX 78701 USA",17,10.1109/Tpwrs.2015.2502139,Sep,0885-8950,5,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,low frequency ac (lfac) transmission,skin effect,voltage stability margin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Du8qb,,3873-3880,5785,Journal Article,,,Steady-State Analysis and Performance of Low Frequency AC Transmission Lines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Steady-State Analysis and Performance of Low Frequency AC Transmission Lines,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000382477600051,31,,,2016,,Univ Texas Austin,USA

70,,"This paper presents a new method for short-term nodal voltage phasor forecasting in power systems to which a large number of renewable resources and microgrids are connected. Its motivation stems from the observation that such systems are characterized by an unconventional topology along with the presence of a number of buses with bursty power injection patterns, which in turn significantly impacts the temporal and spatial correlation of the nodal voltage phasors. Simulation results carried out on three IEEE test systems reveal that this new pattern affects the number of dominant buses, termed electrical hubs, and, subsequently, the time and spatial correlation among nodal voltage angles. They also reveal that the nodal voltage magnitudes exhibit time correlation, but no spatial correlation. In this paper, time series are represented by autoregressive (AR) processes while multivariate time series with spatial correlation are represented by vector autoregressive (VAR) processes. Statistical tests show that an order one for both models is adequate. The non-zero parameters of the VAR(1) models are identified using metrics on electrical connectivity, centrality, and node significance. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-, 118-, and 300-bus test systems in presence of large-scale distributed wind farms and microgrids, and under loss of system observability.",WOS:000382477600052,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Hassanzadeh, M., Evrenosoglu, C.

Augmenting conventional utility-owned voltage regulating equipment with the reactive power capabilities of distributed generation units is a viable solution. Local control options attaining global voltage regulation optimality at fast convergence rates is the goal here. In this context, novel reactive power control rules are analyzed under a unifying linearized grid model. For single-phase grids, our proximal gradient scheme has computational complexity comparable to that of the rule suggested by the IEEE 1547.8 standard, but it enjoys well-characterized convergence guarantees. Furthermore, adding memory to the scheme results in accelerated convergence. For three-phase grids, it is shown that reactive power injections have a counter-intuitive effect on bus voltage magnitudes across phases. Nevertheless, when our control scheme is applied to unbalanced conditions, it is shown to reach an equilibrium point.

The existing methods to design control gains for proportional-integral (PI) controllers in AGC are either time consuming or easily affected by the designer's experience. Further, the control gains are usually designed with fixed values for specific scenarios in the studied power system. The desired response may not be achieved when variable wind power is integrated into power systems. To address these challenges, a dynamic gain tuning control (DGTC) method for AGC is proposed in this paper. By the proposed control method, PI control gains can be dynamically adjusted to reach the desired performance. The proposed method is tested in a modified IEEE 39 bus system with actual wind data, and compared with conventional control approach with well-tuned fixed gains in the simulation.

The real-time SCED is a widely used market scheduling tool that seeks to economically balance electricity supply and demand and provide locational marginal prices (LMPs), while ensuring system reliability standards are met. To capture network flows and security considerations, the conventional SCED formulation relies on sensitivities that are typically computed from a linearized power flow model, which is vulnerable to phenomena such as undetected topology changes, changes in the system operating point, and the existence of incorrect model data. Our approach to the formulation of the SCED problem utilizes power system sensitivities estimated from phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. The resulting measurement-based real-time SCED is robust against the aforementioned phenomena. Moreover, the dispatch instructions and LMPs calculated with the proposed measurement-based SCED accurately reflect real-time system conditions and security needs.

This problem can be resolved by allowing students to assemble their setups using laboratory scaled-down devices; however, implementation times can limit students to focus on the main concepts of the experiments. In particular, lacking experience with hardware description languages to develop switching patterns and control schemes for solid-state based converters further increases the implementation times.

102,,"Electric power systems can display a range of undesirable dynamic phenomena by which acceptable, stable operation may be lost. Quasi-steady-state operational problems such as the voltage instability phenomena are among these. Ill-conditioning of the power flow, reflected in high sensitivity of bus voltage magnitudes to load variation is an often observed precursor to such quasi-steady state operational problems. Motivated by this insight, work here will propose a voltage stability and conditioning monitor that is model-free in real-time, based solely on phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, arguing that such an approach is well suited to near-real-time application. We review model-dependent singular value analysis in voltage stability assessment, and relate these existing approaches to our proposed model-free method in real-time application. The proposed algorithm is first applied under the idealized assumption of full measurement data at all buses.

113,,"Reliable and economic deployment of a generation fleet to satisfy demand is a complex problem. Independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission operators (RTOs) solve complex unit commitment and economic dispatch models to determine appropriate resources to deploy at various time stages. Due to the complexity of power systems, several approximations are made within optimization models, including approximations of the transmission network with a linearized formulation known as the direct current optimal power flow (DCOPF) instead of the more realistic formulation known as the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF). Furthermore, approximations occur in these models by relaxing specific constraints in the model, i.e., the constraint is allowed to be violated based on a predetermined penalty price. By doing so, the ISO/RTO receives several benefits, including the ability to manage prices, clear the market, as well as the potential to obtain gains in social welfare (market surplus).

118,,"In the distribution management system (DMS), an essential application for the energy efficiency improvement is loss reduction. Loss reduction often involves the control of reactive power (var) resources to optimize the var flow in the network. Traditionally, most available var resources in the distribution network have been switchable shunt capacitor banks. Today distributed energy resources (DER) are becoming another significant var resource due to their increasing penetration, which brings new opportunities as well as challenges for loss reduction. This paper proposes an advanced loss reduction approach to achieve the optimal control coordination among multiple capacitors and DERs. The proposed approach and solution are developed on the basis of the detailed multi-phase distribution network modeling and the state-of-the-art optimization technology. This work also investigates the impact of the DER var control on the loss reduction improvement and voltage violation correction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on practical utility distribution circuits with varying degree of unbalance and model complexity.

119,,"Reserve requirements serve as a proxy for N-1 reliability in the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, there is no guarantee that the reserve is deliverable for all scenarios (post-contingency states). One cheap way to improve reserve deliverability is to harness the flexibility of the transmission network. Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices are able to significantly improve the transfer capability. However, FACTS utilization is limited today due to the complexities these devices introduce to the DC optimal power flow problem (DCOPF). With a linear objective, the traditional DCOPF is a linear program (LP); when variable impedance based FACTS devices are taken into consideration, the problem becomes a nonlinear program (NLP). A reformulation of the NLP to a mixed integer linear program, for day-ahead corrective operation of FACTS devices, is presented in this paper. Engineering insight is then introduced to further reduce the complexity to an LP. Although optimality is not guaranteed, the simulation studies on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the method finds the globally optimal solution in 98.8% of the cases. Even when the method did not find the optimal solution, it was able to converge to a near-optimal solution, which substantially improved the reliability, very quickly.",WOS:000375774200033,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Sahraei-Ardakani, M. and Hedman, K.

121,,"Considering recent development of deregulated energy markets and the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, it is important for power system operators to ensure cost effectiveness while maintaining the system reliability. To achieve this goal, significant research progress has recently been made to develop stochastic optimization models and solution methods to improve reliability unit commitment run practice, which is used in the day-ahead market for ISOs/RTOs to ensure sufficient generation capacity available in real time to accommodate uncertainties. Most stochastic optimization approaches assume the renewable energy generation amounts follow certain distributions. However, in practice, the distributions are unknown and instead, a certain amount of historical data are available. In this research, we propose a data-driven risk-averse stochastic unit commitment model, where risk aversion stems from the worst-case probability distribution of the renewable energy generation amount, and develop the corresponding solution methods to solve the problem. Given a set of historical data, our proposed approach first constructs a confidence set for the distributions of the uncertain parameters using statistical inference and solves the corresponding risk-averse stochastic unit commitment problem. Then, we show that the conservativeness of the proposed stochastic program vanishes as the number of historical data increases to infinity. Finally, the computational results numerically show how the risk-averse stochastic unit commitment problem converges to the risk-neutral one, which indicates the value of data.",WOS:000375774200009,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Zhao, C.

The model is simple, yet still sufficiently comprehensive to analyze the operational characteristics of the VSHP. The DLC scheme is then experimentally applied to the VSHP to evaluate its demand response (DR) capability. Two control methods are considered for a practical implementation of the DLC-enabled VSHP and a further improvement of the DR capability, respectively. Additionally, a small-signal analysis is carried out using the aggregated dynamic response of a number of DLC-enabled VSHPs to analyze their contribution to GFR in an isolated power grid.

The main contribution is the way fault location is reformulated as a sparse estimation problem. Faulted system is modeled by equivalent terminal bus injections which would cause the same changes in bus voltages with the fault current drawn at any point along the faulted line. Once these injections are estimated, the fact that the ratio between equivalent injections at the two terminal buses depends only on the ratio of serial impedances on each side of the fault point can be used to locate the fault. It is shown that this formulation applies to both two terminal lines as well as teed lines regardless of fault type or resistance. Assuming availability of an accurate three-phase network model and a sufficient number of phasor measurements over the entire network, an underdetermined set of linear equations can be formed and then solved for the sparse equivalent bus injections.

A new EMT-TS hybrid simulation platform, which integrates PSCAD/EMTDC and the open source power system simulation software InterPSS has been developed. A combined interaction protocol with an automatic protocol switching control scheme is proposed. A multi-port three-phase Thevenin equivalent is developed for representing an external network in an EMT simulator. Correspondingly, the external network is represented in three-sequence, and a three-sequence TS simulation algorithm is developed. These techniques allow simulation of unsymmetrical faults within the internal network without the constraint of phase balance at the boundary. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is first tested on the IEEE 9-bus system. Subsequently, the proposed hybrid simulation approach is applied to a detailed FIDVR study on a large WECC system. The study shows that a normally cleared single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault in the transmission system could lead to an FIDVR event, with compressor motors of the air conditioning units on the faulted phases stalling first, followed by a propagation of motor stalling to the unfaulted phase. Moreover, similar events are observed in simulations with a wide range of load compositions.

Effective forecasting is important for the planning and operation of distribution systems. The problem, however, is difficult in view of complicated load features, the large number of distribution-level nodes, and possible switching operations. In this paper, a new forecasting approach within the hierarchical structure is presented to solve these difficulties. Load of the root node at any user-defined subtree is first forecast by a wavelet neural network with appropriate inputs. Child nodes categorized as ""regular"" and ""irregular"" based on load pattern similarities are then forecast separately. Load of a regular child node is simply forecast as the proportion from the parent node load forecast while the load of an irregular child node is forecast by an individual neural network model. Switching operation detection and follow-up adjustments are also performed to capture abnormal changes and improve the forecasting accuracy. This new approach captures load characteristics of nodes at different levels, takes advantage of pattern similarities between a parent node and its child nodes, detects abnormalities, and provides high quality forecasts as demonstrated by two practical datasets.",WOS:000375774200003,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Sun, X.

We specifically investigate the approximation error made in mapping of the original problem, that would decide the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories of the committed generating units, onto the discrete-time problem that is solved in practice. We first show that current practice amounts to approximating the trajectories with linear splines. We then offer a different representation through cubic splines that provides physically feasible schedules and increases the accuracy of the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories by capturing sub-hourly variations and ramping of load in the day-ahead power system operation. The corresponding day-ahead UC model is formulated as an instance of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), with the same number of binary variables as the traditional UC formulation.

For the case when the network is balanced, we use the branch power flow modeling approach for radial power systems to formulate an optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Then, we leverage properties of the system operating conditions to relax certain nonlinear terms of this OPF, which results in a convex quadratic program (QP). To efficiently solve this QP, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

162,,"In this paper, we introduce an approach for a fast assessment of the dynamic characteristics of system frequency during the period of cold load pickup following a large-scale blackout. The approach is developed based on a load model and a model of generation control system: the load model considers the unique time-dependent characteristic of inrush power surges during the period of cold load pickup, while the model of generation control system mimics the characteristics of various governors that are crucial to the determination of the key variables including initial rate of frequency change, frequency nadir and settling frequency. With the proposed linearization and estimation methods, the model of generation control system can be quickly constructed to offer a great amount of flexibility and simplicity for the study of the impact of cold load on frequency response. The proposed approach allows system operators to quickly evaluate many different options for system restoration. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system. The differences between the results obtained using the proposed approach and those obtained from complete PSS/E simulation are very small, which suggests that the linearized model of generation control system is fast, and accurate enough to address the major concerns of cold load pickup in system restoration.",WOS:000375774200071,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Medina, D.

171,,"In this paper, we propose a method for N - 1 contingency constrained transmission capacity expansion planning (TCEP), which is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. In relatively well-designed power systems, a single outage of a majority of lines will not usually cause overload on other lines in most loading conditions. Thus they will not affect the feasible region and the optimal answer of the TCEP optimization problem, and can be safely removed from contingency analysis if we can identify them. A contingency identification index is developed to detect these lines and create variable contingency lists (VCL) for different network loading conditions. In our proposed method, we use results of a relaxed version of the original problem as a lower bound answer in the first step, and integrate contingencies into TCEP in the next steps to solve this optimization problem faster while still satisfying N - 1 criterion. For solving TCEP with contingencies, two options are offered, i. e., option A that uses an updated system as its base case (original existing network together with selected lines by the relaxed problem) and option B that uses the original existing network as its base case (without results of the relaxed problem). Option A is faster than option B because it usually should select fewer new lines compared to B, but cannot guarantee optimality. Option B provides the optimal answer while taking more computational time. An ERCOT case study is used to show capabilities of the proposed method for solving large scale problems, and the numerical result demonstrates this method is much faster than the integrated MIP method that directly incorporates all contingencies.",WOS:000375092200056,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Majidi-Qadikolai, M. and Baldick, R.","Univ Texas Austin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Austin, TX 78701 USA",39,10.1109/Tpwrs.2015.2443101,May,0885-8950,3,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,line outage distribution factor,mixed-integer programming,n-1 criterion,reliability,system adequacy,transmission capacity expansion planning,sensitivity-analysis,uncertainties,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Dk7gc,,2234-2245,5892,Journal Article,,,Integration N-1 of Contingency Analysis With Systematic Transmission Capacity Expansion Planning: ERCOT Case Study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Integration N-1 of Contingency Analysis With Systematic Transmission Capacity Expansion Planning: ERCOT Case Study,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000375092200056,31,,,2016,,Univ Texas Austin,USA

The commitment of the resources, however, could be coordinated globally and frequently in accordance with the state of the system. This paper investigates the minimum cost commitment of IL resources to ensure the PFR of a system remains within specified limits. The binary integer programming problem considers the commitment cost of each IL resource and includes nonlinear frequency constraints specified by the transient stability simulation of the system. A method to estimate the contribution of an IL resource towards meeting a frequency constraint is proposed and incorporated into a solution approach that involves the iterative solving of a linear commitment problem. The sensitivity-based estimation method reduces the amount of computationally burdensome transient stability simulation required by the algorithm with little increase in the final solution cost.

182,,"Higher variable renewable generation penetrations are occurring throughout the world on different power systems. These resources increase the variability and uncertainty on the system which must be accommodated by an increase in the flexibility of the system resources in order to maintain reliability. Many scheduling strategies have been discussed and introduced to ensure that this flexibility is available at multiple timescales. To meet variability, that is, the expected changes in system conditions, two recent strategies have been introduced: time-coupled multi-period market clearing models and the incorporation of ramp capability constraints. To appropriately evaluate these methods, it is important to assess both efficiency and reliability. But it is also important to assess the incentive structure to ensure that resources asked to perform in different ways have the proper incentives to follow these directions, which is a step often ignored in simulation studies. We find that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. We also find that look-ahead horizon length in multi-period market models can impact incentives.

These renewable resources add more complexities to power system operations, due to their intermittent nature. As a result, operators must acquire additional reserves in order to maintain reliability. However, one persistent challenge is to determine the optimal location of reserves and this challenge is exacerbated by the inability to predict key transmission bottlenecks due to this added uncertainty. This paper presents robust corrective topology control as a congestion management tool to manage power flows and the associated renewable uncertainty. The proposed day-ahead method determines the maximum uncertainty in renewable resources in terms of do-not-exceed limits combined with corrective topology control. The day-ahead topology control formulation is based on the direct current optimal power flow; therefore, topology control solutions obtained from these algorithms are tested for AC feasibility and system stability.

The method operates by comparing the periodogram of synchrophasor measurements to a detection threshold. This threshold is established by deriving a general expression for the distribution of the periodogram and is related to the algorithm's probabilities of false alarm and detection. Unlike classic detection algorithms designed for use with white Gaussian noise, the proposed algorithm uses a detection threshold that varies with frequency to account for the colored nature of synchrophasor measurements. Further, a detection method based on multiple segments of data is also proposed to improve the algorithm's performance as a monitoring tool in the online environment. A design approach that helps to ensure that the best available probability of detection from any one detection segment is constantly increasing with the duration of the forced oscillation is also developed.

220,,"Transmission systems are under stress and need to be upgraded. Better utilization of the existing grid provides a fast and cheap alternative to building new transmission. One way to improve the utilization of the transmission network is power flow control via flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. While FACTS devices are used today, the utilization of these devices is limited; traditional dispatch models (e.g., security constrained economic dispatch) assume a fixed, static transmission grid even though it is rather flexible. The primary barrier is the complexity that is added to the power flow problem. The mathematical representation of the DC optimal power flow, with the added modeling of FACTS devices, is a nonlinear program (NLP). This paper presents a method to convert this NLP into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The MILP is reformulated as a two-stage linear program, which enforces the same sign for the voltage angle differences for the lines equipped with FACTS.

Details are given to utilize existing stabilizers while causing minimum changes to the equipment and warranting improvement, or at least no detriment, of current system behavior. A set of gains is designed by linear state feedback control to respond to representative system conditions, and these are coordinated with an equal number of decision trees in charge of scheduling by switching. The resulting nonlinear controller is implemented on a model that resembles the characteristics of the Central American System, exemplifying its feasibility to be applied in large systems.

233,,"Recent advancements in high-performance parallel computing platforms and parallel algorithms have significantly enhanced the opportunities for real-time power system protection and control. This paper investigates application of Parareal in time algorithm for fast dynamic simulations. Parareal algorithm belongs to the class of temporal decomposition methods which divide the time interval into sub-intervals and solve them concurrently. Time-parallel algorithms face the difficulty of providing correct initial conditions for all the sub-intervals which impact the convergence rates. Parareal overcomes this difficulty by using an approximate trajectory. It has become popular in recent years for long transient simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics, fusion, reacting flows). This paper presents an approach for reliable implementation of Parareal with detailed models of power systems including saturation. Windowing approach is proposed for improving the convergence. Parareal is compared with the Newton-based time-parallel method. Effectiveness of the algorithm is analyzed by parallel emulation using extensive case studies on 10-generator 39-bus system and 327-generator 2383-bus system for various disturbances. Parareal with simulation windows of 1 s have shown convergence in 1 to 3 iterations for majority of the simulated cases, irrespective of the size of the system and nature of the disturbance.

A risk-limiting economic dispatch scheme provides the means to optimize the dispatch and provision of these products. In this paper, we adopt the extended loss-of-load probability as the definition of risk. We first assess how the new products distort the optimal economic dispatch by comparing to the case without such products. Specifically, using parametric analysis, we establish the relationship between the minimal generation cost and the two key parameters of the new products: the up-and down-flexible ramping requirements. Such relationship yields a novel routine to efficiently solve the non-convex risk-limiting economic dispatch problem. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results suggest that our approach may substantially reduce the cost for incorporating the new products.

Understanding the relative importance of these different mechanisms is important for choosing which mechanisms need to be modeled for particular applications. This work presents a dynamic simulation model of both power networks and protection systems, which can simulate a wider variety of cascading outage mechanisms relative to existing quasi-steady-state (QSS) models. This paper describes the model and demonstrates how different mechanisms interact. In order to test the model, we simulated a batch of randomly selected contingencies for several different static load configurations, and found that the distributions of blackout sizes and event lengths from the simulator correlate well with historical trends. The results also show that load models have significant impacts on the cascading risks. Finally, the dynamic model was compared against a simple dc-power-flow based QSS model; we find that the two models tend to agree for the early stages of cascading but produce substantially different results for later stages.",WOS:000375092200041,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Song, J.

The reconfiguration problem is casted as a multi-objective optimization problem, in order to: 1) minimize the IMG fuel consumption in the operational planning horizon for which islanded operation is planned; 2) ensure the IMG capability to feed the maximum possible demand by enhancing its voltage instability proximity index taken over all the states at which the islanded system may reside; and 3) minimize the relevant switching operation costs. The proposed problem formulation takes into consideration the system's operational constraints in all operating conditions based on the consideration of the uncertainty associated with renewable resources output power and load variability. Moreover, the proposed formulation accounts for droop controlled IMG special operational characteristics as well as the availability/unavailability of a supervisory microgrid central controller (MGCC). The formulated problem is solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). MATLAB environment has been used to test and validate the proposed problem formulation.

245,,"When power grids are heavily stressed with a bulk power transfer, it is useful to have a fast indication of the increased stress when multiple line outages occur. Reducing the bulk power transfer when the outages are severe could forestall further cascading of the outages. We show that synchrophasor measurements of voltage angles at all the area tie lines can be used to indicate the severity of multiple outages. These synchrophasor measurements are readily combined into an ""area angle"" that can quickly track the severity of multiple outages after they occur. We present a procedure to define thresholds for the area angle that relate to the maximum power that can be transferred through the area until a line limit is reached. Then in real time we would monitor the area angle and compare it to the thresholds when line outages occur to determine the urgency (or not) of actions to reduce the bulk transfer of power through the area. The procedure also identifies exceptional cases in which separate actions to resolve local power distribution problems are needed.

Two fundamental sources of uncertainty are considered, namely the uncertainty in the unexpected fluctuation of the net demand process and the uncertainty in the locational marginal prices. We propose a very simple algorithm termed Online Modified Greedy (OMG) algorithm for this problem. A stylized analysis for the algorithm is performed, which shows that comparing to the optimal cost of the corresponding stochastic control problem, the sub-optimality of OMG is controlled by an easily computable bound. This suggests that, albeit simple, OMG is guaranteed to have good performance in cases when the bound is small. Meanwhile, OMG together with the sub-optimality bound can be used to provide a lower bound for the optimal cost. Such a lower bound can be valuable in evaluating other heuristic algorithms. For the latter cases, a semidefinite program is derived to minimize the sub-optimality bound of OMG.

In addition, corrective capabilities of both non-quick-start and quick-start units are rigorously formulated. Specifically, unit commitment of quick-start units is adaptively adjusted in the recourse stage for satisfying security constraints under various uncertainties, which introduces mixed-integer recourse to the proposed two-stage robust SCUC model. The proposed model is solved by the combination of modified Benders decomposition (BD) method and column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm, which decompose the original problem into a master UC problem for the base case and security checking subproblems for uncertainties. Numerical case studies on the modified IEEE 118-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust SCUC approach. Although the modified BD does not provide the tightest lower bound and may not guarantee the global optimality, robustness performance tests indicate that a reasonable threshold on the violation of security checking subproblems would guarantee good enough solutions from engineering point of view.",WOS:000372017600053,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Hu, B.

286,,"Prior research has shown that autocorrelation and variance in voltage measurements tend to increase as power systems approach instability. This paper seeks to identify the conditions under which these statistical indicators provide reliable early warning of instability in power systems. First, the paper derives and validates a semi-analytical method for quickly calculating the expected variance and autocorrelation of all voltages and currents in an arbitrary power system model. Building on this approach, the paper describes the conditions under which filtering can be used to detect these signs in the presence of measurement noise. Finally, several experiments show which types of measurements are good indicators of proximity to instability for particular types of state changes. For example, increased variance in voltages can reliably indicate both proximity to a bifurcation and the location of increased stress. On the other hand, growth of autocorrelation in certain line currents is related less to a specific location of stress but, rather, is a reliable indicator of stress occurring somewhere in the system; in particular, it would be a clear indicator of approaching instability when many nodes in an area are under stress.",WOS:000372017600049,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Ghanavati, G., Hines, P.

This paper proposes a novel approach for assessment of transient stability of the system. The approach generalizes the idea of energy methods, and extends the concept of energy function to a more general Lyapunov functions family (LFF) constructed via semidefinite programming techniques. Unlike the traditional energy function and its variations, the constructed Lyapunov functions are proven to be decreasing only in a finite neighborhood of the equilibrium point. However, we show that they can still certify stability of a broader set of initial conditions in comparison to the energy function in the closest-UEP method. Moreover, the certificates of stability can be constructed via a sequence of convex optimization problems that are tractable even for large scale systems. We also propose specific algorithms for adaptation of the Lyapunov functions to specific initial conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a number of IEEE test cases.",WOS:000372017600040,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Vu, T.

288,,"With the growing development in demand response, load serving entities (LSEs) may participate in electricity market as strategic bidders by offering coupon-based demand response (C-DR) programs to customers. However, due to customers' versatile electricity consumption patterns under C-DR programs as well as the increasing penetration of wind power generation, obtaining the deterministic bidding decision becomes unprecedented complex for LSEs. To address this challenge, a new strategic bidding model for an LSE is proposed in which the primary objective is to maximize the LSE's profit by providing optimal C-DR considering high wind power penetration. The proposed strategic bidding is a bi-level optimization problem with the LSE's net revenue maximization as the upper level problem and the ISO's economic dispatch (ED) for generation cost minimization as the lower level problem. This bi-level model is converted to a stochastic mathematic program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) by recasting the lower level problem as its Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) optimality conditions. Then, the stochastic MPEC is transformed to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is solvable using available optimization software, based on strong duality theory.

The problem is studied by means of a convex relaxation, named semidefinite program (SDP). The existence of a rank-1 SDP solution guarantees the recovery of a global solution of SCOPF. We prove that the rank of the SDP solution is upper bounded by the treewidth of the power network plus one, which is perceived to be small in practice. We then propose a decomposition method to reduce the computational complexity of the relaxation. In the case where the relaxation is not exact, we develop a graph-theoretic convex program to identify the problematic lines of the network and incorporate the loss over those lines into the objective as a penalization (regularization) term, leading to a penalized SDP problem.

This framework allows certain slow-response energy resources to be controlled at an hourly timescale, while fast-response resources, including renewable resources, and related network decisions can be controlled at a sub-hourly timescale. To this end, we study two models motivated by actual scheduling practices of system operators. Using an external simulator as driver for sub-hourly wind generation, we optimize these economic dispatch models using stochastic decomposition, a sample-based approach for stochastic programming. Computational experiments, conducted on the IEEE-RTS96 system and the Illinois system, reveal that optimization with sub-hourly dispatch not only results in lower expected operational costs, but also predicts these costs with far greater accuracy than with models allowing only hourly dispatch.

Nonlinear and linearized equations of this system are analyzed for testing the performance of measurement based methods and to compare their results with respective linearized system modes. It is shown that both electrical and mechanical signals can be used for the SSR monitoring while the torsional modes are more observable in mechanical signals such as generator speeds.

Whenever the criterion is satisfied for a given operating point, it provides mathematical guarantees that the operating point will be stable with respect to small disturbances for any dynamic response of the loads.

Recently, the Smart Grid has been proposed as the next-generation power system to modernize the current grid and improve its efficiency, sustainability, and security. Key technologies of the Smart Grid include smart meters, which allow system operators to collect real-time power consumption data from users, and microgrids, which allow users to own and control renewable resources. However, the Smart Grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks, thus making stealing energy much easier in it. Most existing energy theft detection schemes require the collection of real-time power consumption data from users, i.e., users' load profiles, which violates their privacy. In this paper, we first propose a centralized energy theft detection algorithm utilizing the Kalman filter, called SEK. It can efficiently identify the energy thieves but cannot protect users' privacy.

341,,"Demand response programs are currently being proposed as a solution to deal with issues related to peak demand and to improve the operation of the electric power system. In the demand response paradigm, electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper, a dynamic energy management framework, based on highly resolved energy consumption models, is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior, thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances, including plug-in electric vehicles, is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures. Recently, time-varying electricity rate plans have been proposed by electric utilities as an incentive to their customers with the objective of re-shaping the aggregate demand. Large-scale simulations are performed to analyze and quantitatively assess the impact of demand response programs using different electricity price structures. Results show that simple time-varying electricity price structures, coupled with large-scale adoption of automated energy management systems, might create pronounced rebound peaks in the aggregate residential demand. To cope with the rebound peaks created by the synchronization of the individual residential demands, innovative electricity price structures-called Multi-TOU and Multi-CPP-are proposed.",WOS:000372017600024,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Muratori, M. and Rizzoni, G.","Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Glogal Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",33,10.1109/Tpwrs.2015.2414880,Mar,0885-8950,2,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,demand response,electricity pricing,rebound peaks,residential energy management,tou and cpp,load control,consumption,markets,impacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Dg4ch,,1108-1117,6062,Journal Article,,,Residential Demand Response: Dynamic Energy Management and Time-Varying Electricity Pricing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Residential Demand Response: Dynamic Energy Management and Time-Varying Electricity Pricing,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000372017600024,31,,,2016,,Pacific NW Natl Lab,USA

Consumers are then responsible to adjust the set-points of the individual household devices accordingly to meet the imposed constraint. We formulate the problem as a stochastic household energy management program, with stochasticity arising due to local photovoltaic generation. We show how a demand bidding curve for capacity increments can be constructed as a by-product of the developed problem and provide a rigorous pricing analysis that results in a probabilistic ""shadow"" price envelope.

352,,"This paper discusses a recent event in the western American power system when a forced oscillation was observed at a frequency that was close to a well-known 0.38-Hz inter-area electromechanical mode frequency of the western system. The event motivates a systematic investigation in this paper on the possibility of resonant interactions between forced oscillations and electromechanical inter-area oscillatory modes in power systems. When the natural oscillatory mode of a power system is poorly damped, and the forced oscillation occurs at a frequency close to system mode frequency at critical locations for the mode, resonance is observed in simulation test cases of the paper. It is shown that the MW oscillations on tie-lines can be as high as 477 MW from a 10-MW forced oscillation in Kundur test system because of resonance. This paper discusses the underlying system conditions and effects as related to resonance in power systems caused by forced oscillations and discusses ways to detect such scenarios using synchrophasors.

The presented methodology is general and can be applied to both demand and supply bids. That is, no restrictive assumptions are made on the characteristics of the pool and its agents. However, our focus is on the operation of time-shiftable loads with deadlines, because they play a central role in creating load flexibility and enhancing demand response and peak-load shaving programs. Both basic and complex time-shiftable load types are addressed, where the latter includes time-shiftable loads that are uninterruptible, have per-time-slot consumption limits or ramp constraints, or comprise several smaller time-shiftable subloads. Four innovative analytical steps are presented in order to transform the originally nonlinear and hard-to-solve price-maker economic bidding optimization problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program. Accordingly, the global optimal solutions are found for the price and energy bids within a relatively short amount of computational time.

The sensitivity between VSC control input and the voltage stability margin is introduced. Based on this sensitivity, the proposed control algorithm jointly satisfies system-wide voltage stability margin as well as local voltage magnitude requirements. The proposed approach is to first migrate the entire system to have sufficient voltage stability margin, and then to correct any voltage magnitude violation while keeping that stability margin. A contour-based visualization of the VSC capability space for maintaining system voltage stability is introduced, which can effectively illustrate how the singular value sensitivity (SVS) based control achieves both the local and global voltage stability requirements.

Flatness-based approach is well adopted to control systems in two-level control structure where the tasks of planning, trajectory generation, and tracking the desired trajectories can be easily separated.

While in vector control the trajectories are found using PI controllers, in the proposed control structure the trajectories are computed directly, through algebraic equations. Desired active and reactive power are used to develop the set points for trajectory generation. Tracking of the desired trajectories is guaranteed through feedback linearization.

395,,"Unlike transmission systems, distribution feeders in North America operate under unbalanced conditions at all times, and generally have a single strong voltage source. When a distribution feeder is connected to a strong substation source, the system is dynamically very stable, even for large transients. However if a distribution feeder, or part of the feeder, is separated from the substation and begins to operate as an islanded microgrid, transient dynamics become more of an issue. To assess the impact of transient dynamics at the distribution level, it is not appropriate to use traditional transmission solvers, which generally assume transposed lines and balanced loads. Full electromagnetic solvers capture a high level of detail, but it is difficult to model large systems because of the required detail. This paper proposes an electromechanical transient model of synchronous machines for distribution-level modeling and microgrids. This approach includes not only the machine model, but also its interface with an unbalanced network solver, and a powerflow method to solve unbalanced conditions without a strong reference bus.

Then, by relaxing the non-convex rank-1 constraint in the rank-constrained SDP formulation, one obtains a convex SDP problem. The tap positions are determined as the ratio between the primary-side bus voltage and the secondary-side virtual bus voltage that result from the optimal solution of the relaxed SDP, and then rounded to the nearest discrete tap values. To efficiently solve the relaxed SDP, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

By effectively dividing the controller responsibilities between local substation controls and a central coordinator at control center level, the design is aimed at voltage control of large-scale power systems. At local level, the substation controllers maintain their respective substation bus voltages by local power-flow-like computations using mostly local PMU measurements. The central coordinator computes and provides the voltage set-points to the substation controllers and also coordinates by enabling or disabling the local controllers as needed. The controller is being designed towards prototype implementation in Southern California Edison (SCE), starting with local controllers at specific substations in the first stage. It is tested on real-time dynamic models and large-scale power-flow simulations of SCE transmission network.",WOS:000367298100040,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Venkatasubramanian, V., Guerrero, J., Su, J.

Implementation of dynamic ratings was driven by current economic and environmental constraints placed on the construction of additional electrical transmission infrastructure, thus creating a need to operate the existing equipment closer to its physical limitations. In order to effectively utilize these dynamic limits, the necessary data constructs must be modeled, so ERCOT extended the CIM representation of the balanced three-phase power system model used to operate its various grid functions, in order to support the modeling and use of dynamic ratings in its operational real-time and congestion hedging market models.

411,,"An island formation identification scheme utilizing both phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) information, in conjunction with an analytical method, is developed and presented. The motivation for this work came from the investigation of the islanding event in the Entergy, Louisiana power system in 2008. During Hurricane Gustav in September of 2008, 14 transmission lines were lost which led to the formation of a large electrical island containing much of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This work proposes a method for identifying any specific area of the transmission system that is vulnerable to islanding as the result of losing a system branch. PMU measurements are then utilized to verify SCADA reports that a system branch has been lost. The proposed identification scheme is called the one line remaining (OLR) algorithm. The proposed algorithm identifies potential island formations based on the criteria that a single bus, or a number of buses, are connected to the rest of the system by only a single branch as a direct result of a branch outage. The OLR algorithm is detailed and applied to several small test systems to motivate and validate the approach. The OLR algorithm is then applied to a large Entergy test system for the Gustav islanding event and correctly identifies the last tie line that was lost and created the island.",WOS:000367298100042,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Werho, T., Vittal, V., Kolluri, S. and Wong, S.

In this paper, we investigate the situation where generation lower bounds are present. We show that even for a 2-bus 1-generator system, the SDP relaxation can have all possible approximation outcomes, that is 1) SDP relaxation may be exact, 2) SDP relaxation may be inexact, or 3) SDP relaxation may be feasible while the optimal power flow (OPF) instance may be infeasible. We provide a complete characterization of when these three approximation outcomes occur and an analytical expression of the resulting optimality gap for this 2-bus system. In order to facilitate further research, we design a library of instances over radial networks in which the SDP relaxation has positive optimality gap. Finally, we propose valid inequalities and variable bound tightening techniques that significantly improve the computational performance of a global optimization solver.

The proposed coordinated stochastic model (referred to as EGTran) considers random outages of generating units and transmission lines, and random errors in forecasting the day-ahead hourly loads. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to create multiple scenarios for representing the coordinated system uncertainties. The nonlinear natural gas network constraints are linearized and incorporated into the stochastic model. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of applying the hourly economic demand response for enhancing the scheduling coordination of natural gas and electricity networks. It is demonstrated that electricity demand response would offer a less volatile hourly load profile and locational marginal prices, and less dependence on natural gas constraints for the optimal operation of electric power systems.

Advances in photovoltaic (PV) inverters offer new opportunities for reactive power management provided PV owners have the right investment incentives. In this context, reactive power compensation is considered here as an ancillary service. Accounting for the increasing time-variability of distributed generation and demand, a stochastic reactive power compensation scheme is developed. Given uncertain active power injections, an online reactive control scheme is devised. This scheme is distribution-free and relies solely on power injection data. Reactive injections are updated using the Lagrange multipliers of a second-order cone program.

434,,"The DC power flow model is in widespread utilization in electricity-market applications and contingency analysis. The presented versions of this model can be classified into two categories: state-dependent, or Hot-Start, models and state-independent, or Cold-Start, models. A reasonable accuracy is reported in the literature regarding Hot-Start models as they take into account branch losses and bus voltages by using available base point. On the contrary, due to the absence of base point in Cold-Start models, branch losses must be either neglected or guessed (which is an uncertain precautionary measure), or evaluated by a cumbersome iteration process. In addition, the bus voltage profiles are inevitably considered to be flat. Hence, the accuracy of available Cold-Start models in different circumstances remains of great concern. This paper addresses this concern and unveils a new Cold-Start model that does not rely on a risky assumption. In other words, there will be no lossless or flat voltage profile assumption in the presented approach whereas the equations remain linear. Besides, the exact effect of the net reactive loads on phase angles is considered and, consequently, the reactive power balance equations are reflected in the model for the first time.",WOS:000359371600018,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Fatemi, S.

While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in ""tighter"" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints.

In the normal operation mode, the control objective of the system is to minimize the operation costs and maximize the revenues. A rolling-horizon optimization method is used to schedule the outputs of dispatchable DGs based on forecasts. In the self-healing mode, the on-outage portion of the distribution system will be optimally sectionalized into networked self-supplied microgrids (MGs) so as to provide reliable power supply to the maximum loads continuously. The outputs of the dispatchable DGs will be rescheduled accordingly too. In order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumptions, we formulate the problems as a stochastic program. A scenario reduction method is applied to achieve a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden. A modified IEEE 123-node distribution system is used as a test system.

The scope for particle filter-based DSE can be significantly enhanced by exploiting data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) when available at higher sampling frequencies. In this paper, we present a particle filtering approach to dynamically estimate the states of a synchronous generator in a multi-machine setting considering the excitation and prime mover control systems. The filter relies on typical output measurements assumed available from PMUs stationed at generator buses. The performance of the proposed filter is illustrated with dynamic simulations on IEEE 14-bus system including: 1) generators models with subtransient dynamics, 2) excitation units (IEEE DC1A, DC2A, AC5A), and 3) turbine-governor models (steam and hydro). The estimation accuracy of the proposed filter is assessed for three classes of disturbances assuming noisy PMUs' measurements and comparative results are presented with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF).

The method requires few smart meters along the primary feeders to measure the pre- and during-fault voltages. The voltage sag values for the measured buses produce a vector whose dimension is less than the number of buses in the system. By concatenating the corresponding rows of the bus impedance matrix, an underdetermined set of equation is formed and is used to recover the fault current vector. Since the current vector ideally contains few nonzero values corresponding to fault currents at the faulted points, it is a sparse vector which can be determined by l(1)-norm minimization. Because the number of nonzero values in the estimated current vector often exceeds the number of fault points, we analyze the nonzero values by Fuzzy-c mean to estimate four possible faults. Furthermore, the nonzero values are processed by a new machine learning method based on the k-nearest neighborhood technique to estimate a single fault location. The performance of our algorithms is validated by their implementation on a real distribution network with noisy and noise-free measurement.",WOS:000359371600054,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Majidi, M., Etezadi-Amoli, M. and Fadali, M.

489,,"The potential for cascading failure in power systems adds substantially to overall reliability risk. Monte Carlo sampling can be used with a power system model to estimate this impact, but doing so is computationally expensive. This paper presents a new approach to estimating the risk of large cascading blackouts triggered by multiple contingencies. The method uses a search algorithm (Random Chemistry) to identify blackout-causing contingencies, and then combines the results with outage probabilities to estimate overall risk. Comparing this approach with Monte Carlo sampling for two test cases (the IEEE RTS-96 and a 2383-bus model of the Polish system) illustrates that the new approach is at least two orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo, without introducing measurable bias. Moreover, the approach enables one to compute the sensitivity of overall blackout risk to individual component-failure probabilities in the initiating contingency, allowing one to quickly identify low-cost strategies for reducing risk. By computing the sensitivity of risk to individual initial outage probabilities for the Polish system, we found that reducing three line-outage probabilities by 50% would reduce cascading failure risk by 33%. Finally, we used the method to estimate changes in risk as a function of load.

This paper demonstrates how to extract characteristic attributes in frequency domain (CAFD) and use these CAFDs to formulate a hierarchy of load profiles that can be used as the systematic framework for customer load classification.

A robust optimization approach is adopted for considering forecast errors in load, variable renewable generation, and market prices. The microgrid islanding is further treated as a source of uncertainty. The microgrid planning problem is decomposed into an investment master problem and an operation subproblem. The optimal planning decisions determined in the master problem are employed in the subproblem to examine the optimality of the master solution by calculating the worst-case optimal operation under uncertain conditions.

567,,"We use a unit commitment (UC) model to quantify the operational impacts of subsidizing wind generation when energy prices are negative. Such prices occur increasingly often in U.S. and European Union (EU) markets. Subsidies such as production tax credits, feed-in tariffs, and renewable energy credits motivate renewable generators to submit negative price offers; this lessened flexibility increases system operation and management costs and, in some cases, CO2 emissions when energy prices are negative. Our simulations of large negative bids can also be interpreted as representing EU policies of granting wind absolute dispatch priority. Applications to four hypothetical systems with high wind penetration and distinct generation mixes quantify the UC and dispatch effects of negative bids. Larger negative bids lead to less wind spillage (reducing the 2.8% average curtailment under $0 bids to 1.0%), more conventional plant startups, higher system costs, and, in many cases, higher total CO2 emissions (by up to 2%). In some systems, wind power's effective incremental emissions are as high as coal's. This impact depends strongly on generation mix, carbon price, and the size of the negative bids.

568,,"To respond to volatility and congestion in the power grid, demand response (DR) mechanisms allow for shaping the load compared to a base load profile. When tapping on a large population of heterogeneous appliances as a DR resource, the challenge is in modeling the dimensions available for control. Such models need to strike the right balance between accuracy of the model and tractability. The goal of this paper is to provide a medium-grained stochastic hybrid model to represent a population of appliances that belong to two classes: deferrable or thermostatically controlled loads. We preserve quantized information regarding individual load constraints, while discarding information about the identity of appliance owners. The advantages of our proposed population model are 1) it allows us to model and control load in a scalable fashion, useful for ex-ante planning by an aggregator or for real-time load control; 2) it allows for the preservation of the privacy of end-use customers that own submetered or directly controlled appliances.",WOS:000356531600010,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Alizadeh, M., Scaglione, A., Applebaum, A., Kesidis, G. and Levitt, K.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA",49,10.1109/Tpwrs.2014.2354345,Jul,0885-8950,4,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,clustering,deferrable loads,electric vehicles,load management,load modeling,state-queuing model,privacy,approximation,optimization,electricity,vehicles,demand,pickup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Ck9ak,,1758-1774,6289,Journal Article,,,Reduced-Order Load Models for Large Populations of Flexible Appliances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Reduced-Order Load Models for Large Populations of Flexible Appliances,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000356531600010,30,,,2015,,Univ Calif Davis,USA

Since UC's birth, there have been two major waves of revolution on UC research and real life practice. The first wave has made mixed integer programming stand out from the early solution and modeling approaches for deterministic UC, such as priority list, dynamic programming, and Lagrangian relaxation. With the high penetration of renewable energy, increasing deregulation of the electricity industry, and growing demands on system reliability, the next wave is focused on transitioning from traditional deterministic approaches to stochastic optimization for unit commitment. Since the literature has grown rapidly in the past several years, this paper is to review the works that have contributed to the modeling and computational aspects of stochastic optimization (SO) based UC.

This trend has started to reshape the paradigms of power system operations, as dealing with uncertainty caused by the highly intermittent and uncertain wind power becomes a significant issue. Motivated by this, we present a new framework using adaptive robust optimization for the economic dispatch of power systems with high level of wind penetration. In particular, we propose an adaptive robust optimization model for multi-period economic dispatch, and introduce the concept of dynamic uncertainty sets and methods to construct such sets to model temporal and spatial correlations of uncertainty. We also develop a simulation platform which combines the proposed robust economic dispatch model with statistical prediction tools in a rolling horizon framework.

Specifically, we compute the injection shift factors (ISFs) of a particular line of interest with respect to active power injections at all buses (all other DFs can be determined from ISFs). The proposed ISF estimation method relies on the solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations that arise from high-frequency synchronized measurements obtained from phasor measurement units. We exploit a sparse representation (i.e., one in which many elements are zero) of the vector of desired ISFs via rearrangement by electrical distance and an appropriately chosen linear transformation, and cast the estimation problem into a sparse vector recovery problem. As we illustrate through case studies, the proposed approach provides accurate DF estimates with fewer sets of synchronized measurements than earlier approaches that rely on the solution of an overdetermined system of equations via the least-squares errors estimation method.",WOS:000356531600007,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Chen, Y.

A linear sensitivity analysis is further provided for the case of blocking a single transformer, and it has been observed that the effects of blocking transformer neutral currents to be mostly local.

631,,"Static reserve policies are used within security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) to ensure reliability. A common policy is that 10-min reserve must exceed the largest contingency. However, this condition does not guarantee reliability because voltage and thermal limits can hinder reserve deliverability. Many operators use zonal reserve markets to ensure reserves are dispersed across the grid. Such zonal models attempt to anticipate transmission bottlenecks, which is a difficult task when the future system state is uncertain. This paper examines the market implications of dynamic reserve policies used to mitigate uncertainty from renewable resources and contingencies. We study the market implications of policies recently proposed in the literature, such as hourly zones within day-ahead SCUC and an algorithm that formally disqualifies reserves that are expected to be undeliverable. A locational reserve pricing scheme is also proposed in connection with scenario-based reserve disqualification. Analysis on the RTS-96 test case shows that dynamic zones and reserve disqualification, along with the proposed compensation scheme, help direct reserve payments toward resources that more effectively respond to contingencies.",WOS:000353641000051,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Lyon, J.

Current methods to mitigate this variability and uncertainty focus on using conventional generator ramping capability. There is also the option of using wind power itself to mitigate the variability and uncertainty that it introduces into the system. This paper introduces the concept of a flexible dispatch margin as a means for wind to participate in mitigating net variability and net uncertainty. In providing a flexible dispatch margin, wind generators under-schedule in the hour-ahead energy market in order to have additional expected flexibility available for the real-time market. The implementation of the flexible dispatch margin is analyzed in a two-stage optimization model with recourse to the flexible dispatch margin, flexible demand and generator ramping. This modeling framework combines Monte Carlo simulations with AC OPF analysis, using the IEEE 39-bus test system. Results show that use of the flexible dispatch margin decreases the reliance on peaking generators to mitigate net variability and uncertainty, and also decreases the frequency of price spike events, particularly as wind penetration increases from 10% to 30%.

Some regional electricity market operators adopt complex bidding mechanisms to account for nonconvex cost components that are not reflected in the marginal cost of energy, while other markets rely solely on simple bids with revenue sufficiency conditions. This paper compares the impacts of different bidding rules on wholesale prices and on the remuneration of units in power systems with a significant share of renewable generation. We distinguish the effects of bidding rules from the effects of regulatory uncertainty that can unexpectedly increase renewable generation by considering two distinct situations: 1) an ""adapted"" capacity mix, which is optimized for any given amount of renewable penetration, and 2) a ""nonadapted"" capacity mix, which is optimized for zero renewable penetration, but operated with different nonzero levels of renewables. We show that, although in the transitory state the impact on remuneration of having a nonadapted system dominates over the effect of the startup remuneration mechanisms explored, in equilibrium, bidding rules play an important role in making power plants whole while impacting on the cost borne by consumers.",WOS:000353641000052,Ieee T Power Syst,,"de Sisternes, F.

The price evolves as a stochastic process, capable of correctly explaining the seasonality effects as well as the tail fatness and spikiness in its distribution. Transaction costs capture the price impact of the storage operation on the electricity spot price. A risk analysis of an optimal risk neutral deterministic policy as well as the simple myopic policy indicates that the realized operational cost may notably differ from the expected cost by a considerable probability. This difference suggests that we need to consider risk. Using the downside risk measure of conditional value-at-risk, an optimal risk averse conversion and transmission strategy, among the grid, the renewable power generation source, and an energy storage is proposed to fully satisfy the electricity demand and minimize the expected operational cost as well as the risk.

One of the critical issues is how to keep increasing wind penetration without jeopardizing grid security and reliability. This paper explores the possibility of changing transmission network topology, by transmission switching, to accommodate higher utilization of wind power and reduce the generation costs of thermal units. Considering the uncertainty in wind power output, we use chance constraints to ensure that the wind energy utilized exceeds a minimal usage level at a certain probability.

We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program that aims to minimize the long-run average cost of electricity used and investment in storage, if any, while satisfying all the demand. We model storage with ramp constraints, conversion losses, dissipation losses and an investment cost. We prove the existence of an optimal storage management policy under mild assumptions and show that it has a dual threshold structure. Under this policy, we derive structural results, which indicate that the marginal value from storage decreases with its size and that the optimal storage size can be computed efficiently. We prove a rather surprising result, as we characterize the maximum value of storage under constant prices and i.i.d. net-demand processes: if the storage is a profitable investment, then the ratio of the amortized cost of storage to the constant price is less than 1/4.

652,,"This paper is concerned about effective incorporation of a limited number of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements into the state estimation solution in order to enhance the state tracking accuracy and speed. This is particularly important for fast changing system conditions when rapid control action may be necessary based on the onset of voltage instability due to an unexpected event. Under such conditions, SCADA-based state estimators may be too slow in capturing the changes in system state due to the low scan rates of the order of seconds. PMU measurements on the other hand provide refresh rates of milliseconds; however, they may not provide full system observability. In this work, a solution is proposed in order to address the lack of observability by the PMU measurements while maintaining fast tracking capability as well as estimation robustness against pseudo-measurement and PMU errors. Robustness is accomplished via the use of the so-called least absolute value estimator which minimizes L-1 norm of the residuals.

A risky power contract is proposed, by which wind power producers (WPPs) can trade uncertain future power for efficient wind aggregation. A two-settlement market with both the risky power contract and a conventional firm power contract is shown to have a unique competitive equilibrium (CE), characterized in closed form. The marginal contribution and diversity contribution of each WPP to the group of all WPPs are fairly reflected in the profit earned by this WPP at the CE. Moreover, the CE achieves the same total profit as achieved by a grand coalition of WPPs. In a coalitional game setting, the profit allocation induced by the CE is always in the core, and is achieved via a non-cooperative risky power market.

In practice, the transmission switching operation itself is a disruptive action to the system. Frequently switching lines into or out of service can create undesirable effects on the security and reliability of power systems and may require new investments in the automation and control systems. In this paper, we formulate an economic seasonal transmission switching model where transmission switching occurs once at the beginning of a time period (season) and then the transmission topology remains unchanged during that period. The proposed seasonal transmission switching model is a large-scale mixed integer programming problem. The objective of the optimization model is to minimize the total energy generation cost over the season subject to loads and N-1 reliability requirements. We develop a novel decomposition method that decomposes the seasonal problem into one-hour problems which are then solved efficiently.

The model is applied to analyze the impact of increasing wind power capacity on the optimal generation mix and the profitability of thermal generators. In a case study, we find that increasing wind penetration reduces energy prices while the prices for operating reserves increase. Moreover, scarcity pricing for operating reserves through reserve shortfall penalties significantly impacts the prices and profitability of thermal generators. Without scarcity pricing, no thermal units are profitable, however scarcity pricing can ensure profitability for peaking units at high wind penetration levels. Capacity payments can also ensure profitability, but the payments required for baseload units to break even increase with the amount of wind power.

We show that large groups of renewable producers would act strategically to lower the aggregate output because of market power. To maximize renewable power production, we characterize the trade-off between market power and generation uncertainty as a function of the size of the groups.

The quantified interactions can capture the general propagation patterns of the cascades from utilities or simulation, thus helping to better understand how cascading failures propagate and to identify key links and key components that are crucial for cascading failure propagation. By utilizing these interactions a high-level probabilistic model called interaction model is proposed to study the influence of interactions on cascading failure risk and to support online decision-making. It is much more time-efficient to first quantify the interactions between component failures with fewer original cascades from a more detailed cascading failure model and then perform the interaction model simulation than it is to directly simulate a large number of cascades with a more detailed model. Interaction-based mitigation measures are suggested to mitigate cascading failure risk by weakening key links, which can be achieved in real systems by wide-area protection such as blocking of some specific protective relays.

690,,"This paper proposes a new transmission-constrained unit commitment method that combines the cost-efficient but computationally demanding stochastic optimization and the expensive but tractable interval optimization techniques to manage uncertainty on the expected net load. The proposed hybrid unit commitment approach applies the stochastic formulation to the initial operating hours of the optimization horizon, during which the wind forecasts are more accurate, and then switches to the interval formulation for the remaining hours. The switching time is optimized to balance the cost of unhedged uncertainty from the stochastic unit commitment against the cost of the security premium of the interval unit commitment formulation. These hybrid, stochastic, and interval formulations are compared using Monte Carlo simulations on a modified 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System. The results demonstrate that the proposed unit commitment formulation results in the least expensive day-ahead schedule among all formulations and can be solved in the same amount of time as a full stochastic unit commitment.

696,,"We present a new formulation of a hybrid stochastic- robust optimization and use it to calculate a look-ahead, security-constrained optimal power flow. It is designed to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by efficiently accommodating renewable energy sources and by realistically evaluating system changes that could reduce emissions. It takes into account ramping costs, CO2 damages, demand functions, reserve needs, contingencies, and the temporally linked probability distributions of stochastic variables such as wind generation. The inter-temporal trade-offs and transversality of energy storage systems are a focus of our formulation. We use it as part of a new method to comprehensively estimate the operational net benefits of system changes. Aside from the optimization formulation, our method has four other innovations. First, it statistically estimates the cost and CO2 impacts of each generator's electricity output and ramping decisions. Second, it produces a comprehensive measure of net operating benefit, and disaggregates that into the effects on consumers, producers, system operators, government, and CO2 damage. Third and fourth, our method includes creating a novel, modified Ward reduction of the grid and a thorough generator dataset from publicly available information sources.

Our methodology uses data that is becoming readily available at utility companies-hourly energy consumption readings collected from ""smart"" electricity meters, as well as hourly temperature readings. To decompose individual consumption into a thermal-sensitive part and a base load (non-thermally-sensitive), we propose a model of temperature response that is based on thermal regimes, i.e., unobserved decisions of consumers to use their heating or cooling appliances. We use this model to extract useful benchmarks that compose thermal profiles of individual users, i.e., terse characterizations of the statistics of these users' temperature-sensitive consumption. We present example profiles generated using our model on real consumers, and show its performance on a large sample of residential users. This knowledge may, in turn, inform the DR program by allowing scarce operational and marketing budgets to be spent on the right users-those whose influencing will yield highest energy reductions-at the right time.

While many previous methods were proposed by using change of the boundary values to evaluate the change of optimal solutions, which might lead to failure in convergence, this paper puts forward a coordination strategy according to the correspondence between optimal solutions and boundary values based on a probing mechanism.

The problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is to find the largest operating ranges of variable resources such that the system remains feasible under any generation realizations within the range. Computing the DNE limits can be conceptually translated into finding the largest uncertain set of a robust optimization problem. Depending on the assumptions on how the system responds to the uncertainty of renewable resources, three alternative approaches are developed to convert the nonstandard robust optimization problem into linear programming, bilinear programming and two-stage robust optimization problems, respectively. Although the linear programming problem is easier to solve as compared to the other two alternatives, its resulting DNE limits are the most conservative. Therefore, the trade-off needs to be considered when deciding which approach is the most appropriate in real-time operation.

At the same time, renewable resources require operators to acquire more operating reserves. With today's deterministic reserve requirements unable to ensure optimal reserve locations, improvements to reserve policies are needed to ensure reserve deliverability while maintaining a reliable system at least cost. This paper proposes a daily reserve zone determination procedure, which is able to reflect system operating conditions by utilizing probabilistic power flows. A statistical clustering algorithm is used to cluster buses together to produce the zones; the algorithm uses a centrality measurement, which is based on weighted power transfer distribution factors. The proposed method is validated by testing it on a modified IEEE 118-bus system for multiple days; the proposed method is compared against existing reserve zone partitioning procedures. While the proposed reserve zone determination method is a heuristic, it is shown to be effective and it is a computationally tractable method.

738,,"This paper is concerned with the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. We have recently shown that a convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming (SDP) is able to find a global solution of OPF for IEEE benchmark systems, and moreover this technique is guaranteed to work over acyclic (distribution) networks. The present work studies the potential of the SDP relaxation for OPF over mesh (transmission) networks. First, we consider a simple class of cyclic systems, namely weakly-cyclic networks with cycles of size 3. We show that the success of the SDP relaxation depends on how the line capacities are modeled mathematically. More precisely, the SDP relaxation is proven to succeed if the capacity of each line is modeled in terms of bus voltage difference, as opposed to line active power, apparent power or angle difference. This result elucidates the role of the problem formulation. Our second contribution is to relate the rank of theminimum-rank solution of the SDP relaxation to the network topology. The goal is to understand how the computational complexity of OPF is related to the underlying topology of the power network. To this end, an upper bound is derived on the rank of the SDP solution, which is expected to be small in practice. A penalization method is then applied to the SDP relaxation to enforce the rank of its solution to become 1, leading to a near-optimal solution for OPF with a guaranteed optimality degree.

The advantage of this framework is that while it captures the complexity of long-term decision making, it maintains clarity of information flow between models, agents and timelines. For our purposes, we introduce an equilibrium model that combines grid operational concerns with the short-term competitive behavior of generation firms. An iterative solution technique is proposed to provide a Nash solution where each optimization problem is solved globally. This solution is then used to inform an overarching transmission planning model that we solve using derivative-free optimization.

752,,"Reserve requirements promote reliability by ensuring resources are available to rebalance the power system following random disturbances. However, reliability is not guaranteed when dispatch is limited by transmission constraints. In this work, we propose a modified form of reserve requirement that identifies response sets for distinct contingency scenarios.

A decomposition algorithm for security-constrained unit commitment dynamically updates the response sets to address changing conditions.

771,,"When the modern electrical infrastructure is undergoing a migration to the Smart Grid, vulnerability and security concerns have also been raised regarding the cascading failure threats in this interconnected transmission system with complex communication and control challenge. The DC power flow-based model has been a popular model to study the cascading failure problem due to its efficiency, simplicity and scalability in simulations of such failures. However, due to the complex nature of the power system and cascading failures, the underlying assumptions in DC power flow-based cascading failure simulators (CFS) may fail to hold during the development of cascading failures. This paper compares the validity of a typical DC power flow-based CFS in cascading failure analysis with a new numerical metric defined as the critical moment (CM). The adopted CFS is first implemented to simulate system behavior after initial contingencies and to evaluate the utility of DC-CFS in cascading failure analysis. Then the DC-CFS is compared against another classic, more precise power system stability methodology, i.e., the transient stability analysis (TSA). The CM is introduced with a case study to assess the utilization of these two models for cascading failure analysis. Comparative simulations on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus benchmark reveal important consistency and discrepancy between these two approaches.

A dynamic model of an experimental room is then developed to estimate the effect of the DLC application to the VSHP on its indoor air temperature for two different cooling systems. Furthermore, small signal analysis is performed to evaluate both the transient response of the DLC-enabled VSHP and its contribution to GFR.

Considering the similarity of the cases that the system is unobservable and that the system becomes unobservable if a critical measurement or a critical pair is removed from the measurement set, a unified algorithm of PMU placement for state estimation combining observability analysis and bad data detection into a single iterative procedure is presented. In each iteration of the algorithm, PMU placement is performed to make the system observable, or make critical measurements become non-critical, or make critical pairs become non-critical pairs, respectively. Based on Theorem 3.1 in ""A direct numerical method for observability analysis"" (Gou and Abur, IEEE Trans. Power Syst., vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 625-630, May 2000), this paper presents an improved optimal PMU placement algorithm wherein each iteration is performed by a significantly smaller integer linear programming (ILP) model whose size is governed by the rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix resulting from the configuration of conventional measurements. The proposed formulation thus leads to a far more smaller and simpler ILP problem compared to existing methods. Additional results are also presented to identify critical measurement pairs.

Our framework provides a modular and multi-layered electrical network representation with zooming-in and zooming-out capabilities. The zoomed-out representation concerns interconnections and inter-area transactions, while the zoomed-in representation concerns a single area and its internal transactions. The framework allows explicit modeling of bilateral transactions with contract paths through a transformation of a meshed electrical network into a spanning tree. Loop flows are introduced to represent a deviation between the contract paths of bilateral transactions and physical line flows. The effects of both intra-area and inter-area bilateral transactions and loop flows can be graphically traced in the framework. Moreover, these tracing methods allocate bilateral transactions to line flows and loop flows, essential for accounting and flow control. Our tracing methods differ from the distribution factor based method because the distribution factor matrix handles nodal injections only and it cannot account for contract paths of bilateral transactions and the resulting loop flows.

798,,"This paper presents an optimization approach for the placement of geomagnetically induced current (GIC) blocking devices (BDs) on power system transformers to mitigate the adverse effects of a geomagnetic disturbance (GMD). Solar storms lead to GMDs which, in turn, drive GICs along transmission lines and through transformer windings. GICs cause half-cycle saturation in power transformers, increase their shunt reactive power loss, lead to a significant lack of power system reactive power support, and, as a result, create voltage instability and, potentially, large-scale voltage collapse. To mitigate these detrimental effects, a long-term remedy is to install GIC BDs at the neutral point of transformers. Since these devices are fairly costly, their placement should be performed in an optimal manner. The optimization problem proposed in this paper minimizes the cost of BD placement while satisfying power system voltage and generator maximum reactive power limits.

This paper proposes a methodology to quantify uncertainty in consumption that highlights the dependence of the cost-of-service with volatility in demand. We use a large and rich dataset of consumption time series to provide evidence that there is a substantial degree of high-level structure in the statistics of consumption across users which may be partially explained by certain characteristics of the users. To uncover this structure, we propose a new technique for extracting typical statistical signatures of consumption-energy demand distributions (EDDs)-that is based on clustering distributions using a fast, approximated algorithm. We next study the factors influencing the choice of consumption signature and identify certain types of appliances and behaviors related to appliance operation that are most predictive. Finally, we comment on how structure in consumption statistics may be used to target residential energy efficiency programs to achieve greatest impact in curtailing cost of service.",WOS:000344405600023,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Albert, A. and Rajagopal, R.","Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",22,10.1109/Tpwrs.2014.2312721,Nov,0885-8950,6,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,segmentation,service cost,smart meter data,time-series,electricity,classification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,As6yr,,2795-2803,6526,Journal Article,,,Cost-of-Service Segmentation of Energy Consumers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Cost-of-Service Segmentation of Energy Consumers,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000344405600023,29,,,2014,,Stanford Univ,USA
809,,"This paper seeks to improve the computational time needed to solve transmission switching problems. Transmission switching provides an effective way to reduce operating costs in power system operations by altering the topology of the transmission network. However, determining the optimal set of lines to switch creates an enormous computational burden. Transmission switching formulations add binary decision variables for many transmission lines in the system to indicate if they are switched. This creates a very weak formulation that is difficult to solve. Altering the transmission topology by switching lines can affect the reliability of the network, for instance, by creating islands. Additional reliability constraints need to be added to the problem formulation. These constraints can potentially make an already difficult problem even harder. This paper takes a different approach to the transmission switching problem. Rather than preventing islanding by using constraints in the problem formulation, we look at how they can be used to improve the solution process. Specifically, we develop a cutting plane algorithm to generate valid inequalities and fix variables based on the fact that optimal solutions to the transmission switching problem that do not contain islands exist.",WOS:000344405600006,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Ostrowski, J., Wang, J.

The emerging microgrids embedded in distribution systems enhance the self-healing capability and allow distribution systems to recover faster in the event of an outage. This paper presents a graph-theoretic DSR strategy incorporating microgrids that maximizes the restored load and minimizes the number of switching operations. Spanning tree search algorithms are applied to find the candidate restoration strategies by modeling microgrids as virtual feeders and representing the distribution system as a spanning tree. Unbalanced three-phase power flow is performed to ensure that the proposed system topology satisfies all operational constraints.

814,,"This paper defines flow control algorithms for loop flow cancellation based on the allocation and tracing of bilateral transactions and loop flows. In Part I of this paper, we have shown that the main difference between transportation and electrical networks is caused by the existence of loop flows. We have introduced a distributed framework for the modeling and tracing of bilateral transactions and the corresponding loop flows. Its zooming-out capability provides a valuable mechanism for representing external (inter-area) loop flows based on simplified topologies of individual areas. The tracing information accurately allocates bilateral transactions with associated contract paths to line flows and loop flows. Furthermore, this information can be used for determining the set points of control equipment so that loop flows are minimized. In this framework, phase angle regulators (PARs), commonly used for line flow control, are represented through their effects on loop flows. We define sufficient conditions for achieving complete loop flow cancellation. A new distributed algorithm for determining PAR set points in a coordinated way without revealing operating conditions of individual areas is introduced in this part.

By evaluating the proposed reliability indices for node and system observability, incremental PMUs are sequentially placed on the locations where the reliability of entire system's observability can be best improved at each step. As a result, a pre-set desired reliability of the system's observability can be achieved while using the minimal number of PMUs. The proposed method is generic and flexible in a way that different kinds of failures that impact the reliability of system observability can be easily included in the method.

To achieve this, a fully distributed one-step model-predictive control protocol is proposed and analyzed, whereby each prosumer communicates solely with its neighbors in the network.

A nonlinear dynamic model of general interconnected electric power systems in the ordinary differential equation (ODE) form is proposed in terms of time-varying phasors of all dynamic components. This model captures previously unmodeled fast dynamics of inductors and capacitors of FACTS. Additionally, it allows us to observe the active power which is flowing through FACTS during transients. Using the derived model, an ectropy-based FACTS controller is proposed. The proposed controller regulates the active power through FACTS in order to shift the increment in energy created by disturbances. The energy increment is directed from generators into FACTS, preserving the synchronization between generators during disturbances.

834,,"With the increasing penetration of variable renewable generations, independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission organizations (RTOs) are faced with new challenges for the secure and economic operation of power systems. This paper proposes an effective approach for deriving robust solutions to the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem, which considers load and wind uncertainties via interval numbers. Different from most robust optimization-based SCUC approaches in literature which explore robust unit commitment (UC) solutions for immunizing against the worst economic scenario in terms of the highest minimum dispatch cost, the proposed robust SCUC model minimizes operation cost for the base case while guaranteeing that the robust UC and dispatch solutions could be adaptively and securely adjusted in response to uncertain intervals. Thus, the proposed model achieves smaller unit commitment costs while maintaining the solution robustness as compared with literature. In addition, the proposed model describes base case dispatches and corrective actions in uncertain intervals, which is more consistent with the current day-ahead and real-time markets. Furthermore, besides budget constraints used in literature, this paper also considers load and wind variability correlations in constructing uncertain intervals, which would eliminate unlike-to-happen scenarios and further limit the level of conservatism of the robust solution. The proposed robust SCUC model is solved by Benders decomposition, which decomposes the original problem into a master UC problem for the base case and subproblems for the base case network evaluation and the security checking for uncertain intervals. Feasibility cuts are generated and fed back to the master problem for further iterations when violations are identified in subproblems. Numerical case studies on the modified IEEE 118-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust SCUC model for the secure and economic operation of power systems under various uncertainties.",WOS:000344405600039,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Hu, B.

Generation expansion and retirement become highly uncertain as well. Some of the uncertainties do not have probability distributions, making it difficult to use stochastic programming. Techniques like robust optimization that do not require a probability distribution became desirable. To address these challenges, we study two optimization criteria for the transmission expansion planning problem under the robust optimization paradigm, where the maximum cost and maximum regret of the expansion plan over all uncertainties are minimized, respectively. With these models, our objective is to make planning decisions that are robust against all scenarios. We use a two-layer algorithm to solve the resulting tri-level optimization problems.

857,,"In interconnected power systems, dynamic model reduction can be applied to generators outside the area of interest (i.e., study area) to reduce the computational cost associated with transient stability studies. This paper presents a method of deriving the reduced dynamic model of the external area based on dynamic response measurements. The method consists of three steps, namely dynamic-feature extraction, attribution, and reconstruction (DEAR). In this method, a feature extraction technique, such as singular value decomposition (SVD), is applied to the measured generator dynamics after a disturbance. Characteristic generators are then identified in the feature attribution step for matching the extracted dynamic features with the highest similarity, forming a suboptimal ""basis"" of system dynamics. In the reconstruction step, generator state variables such as rotor angles and voltage magnitudes are approximated with a linear combination of the characteristic generators, resulting in a quasi-nonlinear reduced model of the original system. The network model is unchanged in the DEAR method. Tests on several IEEE standard systems show that the proposed method yields better reduction ratio and response errors than the traditional coherency based reduction methods.",WOS:000341190700006,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Wang, S.

870,,"This paper proposes a distributed direct load control scheme for large-scale residential demand response (DR) built on a two-layer communication-based control architecture. The lower-layer network is within each building, where the energy management controller (EMC) uses wireless links to schedule operation of appliances upon request according to a local power consumption target. The upper-layer network links a number of EMCs in a region whose aggregated demand is served by a load aggregator. The load aggregator wants the actual aggregated demand over this region to match a desired aggregated demand profile. Our approach utilizes the average consensus algorithm to distribute portions of the desired aggregated demand to each EMC in a decentralized fashion. The allocated portion corresponds to each building's aforementioned local power consumption target which its EMC then uses to schedule the in-building appliances. The result will be an aggregated demand over this region that more closely reaches the desired demand.

We reformulate the minimax regret model as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and solve it by the Benders' decomposition algorithm. Moreover, we design a bidding strategy based on the price forecast confidence intervals to generate the offer curve.

Unit commitment (UC) decisions and constraints for thermal units are incorporated into the expansion model to better capture the impact of wind variability on the operation of the system. To reduce computational complexity, we also consider a simplified economic dispatch (ED) based model with ramping constraints as an alternative to the UC formulation. We find that the differences in optimal expansion decisions between the UC and ED formulations are relatively small.

893,,"Inter-area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically poorly controllable by means of local decentralized control. Recent research efforts have been aimed at developing wide-area control strategies that involve communication of remote signals. In conventional wide-area control, the control structure is fixed a priori typically based on modal criteria. In contrast, here we employ the recently-introduced paradigm of sparsity-promoting optimal control to simultaneously identify the optimal control structure and optimize the closed-loop performance. To induce a sparse control architecture, we regularize the standard quadratic performance index with an l(1)-penalty on the feedback matrix. The quadratic objective functions are inspired by the classic slow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous networks without inter-area oscillations. We use the New England power grid model to demonstrate that the proposed combination of the sparsity-promoting control design with the slow coherency objectives performs almost as well as the optimal centralized control while only making use of a single wide-area communication link. In addition to this nominal performance, we also demonstrate that our control strategy yields favorable robustness margins and that it can be used to identify a sparse control architecture for control design via alternative means.",WOS:000341190700029,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Dorfler, F., Jovanovic, M.

Under such conditions, commonly used positive sequence equivalent will no longer be valid. On the other hand, use of full three-phase model will add significant computational burden for the considered application. This paper describes a simple approach to address this issue for the specific application of state estimation. The main idea is to exploit the linearity of the estimation problem when the system is measured solely by phasor measurements. The linear problem lends itself to decoupling via modal transformation unlike the nonlinear formulation with SCADA measurements. A further improvement is introduced via the use of the least absolute value (LAV) estimator, which has the desirable property of automatic bad-data rejection.

903,,"Price-based demand response (DR) program is a mechanism for encouraging electricity consumers to dynamically manage their energy consumptions in response to time-varying electricity prices, and thereby reduce peak electricity demands and alleviate the pressure to power systems. However, it brings additional dynamics and new challenges to the real-time supply and demand balance. Specifically, if real-time price based DR programs are widely deployed in the future, price-sensitive DR load levels would constantly change in response to dynamic real-time prices, which will impact the economic dispatch (ED) schedule and in turn affect electricity market clearing prices. This paper adopts two methods for examining the impacts of different DR price elasticity characteristics and DR participation levels on the convergence of volatile power market: a closed-loop iterative simulation method and a non-iterative method based on the contraction mapping theorem. In this paper, convergence refers to the fact that load and/or price values will finally converge to a fixed point after a finite number of iterations between the ED problem and the price-sensitive DR load adjustment. Five price-sensitive DR performance function categories are used to simulate different nonlinear price elasticity characteristics of DR loads.

The key development is in determining, via state-space analysis, the anticipated spectral content of either frequency or phase angle measurements as observed immediately following the sudden outage. This theoretical development mainly focuses on frequency measurements and the elements subjected to sudden outages are generators. For any sudden generator outage, the power system exhibits a very specific natural response in terms of its kinetic and potential energies. Kinetic energy in the system is directly related to each specific generator's rotational speed. It is shown that the effect can be seen directly in bus frequency measurements. Each remaining generator on the system has its own unique response to the sudden outage which contributes to the overall system natural response. This overall response is generally composed of oscillatory components which have specific frequencies.

943,,"This paper gives the background and role of the market flow in the interregional congestion management process for market-based operating entity and describes the market flow methodology. It proposes that the market flow method calculates the same impact result on a flowgate as the unit dispatch system (UDS) flow does and proves it mathematically. The equivalence of market flow and UDS flow shows that the UDS flow change on a constraint due to the UDS binding will have the same effect on the change in the market flow under the electricity market operations. In addition, it proves that, in an interconnected system, the sum of the market flows of all of the market entities, the generation-to-load impacts of nonmarket entities, and the total tagged transaction impact among the entities is equal to the dc flow for any constraint. The assessment of market flow methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of using the market flow in the congestion management process and coordinated management of transmission constraints. The proposed methodology can help identify the cause of loop flow problem in power systems.

945,,"As colleges prepare or revise their power engineering courses to include discussions on the smart grid, the microgrid, distributed energy sources and renewable energy resources, the need for new material suitable for inclusion in a typical 4-year undergraduate engineering course has never been more obvious. Toward this effort, an old machines lab was remodeled and converted into a small power network that can be operated in both grid-connected and grid-islanded microgrid modes. The intent of this paper is to devise laboratory experiments to supplement a course in conventional power systems analysis at the undergraduate level. During the remodeling process, two of six synchronous machines in the lab were converted to represent distributed generating units within a laboratory-based microgrid. The use of electromechanical distributed generators (EDG) with a low start-up time allows the system to operate as a conventional power network with provisions for frequency and voltage variations. Students can experiment with voltage control and power sharing between the EDGs in islanded mode. A Laboratory Grid Central Controller (LGCC) was developed in LabVIEW (R) to coordinate the operation of the EDGs, the utility grid and the loads. Its functions are similar to those of a central dispatch office, albeit on a much smaller scale.

952,,"A scalable and analytically tractable probabilistic model for the cascading failure dynamics in power grids is constructed while retaining key physical attributes and operating characteristics of the power grid. The approach is based upon extracting a reduced abstraction of large-scale power grids using a small number of aggregate state variables while modeling the system dynamics using a continuous-time Markov chain. The aggregate state variables represent critical power-grid attributes, which have been shown, from prior simulation-based and historical-data-based analysis, to strongly influence the cascading behavior. The transition rates among states are formulated in terms of certain parameters that capture grid's operating characteristics comprising loading level, error in transmission-capacity estimation, and constraints in performing load shedding. The model allows the prediction of the evolution of blackout probability in time. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis of the blackout probability enables the calculation of the probability mass function of the blackout size. A key benefit of the model is that it enables the characterization of the severity of cascading failures in terms of the operating characteristics of the power grid.",WOS:000338189600028,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Rahnamay-Naeini, M., Wang, Z.

Specifically, using the data of the wind turbines' power outputs recorded across two consecutive years, graph-learning based spatio-temporal analysis is carried out to characterize the statistical distribution and quantify the level crossing rate of the wind farm's aggregate power output. Built on these characterizations, finite-state Markov chains are constructed for each epoch of three hours and for each individual month, which accounts for the diurnal non-stationarity and the seasonality of wind farm generation. Short-term distributional forecasts and a point forecast are then derived by using the Markov chains and ramp trend information. The distributional forecast can be utilized to study stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch problems via a Markovian approach. The developed Markov-chain-based distributional forecasts are compared with existing approaches based on high-order autoregressive models and Markov chains by uniform quantization, and the devised point forecasts are compared with persistence forecasts and high-order autoregressive model-based point forecasts.

It also allows system operators to evaluate the impact of SCADA data accuracy on real-time LMP.

The scheduling decisions will be revised using proper islanding cuts if sufficient generation is not available to guarantee a feasible islanding. Islanding cuts will revise generating units, energy storage systems, and adjustable loads schedules.

Despite significant recent improvements, such simulations still require significant computation times. Here we propose a method, based on clustering units, for approximate unit commitment with dramatic improvements in solution time. This method speeds computation by aggregating similar but non-identical units. This replaces large numbers of binary commitment variables with fewer integers while still capturing individual unit decisions and constraints. We demonstrate the trade-off between accuracy and run-time for different levels of aggregation. A numeric example using an ERCOT-based 205-unit system illustrates that careful aggregation introduces errors of 0.05%-0.9% across several metrics while providing several orders of magnitude faster solution times (400 x) compared to traditional binary formulations. Further aggregation increases errors slightly (similar to 2x) with further speedup (2000 x).

1003,,"This paper presents a set of linear control designs for shaping the inter-area oscillation spectrum of a large radial power system through coordinated control of a wind farm and a battery energy system (BES). We consider a continuum representation of the power system with the wind and battery power modeled as point-source forcings. A spectral analysis of the system demonstrates that its oscillation spectrum strongly depends on the locations of these power injections, implying that there are siting locations that produce more favorable spectral responses. However, the ability to site a wind farm or BES at a specific location may be limited by geographic, environmental, economic or other considerations. Our work provides a means to circumvent this problem by designing co-ordinated controllers for the power outputs of the wind farm and the BES by which one can shape the spectral response of the system to a desired response. The design is posed as a parametric optimization problem that minimizes the error between the two spectral responses over a finite range of frequencies. The approach is independent of the locations of the wind farm and the BES, and can be implemented in a decentralized fashion.",WOS:000335399100053,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Chandra, S., Gayme, D.

We use 1) the cutting-plane algorithm for the master problem, which dynamically includes critical transmission line constraints, and 2) column-generation methods, including the branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm and heuristic approaches, for the subproblems, which add only necessary transmission line dual variables on the fly. Computational results for the modified IEEE 118-bus system show that the combination of the cutting-plane algorithm and the heuristic column-generation approach greatly reduces the total solution time of the two-stage robust unit commitment problem.",WOS:000335399100022,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Lee, C., Liu, C., Mehrotra, S. and Shahidehpour, M.","Northwestern Univ, Dept IEMS, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",22,10.1109/Tpwrs.2013.2291498,May,0885-8950,3,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,load-shift-factor,two-stage robust optimization,unit commitment,wind power,demand response,wind power,optimization,generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Ag4oh,,1221-1231,6738,Journal Article,,,Modeling Transmission Line Constraints in Two-Stage Robust Unit Commitment Problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,Modeling Transmission Line Constraints in Two-Stage Robust Unit Commitment Problem,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000335399100022,29,,,2014,,Northwestern Univ,USA

Since solving DCOLSR-TS is computationally difficult, the current work also develops a heuristic (MIP-H), which improves the system topology while specifying the required sequence of switching operations. Experimental results on a list of N-1 and N-2 critical contingencies of the IEEE 118-bus test case demonstrate the advantages of utilizing MIP-H for both online load shed recovery and recurring contingency- response analysis. This is reinforced by the introduction of a parallelized version of the heuristic (Par-MIP-H), which solves the list of critical contingencies close to 5x faster than MIP-H with 8 cores and up to 14x faster with increased computational resources.

The injection region is the set of all vectors of bus power injections that satisfy the network and operation constraints. The geometrical object of interest is the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region. If the voltage magnitudes are fixed, the injection region of a tree network can be written as a linear transformation of the product of two-bus injection regions, one for each line in the network. Using this decomposition, we show that under the practical condition that the angle difference across each line is not too large, the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region remains unchanged by taking the convex hull. Moreover, the resulting convexified optimal power flow problem can be efficiently solved via semi-definite programming or second-order cone relaxations. These results improve upon earlier works by removing the assumptions on active power lower bounds. It is also shown that our practical angle assumption guarantees two other properties: 1) the uniqueness of the solution of the power flow problem and 2) the non-negativity of the locational marginal prices.

To compare the impact of PMU placements, we introduce a useful metric which accounts for three important requirements in power system state estimation: convergence, observability and performance (COP). Our COP metric can be used to evaluate the estimation performance and numerical stability of the state estimator, which is later used to optimize the PMU locations. In particular, we cast the optimal placement problem in a unified formulation as a semi-definite program (SDP) with integer variables and constraints that guarantee observability in case of measurements loss. Last but not least, we propose a relaxation scheme of the original integer-constrained SDP with randomization techniques, which closely approximates the optimum deployment.

1067,,"In steady-state voltage stability analysis, it is well-known that as the load is increased toward the maximum loading condition, the conventional Newton-Raphson power flow Jacobian matrix becomes increasingly ill-conditioned. As a result, the power flow fails to converge before reaching the maximum loading condition. To circumvent this singularity problem, continuation power flow methods have been developed. In these methods, the size of the Jacobian matrix is increased by one, and the Jacobian matrix becomes non-singular with a suitable choice of the continuation parameter. In this paper, we propose a new method to directly eliminate the singularity by reformulating the power flow problem. The central idea is to introduce an AQ bus in which the bus angle and the reactive power consumption of a load bus are specified. For steady-state voltage stability analysis, the voltage angle at the load bus can be varied to control power transfer to the load, rather than specifying the load power itself. For an AQ bus, the power flow formulation consists of only the reactive power equation, thus reducing the size of the Jacobian matrix by one. This reduced Jacobian matrix is nonsingular at the critical voltage point.

The collection of bi-level games in the lower two levels forms an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) that can be approached by either the diagonalization method (DM) or a complementarity problem (CP) reformulation.

1086,,"The objective of this paper is to determine an optimal plan for expanding the capacity of a power grid in order to minimize the likelihood of a large cascading blackout. Capacity-expansion decisions considered in this paper include the addition of new transmission lines and the addition of capacity to existing lines. We embody these interacting considerations in a simulation optimization model, where the objective is to minimize the probability of a large blackout subject to a budget constraint. The probability of a large-scale blackout is estimated via Monte Carlo simulation of a probabilistic cascading blackout model. Because the events of interest are rare, standard simulation is often intractable from a computational perspective. We apply a variance-reduction technique within the simulation to provide results in a reasonable time frame. Numerical results are given for some small test networks including an IEEE 14-bus test network. A key conclusion is that the different expansion strategies lead to different shapes of the tails of the blackout distributions.

It is the critical response required to avoid triggering under-and over-frequency relays or instability that could lead to machine damage, load-shedding, and in the extreme case, blackouts. Currently, in many restructured power systems throughout the world, ancillary services markets have been developed to incent technologies to provide the services to support power system reliability. However, few ancillary services markets include a market explicitly incentivizing the provision of PFR.

Planning flexibility is defined as the capability of a long-term planning solution to adapt cost-effectively to any of the conditions of characterizing the identified scenarios. Global (or high-impact) uncertainties allow us to create scenarios that guide the flexibility-based planning model; whereas local uncertainties allow us to create uncertainty sets that model the imperfect knowledge of each global uncertainty (GU). Our methodology, rather than choosing the most flexible plan among a set of candidate solutions, designs a flexible system that is less sensitive to the choice of scenarios. In addition to minimizing the investment and operational cost, the model minimizes its future adaptation cost to the conditions of other identified scenarios via adjustable robust optimization. Results obtained with our methodology in a 5-region US system under a 40-year planning horizon show how a flexible system adapts to future high-impact uncertainties at reasonably low costs with a low number of adaptation actions.

Maximum peak power tracking algorithms, which emphasize high renewable energy utilization, may cause a supply-demand imbalance when the available renewable generation is more than demanded, especially for autonomous microgrids. Currently, droop control is one of the most popular decentralized methods for sharing active and reactive loads among the distributed generators. However, conventional droop control methods suffer from slow and oscillating dynamic response and steady state deviations. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a distributed subgradient-based solution to coordinate the operations of different types of distributed renewable generators in a microgrid.

This is important because electric power systems are spatially distributed; hence their performance is driven by the distribution of damage to the components. We test this solution procedure against the nonlinear integer solver in LINGO 13 and apply the formulation and solution strategy to the Eastern Interconnect where the seismic hazard primarily stems from the New Madrid Seismic Zone.

Recently, a parameter error identification method which is based on Lagrange multipliers corresponding to a single measurement scan has been developed. This paper provides an improvement of this method via the use of multiple measurement scans which increases the local redundancy at no additional cost. This leads to identification of errors which could otherwise not be identified. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the limitations of the single scan method and also shows the relationship between the number of scans, the normalized Lagrange multipliers and the normalized residuals. The presented method is easy to implement since estimation of different scans can be executed independent of each other by using an existing state estimation program.

1150,,"Short term voltage stability poses a significant threat to system stability and reliability. This paper applies dynamic VAr injection to ensure short term voltage stability following a large disturbance in a power system with high concentration of induction motor loads. Decelerating and stalling of induction motor loads is considered to be the major cause of fault induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) and short term voltage stability. If system dynamics are not taken into account properly, the proposed control solution may be an expensive over design or an under design that is not capable of eliminating FIDVR problems completely. In this work, the optimal amount and locations for installing dynamic reactive resources are found by control vector parameterization (CVP), a dynamic optimization approach. The efficiency and effectiveness of this approach is improved by utilizing results from trajectory sensitivity analysis, singular value decomposition and linear programming optimization.

But not every partitioning is equally good for all applications; different applications have different goals, or attributes, against which solutions should be evaluated. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines a conventional graph partitioning algorithm with an evolutionary algorithm to partition a power network to optimize a multi-attribute objective function based on electrical distances, cluster sizes, the number of clusters, and cluster connectedness. Results for the IEEE RTS-96 show that clusters produced by this method can be used to identify buses with dynamically coherent voltage angles, without the need for dynamic simulation. Application of the method to the IEEE 118-bus and a 2383-bus case indicates that when a network is well partitioned into zones, intra-zone transactions have less impact on power flows outside of the zone; i.e., good partitioning reduces loop flows. This property is particularly useful for power system applications where ensuring deliverability is important, such as transmission planning or determination of synchronous reserve zones.",WOS:000326184100154,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Cotilla-Sanchez, E., Hines, P.

1154,,"Reactive power control is a fundamental issue in microgrids, especially during islanded mode operation with no support from the main grid. Lack of infinite bus, tightly coupled generation and consumption, and existence of nondispatchable intermittent renewable power sources reinforce the need for a new VVC scheme. This paper presents a new model predictive control (MPC)-based dynamic voltage and var control (VVC) scheme, which includes the dynamics of the microgrid in the VVC formulation. The MPC-based controller uses a simplified voltage prediction model to predict the voltage behavior of the system for a time horizon ahead. The advantage of this method is that it can avoid unstable voltage conditions in microgrids by prediction of the instability ahead of time. This method can also avoid voltage drops or swells in any of the phases of the system since the model can predict the voltage of each phase separately. Also, the presented method can be implemented online so it can efficiently use the time-variant reactive capabilities of the distributed generators to compensate for reactive power needs of the system.

Energy storage can help reduce the power imbalance due to the mismatch between the available renewable power and the load. How much can storage reduce this power imbalance? How much storage is needed to achieve this reduction? This paper presents a simple analytic model that leads to some answers to these questions. Considering the multitimescale grid operation, we formulate the power imbalance problem for each timescale as an infinite horizon stochastic control problem and show that a greedy policy minimizes the average magnitude of the residual power imbalance. Observing from the wind power data that in shorter timescales the power imbalance can be modeled as an iid zero-mean Laplace distributed process, we obtain closed form expressions for the minimum cost and the stationary distribution of the stored power. We show that most of the reduction in the power imbalance can be achieved with relatively small storage capacity. In longer timescales, the correlation in the power imbalance cannot be ignored. As such, we relax the iid assumption to a weakly dependent stationary process and quantify the limit on the minimum cost for arbitrarily large storage capacity.",WOS:000326184100060,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Su, H.

1169,,"The islanding detection is one of the most important issues for grid-connection of the distributed generation (DG) systems. Several recent researches have developed two types of islanding detection methods (IDMs) with high-performance. One is the power and voltage (P-V) characteristic of load based IDM, and the other is the inverter's switching frequency based IDM. Although the above IDMs have no non-detection zone (NDZ) theoretically, their usefulness mainly depends on the control performance of the inverter in practice. In other words, the inverter must achieve the decoupled real and reactive control and successful operation of phase-locked loop (PLL). To deal with these problems, this paper describes the design of inverter controller to improve both system stability and islanding detection performance with the NDZ. The proposed controller uses the magnitude and phase of measured voltage directly instead of using the direct and quadrature axes voltages and currents. Additionally, it does not need an instant phase of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage, which is required in the conventional controller, and therefore makes it possible for the PLL independent control.

Differentials in the LMPs are due to system congestion and so are merely manifestations of binding constraints in the transmission network.

1212,,"This paper presents an improved decomposition framework to accelerate the convergence of linear sensitivity factor (LSF) and Benders decomposition (BD) based methods for network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problems. Classical LSF and BD methods solve NCUC problems by an iterative procedure between a master UC problem and transmission network evaluation subproblems. Subproblems evaluate the transmission network security of a master UC solution, and feedback violated network constraints or Benders feasibility cuts to the UC problem for seeking a feasible UC solution that could mitigate transmission violations. However, classical methods often converge very slowly and introduce major computational bottlenecks. This paper presents an improved decomposition framework by embedding network evaluation subproblems into the branch-and-bound (BAB)/branch-and-cut (BAC) procedure of the master UC problem. Thus, instead of iteratively solving the UC master problem and network evaluation subproblems, the NCUC problem is solved in one single integrated procedure by performing network evaluations at each BAB/BAC node. The proposed methods reduce the number of BAB/BAC nodes to be solved in the UC problem at the cost of additional network evaluations. Numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed decomposition framework. The benefit of the proposed decomposition framework would be significant when a system is heavily congested and a large number of iterations is expected for the classical methods.

Modeling the dynamic behavior of a large population of responsive loads is especially important to evaluate the effectiveness of various demand response strategies. In this paper, a highly accurate aggregated model is developed for a population of air conditioning loads. The model effectively includes statistical information of the load population, systematically deals with load heterogeneity, and accounts for second-order dynamics necessary to accurately capture the transient dynamics in the collective response. Based on the model, a novel aggregated control strategy is designed for the load population under realistic conditions. The proposed controller is fully responsive and achieves the control objective without sacrificing end-use performance. The proposed aggregated modeling and control strategy is validated through realistic simulations using GridLAB-D.

1299,,"With the increasing penetration of wind power into the power grid, maintaining system reliability has been a challenging issue for ISOs/RTOs, due to the intermittent nature of wind power. In addition to the traditional reserves provided by thermal, hydro, and gas generators, demand response (DR) programs have gained much attention recently as another reserve resource to mitigate wind power output uncertainty. However, the price-elastic demand curve is not exactly known in advance, which provides another dimension of uncertainty. To accommodate the combined uncertainties from wind power and DR, we allow the wind power output to vary within a given interval with the price-elastic demand curve also varying in this paper. We develop a robust optimization approach to derive an optimal unit commitment decision for the reliability unit commitment runs by ISOs/RTOs, with the objective of maximizing total social welfare under the joint worst-case wind power output and demand response scenario. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage robust mixed-integer programming problem. An exact solution approach leveraging Benders' decomposition is developed to obtain the optimal robust unit commitment schedule for the problem. Additional variables are introduced to parameterize the conservatism of our model and avoid over-protection. Finally, we test the performance of the proposed approach using a case study based on the IEEE 118-bus system. The results verify that our proposed approach can accommodate both wind power and demand response uncertainties, and demand response can help accommodate wind power output uncertainty by lowering the unit load cost.",WOS:000322989900067,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Zhao, C.

1301,,"Prices in electricity markets are given by the dual variables associated with the supply-demand constraint in the dispatch problem. However, in unit-commitment-based day-ahead markets, these variables are not easy to obtain. A common approach relies on re-solving the dispatch problem with the commitment decisions fixed, and utilizing the associated dual variables. This avenue may lead to inadequate revenues to generators, which has led to the introduction of uplift payments made by the market operator for further compensating the generators. An alternative pricing mechanism known as convex hull pricing has been proposed to reduce or eliminate uplift payments. Computation of these prices requires the global maximization of an associated Lagrangian dual problem. In this paper, we present an extreme-point-based procedure for obtaining a global maximizer. Unlike standard subgradient schemes where an arbitrary subgradient is used, we present an extreme-point subdifferential (EPSD) algorithm; this is a novel technique in which the steepest ascent direction is constructed by solving a continuous quadratic program. The EPSD algorithm initiates a move along this direction, employing an a priori constant steplength, with the intent of reaching the boundary of the face. A backtracking scheme selects a steplength that ensures descent with respect to a suitably defined merit function. As most electricity markets today co-optimize energy and reserves, an extension of the proposed convex hull pricing algorithm is provided for such integrated markets. Under suitable assumptions, we compare outcomes of energy-only and energy-reserve co-optimizedmarkets under different pricing and uplift rules. In these examples, pricing rules have a major impact on the total payment while the uplift payment only accounts for a small portion of it. We also observe that it remains unclear whether marginal-cost pricing or convex-hull pricing leads to higher total payment.",WOS:000322989900006,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Wang, G., Shanbhag, U.

1306,,"High penetration of intermittent renewable energy imposes new challenges to the operation and control of power systems. Power system security needs to be ensured dynamically as the system operating condition continuously changes. The dynamic stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF) control algorithm using the Adaptive Critic Designs (ACDs) has shown promising dynamic power flow control capability and has been demonstrated in a small system. To further investigate the potential of the DSOPF control algorithm for large power systems, a 70-bus test power system with different generation resources, including large wind plants, is developed. A two-level DSOPF control scheme is proposed in this paper to scale up the DSOPF algorithm for this 70-bus system. The lower-level area DSOPF controllers control their own area power network. The top-level global DSOPF controller coordinates the area controllers by adjusting the inter-area tie-line flows. This two-level architecture distributes the control and computation burden to multiple area DSOPF controllers, and reduces the training difficulty for implementing the DSOPF control for a large power network.

1308,,"Major transmission projects are needed to integrate and to deliver renewable energy (RE) resources. Cost recovery is a serious impediment to transmission investment. A negotiation methodology is developed in this study to guide transmission investment for RE integration. Built on Nash bargaining theory, the methodology models a negotiation between an RE generation company and a transmission company for the cost sharing and recovery of a new transmission line permitting delivery of RE to the grid. Findings from a six-bus test case demonstrate the Pareto efficiency of the approach as well as its fairness, in that it is consistent with one commonly used definition of fairness in cooperative games, the Nash cooperative solution. Hence, the approach could potentially be used as a guideline for RE investors. The study also discusses the possibility of using RE subsidies to steer the negotiated solution towards a system-optimal transmission plan that maximizes total net benefits for all market participants. The findings suggest that RE subsidies can be effectively used to achieve system optimality when RE prices are fixed through bilateral contracts but have limited ability to achieve system optimality when RE prices are determined through locational marginal pricing.

We formulate CCUC as a two-stage robust optimization problem and develop a decomposition framework to enable tractable computation. In our framework, the master problem makes unit commitment decisions and the subproblem discovers the worst-case contingency scenarios. By using linearization techniques and duality theory, we transform the subproblem into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP).

The newly proposed architecture facilitates faster and more accurate frequency restoration during primary frequency control, by providing decentralized robust control to several selected pilot generators in each area. At the local level, these decentralized robust controllers are designed to quickly damp oscillations and restore frequency after large faults and disturbances in the system. Incorporating this supplementary governor control helps the system reach the nominal frequency without necessarily requiring secondary frequency control. Thus, at the area level, automatic generation control (AGC) actions are alleviated in terms of conducting frequency restoration. Moreover, at the area level, AGC coordinates with the decentralized robust controllers to successfully perform tie-line power balancing, while efficiently damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations.

1315,,"To allow for high penetration of distributed generation and alternative energy units, it is critical to minimize the complexity of generator controls and the need for close coordination across regions. We propose that existing controls be replaced by a two-tier structure of local control operating within a global context of situational awareness. Flatness as an extension of controllability for nonlinear systems is a key to enable planning and optimization at various levels of the grid in this structure. In this study, flatness-based control for automatic generation control (AGC) of a multi-machine system with high penetration of wind energy is investigated. The local control tracks the reference phase which is obtained through economic dispatch at the global control level. As a result of applying the flatness-based method, the machine system is decoupled into linear controllable systems in canonical form. Therefore, the control strategy results in a distributed AGC formulation which is significantly easier to design and implement compared to conventional AGC. Practical constraints such as generator ramping rates can be considered in designing the local controllers. The proposed strategy demonstrates promising performance in mitigating frequency deviations and the overall structure could facilitate operation of other nontraditional generators.",WOS:000322989900097,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Variani, M.

The extended LMPs (ELMPs) were established as the optimal Lagrangian multiplier of the dual of the unit commitment and economic dispatch problem. Commitment related costs are included and uplift payments are minimized. To obtain ELMPs, the dual problem should be solved with multiplier optimality and computational efficiency. Subgradient methods suffer from the multiplier zigzagging difficulty. Cutting plane methods encounter computational complexity issues in calculating query points. In this paper, a subgradient simplex cutting plane method is developed to obtain ELMPs. Transmission is not considered for simplicity, while key features of ELMPs are still captured. By innovatively using subgradients and simplex tableaus, query points are efficiently obtained through an adaptive three-level scheme.

1343,,"We propose a branch flow model for the analysis and optimization of mesh as well as radial networks. The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints.

The connection of future distribution networks may not be simple radial circuits and analyzing the reliability of such a network is usually complicated and time consuming.

We formulate the attack as an optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the difference between the PMU's receiver clock offset (with respect to the GPS time measured by the onboard satellite clocks) before and after the attack. Since the PMU uses this clock offset to compute a synchronized time stamp for its measurements, an error in the receiver clock offset introduces a proportional phase error in the voltage or current phase measurements provided by the PMU. For the most general case, the decision variables in the optimization problem are the satellites' ephemerides, pseudoranges, and the receiver's Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates. The constraints are cast such that the decision variables and the satellite positions computed from the solution of the optimization problem are close to their pre-attack values, so as to avoid possible detection schemes that check for large jumps in the values of these variables. We show that the spoofing attack is feasible for any number of visible satellites.

1425,,"Due to increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy and introduction of demand response programs, uncertainties occur in both supply and demand sides in real time for the current power grid system. To address these uncertainties, most ISOs/RTOs perform reliability unit commitment runs after the day-ahead financial market to ensure sufficient generation capacity available in real time to accommodate uncertainties. Two-stage stochastic unit commitment and robust unit commitment formulations have been introduced and studied recently to provide day-ahead unit commitment decisions. However, both approaches have limitations: 1) computational challenges due to the large scenario size for the stochastic optimization approach and 2) conservativeness for the robust optimization approach. In this paper, we propose a novel unified stochastic and robust unit commitment model that takes advantage of both stochastic and robust optimization approaches, that is, this innovative model can achieve a low expected total cost while ensuring the system robustness. By introducing weights for the components for the stochastic and robust parts in the objective function, system operators can adjust the weights based on their preferences. Finally, a Benders' decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently.

The integration of microgrids in distribution systems will offer a decentralized control of local resources for satisfying the network reliability and the power quality required by local loads. The objective in this paper is to minimize the total system planning cost comprising investment and operation costs of local microgrids, the co-optimized planning of large generating units and transmission lines, and the expected cost of unserved energy. The cost of unserved energy reflects the cost of load shedding which is added to the objective function for reliability considerations. The microgrid-based co-optimization planning problem is decomposed into a planning problem and annual reliability subproblem. The optimal integer planning decisions calculated in the planning problem will be examined against the system reliability limits in the subproblem and the planning decisions will be revised using proper feasibility cuts if the annual reliability limits are violated. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed microgrid-based co-optimization planning in power systems and explore the economic and reliability merits of microgrid planning as compared to grid-based generation and transmission upgrades.",WOS:000322139300103,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Khodaei, A. and Shahidehpour, M.","Univ Houston, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA",41,10.1109/Tpwrs.2012.2224676,May,0885-8950,2,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,annual reliability,co-optimization of transmission and generation planning,microgrids,power system expansion planning,electricity markets,expansion,coordination,costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,187SK,,1582-1590,7174,Journal Article,,,Microgrid-Based Co-Optimization of Generation and Transmission Planning in Power Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31,Microgrid-Based Co-Optimization of Generation and Transmission Planning in Power Systems,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000322139300103,28,,,2013,,Univ Houston,USA

In principle, this could enable greater use of baseload generation, and encourage investments in intermittent capacity such as wind and solar. If storage is to penetrate the system, the marginal value of storage capacity must be high enough to enable investments in storage. To have a significant impact on investments in intermittent technologies, it must be large enough to affect the prices on the system. This research develops a theoretical framework to evaluate the marginal values of the components of a storage system, and to characterize the impact of storage on the price patterns in the system.

We first formulate the EV charging scheduling problem as an optimal control problem, whose objective is to impose a generalized notion of valley-filling, and study properties of optimal charging profiles. We then give a decentralized algorithm to iteratively solve the optimal control problem. In each iteration, EVs update their charging profiles according to the control signal broadcast by the utility company, and the utility company alters the control signal to guide their updates. The algorithm converges to optimal charging profiles (that are as ""flat"" as they can possibly be) irrespective of the specifications (e.g., maximum charging rate and deadline) of EVs, even if EVs do not necessarily update their charging profiles in every iteration, and use potentially outdated control signal when they update. Moreover, the algorithm only requires each EV solving its local problem, hence its implementation requires low computation capability.

Theoretical analysis shows that there exists a corresponding formulation of the dynamic control parameters with multiple DEs to give the desired responses. Therefore, the proposed control method has a solid theoretical basis. The method is based on dynamically and adaptively adjusting DE control parameters to ensure that actual voltage responses follow the desired outputs. Also, it is based on local and the other DEs' voltages without the need of the full system data and extensive studies to tune the control parameters. Hence, the method is autonomous and adaptive for variable operational situations, and has the plug-and-play feature with a high tolerance to unavailable or inaccurate system data. Thus, it is suitable for broad utility application. Simulation results from various conditions, such as asynchronous start of multiple DEs, disappearance of the original disturbance in the middle of the control process, and operation in looped distribution systems, confirm the performance, validity, and flexibility of the proposed control method.

The intent is to examine the influence of uncertainty due to photovoltaic (PV) generation resources and loads. PV generation uncertainty may have a significant impact on transmission systems since this resource is easily influenced by changing environmental conditions. However, it is prudent to include generation dispatch in the PPF algorithm since the dispatching strategy compensates for PV generation injections and influences the uncertainty in the results. The proposed PPF algorithm is based on the cumulant method. The Gram-Charlier expansion is applied to approximate the distribution of probabilistic variables. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a probabilistic optimal power dispatching strategy which considers uncertainty problems in the economic dispatch and optimizes the expected value of the total cost with the overload probability as a constraint.

A local controller on each bus of the network monitors the bus voltage and, whenever there is a voltage violation, it uses locally available information to estimate the amount of reactive power that needs to be injected into the bus in order to correct the violation. If the DERs connected to the bus can collectively provide the reactive power estimated by the local controller, they are instructed to do so. Otherwise, the local controller initiates a request for additional reactive power support from other controllers at neighboring buses through a distributed algorithm that relies on a local exchange of information among neighboring controllers. We show that the proposed architecture helps prevent voltage violations and shapes the voltage profile in radial distribution networks, even in the presence of considerable penetration of variable generation and loads.

The optimal storage scheduling strategy is shown to be an inventory control-like policy, which through mild approximation yields affine relationships with the state variables.

1518,,"In response to the need for the decarbonization of the transport sector, it is expected that large fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) will constitute an important share of the electricity demand. This evolution is likely to be accompanied by a parallel evolution of the electricity supply business with the deployment of smart grid technologies. As a consequence, it is expected that demand will feature higher potential for communication and control, which will enable its active participation in the daily operational planning of power systems. In particular, EVs being equipped with a battery can both defer their demand or inject electricity back into the system. However, to achieve volumes that can have an impact on the system, these demands need to be aggregated and operated as an ensemble. This paper proposes the necessary adaptations to include the input of EV aggregation to electricity markets.

However, in this paper, it is shown that distribution companies can alternatively encourage DG investors into DG contracts that can significantly benefit the utility network. In this regard, a new algorithm is proposed to determine the best sites, sizes, and optimal payment incentives under such special contracts for committed-type DG projects to offset distribution network investment costs. On one hand, the aim is to allocate DGs such that the present value profit gained by the distribution company is maximized via procuring power from DGs and the market at a minimum expense. On the other hand, each DG unit's individual profit is taken into account to assure that private DG investment remains economical.

The beneficial impacts of incorporating phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements into the state estimator have been studied by many researchers. However, the availability of PMU measurements and many practical implementation issues still need to be resolved. This paper addresses one specific and important issue when integrating PMU measurements into the state estimator, namely, determining the optimal buffer length for PMU data. Due to different reporting rates of the conventional measurements and PMU measurements, a memory buffer of PMU measurements is recommended to be processed ahead of the state estimation. The impact of PMU measurement buffer length on state estimation is discussed. A procedure to determine the optimal buffer length of PMU measurements is presented.

Since the efficiency of emissions controls can depend on generator loading, this additional capacity can increase generator emissions rates. Another method of accommodating wind is using demand response, which has system loads that more closely follow supply. Using a case study based on the Texas power system, we examine the emissions and cost impacts of using these two strategies to accommodate wind. While we find that wind decreases loading and increases emissions rates of generators, it has a positive net emissions benefit overall.

We propose models of costs to utility companies arising from user demand fluctuations, and models of user satisfaction with the difference between the nominal demand and the actual consumption. We design utility functions for the company and the users, and obtain a Nash equilibrium using backward induction. In addition to a single-user-type scenario, we also consider a scenario with multiple types of users, each of whom responds differently to time-dependent prices.

The reason is that high-penetration controllable load may have substantial impact on system frequency response (SFR). However, the effect of the frequency-related load-damping coefficient is still not completely understood. This paper investigates the effect of frequency-sensitive load on system frequency using typical SFR model. Theoretic analyses based on transfer functions show that the frequency deviation under a different load-damping coefficient is relatively small and bounded when the power system is essentially stable; while the frequency deviation can be accelerated when a power system is unstable after disturbance. For the stable case, the largest frequency dip under a perturbation and the corresponding critical time can be derived by inverse Laplace transformation using a full model considering load-damping coefficient. Further, the error in evaluating the load-frequency coefficient gives the largest impact to frequency deviation right at the time when the largest frequency dip occurs. Multiple-machine cases and automatic generation control (AGC) are also included in the analyses with verifications by simulation studies.

1590,,"Deregulation of energy markets, penetration of renewables, advanced metering capabilities, and the urge for situational awareness, all call for system-wide power system state estimation (PSSE). Implementing a centralized estimator though is practically infeasible due to the complexity scale of an interconnection, the communication bottleneck in real-time monitoring, regional disclosure policies, and reliability issues. In this context, distributed PSSE methods are treated here under a unified and systematic framework. A novel algorithm is developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It leverages existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies, exhibits low communication load, and its convergence to the centralized estimates is guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond the conventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodates a robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressive sampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the state and identifies corrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are numerically evaluated using the IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4200-bus benchmarks. Simulations demonstrate that the attainable accuracy can be reached within a few inter-area exchanges, while largest residual tests are outperformed.",WOS:000322139300107,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Kekatos, V. and Giannakis, G.

Validation of the appliance-level load models is carried out by comparing the models' output with the real electricity consumption data for the associated appliances. The appliance-level load models are aggregated to generate load profiles for a distribution circuit, which are validated against the load profiles of an actual distribution circuit.

We focus on opportunities to centrally control loads with high accuracy but low requirements for sensing and communications infrastructure. We compare cases when measured load state information (e. g., power consumption and temperature) is 1) available in real time; 2) available, but not in real time; and 3) not available. We use Markov chain models to describe the temperature state evolution of populations of TCLs, and Kalman filtering for both state and joint parameter/state estimation. A look-ahead proportional controller broadcasts control signals to all TCLs, which always remain in their temperature dead-band. Simulations indicate that it is possible to achieve power tracking RMS errors in the range of 0.26%-9.3% of steady state aggregated power consumption. We also report results in terms of the generator compliance threshold which is commonly used in industry.

The variance estimates are achieved using two closed-form multidimensional Taylor series approximations, the details of which are fully derived here. The proposed method is validated using a Monte Carlo simulation with a low order model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system under both ambient and probing conditions, with multiple modes closely spaced in frequency, and is compared to the regularized robust recursive least squares (R3LS) method.

However, the switching operation itself represents a step change in power systems, which is, to some extent, similar to a contingency that can bring disturbances into systems. This paper proposes a new model for multi-period, static-security-constrained transmission switching. Because the power flow on the network will be redistributed instantaneously after the switching operations, the new model involves using disjunctive programming, which considers two sets of power flow equations under possibly different topologies before/after switching. Each switchable transmission element is modeled into four actions or disjunctions. An action transition diagram coupling of four actions in different hours is used to represent feasible paths of instantaneous changes in the element status. Disjunctive formulations are transformed into mixed-integer programming problems.

1712,,"The paper proposes a framework for modeling and analysis of the dynamics of supply, demand, and clearing prices in power systems with real-time retail pricing and information asymmetry. Characterized by passing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, real-time pricing creates a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and the market layer of the system. In the absence of a carefully designed control law, such direct feedback can increase sensitivity and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and generation. It is shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's maximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the generalized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this ratio increases, the system may become more volatile. Since new demand response technologies increase the price-elasticity of demand, and since increased penetration of distributed generation can also increase the uncertainty in price-based demand response, the theoretical findings suggest that the architecture under examination can potentially lead to increased volatility. This study highlights the need for assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally strike the trade-offs between volatility/robustness and performance metrics such as economic efficiency and environmental efficiency.",WOS:000310389000022,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Roozbehani, M., Dahleh, M.

The objective is to minimize the total system cost in the planning horizon, comprising investment and operation costs and salvage values subject to long-term system reliability and short-term operation constraints.

The planning decisions calculated in the planning problem would also satisfy the short-term operation constraints. A detailed model of thermal and hydro units is considered using the mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. In addition, a multi-state representation for the expansion planning of renewable energy units is explored. The proposed approach considers customers' demand response as an option for reducing the short-term operation costs. The planning problem solution is applied to the annual reliability subproblems which examine system reliability indices as a post-processor. If the reliability limit is not satisfied, additional reliability constraints will be introduced which are based on the sensitivity of system reliability index to investment decisions. The new reliability constraints are added to the next iterations of the planning problem to govern the revised plan for the optimal expansion.

1719,,"Fast and accurate unveiling of power-line outages is of paramount importance not only for preventing faults that may lead to blackouts, but also for routine monitoring and control tasks of the smart grid, including state estimation and optimal power flow. Existing approaches are either challenged by the combinatorial complexity issues involved and are thus limited to identifying single and double line-outages or they invoke less pragmatic assumptions such as conditionally independent phasor angle measurements available across the grid. Using only a subset of voltage phasor angle data, the present paper develops a near real-time algorithm for identifying multiple line outages at the affordable complexity of solving a sparse signal reconstruction problem via either greedy steps or coordinate descent iterations. Recognizing that the number of line outages is a small fraction of the total number of lines, the novel approach relies on reformulating the DC linear power flow model as a sparse overcomplete expansion and lever-aging contemporary advances in compressive sampling and variable selection. This sparse representation can also be extended to incorporate available information on the internal system and more general line-parameter faults.

We applied the method to a model of cascading failure in a power network with n=2896 branches and identify unique, minimal n-k branch contingencies (2 <= k <= 5) that cause large cascades, many of which would be missed by using pre-contingency flows, linearized line outage distribution factors, or performance indices as screening factors.

The major purpose is to deal with uncertainties of reliability data in PMU. The membership functions of reliability parameters can be built based on statistics and fuzzy set theory. The fuzzy hierarchical Markov models are presented to quantify membership functions of multiple reliability indices of the entire PMU. A fuzzy sensitivity analysis index is developed to estimate the effects of parameter uncertainties on the uncertainty of PMU reliability and identify the most sensitive component(s).

Variable generation (VG) is variable and uncertain at multiple timescales, and it is important that system operators understand how each of these characteristics impact their systems since each may have different mitigation strategies. To date, many of the studies of VG integration are limited to studying at one time resolution and therefore cannot analyze the variability and uncertainty impacts across multiple timescales. Here we study the variability and uncertainty impacts across multiple operational timescales. A model is used which integrates multiple scheduling sub-models with different update frequencies, time resolutions, and decision horizons. Using metrics that describe reliability and costs with a methodology that describes the sensitivities and tradeoffs of variability and uncertainty impacts separately with respect to the conditions that cause those impacts, case studies are performed which display greater information on expectations of these impacts on future systems with high penetrations of VG.",WOS:000309996500018,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Ela, E. and O'Malley, M.","Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",37,10.1109/Tpwrs.2012.2185816,Aug,0885-8950,3,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,automatic generation control,economic dispatch,power system operations,power system reliability,unit commitment,variable generation,wind integration,constrained unit commitment,wind power-generation,stochastic security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,022XC,,1324-1333,7491,Journal Article,,,Studying the Variability and Uncertainty Impacts of Variable Generation at Multiple Timescales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,43,Studying the Variability and Uncertainty Impacts of Variable Generation at Multiple Timescales,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000309996500018,27,,,2012,,Natl Renewable Energy Lab,USA

Recent research shows that, by optimally dispatching the network topology along with generation resources, significant congestion costs may be avoided. Optimal topology control, i.e., appropriate changes of transmission-line status, for real-sized power networks requires the solution of a computationally intractable mixed-integer linear program; however, it appears that much of the cost savings may be attained by changing the status of just a few lines. This paper proposes tractable transmission topology control policies, which employ sensitivity information readily available from the ED to select candidate lines to change status while maintaining system connectivity. Implementation on the IEEE 118-bus test system found that our best performing policy captured an average of 96% of the potential cost savings.

However, the current extra-market approach to its assimilation into the electric grid will not scale at deep penetration levels. In this paper, we investigate how an independent wind power producer might optimally offer its variable power into a competitive electricity market for energy. Starting with a stochastic model for wind power production and a model for a perfectly competitive two-settlement market, we derive explicit formulae for optimal contract offerings and the corresponding optimal expected profit. As wind is an inherently variable source of energy, we explore the sensitivity of optimal expected profit to uncertainty in the underlying wind process. We also examine the role of forecast information and recourse markets in this setting.

A novel methodology for very-short-term load forecasting is introduced in this paper, and its performance is tested on a set of historical, demand-side, 5-min data. The approach employs an ensemble of kernel-based Gaussian processes (GPs) whose predictions constitute the terms of a linear model. Adoption of a set of cost functions assessing model accuracy allows the formulation of a multiobjective optimization problem with respect to model coefficients. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search for a solution based on the previous step data while Pareto optimality theory provides the necessary conditions to identify an optimal one. Thus, it is the optimized linear model that yields the final prediction over the designated time interval. The proposed methodology is examined on 5-min-interval predictions for 30-min-ahead horizon.

1793,,"We develop a market-based mechanism that enables a building smart microgrid operator (SMO) to offer regulation service reserves and meet the associated obligation of fast response to commands issued by the wholesale market independent system operator (ISO) who provides energy and purchases reserves. The proposed market-based mechanism allows the SMO to control the behavior of internal loads through price signals and to provide feedback to the ISO. A regulation service reserves quantity is transacted between the SMO and the ISO for a relatively long period of time (e. g., a one-hour-long time-scale). During this period the ISO follows shorter time-scale stochastic dynamics to repeatedly request from the SMO to decrease or increase its consumption. We model the operational task of selecting an optimal short time-scale dynamic pricing policy as a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes average SMO and ISO utility. We then formulate an associated nonlinear programming static problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal utility. We study an asymptotic regime in which this upper bound is shown to be tight and the static policy provides an efficient approximation of the dynamic pricing policy. Equally importantly, this framework allows us to optimize the long time-scale decision of determining the optimal regulation service reserve quantity.

1801,,We show how an adaptive control algorithm can improve the performance of distributed reactive power control in a radial distribution circuit with a high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) cells. The adaptive algorithm is designed to balance the need for power quality (voltage regulation) with the desire to minimize power loss. The adaptation law determines whether the objective function minimizes power losses or voltage regulation based on whether the voltage at each node remains close enough to the voltage at the substation. The reactive power is controlled through the inverter on the PV cells. The control signals are determined based on local instantaneous measurements of the real and reactive power at each node. We use the example of a single branch radial distribution circuit to demonstrate the ability of the adaptive scheme to effectively reduce voltage variations while simultaneously minimizing the power loss in the studied cases.

Navy for their future combatant system, consists of several voltage source converters (VSCs). The proposed architecture is tightly-coupled, power-limited and its performance needs to be evaluated for security, reliability, and survivability. Following system damage or a fault, the current flow pattern in the DC network may change, which may result in the failure of VSCs due to overvoltage developed across them in certain operating conditions. For a given MVDC system, DC voltage reference setting for one of the VSCs operating in the voltage regulator mode, and the optimal power reference settings of the remaining VSCs in the power dispatcher mode have to be pre-determined. These settings and control modes of VSCs are needed to maintain the DC voltage within desired margins (usually 5% around the nominal DC voltage), both in ""pre-fault"" and ""post-fault outage"" conditions.

With the naturally intermittent renewable energy, such as wind energy, playing more important roles, system robustness becomes a must. In this paper, we propose a robust optimization approach to accommodate wind output uncertainty, with the objective of providing a robust unit commitment schedule for the thermal generators in the day-ahead market that minimizes the total cost under the worst wind power output scenario. Robust optimization models the randomness using an uncertainty set which includes the worst-case scenario, and protects this scenario under the minimal increment of costs. In our approach, the power system will be more reliable because the worst-case scenario has been considered.

However, the power grid is evolving towards a state where the adaptations are no longer as easy (e. g., large amounts of limited control, renewable generation), necessitating new approaches. In this paper, we propose a discrepancy-bounded local search (DBLS) that encapsulates the complexity of power flow modeling in a black box that may be queried for information about the quality of a proposed expansion.

The model considers settlement mechanisms in markets with locational marginal prices (LMPs), where wind power is not necessarily penalized from deviations between DA schedule and real-time (RT) dispatch. We use kernel density estimation to produce a probabilistic wind power forecast, whereas uncertainties in DA and RT prices are assumed to be Gaussian. Utility theory and conditional value at risk (CVAR) are used to represent the risk preferences of the wind power producers. The model is tested on real-world data from a large-scale wind farm in the United States. Optimal DA bids are derived under different assumptions for risk preferences and deviation penalty schemes. The results show that in the absence of a deviation penalty, the optimal bidding strategy is largely driven by price expectations. A deviation penalty brings the bid closer to the expected wind power forecast.

1831,,"This paper compares applications of scenario-based and interval optimization approaches to stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (Stochastic SCUC). The uncertainty of wind power generation is considered in this study to compare the two approaches, while other types of uncertainty can be addressed similarly. For the simulation of uncertainty, the scenario-based approach considers the Monte Carlo (MC) method, while lower and upper bounds are adopted in the interval optimization. The Stochastic SCUC problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) problem and solved using the two approaches. The scenario-based solutions are insensitive to the number of scenarios, but present additional computation burdens. The interval optimization solution requires less computation and automatically generates lower and upper bounds for the operation cost and generation dispatch, but its optimal solution is very sensitive to the uncertainty interval. The numerical results on a six-bus system and the modified IEEE 118-bus system show the attributes of the two approaches for solving the Stochastic SCUC problem.

1842,,"Prony analysis has been applied to estimate inter-area oscillation modes using phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. To suppress noise and signal offset effects, a high-order Prony model usually is used to over-fit the data. As such, some trivial modes are intentionally added to improve the estimation accuracy of the dominant modes. Therefore, to reduce the rate of false alarms, it is important to distinguish between the dominant modes that reflect the dynamic features of a power system and the trivial modes that are artificially introduced to improve the estimation accuracy. In this paper, a stepwise-regression method is applied to automatically identify the dominant modes from Prony analysis. A Monte Carlo method is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using data obtained from simulations. Field-measured PMU data are used to verify the applicability of the proposed method.

The online stage is based solely on the utilization of the time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements of traveling waves propagating from the fault-occurrence point to synchronized wide-area monitoring devices installed at strategically selected substations. The captured waveforms are processed together at the time of fault in order to identify the location of the fault under study. The overall performance of the developed technique is demonstrated using Alternative Transients Program (ATP) simulations of fault transients and postprocessing the faulted waveform data via discrete wavelet transform.

1866,,"An efficient, timely, and accurate state estimation is a prerequisite for most energy management system (EMS) applications in power system control centers. The emerging wide-area measurement systems (WAMSs) offer new opportunities for developing more effective methods to monitor power system dynamics online. Recently, alternative methods for power system state estimation have caught much attention. Due to the nonlinearity of state transition and observation equation, linearization and Jacobian matrix calculation are indispensible in the existing methods of power system state estimation. This makes WAMS' high performance compromised by burdensome calculation. In order to overcome the drawbacks, this study tries to develop an effective state estimation method without the linearization and Jacobian matrix calculation. Firstly, unscented transformation is introduced as an effective method to calculate the means and covariances of a random vector undergoing a nonlinear transformation. Secondly, by embedding the unscented transformation into the Kalman filter process, a method is developed for power system dynamic state estimation.

The optimized reconfiguration is achieved by prioritizing power delivered to vital loads over semi-vital and nonvital loads.

Analysis of the nonconvex reconfiguration formulation is done by an appropriate nonconvex solver and by convex approximation. Unlike the nonconvex solution that is based on branch-and-bound methods, convex approximation significantly reduces complexity. It is shown that for the hybrid SPS reconfiguration problem, low complexity convex approximations are effective in finding optimal solutions. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the power delivered to loads is presented to showcase the system robustness against random fault scenarios. A combined objective of maximizing power delivery and minimizing the number of switching actions is included in the analysis.

A global optimum solution to the OPF problem can be retrieved from a solution of this convex dual problem whenever the duality gap is zero. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided in this paper to guarantee the existence of no duality gap for the OPF problem. This condition is satisfied by the standard IEEE benchmark systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses as well as several randomly generated systems. Since this condition is hard to study, a sufficient zero-duality-gap condition is also derived. This sufficient condition holds for IEEE systems after small resistance (10(-5) per unit) is added to every transformer that originally assumes zero resistance. We investigate this sufficient condition and justify that it holds widely in practice.

1938,,"An accurate estimation of critical load levels (CLLs) is beneficial in evaluating the confidence level for the predicted locational marginal prices (LMPs) in power markets. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to quickly identify CLLs under the with-loss-DCOPF framework. The proposed method approximates the trajectory of DCOPF solutions with respect to the system load variations. The quadratic coefficients of the trajectory can be efficiently obtained by solving a small-scale nonlinear system of equations formed by the variable substitution method, which does not require additional OPF runs and is thus more computationally efficient than existing methods such as binary search and interpolation. The obtained trajectory can be used for a quick calculation of OPF solutions without re-running OPF.

These methods differ with respect to information exchange requirements, computational complexity, and physical implementability. A novel look-ahead interactive dispatch that internalizes inter-temporal constraints at the DERs level, and dispatches the results of distributed decisions subject to spatial security constraints, is proposed as a possible effective algorithm. This method requires only the use of today's static security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) by the system operators. The optimization accounting for inter-temporal constraints, and ramping rates in particular, is done by the DERs while they create their own supply and demand functions.

The traditional approach to the mesh matrices naturally relates to graph theory, where the fundamental loops of a representative graph are found from a spanning tree. While valid, mesh identification is time consuming, involves unnecessary programming overhead, yields dense mesh matrices, and requires developing good search heuristics. The proposed approach uses a connection tensor to form a sparse mesh resistance matrix without resorting to graph theory. It allows for the interconnection of only those meshes circulating around the terminals of each power apparatus, which is more effective than searching for the meshes of an entire power system. Detailed steps to form the tensor and supporting examples illustrate the procedure presented in several scenarios.

Although it is sometimes assumed that the forecast errors are Normally distributed, it is a special case arising from the geographical dispersion of wind resources, as shown in this paper. The distribution of the forecast error needs to be examined individually for every wind farm to determine the impact of this error on trading energy in electricity markets. This paper addresses the problem of modeling the distribution of the forecast errors associated with Persistence forecasts at the level of a single wind farm, and develops a novel, mixed distribution-based model to approximate the distribution of these errors.

The resulting ILP problem is solved for the optimal solution on IEEE 14-, 57-, and 118-bus systems considering zero-injection buses. To extend the formulation to large-scale systems, two heuristics are proposed where the nonlinear problem is decomposed into two separate problems of lesser complexity. The heuristics are evaluated on standard IEEE test cases and a large 2383-bus Polish system. The heuristics yield solutions close to optimal (difference of 1 PMU) solutions on standard IEEE systems, while substantially reducing problem complexity and run time. The placement results obtained with the proposed formulation require fewer PMUs for observability compared to systems with fixed locations of conventional measurements. The results thus potentially provide a more economical solution to system observability compared to those obtained solely with PMU placement.",WOS:000298784500015,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Kavasseri, R. and Srinivasan, S.

2004,,"The rapid increase in wind power capacity over the past decade has resulted from the adoption of policies that encourage the wider use of renewable energy sources in order to reduce CO(2) and the dramatic cost reductions due to technology advancements. The high variability in wind speeds poses major difficulties in power system planning and operations, leading to an acute need for practical planning and operations tools to study the effects of the integration of wind resources into the grid. This paper addresses the need in the planning domain through the development of a computationally efficient probabilistic production simulation approach with the capability to quantify the variable effects of systems for varying levels of wind penetration with the uncertainty in the variability/intermittency effects of wind generation at multiple sites together with the other sources of uncertainty explicitly represented. The simulation approach is based on the identification of the prevailing wind regimes in the regions where wind resources are located and the judicious application of conditional probability concepts in incorporating the wind regime representation. The regimes-based approach described in the paper effectively captures both the seasonal and the diurnal variations of renewable resources and their correlation with the load seasonal and diurnal changes. Additionally, the proposed approach explicitly quantifies the impacts of wind on the additional reserve requirements on the controllable resources.

The two types of protection failures, i.e., undesired-tripping mode and fail-to-operate mode, and their impact on reliability modeling are discussed. A complete Markov model for current-carrying components is established and its simplified form appropriately describes the overall reliability situation of individual components. Concepts of self-down state and induced-down state are introduced and used to build the composite unit model for quantitatively assessing the influence of protection failures on modeling system states. Finally, a Markov model of power systems with protection failures is proposed for system reliability evaluation.

The legacy power system visualization tools, however, restrict the visualization process to follow a limited number of pre-defined patterns created by human designers, thus hindering users' ability to discover. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to interactive visualization of power systems. The proposed approach relies on developing powerful data manipulation algorithms to create visualizations based on the characteristics of empirically or mathematically derived data. Based on this approach, a data-driven model exploratory tool has been developed to enable users to visualize the power system's physical/electrical configurations at various levels and from different perspectives.

This Jacobian matrix provides valuable information, such as in characterizing a generation firm's profit maximizing strategy. We apply the bundle-Newton method utilizing the Jacobian matrix to find a generation firm's maximum profit.

The paper presents a ball-on-concave-surface (BOCS) mechanics system as a power system's adaptive equivalent representing its real-time status and the stability region about a monitored variable. The parameters of the equivalent are adaptive to the operating condition and can online be identified from the phase-plane trajectories of the monitored variable. Accordingly, the stability margin and risk of instability can be estimated. Case studies on a two-generator system and a 179-bus system show that the BOCS system can be applied either locally or for wide-area stability monitoring in real-time calculation of stability margin.

2120,,"To ensure secure real-time power system operations, the system operator must schedule sufficient resources to meet energy demand and operating reserve requirements simultaneously. Under a joint real-time energy-reserve market regime, a dominant market participant can exercise pricing power by withholding reserve capability or by marking up energy offers. This paper examines the short-term impact of the choice of reserve price cap on participant behavior and market outcomes. A Stackelberg game is utilized to analyze the strategic bidding behaviors of the dominant participants assuming a range of reserve price caps and market conditions. The market participants play the role of the leaders, while the independent system operator is treated as a follower. The proposed model is applied to the New England electricity market. The computed solutions show that although the reserve price cap is unable to eliminate physical withholding behaviors, it disciplines the participants and limits incentives to withhold economically. Also, it limits prices to a reasonable level during reserve shortage events when only supply-side market power mitigation options are available. Absent any transmission improvements or effective demand response participation, the reserve price cap remains an effective tool to mitigate the impact of the exercise of supplier market power.",WOS:000289904200013,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Zhao, J.

The intent is to create a planning tool to allow utility system operators to determine the best locations to place trust nodes to increase system security given limited resources and/or hardware constraints.

The NNs are utilized to approximate the unknown subsystem and the interconnection dynamics. By using novel online NN weight update laws with quadratic error terms, the closed-loop signals are shown to be locally asymptotically stable via Lyapunov stability analysis, even in the presence of NN approximation errors in contrast with other NN techniques where a bounded stability is normally assured.

Induction motor kinetic energy deviation has been shown to be identical to the integral of power imbalance. Instead of using voltage as an indicator, the proposed strategy applies a centralized scheme making use of equivalent motor kinetic energy to identify the most effective loads to shed. In order to derive kinetic energy, the equivalent inertia and the speed of the induction motor are needed. A methodology is proposed to obtain these variables through online measurements. Simulations on a sample power system illustrate the novel load shedding strategy and its effectiveness.

With more sophisticated modeling of transmission assets, it is possible to better utilize the current infrastructure to improve the social welfare. Co-optimizing the generation with the network topology has been shown to reduce the total dispatch cost. In this paper, we propose the concept of just-in-time transmission. This concept is predicated on the fact that transmission that is a detriment to network efficiency can be kept offline when not needed and, with the proper smart grid/advanced technology, can be switched back into service once there is a disturbance. We determine which lines to have offline based on the optimal transmission switching model previously proposed. A secondary topic of this paper focuses on flowgate bidding. Approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and implemented within the SPP and NYISO networks, flowgate bidding is defined as allowing a line's flow to exceed its rated capacity for a short period of time for a set penalty, i.e., price.

We propose two novel algorithmic techniques for speeding-up the computational runtime of both problems. First, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the distribution network reconfiguration problem for loss reduction. We formulate the problem of finding incremental branch exchanges as a minimum cost maximum flow problem. This approach finds the best set of concurrent branch exchanges yielding larger loss reduction with fewer iterations, hence significantly reducing the computational runtime. Second, we propose an efficient random walks-based technique for the loss estimation in radial distribution systems. The novelty of this approach lies in its property of localizing the computation. Therefore, bus voltage magnitude updates can be calculated in much shorter computational runtimes in scenarios where the distribution system undergoes isolated topological changes, such as in the case of network reconfiguration. Experiments on distribution systems with sizes of up to 10 476 buses demonstrate that the proposed techniques can achieve computational runtimes shorter with up to 7.78 times and with similar or better loss reduction compared to the Baran's reconfiguration technique [1].",WOS:000286516100004,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Ababei, C. and Kavasseri, R.","N Dakota State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fargo, ND 58108 USA",33,10.1109/Tpwrs.2010.2052076,Feb,0885-8950,1,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,computation time,losses,networks,power distribution control,distribution-system reconfiguration,loss reduction,feeder reconfiguration,service restoration,power-flow,algorithm,sensitivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,710MO,,30-37,7912,Journal Article,,,Efficient Network Reconfiguration Using Minimum Cost Maximum Flow-Based Branch Exchanges and Random Walks-Based Loss Estimations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23,Efficient Network Reconfiguration Using Minimum Cost Maximum Flow-Based Branch Exchanges and Random Walks-Based Loss Estimations,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000286516100004,26,,,2011,,N Dakota State Univ,USA
2193,,"Adverse weather such as hurricanes can have significant impact on power system reliability. One of the challenges of incorporating weather effects in power system reliability evaluation is to assess how adverse weather affects the reliability parameters of system components. In this paper, a fuzzy inference system (FIS) built by using fuzzy clustering method is combined with the regional weather model to solve the preceding problem. The composite power system is assumed to be partitioned into different regions and the FIS maps the nonlinear functional relationship between hurricane parameters and the increment multipliers of the failure rates (IMFR) of the transmission lines in different regions. The possible case that transmission lines traverse bordering regions is investigated by using the weighted average method.

2195,,"The present work is based on developing a control strategy to mitigate the impact of reduced inertia due to significant DFIG penetration in a large power system. The paper aims to design a supplementary control for the DFIG power converters such that the effective inertia contributed by these wind generators to the system is increased. The paper also proposes the idea of adjusting pitch compensation and maximum active power order to the converter in order to improve inertial response during the transient with response to drop in grid frequency. Results obtained on a large realistic power system indicate that the frequency nadir following a large power impact in the form of generators dropping out is effectively improved with the proposed control strategy. The proposed control is also validated against the sudden wind speed change in the form of wind gust downs and wind ramp downs occurring in conjunction with the generators dropping out. A beneficial impact in terms of damping power system oscillations is also observed, which is validated by eigenvalue analysis. The affected mode is then excited with a large disturbance in time domain.

The proposed method finds a set of prices that are as consistent as possible with the actual outputs of resources correctly following their dispatch instructions. Two alternative consistency metrics are proposed in the paper. One measures the difference between the actual performance of an individual resource and its bid-based profit-maximizing response to the ex post prices in a perfectly competitive market. Another measures the difference between the ex post price and the price that supports the actual response of an individual resource. Compared to the existing approaches adopted in the real-time electricity markets in the U. S., the proposed method solves the ex post energy and ancillary service prices directly and simultaneously. It does not require heuristics that are hard to justify, and has a much clear definition for the pricing problem than the existing approaches do.

Eigenvalue analyses are performed on linearized models of the shaft system including the induction machine to find the optimum location. The best location of the IMDU, providing maximum damping, is next to the HP turbine at the end of the shaft. Time domain simulations are conducted to find the adequate rating of the induction machine.

2289,,"Transmission congestion results in revenue collected from the loads that often exceeds the payment made to the generators. The financial transmission right (FTR) is an instrument that allows the independent system operator (ISO) to redistribute the excess revenue (congestion charge) among the market participants. Generators and loads hold FTRs to hedge against congestion charges. Since the revenues from the FTR and energy markets are interdependent, each generator and load must have a joint bidding strategy for FTR and energy markets to maximize its total payoff. This paper presents a two-tier matrix game model that allows the generators and loads to obtain joint bidding strategies. The model also allows the ISOs and the market designers to assess the impact of various network configurations and rules on market performance (e. g., market power). The two-tier model considers multiple participants, multidimensional bid vectors, network contingencies, and varying demand. We conducted a numerical validation of our model by analyzing the three-node network studied by Joskow and Tirole (2000).

2292,,"The welfare of electricity producers and consumers depends on congestion in the transmission grid, generation costs that consist mainly of fuel costs, and strategic behavior. We formulate a game theoretic model of an oligopolistic electricity market where generation costs are derived from a fuel supply network. The game consists of a fuel dispatcher that transports fuels at minimum cost to meet generator demands, generators that maximize profit in Cournot competition, and an independent system operator (ISO) that sets nodal prices to balance electricity supply with linear demand functions. We prove the existence of an equilibrium. If fuel supplies are unlimited, the same equilibria hold in a simplified version of the game in which each generator optimizes its fuel acquisition from the network. In some very simple examples under different assumptions about the rationality of generators with respect to ISO decisions, paradoxical effects on total welfare can occur from expanding either electricity transmission capacity or the transportation capacity of low-cost fuel. We find some instances in which the paradox occurs only under bounded rationality of the generators, others where it occurs only if the generators are fully rational, and still others where it occurs to different degrees under the two rationality assumptions.",WOS:000282544900015,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Ryan, S.

2295,,"This study presents a stochastic model for the independent system operator's (ISO's) optimal coordinated long-term maintenance scheduling of generation units and transmission lines with short-term security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). Random disturbances of power systems including forced outages of generation units and transmission lines, load forecast errors, and fuel price fluctuations are modeled as scenario trees using the Monte Carlo simulation. Lagrangian relaxation (LR) is applied to separate the coordinated optimization problem into long-term equipment maintenance (LTEM) and stochastic long-term SCUC (LTSCUC) subproblems. For the stochastic LTSCUC subproblem, scenario bundle constraints are relaxed via LR and the optimization problem is decomposed into deterministic LTSCUC problems. LR is applied to each deterministic LTSCUC to relax long-term fuel and emission limits and decompose the problem into short-term SCUC subproblems. The decomposition is further applied to short-term SCUC subproblems for separating hourly unit commitment and transmission network constraints. The unit commitment is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem and solved by the branch-and-cut method using CPLEX. The outcome of this study includes the hourly scheduling of outages of generation units and transmission lines, which corresponds to the optimal generation unit commitment and dispatch, and transmission flows. The hourly schedules minimize the total cost of operation and maintenance and satisfy long-term and short-term constraints of generation units and transmission network with the inclusion of power system uncertainty.

Theoretical analysis shows that there exists a corresponding formulation of the dynamic control parameters; hence the adaptive control method is theoretically solid. Both simulation and field experiment test results at the Distributed Energy Communications and Controls (DECC) Laboratory confirm that this method is capable of satisfying the fast response requirement for operational use without causing oscillation, inefficiency, or system equipment interference.

The full control of transmission assets are not currently built into electric network optimization models. Optimal transmission switching is a straightforward way to leverage grid controllability: to make better use of the existing system and meet growing demand with existing infrastructure. Previous papers have shown that optimizing the network topology improves the dispatch of electrical networks. Such optimal topology dispatch can be categorized as a smart grid application where there is a co-optimization of both generators and transmission topology. In this paper we present a co-optimization formulation of the generation unit commitment and transmission switching problem while ensuring N-1 reliability. We show that the optimal topology of the network can vary from hour to hour. We also show that optimizing the topology can change the optimal unit commitment schedule.

The control of voltage level is accomplished by controlling the production, absorption as well as flow of reactive power at various locations in the system. This paper presents an approach to determine a real-time system protection scheme to prevent voltage instability and maintain a desired amount of post-transient voltage stability margin (an index of system security) following the occurrence of a contingency by means of reactive power control. This approach is based on the model predictive control (MPC) theory. According to an economic criterion and control effectiveness, a control switching strategy consisting of a sequence of amounts of the shunt capacitors to switch is identified for voltage restoration. The effect of the capacitive control on voltage recovery is measured via trajectory sensitivity. The sensitivity of voltage stability margin with respect to the capacitive control is used to construct a security constraint for post-fault operation in the MPC formulation. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated through applications to the WECC system for enhancing the voltage performance and to the 39-bus New England system for preventing voltage collapse.",WOS:000285051800042,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Jin, L.

2360,,"In power system reliability evaluation, usually component failures are assumed independent and reliability indices are calculated using methods based on the multiplication rule of probabilities. But in some cases, for instance when the effects of fluctuating weather are considered, the previous assumption is invalid. Generally, two kinds of methodologies are adopted to solve this problem, namely analytical and simulation. This paper proposes a DC-OPF based Markov cut-set method (DCOPF-MCSM) to evaluate composite power system reliability considering weather effects. The proposed method uses DC-OPF approach to determine minimal cut sets (MCS) up to a preset order and then uses MCSM to calculate reliability indices. In the second step, Markov process is applied, at a time, to the components of the determined MCS (and their unions) instead of the entire system. Since enumerating all MCS (and their unions) of a power system is impractical and unnecessary, this paper proposes an algorithm to calculate the bounds of reliability indices and it can automatically generate transition rate matrix (TRM) of the determined MCS (and their unions). The proposed method is tested on the modified IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and the results are compared with those of the next-event sequential simulation (NESS).

2367,,"This paper investigates the design of effective input signals for low-level probing of power systems. In 2005, 2006, and 2008 the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) conducted four large-scale system-wide tests of the western interconnected power system where probing signals were injected by modulating the control signal at the Celilo end of the Pacific DC intertie. A major objective of these tests is the accurate estimation of the inter-area electromechanical modes. A key aspect of any such test is the design of an effective probing signal that leads to measured outputs rich in information about the modes. This paper specifically studies low-level probing signal design for power-system identification. The paper describes the design methodology and the advantages of this new probing signal which was successfully applied during these tests. This probing input is a multi-sine signal with its frequency content focused in the range of the inter-area modes. The period of the signal is over 2 min providing high-frequency resolution. Up to 15 cycles of the signal are injected resulting in a processing gain of 15. The resulting system response is studied in the time and frequency domains. Because of the new probing signal characteristics, these results show significant improvement in the output SNR compared to previous tests.",WOS:000285051800026,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Pierre, J.

2368,,"One of the costs associated with integrating wind generation into a power system is the cost of redispatching the system in real-time due to day-ahead wind resource forecast errors. One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains.",WOS:000285051800017,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Sioshansi, R.","Ohio State Univ, Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",17,10.1109/Tpwrs.2009.2032552,May,0885-8950,2,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,power system economics,real-time pricing,unit commitment,wind forecast errors,wind power generation,electricity markets,efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,691AH,,741-748,8089,Journal Article,,,Evaluating the Impacts of Real-Time Pricing on the Cost and Value of Wind Generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58,Evaluating the Impacts of Real-Time Pricing on the Cost and Value of Wind Generation,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000285051800017,25,,,2010,,Ohio State Univ,USA

2387,,"The tight coupling between system and market operations implies that there are strong interrelationships between system security management and market performance. Therefore, the assurance by the regional transmission organization (RTO) of secure system operations strongly depends on, and directly impacts, electricity markets. Typically, electricity is traded in a sequence of markets that are cleared at different frequencies and with different lead times. In this paper, we focus on the hourly day-ahead markets (DAMs) and their associated real-time markets (RTMs) that clear, typically, every 5 to 10 min. The DAMs' clearing impacts the nature and the extent of the participants' responses to real-time conditions and, therefore, the real-time system operations, which, in turn, impact system security. The basic thrusts of this work are to quantitatively characterize the linkages between the real-time system security and the day-ahead markets as well as to investigate the role of the financial entities in a multi-settlement system. We develop a systematic approach that allows us to quantify the auction surplus attained through the multi-settlement system and evaluate the impacts of the DAMs on market participants' bid/offer surpluses as well as on improving the ability to facilitate real-time secure power system operations. We illustrate the application of the approach on the large-scale ISO-NEmulti-settlement system using the historical 2005-2006 data-the system model and the bids/offers submitted-and the actual market clearing methodology. The studies bear out the well known fact that the participation of financial entities leads to the convergence of the DAM and the associated RTM prices.

This research focuses on addressing the impact of temperature changes on the building cooling load in ten major cities across the Western United States and Canada. Our results have shown that by the mid-century, building yearly energy consumption and peak load will increase in the Southwest. Moreover, the peak load months will spread out to not only the summer months but also spring and autumn months. The Pacific Northwest will experience more hot days in the summer months. The penetration levels of air-conditioning (a/c) systems in this region are likely to increase significantly over the years. As a result, some locations in the Pacific Northwest may be shifted from winter peaking to summer peaking. Overall, the Western U.S. grid may see more simultaneous peaks across the North and South in summer months. Increased cooling load will result in a significant increase in the motor load, which consumes more reactive power and requires stronger voltage support from the grid.

Earlier investigations on placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs) have assumed that a PMU could be placed at a bus and would provide bus voltage phasor as well as current phasors along all branches incident to the bus. This study considers those PMUs which are designed to monitor a single branch by measuring the voltage and current phasors at one end of the monitored branch. It then determines the optimal location of such PMUs in order to make the entire network observable.

2416,,"Currently, most independent system operators in the U.S. run auctions by minimizing the total bid cost [""bid cost minimization"" (BCM)], and then calculate payments based on market clearing prices. Under this setup, the payment cost could be significantly higher than the minimized bid cost. Recently, an alternative auction mechanism that minimizes the consumer payment cost [""payment cost minimization"" (PCM)] has been discussed. Literature has shown that for the same set of bids, PCM leads to reduced consumer payments. However, market participants may bid differently under the two auctions, and therefore, the payment reduction may not be realized. This necessitates the study of strategic behaviors of participants. In this paper, suppliers' bidding strategies in a day-ahead energy market are investigated for both auctions by using a game theoretic framework with Nash equilibrium as the solution concept. To simplify the solution process, the originally continuous strategies are discretized to form matrix games. Discretization may cause the loss of equilibria and the creation of artificial solutions. To reduce these side effects, ""approximate Nash equilibria"" are introduced to recover lost equilibria, and additional strategy samples are evaluated to eliminate artificially created solutions. Games are then solved by examining supplier pay-offs obtained from running auctions. Characteristics of auctions are exploited, leading to improved computational efficiency. Numerical testing results show that the PCM leads to significant payment reductions and relatively small increases of production costs as compared to BCM. Also, the ""hockey-stick"" bidding is more likely to occur under BCM. Finally, long-term impacts of PCM are discussed, and whether it would lower costs to consumers in the long run, including capacity payments, remains to be investigated.",WOS:000273930800020,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Zhao, F., Luh, P.

Since animals cause large number of outages in overhead distribution systems, analysis of these outages has a practical value as it allows utilities to keep track of historical trends. This paper presents a methodology for yearend analysis of animal-caused outages in the past year. Models to estimate weekly animal-caused outages in overhead distribution systems using combination of wavelet transform techniques and neural networks are presented. Discrete wavelet transform is applied to decompose the time series of weekly animal-caused outages into two components and separate neural networks are constructed for each decomposed coefficient series. The outputs of neural networks are combined according to wavelet reconstruction techniques to get estimated results for the weekly animal-caused outages.

In turn, wind generation will increase or decrease the blade angles to reduce or increase the captured wind power. This will be done by wind generation pitch controllers.

2476,,"The contribution of this paper focuses on the development of a security-based methodology for the solution of short-term SCUC when considering the impact of natural gas transmission system. The proposed methodology examines the interdependency of electricity and natural gas in a highly complex transmission system. The natural gas transmission system is modeled as a set of nonlinear equations. The proposed solution applies a decomposition method to separate the natural gas transmission feasibility check subproblem and the power transmission feasibility check subproblem from the hourly unit commitment (UC) in the master problem. Gas contracts are modeled and incorporated in the master UC problem. The natural gas transmission subproblem checks the feasibility of natural gas transmission as well as natural gas transmission security constraints for the commitment and dispatch of gas-fired generating units. If any natural gas transmission violations arise, corresponding energy constraints will be formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until a converged feasible gas transmission solution is found. A six-bus power system with seven-node gas transmission system and the IEEE 118-bus power system with 14-node gas transmission system are analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

2479,,"In power market studies, the forecast of locational marginal price (LMP) relies on the load forecasting results from the viewpoint of planning. It is well known that short-term load forecasting results always carry certain degree of errors mainly due to the random nature of the load. At the same time, LMP step changes occur at critical load levels (CLLs). Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the impact of load forecasting uncertainty on LMP. With the assumption of a certain probability distribution of the actual load, this paper proposes the concept of probabilistic LMP and formulates the probability mass function of this random variable. The expected value of probabilistic LMP is then derived, as well as the lower and upper bound of its sensitivity. In addition, two useful curves, alignment probability of deterministic LMP versus forecasted load and expected value of probabilistic LMP versus forecasted load, are presented. The first curve is designed to identify the probability that the forecasted price in a deterministic LMP matches the actual price at the forecasted load level. The second curve is demonstrated to be smooth and therefore eliminates the step changes in deterministic LMP forecasting. This helps planners avoid the possible sharp changes during decision-making process.

2487,,"The targeted and current development of wind energy in various countries around the world reveals that wind power is the fastest growing power generation technology. Among the several wind generation technologies, variable speed wind turbines utilizing doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are gaining momentum in the power industry. With the increase in penetration of these wind turbines, the power system dominated by synchronous machines will experience a change in dynamics and operational characteristics. Given this assertion, the present paper develops an approach to analyze the impact of increased penetration of DFIG-based wind turbines on transient and small signal stability of a large power system. The primary basis of the method is to convert the DFIG machines into equivalent conventional round rotor synchronous machines and then evaluate the sensitivity of the eigenvalues with respect to inertia. In this regard, modes that are both detrimentally and beneficially affected by the change in inertia are identified. These modes are then excited by appropriate disturbances and the impact of reduced inertia on transient stability performance is also examined. The proposed technique is tested on a large test system representing the Midwestern portion of the U. S. interconnection.

2517,,"We generalize a model, proposed by Alvarado, of the electric power market by including the effects of control and communication. To simulate realistic markets, our model issues control signals only at given times and those signals are delayed during transmission. These two effects transform Alvarado's continuous system into a hybrid system, with consequential effects. The stability analysis of the new system reveals two important properties. First, there is an upper limit on the market clearing time and the delay of the price signal beyond which the system becomes unstable. Second, there is a counter-intuitive relationship between the market clearing time and price signal delay: when the market clearing time is relatively long, delaying the price signal can improve the market's stability while reducing the communication delay can destabilize the market. This counter-intuitive effect shows that the full impact of information technology on power markets can be significant and difficult to anticipate.

2542,,"One of the impediments to large-scale use of wind generation within power systems is its nondispatchability and variable and uncertain real-time availability. Operating constraints on conventional generators such as minimum generation points, forbidden zones, and ramping limits as well as system constraints such as power flow limits and ancillary service requirements may force a system operator to curtail wind generation in order to ensure feasibility. Furthermore, the pattern of wind availability and electricity demand may not allow wind generation to be fully utilized in all hours. One solution to these issues, which could reduce these inflexibilities, is the use of real-time pricing (RTP) tariffs which can both smooth-out the diurnal load pattern in order to reduce the impact of binding unit operating and system constraints on wind utilization, and allow demand to increase in response to the availability of costless wind generation.

Therefore, it is beneficial to system planners if the congestion or locational marginal pricing (LMP) versus load is readily available. This can certainly be obtained by repetitively running an optimization model at different load levels. However, this approach is too brute-force to be practical. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to identify the new binding constraint and the new marginal unit set when the system load increases from the present load level. It addresses the challenge of step changes in generation dispatch when a generation or transmission limit becomes binding. The algorithm also gives the new sensitivity of the new marginal units. Therefore, the generation dispatch, congested lines, and LMP at a new critical load level (CLL) can be easily calculated. Test results are presented in matrix formulation to clearly demonstrate and verify the proposed algorithm.

2545,,"To study the competitive behavior among individual generating companies (GENCOs), an incomplete information game model is proposed in this paper in which each GENCO is modeled as an agent. Each agent makes strategic generation capacity expansion decisions based on its incomplete information on other GENCOs. The formation of this game model falls into a bi-level optimization problem. The upper level of this problem is the GENCOs' own decision on optimal planning strategies and energy/reserve bidding strategies. The lower-level problem is the ISO's market clearing problem that minimizes the cost to supply the load, which yields price signals for GENCOs to calculate their own payoffs. A co-evolutionary algorithm combined with pattern search is proposed to optimize the search for the Nash equilibrium of the competition game with incomplete information. The Nash equilibrium is obtained if all GENCOs reach their maximum expected payoff assuming the planning strategies of other GENCOs' remain unchanged.

2562,,"We propose a component model for the scheduling of combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) units by mixed-integer programming (MIP) in which combustion turbines (CTs) and steam turbines (STs) are modeled as individual units. The hourly schedule of CCGT based on the component model is compared with that of the mode model. The modeling of modes, which includes a combination of CTs and STs, would require certain approximations for representing fuel input-power output curves, ramping rate limits, minimum operating time limits, etc. The approximations can result in sub-optimal schedules. Furthermore, the commitment and dispatch of CCGTs based on the mode model will require a real-time dispatch to individual CT and ST components of CCGT. In comparison, the mode modeling approximations will no longer be required in the component model as individual CTs and STs are modeled and dispatched. The enhancement tools such as duct burners, loggers, and peak firing for increasing the CCGT output can be easily modeled in the component model. Case studies show that the proposed component model is effective for representing CCGTs, and verify that the proposed component model can potentially save CCGT operating costs.

2635,,"Standard computations reveal that locational marginal prices (LMPs), being Lagrange multipliers in an optimization problem, must lie in the null space of a Jacobian matrix evaluated at the optimal power flow solution, augmented by columns associated with active line flow limits. The impact of network power flow and active line limit constraints is to confine the LMPs in a subspace that satisfies necessary conditions for optimality. Optimal market clearing can then proceed as a minimization over offer curves confined to admissible LMPs in this subspace. When no line limits are active and losses neglected (e.g., in a dc power flow representation), the matrix in question has a generalized Laplacian structure, and admits only a vector of all equal elements in its null space (verifying the well-known equal incremental cost condition). As line flow limits become active, the null space grows in dimension. Among the phenomena of interest as the dimension of admissible LMPs grows is that of ""load pockets""; that is, admissible LMP vectors that can show patterns in which buses partition into zones of approximately equal LMPs, with significant differences between zones. This paper explores an approach to admissible LMP calculation that isolates the topological role of active line flow constraints, independent of offer curve prices. Identification of this admissible subspace can then greatly facilitate computations such as clustering to identify potential zones of differentiated LMPs.",WOS:000262817200014,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Cheverez-Gonzalez, D. and DeMarco, C.

To model the nature of nonlinear power injection variations, a piecewise-linear model is proposed to approximate the nonlinear model of power injections.

The impacts of linear as well as nonlinear load variations on the P-V curve, Q-V curve, and P-Q-V curve are numerically analyzed on test power systems.

The application of fuel diversity (e.g., generating units with fuel switching capability) is presented as an effective peak shaving strategy for natural gas demand which could hedge price volatilities of natural gas and electric power. The proposed model can be used by a vertically integrated utility for the commitment and dispatch of generating units and the allocation of natural gas for the next day utilization. The proposed model can also be used for measuring the security of social services by modeling the interdependency of natural gas and electric power system infrastructures. If the proposed model is used by GENCOs, gas constraints will be submitted to electricity markets as energy constraints.

Interdependencies between computer communication system and the physical infrastructure also become more complex as information technologies are further integrated into devices and networks.

The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its potential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a modul e for the power flow computation.

The objective of a GENCO is to maximize payoffs and minimize financial risks when scheduling its midterm generation of thermal, cascaded hydro, and pumped-storage units. The proposed schedule will be used by the GENCO for bidding purposes to the ISO. The optimization model is based on stochastic price-based unit commitment. The proposed GENCO solution may be used to schedule midterm fuel and natural water inflow resources for a few months to a year. The proposed stochastic mixed-integer programming solution considers random market prices for energy and ancillary services, as well as the availability of natural water inflows and generators in Monte Carlo scenarios. Financial risks associated with uncertainties are considered by applying expected downside risks which are incorporated explicitly as constraints. Variable time-steps are adopted to avoid the exponential growth in solution time and memory requirements when considering midterm constraints. A single water-to-power conversion function is used instead of several curves for representing water head and discharge parameters. Piecewise linearized head-dependant water-to-power conversion functions are used for computational efficiency.

Hence, the capability to effectively process topology errors is closely linked to proper measurement design. In particular, detection of a topology error associated with a given branch may or may not be possible depending upon the existing measurement configuration. Hence, it is possible. to efficiently improve the topology error processing capability for a given system by strategically placing few extra measurements.

2701,,"A key need facing the electric power industry is the ongoing requirement to develop its future workforce. While university education is a crucial step in this process, studies have shown that many promising students are unaware of possible careers in the power industry. Many also lose interest in math and science during their high school and even middle school years. This paper presents lesson plans and associated applets designed to help address these needs, developed as a collaboration between electric power researchers and education specialists. Thus far, two units have been developed to engage pre-university students in the power area. The first unit, Power and Energy in the Home, serves as an introduction to the concepts of power and energy and provides many sample loads to illustrate the impacts of running different appliances. Special attention is paid to environmental issues by the inclusion of Energy Star appliances along with incandescent and compact fluorescent lighting.

2707,,Cascading transmission line outages contribute to widespread blackouts. Engineers respond to the risk of cascading line outages by applying policies such as the n-1 criterion and upgrading lines involved in recent cascading outages. The transmission grid slowly evolves as these policies are applied to maintain reliability while the load grows. We suggest how to assess the long-term effect of these policies on the risk of cascading line outages by simulating both the cascading and the slow evolution of the transmission grid. The long-term effects of these policies on the probability distribution of outage size and the grid utilization are computed for the IEEE. 118-bus test system.

2710,,"This paper presents a model for calculating the cost of power system reliability based on the stochastic optimization of long-term security-constrained unit commitment. Random outages of generating units and transmission lines as well as load forecasting inaccuracy are modeled as scenario trees in the Monte Carlo simulation. Unlike previous reliability analyses methods in the, literature which considered the solution of an economic dispatch problem, this model solves an hourly unit commitment problem, which incorporates spatial constraints of generating units and transmission lines, random component outages, and load forecast uncertainty into the reliability problem. The classical methods considered predefined reserve constraints in the deterministic solution of unit commitment. However, this study considers possible uncertainties when calculating the optimal reserve in the unit commitment solution as a tradeoff between minimizing operating costs and satisfying power system reliability requirements. Loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) is included as a constraint in the stochastic unit commitment for calculating the cost of supplying the reserve. The proposed model can be used by a vertically integrated utility or an ISO. In the first case, the utility considers the impact of long-term fuel and emission scheduling on power system reliability studies. In the second case, fuel and emission constraints of individual generating companies are submitted as energy constraints when solving the ISO's reliability problem.

In particular, the linearized de load flow model has been popular in complementarity and other types of oligopoly models. In this paper, we show how such models can be generalized to include quadratic losses, controllable DC lines, and phase shifting transformers. These generalizations preserve convexity of the feasible region, a property that facilitates computation and proof of solution uniqueness and existence. Piecewise and successive linearization formulations are also provided that allow consideration of nonlinear losses in models that require linear constraints. A simple six-bus example illustrates the application of these generalizations. In that example, the impact of losses on prices is much greater under strategic behavior than under competition. Large-scale applications of these approaches to markets in western North America and the European Union illustrate how inclusion of nonlinear losses and controllable DC lines can affect estimates of prices, flows, and economic efficiency indices resulting from oligopoly models.",WOS:000258032200022,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Hobbs, B.

This paper deals with the development of an online monitoring technique based on mechanical state estimation to determine the sag levels of overhead transmission lines in real time and hence determine if these lines are in normal physical condition or have been damaged or downed. A computational algorithm based on least squares state estimation is applied to the physical transmission line equations to determine the conductor sag levels from measurements of tension, temperature, and other transmission line conductor parameters.

In the aftermath of the 2000-2001 California crisis, the consideration of resource adequacy in market design became critically important. Various capacity approaches, such as requirements, payments, and subscriptions, have been proposed to ensure resource adequacy in electricity markets. We focus on short-term resource adequacy design and analysis within the context of making effective use of competition in electricity markets. We propose a design of a short-term resource adequacy program based on capacity requirements expressed in terms of a price-sensitive demand curve. The program gives incentives for providing capacity to markets and metes out penalties for nonperformance situations. The probabilistic modeling of the uncertainty in the generation availability and in the load allows the evaluation of reliability in terms of widely-used metrics. The analysis of the proposed design and the simulation of a simple implementation on different sized test systems show that the program results in improved reliability.

2748,,"Adequacy assessment of power-generating systems provides a mechanism to ensure proper system operations in the face of various uncertainties including equipment failures. The integration of time-dependent sources such as wind turbine generators (WTGs) makes the reliability evaluation process more challenging. Due to the large number of system states involved in system operations, it is normally not feasible to enumerate all possible failure states to calculate the reliability indices. Monte Carlo simulation can be used for this purpose through iterative selection and evaluation of system states. However, due to its dependence on proportionate sampling, its efficiency in locating failure states may be low. The simulation may thus be time-consuming and take a long time to converge in some evaluation scenarios. In this paper, as an alternative option, four representative population-based intelligent search (PIS) procedures including genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial immune system (AIS), and ant colony system (ACS) are adopted to search the meaningful system states through their inherent convergence mechanisms. These most probable failure states contribute most significantly to the adequacy indices including loss of load expectation (LOLE), loss of load frequency (LOLF), and expected energy not supplied (EENS). The proposed solution methodology is also compared with the Monte Carlo simulation through conceptual analyses and numerical simulations.

The method breaks the restoration horizon into intervals and develops a restoration plan by finding the status of each of the feeders at each time interval. The Lagrangian relaxation approach allows a computationally efficient calculation of the timing and selection of feeders to be energized. The subgradient iterative approach relates to the selection of a vector of Lagrange multipliers in the optimization process. A restoration index obtained from the dual formulation of the problem is also shown. This index identifies the feeders that are closer to restoration.

Event location is formulated as finding the most likely group from which an event originates.

2773,,"Deregulated electricity markets in the U.S. currently use an auction mechanism that minimizes total supply bid costs to select bids and their levels. Payments are then settled based on market-clearingprices. Under this setup, the consumer payments could be significantly higher than the minimized bid costs obtained from auctions. This gives rise to ""payment cost minimization,"" an alternative auction mechanism that minimizes consumer payments. We previously presented an augmented Lagrangian and surrogate optimization framework to solve payment cost minimization problems without considering transmission. This paper extends that approach to incorporate transmission capacity constraints. The consideration of transmission constraints complicates the problem by entailing power flow and introducing locational marginal orices (LMPs). DC power flow is used for simplicity and LMPs are defined by ""economic dispatch"" for the selected supply bids. To characterize LMPs that appear in the payment cost objective function, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of economic dispatch are established and embedded as constraints. The reformulated problem is difficult in view of the complex role of LMPs and the violation of constraint qualifications caused by the complementarity constraints of KKT conditions. Our key idea is to extend the surrogate optimization framework and use a regularization technique. Specific methods to satisfy the ""surrogate optimization condition"" in the presence of transmission capacity constraints are highlighted. Numerical testing results of small examples and the IEEE Reliability Test System with randomly generated supply bids demonstrate the quality, effectiveness, and scalability of the method.",WOS:000258765900031,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Zhao, F., Luh, P.

We use both measured and modeled wind data and estimate the time-varying value of wind power with both financial and load-based metrics. We find that the potential difference in wholesale market value between better-correlated and poorly correlated wind sites is modest, on the order of 5%-10%.

The GENCO also coordinates its proposed outage scheduling with short-term unit commitment for maximizing payoffs. The proposed model is a stochastic mixed integer linear program in which random hourly prices of energy, ancillary services, and fuel are modeled as scenarios in the Monte Carlo method. Financial risks associated with price uncertainty are considered by applying expected downside risks which are incorporated explicitly as constraints.

2875,,"The residual demand derivative plays a central role in constructing the best response to competitors' strategies in widely used strategic models such as the Cournot model and the supply function model. In the absence of transportation or transmission constraints, the residual demand derivative is obtained straightforwardly by taking the derivative of the residual demand function with respect to price. However, in an electricity market, the market is embedded in a transmission network. When there is no transmission congestion, the residual demand derivative can be calculated as usual, but when there is transmission congestion, the residual demand derivative is more difficult to calculate. In this paper, we characterize the transmission-constrained residual demand derivative. We use the dc power flow model and characterize the residual demand derivative analytically. The residual demand derivative could also be obtained from the solution of a specific weighted least squares problem. Several properties of the residual demand derivative are implications of the weighted least squares theory. We also characterize the condition under which the residual demand derivative will be bounded or unbounded when there are perfectly elastic supplies/demands at some buses in the system. We verified our results in three examples: a two-bus system, a four-bus two-loop system, and a three-bus one-loop system with one perfectly elastic supply.

Using an unusually large dataset that includes the companies' experiences in six hurricanes and eight ice storms, accelerated failure time models were fitted and used to predict the duration of each probable outage in a storm. By aggregating those estimated outage durations and accounting for variable outage start times, restoration curves were then estimated for each county in the companies' service areas. The method can be applied as a storm approaches, before damage assessments are available from the field, thus helping to better inform customers and the public of expected post-storm power restoration times.

The capacity mechanism offers incentives for market participant investments that reflect the locational values of additional capacity.

The inherent nonlinearity of transmission losses and the use of marginal loss pricing can obscure the intended economic information in the loss component of nodal prices. As one step in clarifying the determination of the marginal loss price component, this paper discusses the calculation of nodal electricity prices in lossy networks and presents a variety of accepted methods for determining marginal loss. This paper then proposes a method for calculating the marginal loss component of nodal prices during hours with congestion that reflects each market participant's contribution to marginal losses more accurately than current implementations. The proposed method recognizes that increases in incremental energy flows cannot flow across constrained lines, and thus, system-wide marginal losses should not be attributed to generators or loads in the constrained subregions. The objectives of the discussion are to improve the understanding of how marginal losses are determined and also to improve the accuracy of the information conveyed in the marginal loss price component.

Moreover, the dc optimal power flow (DCOPF) model has been applied in the power industry to calculate locational marginal prices (LMPs), especially in market simulation and planning owing to its robustness and speed. In this paper, first, an iterative DCOPF-based algorithm is presented with the fictitious nodal demand (FND) model to calculate LMP. The algorithm has three features: the iterative approach is employed to address the nonlinear marginal loss; FND is proposed to eliminate the large mismatch at the reference bus if FND is not applied; and an offset of system loss in the energy balance equation is proved to be necessary because the net injection multiplied by marginal delivery factors creates doubled system loss. Second, the algorithm is compared with ACOPF algorithm for accuracy of LMP results at various load levels using the PJM 5-bus system. It is clearly shown that the FND algorithm is a good estimate of the IMP calculated from the ACOPF algorithm and outperforms the lossless DCOPF algorithm.

The scheme builds and periodically updates decision trees offline to decide critical attributes as security indicators. Decision trees provide online security assessment and preventive control guidelines based on real-time measurements of the indicators from phasor measurement units. The scheme uses a new classification method involving each whole path of a decision tree instead of only classification results at terminal nodes to provide more reliable security assessment results for changes in system conditions. The approaches developed are tested on a 2100-bus, 2600-line, 240-generator operational model of the Entergy system.

2953,,"The key of reactive power planning (RPP), or Var planning, is the optimal allocation of reactive power sources considering location and size. Traditionally, the locations for placing new Var sources were either simply estimated or directly assumed. Recent research works have,presented some rigorous optimization-based methods in RPP. This paper will first review various objectives of RPP. The objectives may consider many cost functions such as variable Var cost, fixed Var cost, real power losses, and fuel cost. Also considered may be the deviation of a given voltage schedule, voltage stability margin, or even a combination of different objectives as a multi-objective model. Secondly, different constraints in RPP are discussed. These different constraints are the key of various optimization models, identified as optimal power flow (OPF) model, security-constrained OPF (SCOPF) model, and SCOPF with voltage-stability consideration. Thirdly, the optimization -based models will be categorized as conventional algorithms, intelligent searches, and fuzzy set applications. The conventional algorithms include linear programming, nonlinear programming, mixed-integer nonlinear programming, etc. The intelligent searches include simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, and tabu search. The fuzzy set applications in RPP address the uncertainties in objectives and constraints.

Their use in various applications such as congestion management and hedging requires specific LMP components in the computations. We provide a general formulation for the evaluation of the LMP components by making explicit use of the important role played by the nodes with generators with free capacity. On the other hand, the LMPs of the nodes without generation or with the generators at their limits are a function of the LMPs at the marginal nodes and the impacts of the network constraints, including the losses in the network. In the formulation, we pay special attention to the importance of the assumptions and specifications-the so-called policy specification-in the determination of the components. We obtain a very general formulation that brings under a single framework the different decomposition approaches that exist. The formulation's comprehensiveness brings numerous insights into the various decompositions, provides a platform for their comparative analysis, and allows us to understand the direct implications and the role of the policy specified. Moreover, the formulation reveals the limitations of any decomposition into the components due to the underlying structural interdependencies among them, which is clearly shown in this paper.

3016,,"Many large interconnected power systems such as the U.S. eastern interconnection and the U.S. western power system are characterized by many power transfer paths or interfaces with high loading. Disruptions of these transfer paths frequently lead to increased loading on neighboring transfer paths, which themselves will become less secure and could cause further disruptions. State estimators have limited performance under large system disruptions, because of low sampling rates and potentially poor solution quality due to topology errors. Furthermore, disruptions in external power systems cannot be readily seen by control room operators because most state estimators only use reduced models for external systems. A system of well-placed phasor measurement units (PMUs) that provide voltage and current magnitude and phase at a high sampling rate can provide useful system dynamic security information.

We develop a combined graph-theoretic-algebraic approach to detect island formation in power system networks under multiple line outages.

We develop a one-to-one relationship between minimal cutsets and a matrix of the generalized line outage distribution factors for multiple line outages. This relationship requires computations on lower order matrices and so is able to provide rapidly essential information. The proposed approach detects the island formation and identifies the subset of outaged lines that is the causal factor. Furthermore, for cases in which the set of outaged lines does not result in system separation, the method has the ability to identify whether a set of candidate line outages separates the system.

In this model, random disturbances, such as outages of generation units and transmission lines as well as load forecasting inaccuracies, are modeled as scenario trees using the Monte Carlo simulation method. For dual optimization, coupling constraints among scenarios are relaxed and the optimization problem is decomposed into deterministic longterm SCUC subproblems. For each deterministic long-term SCUC, resource constraints represent fuel find emission constraints (in the case of vertically integrated utilities) and energy constraints (in the case of electricity markets). Lagrangian relaxation is used to decompose subproblems with long-term SCUC into tractable short-term MIP-based SCUC subproblems without resource constraints. Accordingly, penalty prices (Lagrangian multipliers) are signals to coordinate the master problem and small-scale subproblems. Computational requirements for solving scenario-based optimization models depend on the number of scenarios in which the objective is to minimize the weighted-average generation cost over the entire scenario tree. In large scale applications, the scenario reduction method is introduced for enhancing a tradeoff between calculation speed and accuracy of long-term SCUC solution. Numerical simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for solving the stochastic security-constrained unit commitment.",WOS:000246271100034,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Wu, L., Shabidehpour, M. and Li, T.","IIT, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA",16,10.1109/Tpwrs.2007.894843,May,0885-8950,2,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,lagrangian relaxation,mixed integer program,monte carlo simulation,random power outages,scenario aggregation,security-constrained unit commitment,subgradient method,uncertainty,long-term,decomposition,coordination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,164YO,,800-811,8740,Journal Article,,,Stochastic security-constrained unit commitment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,227,Stochastic security-constrained unit commitment,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000246271100034,22,,,2007,,IIT,USA

As power flows are computationally expensive and approximate solutions are usually acceptable, fast estimation methods are used.

Reactive power and voltage sensitivities-based methods have not been as successful, partially because equipment limits are ignored.

This paper describes a new system-wide harmonic state estimator that can reliably identify harmonic sources using fewer meters than unknown state variables. Note there are only a small number of simultaneous harmonic sources among the suspicious buses. Traditional observability analysis is extended to general underdetermined estimation when considering the sparsity of state variables. It is shown that the underdetermined HSE can become observable with proper measurement arrangements by applying the sparsity of state variables. The HSE is formulated as a constrained sparsity maximization problem based on L1-norm minimization. It can be solved efficiently by an equivalent linear programming. Numerical experiments are conducted in the IEEE 14-bus power system to test the proposed method. The underdetermined system contains nine meters and 13 suspicious buses.

3075,,"Because of high generation adequacy standards in the power industry, some peaking capacity operates for a limited time during the year and may not receive sufficient energy revenues to meet its fixed costs. This is particularly true when energy prices are capped in order to mitigate market power. The northeastern U.S. independent system operators (ISOs) have responded to this issue by establishing capacity obligations for loads and markets for installed capacity, thus providing a capacity revenue stream to generators. The installed capacity (ICAP) markets in the northeastern U.S. markets are a response to this need for additional incentives to construct generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has accepted the PJM Interconnection's (PJM) proposal to replace the present fixed ICAP requirement that is placed upon load serving entities (LSEs) with a demand curve-based system in which the ISO would be responsible for acquiring ""residual'' capacity on behalf of LSEs. The demand curve approach pays more when reserve margins are smaller and provides a reduced incentive for investment when installed reserves are above the target. Another goal is to make revenues more predictable for generators, making investment less costly and, ultimately, lowering prices for consumers. A dynamic representative agent model is presented for projecting effects upon reserve margins, generator profitability, and consumer costs and is applied to alternative demand curves proposed for the PJM market. The consumer costs resulting from a sloped demand curve are robustly lower compared to the present fixed requirement under a wide range of assumptions concerning behavior of generation owners, including risk attitudes, bidding behavior, and willingness to build capacity as a function of forecast profit. ne cost savings arise from lower capital costs to generators due to reduced risk and risk premiums.

In day-ahead (DA) energy markets, strategies such as uniform price, discriminatory, and second-price uniform auctions result in different price settlements and thus offer different levels of market power. In this paper, we present a nonzero sum stochastic game theoretic model and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution framework that allow assessment of market power in DA markets. Since there are no available methods to obtain exact analytical solutions of stochastic games, an RL-based approach is utilized, which offers a computationally viable tool to obtain approximate solutions. These solutions provide effective bidding strategies for the DA market participants. The market powers associated with the bidding strategies are calculated using well-known indexes like Herfindahl-Hirschmann index and Lerner index and two new indices, quantity modulated price index (QMPI) and revenue-based market power index (RMPI), which are developed in this paper.

Optimizing the natural gas supply portfolio, especially the short-term portfolio, is critical for the day-to-day operations and the financial performance of NGFPPs. Traditionally, such optimization problems are solved using cost-minimization-based frameworks. However, such frameworks are facing challenges due to the lack of consideration of associated financial risks in the current deregulated electricity markets, which the electric utility companies (EUCs) who own and operate NGFPPs now bear. This paper presents a utility-maximization-based framework to optimize the short-term natural gas supply portfolio for the EUC. It considers the financial risks associated with the portfolio and incorporates the risk preferences of the EUCs as decision-maker (DM) in the portfolio optimization process.

Several oligopoly models have been proposed for representing strategic behavior in electricity markets, notable among which is the Cournot model. The literature on this model has for the most part provided a deterministic treatment of the demand and supply side quantities. The market, however, is subject to both supply and demand side uncertainties. This paper provides analytical models and procedures based on generation system and load data for probabilistically representing two different market competition models-one is based on perfect competition and the other based on asymmetric oligopoly (Cournot). We account for the availability of generating units and show its effects on market prices. We also study the effects on a firm's expected profit when generator availabilities are neglected in the offers decisions.

To implement a sensitivity-based screening technique for guidance in optimally locating a single UPFC in a power system, we propose a new UPFC model, which consists of an ideal transformer with a complex turns ratio and a variable shunt admittance. In this model, the UPFC control variables do not depend explicitly on UPFC input and output currents and voltages.

A new set of parameter sensitivities of FACTS devices are derived to include the operational constraints of FACTS devices during optimization. In order to reduce the effect of errors due to linearization, all sensitivities can be updated during the OPF iterations. The algorithm is implemented with MATLAB and tested on the New England 39-bus system and the WECC 179-bus system. The simulation results show that the proposed LP-based OPF algorithm is effective, fast, and accurate in finding the optimal parameter settings for FACTS devices to solve the problem of overloads and voltage violations.",WOS:000241839700041,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Shao, W. and Vittal, V.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",28,10.1109/Tpwrs.2006.881127,Nov,0885-8950,4,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,corrective control,flexible ac transmission systems (facts),linear programming (lp),optimal power flow (opf),overloads,unified power flow controller (upfc),voltage violations,optimal power-flow,load flow,systems,devices,models,upfc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,102UV,,1832-1839,8858,Journal Article,,,LP-based OPF for corrective FACTS control to relieve overloads and voltage violations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54,LP-based OPF for corrective FACTS control to relieve overloads and voltage violations,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000241839700041,21,,,2006,,Iowa State Univ,USA
3138,,"This paper discusses an alternative to the ex post pricing model currently under development within ISO New England's (ISO NE) ancillary service market. Since ISO NE's real-time ancillary service market co-optimizes both energy and reserve products, ex post pricing is needed for both energy and reserve. A co-optimization approach for ex post pricing requires defining complex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid complexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new ex post pricing schema is proposed to calculate the ex post energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve. In the proposed approach, ex post energy prices are first computed by incorporating the ex ante marginal opportunity cost of reserve in the energy offer; the ex post reserve prices are then calculated by considering the ex post marginal opportunity cost of energy. This approach simplifies the implementation of ex post pricing rules in the ISO NE market.

An effective method to model weather's impact on overhead distribution lines' failure rates will enable utilities to compare their systems' reliabilities under different weather conditions. This will allow them to make the right decisions to obtain the best operation and maintenance plan to reduce impacts of weather on reliabilities. Two methods to model overhead distribution lines' failure rates are presented in this paper. The first is based on a Poisson regression model, and it captures the counting nature of failure events on overhead distribution lines. The second is a Bayesian network model, which uses conditional probabilities of failures given different weather states. Both methods are used to predict the yearly weather-related failure events on overhead lines. This is followed by a Monte Carlo analysis to determine prediction bounds.

It attempts to verify that the location of uncontrolled separation (loss of synchronism or out-of-step operation) is independent of the location and severity (short-circuit duty or duration) of the initial faults, that the location depends on the prevailing network configuration and load level, and that it takes place one operation at a time (cascades). Verification of these conjectures would allow controlled separation during a disturbance in real-time, using the present communication and protection systems, and results in a minimal load and generation imbalance. Two actual power systems were used, a 50-bus system to establish the procedure for controlled separation and a 640-bus interconnection to apply the procedure. Data representing static and dynamic behavior of the two power systems were obtained from the operating utilities, and the many required simulations were conducted using EPRI Power System Analysis Package (including IPFLOW and ETMSP programs).",WOS:000241839700048,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Adibi, M.

We also account for security by using an objective function that is the expected value of social welfare. This objective function includes security costs such as generator ramping and load interruption that may be necessary when a contingency occurs.

A load serving entity (LSE) has multiple choices from these instruments to meet its load obligations. In view of the large amount of power involved, the complex market structure, the risks in such volatile markets, the stringent constraints to be satisfied, and the long time horizon, a power portfolio optimization problem is of critical importance for an LSE to serve its load, maximize its profit, and manage its risks. In this paper, a midterm power portfolio optimization problem with risk management is presented. Key instruments are considered, risk terms based on semi-variances of spot market transactions are introduced, and penalties on load obligation violations are added to the objective function to improve algorithm convergence and constraint satisfaction. To overcome the inseparability of the resulting problem, a surrogate optimization framework is developed, enabling a decomposition and coordination approach.

The SMD NOPR contains the Commission's most definitive guidelines regarding its vision of future competitive wholesale electric markets, their structure, and scope. Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) are at the heart of the order-providing the structure and institutions to support wholesale electricity trade and the management of the nation's transmission grid. Locational marginal pricing (LMP) and congestion revenue rights (CRRs) will be used to manage the operation of the transmission grid. As the geographies of these RTOs will expand across many states and one or more independent system operators (ISOs), the state regulators and ISOs, affected by FERC orders, are particularly interested in the assessment of economic impact in their states and ISO market areas, if these orders were adopted. While one can easily conceptualize the steps required to characterize the economic impact of implementing RTOs and SMD, the modeling and analytical methodology is extremely complex and requires that numerous ""reasonable assumptions"" be made to approximate the operations of the electric system. Results from a case study are used to illustrate the impact of key assumptions and the inherent imprecision in this type of analysis.

This is demonstrated by the significant reduction in line flows in the rest of the system and by improved voltage and relative angle characteristics. Based on the suggestion in the joint U.S.-Canadian task force final report on the blackout, load shedding without any islanding is also performed, and results obtained are compared with the proposed controlled islanding method.

One of the most natural applications of these measurements is in the area of state estimation. A straightforward application of state estimation theory treats phasor measurements of currents and voltages as additional measurements to be appended to traditional measurements now being used in most energy management system (EMS) state estimators. The resulting state estimator is once again nonlinear and requires significant modifications to existing EMS software. This paper proposes an alternative approach, which leaves the traditional state estimation software in place, and discusses a novel method of incorporating the phasor measurements and the results of the traditional state estimator in a postprocessing linear estimator.

The cross-validation technique is applied to validate the four dynamic load models in order to obtain a better estimate of their performance. Numerical studies indicate that linear dynamic load models studied in this paper give better results than two nonlinear dynamic load models in modeling reactive power behaviors during disturbance while they are comparable in modeling real power behaviors.",WOS:000239355300030,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Choi, B.

This computation takes into account the limits on the line flows, bus voltage magnitude, generator reactive power, voltage stability, as well as the loss of line contingencies. The multi-area TTC problem is solved by using a network decomposition approach based on REI-type network equivalents. Each area uses REI equivalents of external areas to compute its TTC via the continuation power flow (CPF). The choice and updating procedure for the continuation parameter employed by the CPF is implemented in a distributed but coordinated manner. The proposed method leads to potential gains in the computational efficiency with limited data exchanges between areas.

The power system model with TCSC devices is linearized at different operating points to obtain an LPV open loop model, whose state space entries depend continuously on a time varying parameter vector. Appropriate scheduling parameters are chosen and a suitable grid is formed in the entire parameter space. The locations of the TCSCs with their controllers are carefully chosen based on the analysis of mode shapes as well as the calculation of the modal controllability. An LPV damping controller for TCSC is then designed based on a single Lyapunov function under some realistic constraints.

Major power shortages in the Midwest and California in the wake of deregulation led to a reexamination by most regions of the need for centralized resource planning and integrated resource plans.

3257,,"Deregulated electricity markets use an auction mechanism to select offers and their power levels for energy and ancillary services. A settlement mechanism is then used to determine the payments resulting from the selected offers. Currently, most independent system operators (ISOs) in the United States use an auction mechanism that minimizes the total offer costs but determine payment costs using a settlement mechanism that pays uniform market clearing prices (MCPs) to all selected offers. Under this setup, the auction and settlement mechanisms are inconsistent since minimized costs are different from payment costs. Illustrative examples in the literature have shown that for a given set of offers, if an auction mechanism that directly minimizes the payment costs is used, then payment costs can be significantly reduced as compared to minimizing offer costs. This observation has led to discussions among stakeholders and policymakers in the electricity markets as to which of the two auction mechanisms is more appropriate for ISOs to use. While methods for minimizing offer costs abound, limited approaches for minimization of payment costs have been reported. This paper presents an effective method for directly minimizing payment costs. In view of the specific features of the problem including the nonseparability of its objective function, the discontinuity of offer curves, and the maximum term in defining MCPs, our key idea is to use augmented Lagrangian relaxation and to form and solve offer and MCP subproblems by using the surrogate optimization framework. Numerical testing results demonstrate that the method is effective, and the resulting payment costs are significantly lower than what are obtained by minimizing the offer costs for a given set of offers.",WOS:000237313000014,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Luh, P.

3328,,"A decoupled method is proposed to deal with time-domain simulation for power system dynamic analysis. Traditionally, there are two main categories of numerical. integration methods: explicit methods and implicit methods. The implicit methods are numerically stable but require more computational time to solve the nonlinear equations, while explicit methods are relatively efficient but may cause a numerical stability problem. This paper proposes a new hybrid method to take advantage of both explicit and implicit methods based on the invariant subspace partition. The original power system equations are decoupled into two parts that correspond to the stiff and nonstiff subspaces. For the stiff invariant subspace, the implicit method is applied to achieve numerical stability, and the explicit method is employed to handle nonstiff invariant subspace for the computational efficiency. As a result, the new hybrid method is both numerically stable and efficient.

A general model of bus-bar switching action is also presented such that the new algorithm can simulate any kind of complicated bus-bar switching action. Furthermore, on the basis of a newly proposed voltage distribution factor by multiple iterations in power flow calculation, a novel algorithm for corrective voltage control by shunt switching is developed. These two algorithms are then integrated into a corrective switching algorithm.

The use of the Taguchi method for the economic dispatch problem is a novel idea, and it leads to efficient algorithms that can find a satisfactory solution by minimizing the cost function in a few iterations.

On the basis of this model, nonlinear interaction measures are then obtained to assess the extent and distribution of nonlinearity in the system. Analytical criteria are developed to predict the existence of nonlinear modal interactions that significantly affect system dynamic performance. To demonstrate the effect of nonlinear interaction, a case study of locating controllers to damp electromechanical oscillations is developed.

This curve is expected to be useful in the long-term prediction of market prices and is similar in spirit to the load duration curve. It shows the proportion of time over a given time horizon during which the real-time market price of electricity is expected to exceed specified dollar amounts. The price over a long term is a stochastic quantity that depends on physical factors such as production cost, load, generation availability, unit commitment, and transmission constraints. It also depends on economic factors such as strategic bidding and load elasticity. We illustrate a procedure for constructing a stochastic system-based model for the PDC, taking into account the randomness associated with load and generator outages. The effects of unit commitment, transmission congestion, and transmission outages are not considered. We use two economic models. One is due to Bertrand and represents perfect competition.

The paper embeds these considerations in an optimization procedure that checks if transmission security is maintained and, when necessary, generates minimal corrections in existing contractual transactions that ensure security. Given our interest in real-time applications, we consider problem formulations guaranteeing solution existence and global optimality.

3490,,"In electricity markets, financial transmission right is an important instrument for hedging congestion charges. There are two types of financial transmission rights: point-to-point right (FTR) and flow-based right (FGR). This paper proposes a risk-constrained FTR bidding strategy in transmission auction markets. Based on the forecasted LMP differences between sink and source points of certain FTRs, bidders try to maximize their expected payoffs by taking into account the associated risks. Supposing the forecasted distribution of LMP differences and bidders' risk preferences are known to respective bidders, the FTR bidding problem is modeled as a bilevel optimization with the upper subproblem representing bidders and the lower subproblem representing the solution to the ISO's FTR market clearing problem for maximizing the revenues collected from the FTR auction. The bilevel optimization problem is solved by developing the sensitivity of a bidder's expected utility with respect to its bidding strategy. A three-bus system with four bidders is considered for illustrating the proposed method. The numerical results discuss the distinction between FTR obligation and FTR option bidding strategies. The results further demonstrate the impact of contingency constraints, forecasted LMP differences, and bidders' preferred risk levels on FTR bidding strategies.",WOS:000228778800058,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Li, T. and Shahidehpour, M.","IIT, Elect Power & Power Elect Ctr, Chicago, IL 60616 USA",20,10.1109/Tpwrs.2005.846052,May,0885-8950,2,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,bidding strategy,contingencies,financial and physical risks,ftr obligation and option,incomplete information games,lmp,rights,design,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,921QF,,1014-1021,9211,Journal Article,,,Risk-constrained FTR bidding strategy in transmission markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,Risk-constrained FTR bidding strategy in transmission markets,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000228778800058,20,,,2005,,IIT,USA

3513,,"In today's volatile environment of restructured power markets, and with the passage of more stringent Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990, competitive generation units must have the ability for operating under flexible conditions to respond to various market driving forces. Among generating units with flexible operating conditions, those with fuel switching and fuel-blending capabilities, as well as combined cycle units, are commonly considered for responding to volatile market environments. For a detailed modeling of flexible operating conditions, we consider fuel types and limitations along with operating constraints such as unit configuration, min up/down time, ramping, generating capacity, and start-up characteristics, which could make unit commitment (UC) calculations even more cumbersome. In this paper, we consider network constraints in security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). The SCUC problem is decomposed into two coordinated problems, based on Benders decomposition, which include a master problem for optimizing UC and a subproblem for minimizing network violations. We apply Lagrangian relaxation to UC for modeling various types of generation units.

By properly selecting the continuation (local) parameter, the approach can avoid the numerical divergence encountered by a conventional approach, due to the singularity of he algebraic part of the equations. Meanwhile, by setting step size in a local parameterization, the approach varies its time step size acording to the first- or second-order sensitivity of the solution to the variation of local parameter. It employs larger time step sizes for slow dynamics and smaller ones for fast dynamics. The approach resents an advanced tool to study voltage dynamics in multiple me scales and is easiliy adaptable for quasisteady-state analysis)SS).

3589,,"Models formulated as complementarity problems have been applied previously to assess the potential for market power in transmission-constrained electricity markets. Here, we use the complementarity approach to simulate the interaction of pollution permit markets with electricity markets, considering forward contracts and the operating reserve market. Because some power producers are relatively large consumers of permits, there could be interaction between market power in the permits and energy markets. Market power in the energy market is modeled using a Cournot game, while a conjectured price response model is used in the permits market. An illustrative application is made to Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM), which we represent by a 14-node dc load-flow model, and the USEPA Ozone Transport Commission NOx Budget Program. The results show that forward contracts effectively mitigate market power in PJM energy market and both simulated solutions of perfect and Cournot (oligopoly) competition are a good approximation to actual prices in 2000, except that the Cournot model yielded higher peak prices. The NOx market influences the Cournot energy market in several ways. One is that Cournot competition lowers the price of NOx permits, which in turn affects on low- and high-emission producers differently. In general, because pollution permits are an important cost, high concentration in the market for such permits can exacerbate the effects of market power in energy markets.",WOS:000226733200015,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Chen, Y.

A case study with a 377-generator model of the Mexican interconnected system is used to illustrate nonlinear aspects arising from the nonlinear interaction of the different low-frequency inter-area modes.

3608,,"Market clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and confidence interval (CI) estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP prediction, however, is difficult, since MCP is a nonstationary process. Effective prediction, in principle, can be achieved by neural networks using extended Kalman filter (EKF) as an integrated adaptive learning and CI estimation method. EKF learning, however, is computationally expensive because it involves high dimensional matrix manipulations. This paper presents a modified U-D factorization method within the decoupled EKF (DEKF) framework. The computational speed and numerical stability of this resulting DEKF-UD method are significantly improved as compared to standard EKE. Testing results for a classroom problem and New England MCP predictions show that this new method provides smaller CIs than what provided by the BP-Bayesian method developed by the authors.

The motivation for finding a bifurcation subsystem and its advantages over model reduction, slaving, and finding the center manifold dynamics are discussed. By using the theoretical results of the persistence on saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation of a full system model with both fast and slow singularly perturbed dynamics, a more precise definition of what constitutes a bifurcation subsystem for both saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation is given. Persistence of the center manifold for the reduced models of singularly perturbed fast and slow external dynamics thus is shown. These results are then used to show that the center manifold of the saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation lies in the bifurcation subsystem or is contained within the bifurcation subsystem if additional conditions are satisfied. The test conditions for the existence of a bifurcation subsystem are: 1) quickly reviewed and 2) then applied to compute a saddle-node and a Hopf bifurcation subsystem for a multiple machine differential algebraic example system.

3651,,"In this paper, the power system model is formulated as a finite dimensional linear system whose state-space entries depend continuously on a time varying parameter vector called the scheduling variables. This system is referred to as the linear parameter varying (LPV) system. Although the trajectory of the changing parameters such as load levels and tie line flows is not known in advance, in most situations, they can be measured in real time. The LPV technique is applied to the decentralized design of power system stabilizers (PSS) for large systems. In the approach developed, instead of considering the complete system model with all the interconnections, we develop a decentralized approach where each individual machine is considered separately with arbitrarily changing real and reactive power output in a defined range. These variables are chosen as the scheduling variables. The designed controller automatically adjusts its parameters depending on the scheduling variables to coordinate with change of operating conditions and the dynamics of the rest of the system. The resulting decentralized PSSs give good performance in a large operating range. Design procedures are presented and comparisons are made between the LPV decentralized PSSs and conventionally designed PSSs on the 50-generator IEEE test system.",WOS:000224849400029,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Qiu, W.

The model is derived using a model reduction technique of a high-order finite-element model. Then, an equivalencing approach is presented that demonstrates how several wind generators in a wind park can be combined into a single reduced-order model.

Because of the distance involved in wide-area interconnections, communication delay cannot be ignored. Long time delay may be detrimental to system stability and may degrade system performance. The time delay tolerance of a centralized controller and the associated performance tradeoff is analyzed using a small gain criterion. Special attention is paid to the choice of weighting functions in a robust control design. As expected, it is found that time delay tolerance decreases when the system bandwidth increases, while the nominal system time-domain performance is concomitantly improved. Several approaches which can maintain a good system performance while increasing the time delay tolerance are suggested and compared.

The mechanism and scheme of protection systems have been analyzed for their contribution to cascading outages as well as system stability after a fault occurs.

For a large interconnected power grid, these constraints are influenced significantly by the interactions among path flows in different control areas. When a critical transmission path capability is limited by one of these constraints, it may be necessary to coordinate the interarea power transfers so as to improve the transfer capability on the constrained path without compromising on the security criteria. Based on such considerations, this paper presents a novel multiobjective methodology in which global strategies are developed for the improvement and coordination of transmission path transfers. The problem is formulated with respect to various constraints into suitable optimization problems. An efficient nonlinear programming algorithm with sufficient line search step is incorporated for finding optimal solutions while also incorporating security and stability constraints.

The unit commitment problem is initially formulated as a chance constrained optimization problem in which we require that the load be met with a specified high probability over the entire time horizon. The solution procedure consists of solving a sequence of deterministic versions of the unit commitment problem that converge to the solution of the chance constrained program. For the deterministic unit commitment problems, Lagrangian relaxation is used to separate the dual problem into its subproblems. Each subproblem is solved by a dynamic program. The initial results indicate that accounting for the correlation structure of the hourly loads reduces the value of the objective function when the optimization problem is formulated as a chance constrained program. Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the accuracy of the solution provided by the algorithm.

3767,,"In the locational marginal price (LMP)-based congestion management scheme, transmission customers face uncertainty in the congestion charges they incur. In order to bring certainty to customers, congestion revenue rights (CRR) such as the fixed transmission rights (FTR) used in the PJM interconnection and flowgate rights (FGR) are introduced. These CRR are financial tools that provide the holder reimbursement of the congestion charges incurred in the day-ahead market. The implementation of CRR requires appropriate modeling of the transmission network in which the distribution factors are extensively used. These factors-the injection shift factors (ISFs) and the power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs)-are linear approximations of the sensitivities of the active power line flows with respect to various variables. The factors are computed for a specified network topology and parameter values. In practice, the PTDFs used for the CRR issuance may be different from those used in the day-ahead market due to changes in the forecasted network conditions. The PTDF errors may impact the FTR issuance quantities, the revenue adequacy of the FTR issuer and the hedging ability of the FGR. In this paper, we explore analytical characteristics of these distribution factors and investigate their role in CRR applications. We study the nature of the PTDF errors and examine their impacts in these applications, both analytically and experimentally. Our results indicate that the impacts of the PTDF errors in CRR applications stay in an acceptable range under a broad spectrum of conditions including contingencies used to establish n - I security.",WOS:000221283300014,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Liu, M.

3777,,"The conjectured transmission price response model presented in the first of this two-paper series considers the expectations of oligopolistic generators regarding how demands for transmission services affect the prices of those services. Here, the model is applied to northwest Europe, simulating a mixed transmission pricing system including export fees, a path-based auction system for between-country interfaces, and implicit congestion-based pricing of internal country constraints. The path-based system does not give credit for counterflows when calculating export capability. The application shows that this no-netting policy can exacerbate the economic inefficiencies caused by oligopolistic pricing by generators. The application also illustrates the effects of different generator conjectures regarding rival supply responses and transmission prices. If generators anticipate that their increased demand for transmission services will increase transmission prices, then competitive intensity diminishes and energy prices rise. In the example here, the effect of this anticipation is to double the price increase that results from oligopolistic (Cournot) competition among generators.",WOS:000221283300023,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Hobbs, B.

This generalization reflects the market reality that large producers will anticipate that they can favorably affect transmission prices by their actions.

This mixed system includes fixed transmission tariffs, congestion-based pricing of physical transmission constraints (represented as a linearized dc load flow), and auctions of interface capacity in a path-based pricing system.

The DT inputs are apparent resistance R and its rate of change Rdot measured near the electrical center of the Pacific AC Intertie (PACI). The method involves triggering a fixed combination of one-shot controls when a DT trained for stability prediction indicates impending loss of synchronism. The proposed scheme is able to prevent loss of synchronism across the PACI in many situations, and it can preserve stability for the entire network sometimes. Robustness is demonstrated by evaluating the fixed control combination on a large number of simulations.",WOS:000188951000067,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Mei, K. J. and Rovnyak, S.

Developing effective strategies to optimize hourly offer curves for a hydrothermal power system to maximize profits has been one of the, most challenging and important tasks for a GenCo.

A stochastic mixed-integer optimization formulation having a separable structure with respect to individual units is first established. A method combining Lagrangian relaxation and stochastic dynamic programming is then presented to select hourly offer curves for both energy and reserve markets. In view that pumped-storage units provide significant energy and reserve at generating and pumping, the offering strategies are specially highlighted in this paper. Numerical testing based on an 11-unit system with a major pumped-storage unit in the New England market shows that the algorithm is computationally efficient, and effective energy and reserve offer curves are obtained in 4-5 min on a 660-MHz Pentium III PC.

3902,,"The capability to deal effectively with the uncertainty associated with locational marginal prices (LMPs) in congestion management schemes requires the development of appropriate financial tools. Congestion revenue rights (CRR) are hedging tools that provide the holder reimbursement of the congestion charges in the day-ahead market and thereby provide transmission service customers with price certainty. In this paper, we construct a framework for the design and analysis of the CRR by marrying finance theory notions with salient characteristics of electric power systems and electricity markets. The framework consists of three interconnected layers with one layer each to represent the models of the transmission network, the commodity markets and the CRR financial markets. The interaction between the layers is represented as information flows. The framework has sufficient scope to allow the analysis of a broad range of problems associated with ensuring price certainty for transmission services. The structural modularity of the framework provides the flexibility to analyze issues and design structures for the provision of transmission services in the competitive environment. We introduce a new notion of CRR payoff parity and a practical pricing scheme, which are used as the basis for the design of more liquid CRR markets.

3928,,"This paper describes a scheduling method for representing the thermal stress of turbine shafts as ramp rate constraints in the thermal commitment and dispatch of generating units. The paper uses Lagrangian relaxation for optimal generation scheduling. In applying the unit commitment, thermal stress over the elastic limit is used for calculating the ramping cost. The thermal stress contribution to generation cost requires the calculation of a set that includes thermal stress at the end of each time step; this requirement presents a complicated problem which cannot be solved by an ordinary optimization method such as dynamic programming. The paper uses an improved simulated annealing method to determine the optimal trajectory of each generating unit. Furthermore, the paper uses linear programming for economic dispatch in which thermal stress limits are incorporated in place of fixed ramp rate limits. The paper illustrates the economics of frequently ramping up/down of low cost generating units versus the cost of replacement of their turbine rotors with a shorter life span.

This large-signal model is formulated in continuous-time and is therefore compatible with standard models of power system components. In a departure from previous works on the subject, we do not postulate a particular model structure for the equivalent, hence the label nonparametric. The approach uses only measurements at points where internal (retained) and external (reduced) systems are interfaced, and requires no knowledge of parameters and topology of the external subsystem. The procedure consists of two conceptual steps: 1) the first (""bottleneck"") ANN is used to extract ""states"" of the reduced-order equivalent; and 2) the second (recurrent) ANN is embedded in an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) solver, and trained to approximate the ""right-hand side,"" using the states extracted at the first step. We also describe an extension in which a third ANN is used to synthesize missing interface measurements from a historical database of system responses to various disturbances.

Marti model) which is currently used in most electromagnetic transient programs [1], has been a major contribution to the power system transient simulations. However, despite its accuracy and computational efficiency for most simulation cases, it still requires improvement due to the approximation it makes in choosing the modal transformation matrix T-v. This matrix is, in general, frequency dependent and used in transforming variables between the phase and modal domains at each simulation time step. Currently, it is approximated as a constant matrix which may not hold true for certain tower configurations and/or conductor types where line parameters vary drastically with frequency. In this paper, a wavelet-based alternative solution, which incorporates frequency dependence of transformation matrices into the simulation process, is proposed.

The current practice of reactive management relies on heuristics and operators' judgments to procure reactive services. Consequently, it lacks a transparent market process and assurance that the procurement costs are the lowest. This paper presents a practical, market-based solution for managing reactive services by transmission operators. Three distinct features for the proposed solution are: 1) obligating generation facilities to provide reactive services in proportion to their active power output; 2) optimizing and integrating the reactive procurement with market operation for least-cost solution; and 3) taking into account the interactions of active and reactive powers for accurate calculation of the lost opportunity costs of generators. The proposed solution further simplifies the modeling and settlement aspects of reactive management.

4028,,"Fast, accurate algorithms to compute network capabilities are indispensable for transfer-based electricity markets. Most transfer studies involve contingencies and multipattern scenarios that often can only be performed in reasonable time with the use of linear methods. One of the limitations of linear ATC is the error produced by neglecting the effect of reactive power flows in line loading. This paper describes a fast algorithm to incorporate this effect. The estimation of the line post-transfer complex flow is based on circle equations and a megavar-corrected megawatt limit. The method can be easily integrated into existing linear ATC software because the computation remains based on active power distribution factors. The algorithm is illustrated in a small example and the error correction demonstrated for transfers in larges systems.",WOS:000182870000028,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Grijalva, S., Sauer, P.

4053,,"This paper compares methods for converting system limits into market signals. One classification of methods is according to reliability driven (TLR and similar) versus market driven (LMP and similar) methods. A second classification is according to direct versus indirect methods. Direct methods deal with individual limits and constraints. Indirect methods include various ways of converting one type of limit to another, equivalent limit for purposes of making the handling of the limit more expeditious. An example of an indirect method is the conversion of 4 voltage limit to either a flow limit or an interface limit. Another example is the use of flow limits on interfaces as surrogates for stability limits. These transformed limits are often represented by nomograms. Conversion of one type of limit to another and the construction of nomograms has the advantage of reducing the problem of imposing system limits within a market context to a ""previously solved"" market problem. If a market already has learned how to cope with an import limit into a load pocket, conversion of a voltage limit into a load pocket import limit makes it easy for a market to react and respond to the condition. However, any conversion from one type of limit to another,entails an approximation.

The objectives are in conflict since the improvement of one of them leads to the deterioration of another. Instead of a unique optimal solution, it exists a set of best tradeoffs between competing objectives, the so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. A specially tailored nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) for a PMU placement problem is proposed as a methodology to find these Pareto-optimal solutions. The algorithm is combined with the graph-theoretical procedure and a simple GA to reduce the initial number of the PMU's candidate locations. The NSGA parameters are carefully set by performing a number of trial runs and evaluating the NSGA performances based on the number of distinct Pareto-optimal solutions found in the particular run and distance of the obtained Pareto front from the optimal one.

4107,,"The optimal tap selection of transformers directly connected to generators is one of the two significant industry problems. The generator stepup and auxiliary transformers generally are equipped with no-load (fixed) taps that are infrequently changed. Their optimum positions need to be determined for meeting power system discrete states over long periods, covering the annual light-load, peak-load, and emergency conditions. The other and related problem is the use of design reactive capability of generators rather than their actual operating limits. This paper reports on application of a modified barrier-augmented Lagrangian (MBAL)-based nonlinear optimal power-flow method for the optimum selections of the transformer tap positions and the voltage set points of the generators within their over and underexcitation operating limits. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated using a 160-bus test system in operation at a midatlantic utility. It is shown that the method minimizes the deviations of the system bus voltages from the unity while meeting the power system equality and inequality constraints under lightand peak-load conditions.",WOS:000180981100034,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Adibi, A.

4133,,"The energy market clearing prices (MCPs) in deregulated power markets are volatile. Good MCP prediction and its confidence interval estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP prediction, however, is difficult since bidding strategies used by participants are complicated and various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. Furthermore, MCP predictors usually have a cascaded structure, as several key input factors need to be predicted first. Cascaded structures are widely used, however, they have not been adequately investigated. This paper analyzes the uncertainties involved in a cascaded neural-network (NN) structure for MCP prediction, and develops the prediction distribution under the Bayesian framework. A computationally efficient algorithm to evaluate the confidence intervals by using the memoryless Quasi-Newton method is also developed. Testing results on a classroom problem and on New England MCP prediction show that the method is computationally efficient and provides accurate prediction and confidence coverage.

Current techniques for estimating electromechanical modes are computationally intensive and rely on complex system models. This research complements model-based approaches and uses measurement-based techniques. This paper discusses the development of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) block-processing technique to estimate these low-frequency electromechanical modes from measured ambient power system data without requiring a disturbance. This technique is applied to simulated data containing a stationary low-frequency mode generated from a 19-machine test model. The frequency and damping factor of the estimated modes are compared with the actual modes for various block sizes. This technique is also applied to 35-min blocks of actual ambient power system data before and after a disturbance and compared to results from Prony analysis on the ringdown from the disturbance.,WOS:000180981100023,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Wies, R.

One major advantage of this approach over deterministic online security assessment is that it condenses contingency likelihood and severity into indices that reflect probabilistic risk. Use of these indices in control room decision making leads to increased understanding of potential network problems, including overload, cascading overload, low voltages, and voltage instability, resulting in improved security-related decision making.

If implemented in large enough numbers, DER equipment may feasibly be leveraged to provide ancillary services such as spinning reserve, system inertia, or system stabilization. To determine the potential impacts of DER on future transmission grid stability, dynamic models of DER load combinations were created, reduced in order, and scattered throughout Central and Southern California within an existing Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) dynamic model. Evaluation of the composite WSCC-DER dynamic model allows correlations to be drawn between various DER properties and the transmission grid stability. Key findings show that increasing DER inertia tends to destabilize the transmission system.

4194,,"An auction-based process is proposed that allows power market participants to acquire and reconfigure financial transmission rights. The process simultaneously accommodates flowgate and point-to-point options and obligations, along with energy production and consumption futures. A sequence of auctions is held during which participants can buy and sell rights, which are then settled in a day-ahead or real-time auction, at which time all rights are cashed out. By allowing flowgate and point-to-point obligations and options to be reconfigured and exchanged, the market can decide what combination of financial rights are most useful to power generators, consumers, and traders. Rights can be specified not only for capacity of individual flowgates, but also for more complex transmission constraints, such as nomograms. Under certain conditions, we prove that the auction is revenue adequate for the market operator, in that payments to rights holders cannot exceed congestion revenues.

4202,,"This paper presents a new approach to short-term load forecasting in a deregulated and price-sensitive environment. A real-time pricing type scenario, is envisioned where energy prices could change on an hourly basis with the consumer having the ability to react to the price signal through shifting his electricity usage from expensive hours to other times when possible. The load profile under this scenario would have different characteristics compared to that of the regulated, fixed-price era. Consequently, short-term load forecasting models customized on price-insensitive (PIS) historical data of regulated era would no longer be able to perform well. In this work, a price-sensitive (PS) load forecaster is developed. This forecaster consists of two stages, an artificial neural network based PIS load forecaster followed by a fuzzy logic (FL) system that transforms the PIS load forecasts of the first stage into PS forecasts. The first stage forecaster is a widely used forecaster in industry known as ANNSTLF. For the FL system of the second stage, a genetic algorithm based approach is developed to automatically optimize the number of rules and the number and parameters of the fuzzy membership functions. Another FL system is developed to simulate PS load data from the PIS historical data of a utility. This new forecaster termed NFSTLF is tested on three PS database and it is shown that it produces superior results to the PIS ANNSTLF.",WOS:000179985800047,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Khotanzad, A., Zhou, E.

The allocation results are used in the congestion relief of the independent grid operator (IGO) so as to allow it to acquire relief services to remove the overload congestion attributed to each transaction from the network in the most economic manner. The congestion charges attributable to each transaction for its usage of the network are also determined.

As a detailed survey of the power market modeling literature shows, OF models differ from previous approaches in that they represent each of GenCo's conjectures regarding how rival firms will adjust sales in response to price changes. The CSF approach is a more realistic and flexible framework for modeling imperfect competition than other models for three reasons. First, the models include as a special case the Cournot conjecture that rivals will not change production if prices change; thus, the CSF framework is more general. Second, Cournot models cannot be used when price elasticity of demand is zero, but the proposed models can. Third, unlike supply function equilibrium models, CSF equilibria can be calculated for large transmission networks. Existence and uniqueness properties for prices and profits are reported.

The algorithm utilizes price and dispatch sensitivities, available from the Hessian matrix and gradient of the OPF, to help determine an optimal change in an individual's bid. The algorithm is shown to be successful in determining local welfare maxima, and the prospects for scaling the algorithm up to realistically sized systems are very good.

4280,,"Regulatory changes and advances in distributed resources (DR) technology have lead utilities to consider DRs as alternatives to central station generation and T&D investments. This paper presents a comprehensive planning and production simulation model that simultaneously evaluates central and local investments to determine the optimal mix for long-term expansion. The model can also be viewed as optimizing DRs while simulating a perfectly competitive wholesale power market. The model is a mixed integer linear stochastic program that enforces Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws and is solved using generalized Benders decomposition (GBD). The formulation includes multiarea probabilistic production costing as a subproblem. DRs and local distribution reinforcements are modeled as integer variables, while transmission and central generation options are represented as continuous variables. The model is applied to a ten-year multi-area example that suggests that DRs are able to modify capacity additions and production costs by changing demand and power flows.",WOS:000176062900041,Ieee T Power Syst,,"McCusker, S.

The proposed approach introduces an index called the single contingency sensitivity (SCS) index which is used to rank the system branches according to their suitability for installing a TCSC. Once the locations are determined, an optimization problem of finding the best settings for the installed TCSCs in case of a given set of contingencies, is formulated and solved. The objective of the optimization problem is to eliminate or minimize line overloads as well as the unwanted loop flows under single contingencies. The proposed approach for locating and controlling TCSCs enhances the static security and reduces the power losses in a given power system.

One approach, proposed by Cadwalader et al. is based on dual decomposition in which out of area congestion is ''priced-out'' and added to the optimal power flow (OPF) objective function of the control area operator while the prices are determined iteratively via nodal energy adjustment bids. The paper demonstrates through a simple three node example that even with ''correct prices'' on out-of-area congested interfaces, the augmented AC-OPF objective function of a control area operator might not be locally convex at the optimal solution and hence the control area's optimal dispatch may violate the thermal constraints on out-of-area interfaces. That conclusion supports the alternative ''flow-based'' approach that enforces thermal limits more directly, which is consistent with North American Electric Reliability Council's (NERC's) FLOWBAT proposal for interzonal transmission load relief (TLR).",WOS:000173671300024,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Oren, S.

Circuit breakers (CBs) and fuses are provided at different locations for Isolation of faulted loads, generators or distribution system from unfaulted portions of the system. These faults could be due to widespread system fault resulting from battle damage or material casualties of individual loads or cables. After the faults and subsequent Isolation of the faults, there will be unfaulted sections that are left without supply. Fast restoration of supply to these unfaulted sections of the SPS is necessary for system survivability. This paper presents a new method to reconfigure the network to restore service to unfaulted sections of the system. The problem is formulated as a variation of fixed charge network flow problem.

It arises from the practical concern that transient stability and voltage regulation are both important properties of power system control, but they are ascribed to different model descriptions and relate to different stages of system operation (i.e., transient period and post-transient period respectively). Earlier control results deal with the two problems separately, or employ a switching strategy of two different kinds of controllers, which causes a discontinuity of system behavior. We design in this paper a global controller to coordinate the transient stabilizer and voltage regulator. The designed controller is smooth and robust with respect to different transient faults.

The algorithm is designed to handle time varying loads when evaluating phase moves that will result in improved circuit losses over all load points.

4419,,"The deregulation and reconstruction of the electric power industry worldwide raises many challenging issues related to the economic and reliable operation of electric power systems. Traditional unit commitment or hydrothermal scheduling problems have been integrated with generation resource bidding, but the development of optimization based bidding strategies is only at a very preliminary stage. This paper presents a bidding strategy based on the theory of ordinal optimization that the ordinal comparisons of performance measures are robust with respect to noise and modeling error, and the problems become much easier if the optimization goal is softened from asking for the ""best"" to ""good enough"" solution. The basic idea of our approach is to use a approximate model that describes the influence of bidding strategies on the market clearing prices (MCP). A nominal bid curve is obtained by solving optimal power generation for a given set of MCPs via Lagrangian relaxation. Then N bids are generated by perturbing the nominal bid curve. The ordinal optimization method is applied to isolate a good enough set S that contains some good bids with high probability by performing rough evaluation. The best bid is then selected by solving full hydrothermal scheduling or unit commitment problems for each of the bids in S. Using ordinal optimization approach we are able to obtain a good enough bidding strategy with reasonable computational effort. Numerical results using historical MCPs from the California market and a generation company with 10 units show that the ordinal optimization based method is efficient and good bidding strategies are obtained.",WOS:000171787000030,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Guan, X.

In fact, the NERC criteria CPS1 and CPS2 are special cases of the criteria;of the framework. The paper thus provides an analytic rationale for the NERC control performance criteria.

The two models simulate bilateral markets. The models include a congestion pricing scheme for transmission, but other transmission pricing approaches can also be represented in this framework. The two models differ from each other in that one has no arbitrage between nodes of the network, while in the other model, arbitragers erase any noncost based differences in price. The latter bilateral model turns out to be equivalent to a Cournot model of a POOLCO. The models differ from other Cournot market models in that they include both of Kirchhoff's laws via a DC approximation; can include arbitragers; possess unique solutions; and are readily solved by efficient LCP algorithms.

Most approaches in the literature solve the problem sequentially, which may lead to an under or over-estimation of the service requirement and transaction curtailment. A few of them do it iteratively which is quite time consuming. In this paper, a combined framework for service identification and congestion management is proposed. The ideal objective function is to maximize the overall profit of all market participants. Practically, an upper bound cost minimization is suggested and has been applied to identify two of the services, the reactive support and real power loss services, in case of congestion. The service costs plus the congestion cost are minimized. Results show that the proposed approach results in a smaller transaction curtailment.

A critical issue is the incentive paid to the customer to participate in demand management programs and provide load relief. The utility has to design cost effective yet attractive demand management contracts, The main goal is to get load relief when needed, and to do so in a cost effective way. Customers sign up for programs when the benefits they derive in the form of up front payments, demand discounts and interruption payments exceed their cost of interruption. In order to design such contracts, mechanism design with revelation principle is adopted from Game Theory and applied to the interaction between a utility and its customers. The idea behind mechanism design is to design an incentive structure that encourages customers to sign up for the right contract and reveal their true value of power (and thus, the value of power interruptibility).",WOS:000166738400012,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Fahrioglu, M. and Alvarado, F.

The allocation scheme is developed using a framework in which the transactions are explicitly represented. The proposed scheme is based on expressing losses explicitly in terms of all the transactions in the system. An important property of the allocation scheme is its effective capability to deal with counter flows that result in the presence of specific transactions. Extensive numerical testing indicates that the allocation scheme produces loss allocations that are appropriate and that behave in a physically reasonable manner.

4665,,"As the electrical industry restructures, many of the traditional algorithms for controlling generating units need modification or replacement. Previously utilized to schedule generation units in a manner that minimizes costs while meeting all demand, the unit commitment (UC) algorithm must be updated. A UC algorithm that maximizes profit will play an essential role in developing successful bidding strategies for the competitive generator. Simply bidding to win contracts is insufficient; bidding strategies must result in contracts that, on average, cover the total generation costs. No longer guaranteed to be the only electricity supplier, a generation company's share of the demand will be more difficult to predict than in the past, Removing the obligation to serve softens the demand constraint. In this paper the authors provide a price/profit-based UC formulation which considers the softer demand constraint and allocates fixed and transitional costs to the scheduled hours.

Measures of these uncertainties are obtained from an analysis of two years' actual hourly load data. Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the contributions of uncertainties resulting from load and generator availabilities to the variance of production costs. It is found that ignoring the ambient temperature forecasts and correlation among hourly loads results in inaccurate prediction of costs, and that load uncertainty accounts for a significant portion of the variance of production costs.

It describes a method of valuing risky projects based on Options Pricing Theory and Decision Analysis and its implementation to long-term power portfolio management or integrated resource planning for an electric utility in Texas. The author believes that the methodology described in this paper has wide application in the deregulated competitive electricity market from integrated resource planning for utilities facing competition and valuing a power plant investment by an independent power producer to pricing electricity options.",WOS:000087916000017,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Siddiqi, S.

This paper; presents a novel approach to very short-time load forecasting by the application of artificial neural networks to model load dynamics. The proposed algorithm is more robust as compared to the traditional approach when actual loads are forecasted and used as input variables. It provides more reliable forecasts, especially when the weather conditions are different from those represented in the training data. The proposed method has been successfully implemented and used for on-line load forecasting in a power utility in the United States. To assure robust performance and training times acceptable for on-line use, the forecasting system was implemented as a set of parsimoniously designed mural networks.

The improvements detailed in this paper come from using data structures which combine genetic programming and finite state automata termed GP-Automata. The strategies developed by the method described here are adaptive-reacting to input-whereas the previously developed strategies were only suitable in the particular scenario for which they had been designed. The strategies encoded in the GP-Automata are tested in an auction simulator. The simulator pits them against other distribution companies (distcos) and generation companies (gencos), buying and selling power via double auctions implemented in regional commodity exchanges. The GP-Automata are evolved with a genetic algorithm so that they possess certain characteristics. In addition to designing successful bidding strategies (whose usage would result in higher profits) the resulting strategies can also be designed to imitate certain types of trading behaviors. The resulting strategies can be implemented directly in online trading, or can be used as realistic competitors in an off-line trading simulator.",WOS:000083533500004,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Richter, C.

4776,,"Deregulation eliminates the boundary of the territory of the monopoly power industry. Competition forces utilities to improve power quality as well as to reduce investment and operation costs. Feeder imbalance describes a situation in which the voltages of a three-phase voltage source are not identical in magnitude, or the phase differences between them are not 120 electrical degrees, or both. It affects motors and other devices that depend upon a well-balanced three-phase voltage source. Phase balancing is to make the voltages balanced at each load point of the feeder. Phase swapping is a direct approach for phase balancing with the minimum cost. Phase balancing can enhance utilities' competitive capability by improving reliability, quality, and reducing costs. Therefore, phase balancing optimization is nowadays receiving more attention in the power industry, especially in today's deregulating environments.

The economic cost of inaccurate forecasts is assessed by a combination of forecast simulation, unit commitment optimization, and economic dispatch modeling for several different generation/load systems. The forecast simulation preserves the error distributions and correlations actually experienced by users of a neural net-based forecasting system. Underforecasts result in purchases of expensive peaking or spot market power; overforecasts inflate start-up and fixed costs because too much capacity is committed. The value of improved accuracy is found to depend on load and generator characteristics; for the systems considered here, a reduction of 1% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreases variable generation costs by approximately 0.1%-0.3% when MAPE is in the range of 3%-5%.

The SGM suffers from slow convergence caused by the non-differentiable characteristics of dual functions. This paper presents an algorithm that utilizes the Bundle Trust Region Method (BTRM) to update the multipliers within the Lagrangian relaxation framework. The BTRM is shown to converge faster than the SGM as well as other bundle type methods in optimizing non-differentiable dual functions. The application of BTRM for solving hydro subproblems results in greatly improved convergence over the SGM.

The technique implemented active selection of training data, employing the k-nearest; neighbors concept. A novel concept of pilot simulation was used to determine the number of hidden units fdr the ANNs. The ensemble of local ANN predictors was used to produce the final forecast, whereby the iterative forecasting procedure used a simple average of ensemble ANNs. Results obtained using data from two US utilities showed forecasting accuracy comparable to those using similar techniques.

This cost includes the explicit and opportunity cost from various generation sources, such as generators, and the explicit cost from various transmission sources, such as reactive compensators, tap-changing transformers and the cost of transmission losses. Different from previous objectives functions, in this paper, a cost-based reactive power dispatch is presented, which minimizes the total cost of reactive power support and determines the resultant reactive profile.

Ranking of contingencies requires the use of severity indices, and for DSA such an index must be a measure of stability. From experience in static security analysis, it is well known that some indices work better than others for particular power systems and that combinations of indices usually work better than a single index. For DSA, which is still in its infancy, severity indices are more complex and very few have been tested for screening. In this paper, several indices are proposed for contingency screening in online DSA. These indices are based on the concepts of coherency, transient energy conversion between kinetic energy and potential energy, and three dot products of system variables.

The ISPS is the projection of parametric sensitivity onto a particular critical eigensubspace of interest. In [4], the measure of ISPS is used qualitatively to identify the parameters that affect the voltage stability. In this paper, major modifications are proposed to extend the applicability of the ISPS. ISPS is computed while tracing simultaneously the trajectory of both dynamic and algebraic state variables. By doing so, the sparsity of total Jacobian (the Jacobian that corresponds to both dynamic and algebraic variables) is fully exploited. We also derived a new voltage stability margin estimation from the measure of ISPS. It is shown here that the derived margin sensitivity vector can be calculated with essentially no further cost once the measure of ISPS is available. The voltage stability margin for any other parameter variations can be easily estimated without re-computing the P-V curves. With this methodology, effective controls can be easily coordinated by quantifying the relative importance of a wide range of control parameters.

4960,,"Unstable equilibrium points (UEP's) have been studied extensively in the transient stability literature previously for understanding the transient stability boundary structure of the system operating point. In contrast with UEP's, unstable limit cycles (ULC's) can represent the critical portion of the transient stability boundary for a detailed power system model under certain operating conditions. Using Hopf bifurcation theory, it is shown that ULC's are likely to be present on the transient stability boundary when the operating condition has poorly damped oscillatory modes which are subcritical (that is, nonlinear unstable). Because it is extremely difficult to compute ULC's in general power system models, a novel technique to approximate unstable limit cycles through reverse-time integration on a center manifold approximation is proposed in the paper. The technique is illustrated by computation of ULC's in 9-bus and 4-bus test systems.

4966,,"In this paper, optimal power flow (with transmission security and voltage constraints) is incorporated in the unit commitment formulation. Using Benders decomposition, the formulation is decomposed into a master problem and a subproblem. The master problem solves unit commitment with prevailing constraints, except transmission security and voltage constraints, by augmented Lagrangian relaxation. The subproblem minimizes violations of transmission security and voltage constraints for a commitment schedule given in the master problem. Since transmission constraints are decoupled from voltage constraints in the subproblem, the subproblem could further be decomposed into two smaller subproblems. The resulting transmission subproblem minimizes transmission flow violations for the worst contingency case by adjusting unit generation and phase shifter controls. The corresponding reactive subproblem minimizes voltage constraints by reactive power generation and tap changing controls. In the case of transmission flow or voltage infeasibility, Benders cuts are produced for unit commitment rescheduling. The iterative process between the master problem and the subproblems provides a minimum production cost solution for generation scheduling while satisfying the constraints.

Identical or similar units can prevent LR horn finding the optimal solution. If the units are similar, LR may have trouble selecting some of them for the optimal solution. A feasible solution may thus not be found. Since a heuristic selection of which unit data to alter has to be applied, this is inequitable to the unit(s)not selected and may result in lawsuit(s). Because the dispatcher has to use heuristic selection, there is no ""fair'' solution to these problems. The authors suggest previously published methods to implement auctions.

Feeder reconfiguration and phase swapping are two popular methods to balance the systems. For an unbalanced feeder system, feeder reconfiguration is difficult to meet the phase balancing criterion due to the limited number of sectionalizing switches available. Phase swapping is another alternative and direct approach for phase balancing. Phase swapping has not received its deserved attention due to the complexity of feeder systems, the dimension of problems, and totally overlooking the impacts of phase imbalance. Phase swapping can economically and effectively balance the feeder systems to improve power quality and reduce power system total cost. Deregulation arises competition on power quality, service reliability, and electricity price. Therefore phase swapping can enhance utilities competitive capability. This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming formulation for phase swapping optimization. Single-phase loads are treated differently with three-phase loads.

Results compare favorably to the ones reported in the literature, indicating that more parsimonious set of input variables can be used in STLF without sacrificing the accuracy of the forecast.

5144,,"For on-line dynamic security analysis (DSA), the preventive control or remedial action should be an integral part of the function if instability for a contingency is detected. Research done so far in on-line remedial action has been in rescheduling generation and mast of the suggested methods for determining such preventive control use the sensitivities of the stability energy margin to the generator power injections. For any approach using the energy margin, computation time is a concern and a somewhat different approach was suggested that determines control action by maximizing coherency of the generators without the use of sensitivities. In this paper, a new coherency based sensitivity method is proposed for generation rescheduling. Different coherency indices have been defined and then compared by ranking the contingencies according to these indices as well as the energy margin index. Since the coherency indices are always functions of the rotor angles, the sensitivity trajectories of a coherency index, such as the most critical rotor angle, with respect to changes of generation can be calculated at every time step of the integration process. This paper suggests that these sensitivities calculated shortly after fault clearing be used for rescheduling the generation. The calculation of these sensitivities are obviously faster than the calculation of the energy margin sensitivities. This paper also shows, with test results using several different systems, that the rescheduling achieved by this method provides the necessary remedial action. It is also noted that this method is intuitively more direct as it uses the sensitivities of the worst affected generator angles for rescheduling.",WOS:000075064400014,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Li, W.

5164,,"A multiarea power system consists of several areas (subsystems) interconnected by a transmission network. In estimating expected generation costs for such systems, transmission capacity limits of the network should be recognized. Transportation network models have generally been used because of their simplicity, but they only enforce Kirchhoff's current law. AC power flow modeling of the transmission network, which recognizes thermal, voltage and stability constraints, is theoretically best, but is too unwieldy for assessing expected costs. The so-called ""DC"" linearized network model is adopted here as a compromise, as it enforces both Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws while its linearity facilitates incorporation in probabilistic production costing models. In this paper, we generalize a bounding-based multiarea probabilistic production costing model to include loop flow and resistance losses based on the DC network model. This is the first multiarea model based on efficient convolution methods for production costing that also includes loop flows and resistance losses.

The method is derived from a load model in the form of a probability density function of load and load affecting factors. A load forecast is a conditional expectation of load given the time, weather conditions and other explanatory variables. This forecast can be calculated directly from historical data as a local average of observed past loads with the size of the local neighborhood and the specific weights on the loads defined by a multivariate product kernel. The method accuracy relies on the adequate representation of possible future conditions by historical data, but a measure to detect any unreliable forecast can be easily constructed.

A forecast of the future electric demand and its geographic distribution is a prerequisite for distribution planning. The quality and accuracy of this forecast have large influence on the quality of the electrical distribution system planning. Spatial load forecasting emerges to provide a more accurate prediction of both the magnitudes and locations of future electric loads. Since the load growth pattern is dominated by its land-use (residential, commercial, or industrial), the land usage study of small area is important to capture the future loads accurately. There are many factors which will affect the customer land-use decision, for example, distance to highway, distance to urban pole, and the costs. The customer's preferences can be estimated based on these objective factors. Then the land utilization and the electricity consumption can be estimated. Since the objectives sometimes are conflicting each other, it can be cumbersome to use conventional cost function approach to determine the land usage decision.

5264,,"Lagrangian relaxation has been widely used for the hydrothermal scheduling of power systems. The idea is to use Lagrangian multipliers to relax system-wide demand and reserve requirements, and decompose the problem into unit-wise subproblems that are much easier to solve. The multipliers are then updated at the high level, most commonly by using a subgradient method (SGM). Since the high level dual function is non-differentiable with many ""ridges,"" SGM may zigzag across ridges resulting in slow convergence. This paper presents an algorithm that utilizes a recently developed ""reduced complexity bundle method"" (RCBM) to update the multipliers at the high level. The RCBM is a kind of ""bundle method"" that enjoy faster convergence compared to SGM, but has much reduced complexity as compared to a conventional bundle method. Testing results show that RCBM can find better directions, avoid zigzagging behavior, End obtain better dual and feasible solutions as compared to the SGM.",WOS:000073212600077,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Luh, P.

An exact Newton method employing an LU factorization has been one of the most widely used power flow solution algorithms, due to the efficient minimum degree ordering techniques that attempt to minimize fill-in. However, the LU factorization remains a computationally expensive task that can be avoided by the use of an iterative method in solving the linear subproblem. An inexact Newton method with a preconditioned Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES [12]) linear solver is presented as a promising alternative for solving the power flow equations. When combined with a good duality preconditioner, the Newton-GMRES method achieves a better than 50% reduction in computation, compared to Newton-LU, for two large-scale power systems: one with 3493 buses and 6689 branches, another with 8027 buses and 13765 branches.",WOS:000073212600001,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Flueck, A.

The operation constraints are modeled as linear equality/inequality equations, resulting in a typical QP problem. Goal Programming techniques are also incorporated in the formulation which guarantees the best available solution even under infeasible conditions.

In a deregulated power industry where utilities absorb the ultimate consequence of their decision making, reexamination of load management must be conducted, In this paper, profit-based load management is introduced to examine generic direct load control scheduling. Based upon the cost/market price function, the approach aims to increase the profit of utilities. Instead of determining the amount of energy to be deferred of to be paid back, the algorithm controls the number of groups per customer/load type to maximize the profit.

5485,,"Power system loads are constantly changing. Over a time-span of a few minutes, these changes are primarily random. The random load variations act as a constant low-level excitation to the electromechanical dynamics of the system which shows up as ambient noise in field measured voltage, current, and power signals. Assuming the random variations are white and stationary over an analysis window, it is theoretically possible to estimate the electromechanical modal frequencies and damping from the spectral content of the ambient noise. In this paper, field collected ambient noise is analyzed by solving the Wiener-Hopf linear prediction equations to estimate the modal frequency and damping. These estimates are then compared with results from a Prony analysis on a ringdown resulting from a 1400 MW brake insertion under the same operating conditions as the ambient data. Results show that estimates are consistent between the ambient and ringdown analysis indicating that it is possible to estimate a system's electromechanical characteristics simply from ambient data. These results demonstrate that it may be possible to provide power system control and operation algorithms with a real-time estimate of modal frequency and damping.",WOS:A1997XM56100076,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Pierre, J.

The approach is modeled after traditional security assessment procedures which result in use of a nomogram for characterizing the security boundaries; these procedures are common among many North American utilities today. Therefore, the approach builds on what is already familiar in the industry, but it lakes advantage of computer automation and neural networks for generating and understanding large data bases. The appeal of the approach is threefold: it provides increased accuracy in boundary representation, it reduces the labor traditionally required in generating security boundaries, and the resulting boundaries, encoded in fast, flexible C subroutines, can be integrated into energy management system software to provide the operator with compact, understandable boundary illustration in real time.

Subsynchronous resonance tests show that TCSC interactions with shaft dynamics of PGE's Boardman steam generator are well understood and are effectively avoided by normal TCSC valve firing logic. Modulation tests, performed with the Boardman plant off line, show that the TCSC can be a powerful and responsive actuator for swing damping. Security considerations did not permit lightly damped operation of the controlled plant. Close analysis indicates that the TCSC damping contribution, though small, was measurable. The best estimate is that damping for the McNary mode is 7.33% and 8.55%, for the TCSC damper loop open and closed respectively.

Moreover, growing competitive pressures make it necessary to plan transmission systems to facilitate competition among alternative generation and demand-side resources.

7151,,"Linear programming is a tool that has yet to reach its full potential in power system engineering. To illustrate in a tutorial style how it is currently being applied and how its use evolved, applications are outlined in three areas: generation scheduling, loss minimization through allocation of reactive power supply, and planning of capital investments in generation equipment. The applications include not only linear programming but also its extensions to integer and quadratic programming and to the use of Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition techniques. The planning issues discussed show the limitations of traditional engineering economics to power system planning. This occurs when them is a spread between the interest rates for lending and for borrowing funds and also when investment funds have limits and thus are rationed. The result of this review is the recommendation that power system planning models should incorporate financial flows with the linear programming approach to capital budgeting originally formulated in 1963 by H. M. Weingartner. The need for such an approach is illustrated in the appendix with examples of how capital market conditions can upset the type of engineering economic decision making currently used in planning models. The Lagrangian relaxation method, which can extend computational feasibility for linear and integer programming, is also described in the appendix.",WOS:A1992JC57400023,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Delson, J.

Despite the fact that interdependencies are essential for the operation of critical infrastructures, such interdependencies can negatively affect the reliability and fuel the cascade of failures within and across the networks. In this paper, a novel interdependent Markov-chain framework is proposed that enables capturing interdependencies between two critical infrastructures with the ultimate goal of predicting their resilience to cascading failures and characterizing the effects of interdependencies on system reliability. The framework is sufficiently general to model cascading failures in any interdependent networks; however, this paper focuses on the electric-cyber infrastructure as an example. Using this framework it is shown that interdependencies among reliable systems, i.e., systems with exponentially distributed failure sizes, can make the individually reliable systems behave unreliably as a whole with power-law failure-size distributions.",WOS:000379696800025,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Rahnamay-Naeini, M. and Hayat, M.

Thereafter, we consider a probabilistic traffic model for modeling delays in any typical wide-area communication network, and study how the delays enter the process of information exchange between distributed phasor data concentrators that are employed to execute this consensus algorithm in a coordinated fashion. Finally, we propose four different strategies by which the convergence rate and accuracy of this consensus algorithm can be made immune to the asynchrony resulting from the network traffic. We carry out extensive simulations to show possible numerical instabilities and sensitivities of the ADMM convergence on our proposed strategies.

The objective is to optimize the operation of the distribution feeder according to a variety of performance objectives and ensure voltage regulation. In general, these algorithms take a form of the widely studied ac optimal power flow (OPF) problem. For the envisioned application domain, nonlinear power-flow constraints render pertinent OPF problems nonconvex and computationally intensive for large systems. To address these concerns, we formulate a quadratic constrained quadratic program (QCQP) by leveraging a linear approximation of the algebraic power-flow equations. Furthermore, simplification from QCQP to a linearly constrained quadratic program is provided under certain conditions.

8462,,"Transient stability controller design based on an optimality principle is an emerging approach for resolving high order contingencies that can otherwise lead to rotor angle instability. It is difficult to design for high order contingencies due to their complexity. A challenging issue is the nonlinearity of the system, which limits the selection approaches available and results in a potentially large search space to find a suitable control action. Because rotor angle instability evolves rapidly, a fast control response is required. This paper develops a cost-based controller under the constraint of bounded computation. A method to downsize the admissible control search space is developed in a manner that retains controls most likely to provide the best cost. Subsequently, a further reduction in computation is designed through model elimination. A set of common cost metrics is applied for all controllers. Tradeoffs between the model-based and model-free approaches are demonstrated. The effect of computational constraints on the competing goals of control cost and control timeliness for complex contingencies is tested with the New England 39-bus system.",WOS:000379696800021,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Zweigle, G.

This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation for a more efficient application of topology control strategies in real world scenarios with anticipated increase in the presence of highly variable renewable generation and uncertain loads. Such uncertainties are modeled via the point estimation method embedded into the dc optimal power flow-based formulations for optimal switching solutions. Hourly and daily advantages of the proposed probabilistic framework, compared with the conventional operations and deterministic formulations, are discussed. As the anticipated economic gains would increase through sequential implementation of several switching actions, a new probabilistic decision making approach to identify the optimal number of switching actions at each hour is also proposed. This decision support tool uses the probabilistic reliability cost/value analytics in which not only the financial benefits, but also the costs of reliability risks, are taken into account.

8468,,"Data injection attacks have emerged as a significant threat on the smart power grid. By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can manipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic benefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such works assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or defense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with multiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study the interactions between the defender and the attackers, two game models are considered. In the first, a Stackelberg game is proposed in which the defender acts as a leader that can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers, before deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties of the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the equilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited system information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In the second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot anticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, a hybrid satisfaction equilibrium-Nash equilibrium game is proposed. To find the equilibrium of this hybrid game, a search-based algorithm is introduced. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to illustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and defender. The results show that by defending a very small set of measurements, the grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks have no effect on the system. Moreover, the results also show how, at equilibrium, multiple attackers can play a destructive role toward each other by choosing to carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected.

Recognizing the practical limitations of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, which would be natural to apply in this context, we investigate two practical mechanisms that can be viewed as extensions of second price auction mechanisms and have limited message (bid) complexity. In the first mechanism, the elastic-supply multi-level second price, each PEV agent submits a number of price bids, one for each of a given set of energy levels (energy quantities). In the second mechanism, the elastic-supply progressive second price, the PEV agents submit a 2-D bid indicating the price as well as the desired energy quantity. Taking into account differences across PEV-owners in terms of their willingness-to-pay values and charging time constraints, we analyze the social optimality and incentive compatibility properties of the two auction mechanisms.

In this paper, a dynamic performance model is developed for motor stalling and over heat thermal tripping. Specifically, this dynamic model can be constructed with an energy-like Lyapunov function, and can be incorporated as part of power system dynamic cascading model.

The integration of Hi-RAM into investment formulation allows for certain What-If investment scenario analysis on the use of advanced technologies, new plug-ins, and consumer response to power price fluctuations, and more. To demonstrate the significance of coupling of DER investment decisions and DSM strategies, three scenarios are presented. The base scenario (Mode I) results can be reproduced using traditional forecast models and is included for baseline analysis and benchmarking.

The proposed approach addressed the synergy of energy markets by introducing dynamic game with complete information for GENCOs, microgrids, and LAs. The proposed hierarchical competition is composed of bi-level optimization problems in which the respective upper-level problems maximize the individual market participants' payoff, and the lower-level problems represent the market settlement accomplished by the DNO or the independent system operator.

Due to factors such as manufacturing difference and heterogeneous discharging conditions, cells in the battery pack may have different statuses, such as diverse voltage levels. This cell diversity is commonly known as the cell imbalance issue. For the charging of battery packs, the cell imbalance not only early on terminates the charging process before all cells are fully charged, but also leads to different desired charging currents among cells. In this paper, based on the advancement in reconfigurable battery systems, we demonstrate how to utilize system reconfigurability to mitigate the impact of cell imbalance on an efficient charging process. With the proposed reconfiguration-assisted charging (RAC), cells in the system are categorized according to their real-time voltages, and the charging process is performed in a category-by-category manner. To charge cells in a given category, a graph-based algorithm is presented to charge cells with their desired charging currents, respectively. We evaluate RAC through both experiments and simulations.

However, it introduces new privacy threats to customers. Prior works have proposed privacy-preserving methods in the AMI, such as temporal or spatial aggregation. A main assumption in these works is that fine-grained data do not need to be attributable to individuals. However, this assumption does not hold in incentive-based demand response (IDR) programs where fine-grained metering data are required to analyze individual demand curtailments, and hence, need to be attributable. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for IDR programs in the smart grid, which enables the DR provider to compute individual demand curtailments and DR rewards while preserving customer privacy. Moreover, a customer can reveal his/her identity and prove ownership of his/her power usage profile in certain situations, such as legal disputes.

Then, in order to deal with the complexity of the DP problem resulting from the uncountably infinite allowable price set, we characterize certain key properties of the DP dynamics, solve the DP problem for a discretized price policy to observe the structure of the optimal policy and re-capture the continuous price policy in an analytic approximate policy iteration (API) algorithm using the above properties and structure.

8497,,"Demand-side participation is now widely recognized as being extremely critical for satisfying the growing electricity demand in the U.S. The primary mechanism for demand management in the U.S. is demand response (DR) programs that attempt to reduce or shift demand by giving incentives to participating customers via price discounts or rebate payments. Utilities that offer DR programs rely on automated DR devices (ADRs) to automate the response to DR signals. The ADRs are faulty, but the working state of the ADR is not directly observable; one can, however, attempt to infer it from the power consumption during DR events. The utility loses revenue when a malfunctioning ADR does not respond to a DR signal; however, sending a maintenance crew to check and reset the ADR also incurs costs. In this paper, we show that the problem of maintaining a pool of ADRs using a limited number of maintenance crews can be formulated as a restless bandit problem, and that one can compute a near-optimal policy for this problem using Whittle indices. We show that the Whittle indices can be efficiently computed using a variational Bayes procedure even when the load-shed magnitude is noisy, and when there is a random mismatch between the clocks at the utility and at the meter. The results of our numerical experiments suggest that the Whittle-index-based approximate policy is within 4% of the optimal solution for all reasonably low values of the signal-to-noise ratio in the meter readings.",WOS:000374971000023,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Abad, C. and Iyengar, G.","Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",22,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2465834,May,1949-3053,3,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,automated demand response (adr),bayes procedures,dynamic programming,markov-processes,complexity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Dk5pb,,1411-1419,14218,Journal Article,,,A Near-Optimal Maintenance Policy for Automated DR Devices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,A Near-Optimal Maintenance Policy for Automated DR Devices,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000374971000023,7,,,2016,,Columbia Univ,USA

To address this issue, this paper focuses on how to determine the optimal partition for a given system and optimization problem, and quantify the improvement obtained with the optimal partition in terms of number of iterations and convergence time for solving the ac optimal power flow problem.

The main contribution of this paper is empirical evidence that a fitted fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (fARIMA) model taking into account self-similarity of the load time series can yield high-quality short-term forecasts when H is large enough. Namely, the fitted fARIMA model uniformly outperforms regular ARIMA algorithms in terms of root-mean-square error for predictions with time horizon up to 120 min for H >= 0.639.

A novel hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper that determines Pareto frontiers, as the candidate solutions, for multiobjective distribution network reconfiguration problem. The proposed hybrid optimization algorithm combines the concept of fuzzy Pareto dominance with shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) to recognize optimal nondominated solutions identified by SFLA. The local search step of SFLA is also customized for power systems application so that it automatically creates and analyzes only the feasible and radial configurations in its optimization procedure, which significantly increases the convergence speed of the algorithm.

But it may also reveal critical physical system information. Recovering the grid topology based solely on publicly available market data is explored here. Real-time energy prices are typically calculated as the Lagrange multipliers of network-constrained economic dispatch; that is, via a linear program (LP) typically solved every 5 min. Since the grid Laplacian matrix is a parameter of this LP, someone apart from the system operator could try inferring this topology-related matrix upon observing successive LP dual outcomes. It is first shown that the matrix of spatio-temporal prices can be factored as the product of the inverse Laplacian times a sparse matrix. Leveraging results from sparse matrix decompositions, topology recovery schemes with complementary strengths are subsequently formulated.

In order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumption, we formulate the problems as two-stage stochastic programs.

However, the benefits of such an approach are limited as human electricity usage can often be described as inelastic in nature, or not sensitive to pricing in economic theory. Water heating constitutes one of the largest components of such usage. This paper proposes technology to enable residential water heating to be converted from an inelastic to an elastic demand, which would respond to pricing incentives. This is accomplished by utilizing consumer hot water use patterns combined with thermal storage to calculate a user-specific temperature profile. Results demonstrated that such an approach could not only reduce electrical water heating costs significantly and allow for realization of large-scale grid benefits, but also improve customer experience as thermal storage capability would enable more hot water to be delivered at times of peak consumption.",WOS:000372014900005,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Shah, J.

8556,,"In this paper, stochastic optimization of economic dispatch (ED) and interruptible load management is investigated using short-term distributional forecast of wind farm generation. Specifically, using the statistical information of wind farm generation extracted from historical data, a Markov chainbased distributional forecast model for wind farm generation is developed in a rigorous optimization framework, in which the diurnal nonstationarity and the seasonality of wind generation are accounted for by constructing multiple finite-state Markov chains for each epoch of 3 h and for each individual month. Based on this distributional forecast model, the joint optimization of ED and interruptible load management is cast as a stochastic optimization problem. Additionally, a robust ED is formulated using an uncertainty set constructed based on the proposed distributional forecast, aiming to minimize the system cost for worst cases. The proposed stochastic ED is compared with four other ED schemes: 1) the robust ED; 2) deterministic ED using the persistence wind generation forecast model; 3) scenario-based stochastic ED; and 4) deterministic ED, in which perfect wind generation forecasts are used.

Storage, broadly speaking, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over time; network, on the other hand, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over geographical locations. The optimal control of storage networks in stochastic environments is an important open problem. The key challenge is that, even in small networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control problems on continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality and are intractable in general settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is known to give optimal or provably near-optimal performance for this problem. This paper provides an efficient algorithm to solve this problem with performance guarantees. We study the operation of storage networks, i.e., a storage system interconnected via a power network. An online algorithm, termed online modified greedy algorithm, is developed for the corresponding constrained stochastic control problem. A sub-optimality bound for the algorithm is derived and a semidefinite program is constructed to minimize the bound. In many cases, the bound approaches zero so that the algorithm is near-optimal. A task-based distributed implementation of the online algorithm relying only on local information and neighborhood communication is then developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers.

Within the context of pool-based electricity markets, this paper addresses the incorporation of price-responsive demand in multiperiod energy scheduling driven by consumer payment minimization. Although consumer payment minimization has drawn considerable attention mainly in an operational setting and also recently under a planning framework, available models and solution approaches typically neglect demand-side participation. The proposed scheduling model considers a marginal pricing scheme as well as the effects of both network constraints and intertemporal constraints associated with generation operation. Modeling demand-side participation leads to bilinear payment terms that significantly increase the mathematical complexity of the optimization process. The resulting problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel program for which no exact solution technique is currently available. This paper presents a novel methodology by which the original bilevel and bilinear problem is converted into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear program suitable for efficient off-the-shelf software.

In the proposed framework, hierarchical control is performed at three levels operating in different time frames. A model reference control-based scheme is implemented for primary level power sharing, through which the interface inverter of each microgrid is controlled to track a designed reference model. At the secondary level, an interactive droop management scheme is proposed to manage the reference model droop gains based on a distributed stability criterion. At the tertiary level, an ac power flow-based supervisory control strategy is utilized to dispatch the nominal setting to each microgrid central controller (MGCC) for the primary level reference tracking, and broadcast an interaction coefficient to each MGCC so that the droop gains can be managed to guarantee system-wide stability.

The indices are estimated using two new algorithms, namely, fast bidirectional sensitivities calculation and bidirectional linearization approximation, using local measurements. These local sensitivities from different substations are collected at the control center level, where wide-area voltage security assessment is carried out to estimate the system proximity to voltage collapse, as well as to identify voltage insecure subareas if any exist.

A reliability-differentiated pricing mechanism is developed to satisfy the different reliability requirements of the customers while encouraging the customers to consume electricity in such a way that the reliability of the overall distribution system can be enhanced. A dynamic spinning reserve pricing scheme is developed to stimulate PHEVs to participate in spinning reserve by providing economic benefits when the state of the distribution system becomes risky. Based on the formulated reliability-differentiated system, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to coordinate the charging process of PHEVs in a decentralized fashion. At the upper level of the hierarchical game, an evolutionary game is formulated to optimize the management of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity of each PHEV. Under the V2G strategies obtained from the evolutionary game, a noncooperative game is formulated at the lower level to coordinate the charging sequences of PHEVs.

This simultaneous approach may present challenges when the concerned network consists of different types of systems operated by different entities (independent system operator, transmission system operator, or utility). A leading example is provided by hybrid ac/high voltage dc (HVDC) grids. We propose a distributed solution method where the system network is decomposed into several subsystems on which SE problems are executed separately and are iteratively coordinated through updated boundary information. Hybrid ac/HVDC grids naturally decompose into ac and HVDC subsystems. The proposed method uses a Lagrangian relaxation-based approach and block-wise Gauss-Seidel solution technique to arrive at a solution. The paper describes the method in the context of HVDC grids based on voltage source converter (VSC) technology. It presents a unified modeling framework for monopole/bipole converter configurations, parallel converters, converter-less dc buses, and wind farm connections.

The microgrid coordinates the energy consumption or production of its components, and trades electricity in both day-ahead and real-time markets to minimize its operating cost as a single entity. The bidding problem is challenging due to a variety of uncertainties, including power output of intermittent DG, load variation, and day-ahead and real-time market prices. A hybrid stochastic/robust optimization model is proposed to minimize the expected net cost, i.e., expected total cost of operation minus total benefit of demand. This formulation can be solved by mixed-integer linear programming. The uncertain output of intermittent DG and day-ahead market price are modeled via scenarios based on forecast results, while a robust optimization is proposed to limit the unbalanced power in real-time market taking account of the uncertainty of real-time market price.

MGs can support and interchange electricity with each other in the proposed infrastructure.

In the normal operation mode, the objective is to schedule dispatchable distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems (ESs), and controllable loads to minimize the operation costs and maximize the supply adequacy of each MG. When a generation deficiency or fault happens in an MG, the model switches to the self-healing mode and the local generation capacities of other MGs can be used to support the on-emergency portion of the system. A consensus algorithm is used to distribute portions of the desired power support to each individual MG in a decentralized way.

As the PV penetration rate increases, the intermittency and uncertainty of PV systems will cause frequency regulation issues. When rapid fluctuations take place, the system requires fast responding regulation to recover the frequency within a short period of time. Traditional power plants with slow dynamics are less capable of tracking the fast-changing regulation signal. In this context, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered as an effective regulation source to respond immediately to frequency deviations.

8658,,"With the rapid development of various technologies and applications in smart grid implementation, demand response has attracted growing research interests because of its potentials in enhancing power grid reliability with reduced system operation costs. This paper presents a new demand response model with elastic economic dispatch in a locational marginal pricing market. It models system economic dispatch as a feedback control process, and introduces a flexible and adjustable load cost as a controlled signal to adjust demand response. Compared with the conventional ""one time use"" static load dispatch model, this dynamic feedback demand response model may adjust the load to a desired level in a finite number of time steps and a proof of convergence is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation and boundary calculation using interval mathematics are applied for describing uncertainty of end-user's response to an independent system operator's expected dispatch. A numerical analysis based on the modified Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland power pool five-bus system is introduced for simulation and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.

The unknown parameters in the system, namely the state vector, injected malicious data and the set of attacked meters pose a significant challenge for designing a robust, computationally efficient, and high-performance detector. We propose a sequential detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio to address this challenge. Specifically, the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a variety of attacking strategies, and load situations in the power system, and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection delay and robustness to various attacking strategies.

8670,,"High levels of penetration of distributed generation and aggressive reactive power compensation may result in the reversal of power flows in future distribution grids. The voltage stability of these operating conditions may be very different from the more traditional power consumption regime. This paper focuses on the demonstration of multistability phenomenon in radial distribution systems with reversed power flow where multiple stable equilibria coexist for the given set of parameters. The system may experience transitions between different equilibria after being subjected to disturbances such as short-term losses of distributed generation or transient faults. Convergence to an undesirable equilibrium places the system in an emergency or in extremis state. Traditional emergency control schemes are not capable of restoring the system if it gets entrapped in one of the low voltage equilibria. Moreover, undervoltage load shedding may have a reverse action on the system and can induce voltage collapse. We propose a novel pulse emergency control strategy that restores the system to the normal state without any interruption of power delivery. The results are validated with dynamic simulations of IEEE 13-bus feeder performed with SystemModeler software.

In doing so, we provide a way for DC operators to predict their operational costs for different DC placements and capacities, and thus make informed decisions about how to expand their DC network. Our distributed algorithm uses estimated job arrivals and day-ahead electricity prices to optimize over sliding time windows. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a Google DC trace and investigate the effects of different cost and performance criteria. The algorithm leverages heterogeneous job resource requirements and routing and scheduling flexibility: even deadline and indivisibility constraints yield little cost increase, though they significantly improve job completion times and localization at only one DC, respectively.

8679,,"In this paper, a converter-based dc microgrid is studied. By considering the impact of each component in dc microgrids on system stability, a multistage configuration is employed, which includes the source stage, interface converter stage between buses, and common load stage. In order to study the overall stability of the above dc microgrid with constant power loads (CPLs), a comprehensive small-signal model is derived by analyzing the interface converters in each stage. The instability issue induced by the CPLs is revealed by using the criteria of impedance matching. Meanwhile, virtual-impedance-based stabilizers are proposed in order to enhance the damping of dc microgrids with CPLs and guarantee the stable operation. Since droop control is commonly used to reach proper load power sharing in dc microgrids, its impact is taken into account when testing the proposed stabilizers. By using the proposed stabilizers, virtual impedances are employed in the output filters of the interface converters in the second stage of the multistage configuration. In particular, one of the virtual impedances is connected in series with the filter capacitor, and the other one is connected at the output path of the converter. It can be seen that by using the proposed stabilizers, the unstable poles induced by the CPLs are forced to move into the stable region.

The PV active power output can be controlled in the load-following mode when sufficient solar power is available to supply a local load, or the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode when a local load is large or injection to the system is allowed. Two selected control approaches, P-Q control in the load-following mode and P-V control in the MPPT mode, are investigated in this paper. The P-Q control is implemented with a relatively simple approach, while the P-V control demands an extra MPPT logic, which is solved based on a power balance between the dc and ac sides in a two-stage PV configuration. The control algorithms are tested with the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder with various system conditions like the presence of multiple PV generators, imbalance, harmonics, and faults.

This paper proposes a model of the electricity market that captures the uncertainties on both the operator and user sides. The system operator (SO) implements a temporal linear pricing strategy that depends on real-time demand and renewable generation in the considered period combining real-time pricing with time-of-use pricing. The announced pricing strategy sets up a noncooperative game of incomplete information among the users with heterogeneous, but correlated consumption preferences. An explicit characterization of the optimal user behavior using the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution concept is derived. This explicit characterization allows the SO to derive pricing policies that influence demand to serve practical objectives, such as minimizing peak-to-average ratio or attaining a desired rate of return.

In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naive forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM.

8693,,"Grid integration of wind generation is challenging in view of wind uncertainties and possible transmission congestions. Without considering transmission, a stochastic unit commitment problem was solved in our previous work by modeling aggregated wind as a Markov chain instead of scenarios for reduced complexity. With congestion, wind generation at different locations cannot be aggregated and is modeled as a Markov chain per wind node, and the resulting global states are a large number of combinations of nodal states. To avoid explicitly considering all such global states, interval optimization is synergistically integrated with the Markovian approach in this paper. The key is to divide the generation level of a conventional unit into a Markovian component that depends on the local state, and an interval component that manages extreme nonlocal states. With appropriate transformations, the problem is converted to a linear form and is solved by using branch-and-cut. Numerical results demonstrate that the over conservativeness of pure interval optimization is much alleviated, and the new approach is effective in terms of computational efficiency, simulation cost, and solution feasibility.

The proposed control scheme, system wide adaptive predictive supervisory control (SWAPSC) smooths the output of PV and wind generators under intermittencies, maintains bus voltage by providing dynamic reactive power support to the grid, and reduces the total system losses while minimizing degradation of battery life span. Performance comparisons are made with and without SWAPSC for an IEEE 13 node test system with a PV farm, a wind farm, and two battery-based energy storage systems.",WOS:000364040300012,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Han, J.

Unfortunately, smart meters indirectly leak sensitive information about a home's occupancy, which is easy to detect because it highly correlates with simple statistical metrics, such as power's mean, variance, and range. To prevent occupancy detection, we propose using the thermal energy storage of electric water heaters already present in many homes. In essence, our approach, which we call combined heat and privacy (CHPr), modulates a water heater's power usage to make it look like someone is always home. We design a CHPr-enabled water heater that regulates its energy usage to thwart a variety of occupancy detection attacks without violating its objective-to provide hot water on demand-and evaluate it in simulation using real data. Our results show that a standard 50-gal CHPr-enabled water heater prevents a wide range of state-of-the-art occupancy detection attacks.",WOS:000360435900026,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Chen, D., Kalra, S., Irwin, D., Shenoy, P. and Albrecht, J.","Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",27,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2402224,Sep,1949-3053,5,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,data privacy,internet of things,smart grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Cq2mw,,2426-2434,14425,Journal Article,,,Preventing Occupancy Detection From Smart Meters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Preventing Occupancy Detection From Smart Meters,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000360435900026,6,,,2015,,Univ Massachusetts,USA

However, the evaluation of these promises has relied on simulations of individual TCLs that make important assumptions about the thermal dynamics and properties of the loads, the end-user's interactions with individual TCLs and the disturbances to their operation. In this paper, we first propose a data-driven modeling strategy to simulate individual TCLs-specifically, household refrigeration units (HRUs)-that allows us to relax some of these assumptions and evaluate the validity of the approaches proposed to date. Specifically, we fit probability distributions to a year-long dataset of power measurements for HRUs and use these models to create more realistic simulations. We then derive the aggregate system equations using a bottomup approach that results in a more flexible [linear time invariant (LTI)] system. Finally, we quantify the plant-model mismatch and evaluate the proposed strategy with the more realistic simulation. Our results show that the effects of invalid assumptions about the disturbances and time-invariant properties of individual HRUs may be mitigated by a faster sampling of the state variables and that, when this is not possible, the proposed LTI system reduces the plant-model mismatch.",WOS:000360435900040,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Kara, E.

Nowadays, data encryption occurs at phasor measurement units (PMUs) after the measurements are sampled and digitalized at the analog-to-digital devices.

Hence, communications cost and reliability are some of the key factors that need to be considered before deploying a microgrid protection scheme. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a hybrid microgrid protection system, which implements traditional differential protection scheme along with an adaptive microgrid protection scheme. While the differential scheme is more sensitive, yet relies on extensive communications, the adaptive scheme is less sensitive but has low communications load. The joint deployment of these two schemes has the potential to increase the accuracy and precision of the whole protection scheme, while reducing the overall communications cost. Moreover, we propose a preemptive switching algorithm for the microgrid relays, which ensures a seamless transition from differential protection to adaptive protection based on the bit error rate of the communications links.

8739,,"Public-key cryptography (PKC) is widely used in smart grid (SG) communications to reduce the overhead of key management. However, PKC comes with its own problems in terms of certificate management. Specifically, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) need to be maintained and distributed to the smart meters (SMs) in order to ensure security of the communications. The size of CRLs may grow over time and eventually may introduce additional delay, bandwidth, and storage overhead when various applications are run on SG. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for creating customized CRLs with reduced size for IEEE 802.11s-based advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Rather than maintaining a huge-size single CRL that introduces unnecessary search time and storage, the idea is to cluster/group SMs within the AMI network and create CRLs based on these groups. The grouping is mainly done in such a way that they bring together the SMs that will be very likely to communicate so that the CRLs will be kept local to that group. To this end, we propose two novel grouping algorithms. The first algorithm is a bottom-up approach, which is based on the existing routes from the SMs to the gateway. Since the SMs will be sending their data to the gateway through the nodes on the route, this forms a natural grouping. The second approach is a top-down recursive approach, which considers the minimum spanning tree of the network and then divides it into smaller subtrees. Via grouping, the length of the CRL for each SM and the corresponding distribution overhead can be reduced significantly. Simulation results have shown that our approach can maintain a balance between the size of the CRL and the number of signatures generated by CAs while guaranteeing security of the communications.",WOS:000360435900019,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Akkaya, K., Rabieh, K., Mahmoud, M. and Tonyali, S.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA",20,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2390131,Sep,1949-3053,5,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,certificate revocations,grouping schemes,public key cryptography,security,smart grid,ad hoc networks,infrastructure,protocol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Cq2mw,,2366-2374,14460,Journal Article,,,Customized Certificate Revocation Lists for IEEE 802.11s-Based Smart Grid AMI Networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Customized Certificate Revocation Lists for IEEE 802.11s-Based Smart Grid AMI Networks,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000360435900019,6,,,2015,,Florida Int Univ,USA
8741,,"Demand response systems in the electricity grid, which rely on two way communication between the consumers and utility, require the transmission of instantaneous energy consumption to utilities. Perfect knowledge of a user's power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. It has been shown that an in-home energy storage system (such as a battery/inverter) that provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without inconvenience can also be used to hide a user's power usage pattern. A fundamental tradeoff exists between the costs saved and the degree of privacy achievable, and in this paper, the tradeoff achievable by a finite capacity battery assuming a zero tolerance for activity delay is studied using a Markov process model for user's demands and instantaneous electricity prices. Due to high computational complexity (continuous state-action space) of the stochastic control model, inner and upper bounds are presented on the optimal tradeoff. In particular, a class of battery charging policies based on minimizing revealing states is proposed to derive achievable privacy-cost savings tradeoff. The performance of this algorithm is compared with lower bounds derived using a greedy heuristic and upper bounds derived using an information theoretic rate distortion approach. The framework proposed is shown to be applicable even when users only desire partial information protection, such as presence/absence of activity or specific appliances they wish to hide.

The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through extensive simulations.

The aggregator entity, using a given set of schedulable residential customer assets (e.g., smart appliances), must set a schedule to optimize for a given objective. Here, we consider optimizing for the profit of the aggregator. To encourage customer participation in the residential DR program, a new pricing structure named customer incentive pricing (CIP) is proposed. The aggregator profit is optimized using a proposed heuristic framework, implemented in the form of a genetic algorithm, that must determine a schedule of customer assets and the CIP. To validate our heuristic framework, we simulate the optimization of a large-scale system consisting of 5555 residential customer households and 56 642 schedulable assets using real-pricing data over a period of 24-h.

8758,,"Robust control and management of the grid relies on accurate data. Both phasor measurement units and remote terminal units are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is crucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of tampered data-both for preventing attacks that may lead to blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control of current and future grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme based on the Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the conditional covariance test CMIT to learn the structure of the grid. Using the dc power flow model, we show that, under normal circumstances, the Markov graph of the voltage angles is consistent with the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between the calculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Our method can detect the most recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge of the bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state estimator; hence damaging power network control, monitoring, demand response, and pricing scheme. Specifically, under the stealthy deception attack, the Markov graph of phase angles changes. In addition to detecting a state of attack, our method can detect the set of attacked nodes. To the best of our knowledge, our remedy is the first to comprehensively detect this sophisticated attack and it does not need additional hardware.

Coordinating the increased number of grid participants in an efficient and reliable way is going to be a major challenge. A potential solution is the employment of a distributed energy management approach, which uses intelligence distributed over the grid to balance supply and demand. In this paper, we specifically consider the situation in which distributed resources and loads form microgrids within the bulk power system in which the load is supplied by local generation. A distributed energy management approach based on the consensus + innovations method is presented and used to coordinate local generation, flexible load, and storage devices within the microgrid.

Instead, wavelet transform (WT) provides a time and frequency approach to analyze target signals with multiple resolutions.

By connecting megawatt-scale wind turbines to the distribution system, the cost of building transmission facilities can be avoided and wind power supplied to consumers can be greatly increased; however, integrating megawatt-scale wind turbines on distribution feeders will impact the distribution feeder stability, especially voltage stability. Distributed wind turbine generators (WTGs) have the capability to aid in grid stability if equipped with appropriate controllers, but few investigations are focusing on this. This paper investigates the potential of using real-time measurements from distribution phasor measurement units for a new WTG control algorithm to stabilize the voltage deviation of a distribution feeder. This paper proposes a novel auxiliary coordinated-control approach based on a support vector machine (SVM) predictor and a multiple-input and multiple-output model predictive control on linear time-invariant and linear time-variant systems. The voltage condition of the distribution system is predicted by the SVM classifier using synchrophasor measurement data. The controllers equipped on WTGs are triggered by the prediction results.

The discrete Fourier transform-based method is widely used for phasor and frequency estimation, thanks to its low computational burden. However, errors arise when the power system is operating at off-nominal frequency, especially under dynamic conditions such as phase modulation. Additionally, the power grid signal at the distribution level contains more noise and harmonics, which cause phase and frequency estimation errors. In this paper, a synchronized phase and frequency estimation algorithm suitable for measurement at the distribution level is proposed and tested under noise and harmonic conditions, as well as various conditions in the phasor measurement unit Standard (C37.118.1-2011 and C37.118.1a-2014), to verify its measurement accuracy at the distribution level.",WOS:000356810900045,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Zhan, L.

8804,,"As information and communication networks are highly interconnected with the power grid, cyber security of the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has become a critical issue in the electric power sector. By exploiting the vulnerabilities in cyber components and intruding into the local area networks of the control center, corporation, substations, or by injecting false information into communication links, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data, reconfigure devices, and send trip commands to the intelligent electronic devices that control the system breakers. Reliability of the power system can thus be impacted by various cyber attacks. In this paper, four attack scenarios for cyber components in networks of the SCADA system are considered, which may trip breakers of physical components. Two Bayesian attack graph models are built to illustrate the attack procedures and to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks. A mean time-to-compromise model is modified and adopted considering the known and zero-day vulnerabilities on the cyber components, and the frequencies of intrusions through various paths are estimated. With increased breaker trips resulting from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities in the IEEE reliability test system 79 are estimated. The simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks on the cyber components increases and the skill levels of attackers increase.",WOS:000356810900014,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Zhang, Y.

Building occupant energy-use data is segmented to facilitate the construction of independent energy-use profiles for workdays, nonworkdays, work hours, and nonwork hours, which in turn enable further classification of building occupants according to their energy-use patterns. The three new metrics, building occupant energy-use efficiency, entropy, and intensity enable the design of more targeted energy conservation campaigns. Building occupants with relatively low energy-use efficiency scores can be individually targeted for behavioral interventions aimed at increasing the efficiency of their energy-use. Furthermore, building occupants with relatively low energy-use entropy scores can be sent timely behavior intervention notifications based on predictions of their future energy-use. Finally, building occupants with relatively high energy-use intensity scores can be targeted for equipment upgrades in order to reduce their overall energy consumption.

8810,,"Energy management in microgrids is typically formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Solving it in a centralized manner does not only require high computational capabilities at the microgrid central controller (MGCC), but may also infringe customer privacy. Existing distributed approaches, on the other hand, assume that all generations and loads are connected to one bus, and ignore the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flow and system operational constraints. Consequently, the schedules produced by those algorithms may violate those constraints and thus are not feasible in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the design of a distributed energy management strategy (EMS) for the optimal operation of microgrids with consideration of the distribution network and the associated constraints. Specifically, we formulate microgrid energy management as an optimal power flow problem, and propose a distributed EMS where the MGCC and the local controllers jointly compute an optimal schedule. We also provide an implementation of the proposed distributed EMS based on IEC 61850. As one demonstration, we apply the proposed distributed EMS to a real microgrid in Guangdong Province, China, consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, and a battery energy storage system.

In this paper, we extend our prior work to develop a more robust framework for exploring the diffusion of basic smart grid technologies using a social-network-based model to study demand response adoption. This network is based around considering an end-user as a node, and any relationship where mutual trust and communication exists as an edge. In addition, we have incorporated mathematical representations of user personality traits in the decision-making progress to better simulate real-world actions. We observe greater usage of demand response when conventional electricity is high, when conscientiousness is high, and when the network is densely connected; all of these are reasonable results given logical behavior of the individual agents.

The dependencies on price responsiveness among consumers are captured by a conditional random field (CRF) model. To account for temporal dynamics potentially in a strategic setting, the framework of online convex optimization is adopted to develop an efficient online algorithm for tracking the CRF parameters.

Moreover, a set of rules are defined to make the stakeholders in the microgrid profitable. Also, by analyzing the number of houses in the microgrid, we observe that the number of years it takes to return the capital costs invested in the microgrid may become adequately short for a certain range of the number of houses. For instance, if the aggregator owns the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, it may profit in less than five years when 500 houses participate in the microgrid where each house owns 500 sf solar panels. On the other hand, if the prosumers own the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, the aggregator may profit in about a year. Typically, for an apartment-block type housing area in U.

8866,,"Sales of privately-owned plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are projected to increase dramatically in coming years and their charging will impact residential service transformer loads. Transformer life expectancy is strongly related to the cumulative effects of internal winding temperatures, which are a function of loading. Thermal models exist (e.g., IEEE Standard C57.91) for predicting these internal temperatures, the most sophisticated being the Annex G model. While this model has been validated with measurements from large power transformers, small residential service transformers have been given less attention. Given increasing PEV loads, a better understanding of service transformer aging could be useful in replacement planning processes. Empirical data from this paper indicate that the Annex G model over-estimates internal temperatures in small 25 kVA 65 degrees C rise mineral-oil-immersed transformers. This paper presents an alternative model to Annex G by using a genetic program. Empirical results using a thermally-instrumented transformer suggest that this model is both simpler and more accurate at tracking empirical transformer data.

In this paper, we present CPINDEX, a security-oriented stochastic risk management technique that calculates cyber-physical security indices to measure the security level of the underlying cyber-physical setting. CPINDEX installs appropriate cyber-side instrumentation probes on individual host systems to dynamically capture and profile low-level system activities such as interprocess communications among operating system assets. CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state. The results of our experiments with actual attacks against a real-world power control network shows that CPINDEX, within few seconds, can efficiently compute the numerical indices during the attack that indicate the progressing malicious attack correctly.",WOS:000350338100008,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Vellaithurai, C., Srivastava, A., Zonouz, S. and Berthier, R.","Washington State Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Pullman, WA 99163 USA",19,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2372315,Mar,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,cyber-physical security metrics,cyber-physical systems,intrusion detection systems,situational awareness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Cc4qn,,566-575,14597,Journal Article,,,CPINDEX: Cyber-Physical Vulnerability Assessment for Power-Grid Infrastructures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,CPINDEX: Cyber-Physical Vulnerability Assessment for Power-Grid Infrastructures,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000350338100008,6,,,2015,,Washington State Univ,USA

It is assumed that both the dispatchable and nondispatchable distributed generators (DGs) exist in the networked MGs. In order to achieve the equilibrium among all entities and take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs, we formulate the problem as a stochastic bi-level problem with the DNO in the upper level and MGs in the lower level. Each level consists of two stages. The first stage is to determine base generation setpoints based on the load and nondispatchable DG output forecasts and the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based on the realized scenarios. A scenario reduction method is applied to enhance a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden.

8927,,"In this paper, a double-quadrant state-of-charge (SoC)-based droop control method for distributed energy storage system is proposed to reach the proper power distribution in autonomous dc microgrids. In order to prolong the lifetime of the energy storage units (ESUs) and avoid the overuse of a certain unit, the SoC of each unit should be balanced and the injected/output power should be gradually equalized. Droop control as a decentralized approach is used as the basis of the power sharing method for distributed energy storage units. In the charging process, the droop coefficient is set to be proportional to the nth order of SoC, while in the discharging process, the droop coefficient is set to be inversely proportional to the nth order of SoC. Since the injected/output power is inversely proportional to the droop coefficient, it is obtained that in the charging process the ESU with higher SoC absorbs less power, while the one with lower SoC absorbs more power. Meanwhile, in the discharging process, the ESU with higher SoC delivers more power and the one with lower SoC delivers less power. Hence, SoC balancing and injected/output power equalization can be gradually realized. The exponent n of SoC is employed in the control diagram to regulate the speed of SoC balancing. It is found that with larger exponent n, the balancing speed is higher.

The DER management coordinates operations of micro combined heat and power systems (mu CHPs), and vanadium redox battery (VRB) according to DR decisions. A two-level shared cost-led mu CHPs management strategy is proposed to reduce energy consumption cost further. VRB discharging is managed to be environment-adaptive. Simulations and numerical results show the proposed system is very effective in reducing the energy consumption cost while satisfying user's preference.",WOS:000346731400001,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Jiang, B.

8933,,"Demand response (DR) programs are implemented to encourage consumers to reduce their electricity demand when needed, e.g., at peak-load hours, by adjusting their controllable load. In this paper, our focus is on controllable load types that are associated with dynamic systems and can be modeled using differential equations. Examples of such load types include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; water heating; and refrigeration. In this regard, we propose a new DR model based on a two-level differential game framework. At the beginning of each DR interval, the price is decided by the upper level (aggregator, utility, or market) given the total demand of users in the lower level. At the lower level, for each player (residential or commercial buildings that are equipped with automated load control systems and local renewable generators), given the price from the upper level, the electricity usage of air conditioning unit, and the battery storage charging/discharging schedules, are controlled in order to minimize the user's total electricity cost. The optimal user strategies are derived using the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also show that the proposed game can converge to a feedback Nash equilibrium. Based on the effect of real-time pricing on users' daily demand profile, the simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed game and show how we can optimize consumers' electricity cost in the presence of time-varying prices.",WOS:000346731400029,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Forouzandehmehr, N., Esmalifalak, M., Mohsenian-Rad, H. and Han, Z.","Univ Houston, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA",25,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2357346,Jan,1949-3053,1,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,autonomous demand response,real-time pricing,smart building,stochastic differential game,direct load control,management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Ax1um,,291-300,14654,Journal Article,,,Autonomous Demand Response Using Stochastic Differential Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Autonomous Demand Response Using Stochastic Differential Games,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000346731400029,6,,,2015,,Univ Houston,USA

8951,,"Smart meters, designed for information collection and system monitoring in smart grid, report fine-grained power consumption to utility providers. With these highly accurate profiles of energy usage, however, it is possible to identify consumers' specific activities or behavior patterns, thereby giving rise to serious privacy concerns. This paper addresses these concerns by designing a cost-effective and privacy-preserving energy management technique that uses a rechargeable battery. From a holistic perspective, a dynamic programming framework is designed for consumers to strike a tradeoff between smart meter data privacy and the cost of electricity. In general, a major challenge in solving dynamic programming problems lies in the need for the knowledge of future electricity consumption events. By exploring the underlying structure of the original problem, an equivalent problem is derived, which can be solved by using only the current observations. An online control algorithm is then developed to solve the equivalent problem based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. It is shown that without the knowledge of the statistics of the time-varying load requirements and the electricity price processes, the proposed online control algorithm, parametrized by a positive value V, is within O(1/V) of the optimal solution to the original problem, where the maximum value of V is limited by the battery capacity.

8953,,"In order to study the impact of dynamic demand response in the future smart grid, we examine in an abstract framework how a tradeoff between efficiency and risk arises under different market architectures. We first examine the system performance under noncooperative and cooperative market architectures. The statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes show that, although the noncooperative load scheduling scheme leads to an efficiency loss, the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail, resulting in less frequent aggregate demand spikes. Cooperative dynamic demand response, on the other hand, makes the market place more efficient at the cost of increased risk of aggregate demand spikes. The market architecture determines the locus of the system performance with respect to the tradeoff curve. We also investigate how a properly designed real-time electricity pricing mechanism can help the system operator achieve a target tradeoff between efficiency and risk in a noncooperative market. We further provide a convex characterization of the Pareto front of system performance measures, which serves as a benchmark of the tradeoffs for the system operator to evaluate the pricing rules.",WOS:000346731400028,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Huang, Q.

Moreover, the supercapacitor bank not only supplies the pulse load, but also supports the grid during transient periods when it is highly loaded. However, the energy management and control of such a system is more complex, since the heavy pulse load can cause high power pulsation and voltage drop. To reduce the adverse effects of the pulse load, a new real-time energy management system (EMS) with an adaptive energy calculator (AEC) based on the moving average measurement technique is developed. The proposed microgrid was implemented in hardware and experimentally tested. The results were compared with other methods, such as direct voltage control and continuous current averaging approaches.

The second loop is triggered when large variations of PV power output caused by rapid cloud movement happen. All SVCs and CBs become self-controlled based on local voltage measurements with the single control objective to minimize voltage deviations. SVCs will operate firstly to flatten the voltage profile.

Therefore, questions naturally arise as to when the increased data-dependence may be considered excessive. Two practical considerations emerge: 1) communications and computational overhead, in which redundant and irrelevant information acquisition and use results in heavy computational burden with limited performance return; and 2) increasing risks of power system disruption due to information delay from communication congestion or cyber attack. One strategy to improve smart grid resilience is to determine the appropriate degree of dependence on cyber information to balance performance with overhead and risk.

8982,,"Smart grid technology has enhanced the ability to monitor numerous aspects of the distribution system for improving system performance and reducing system losses. One benefit is the continuous assessment of insulation degradation within distribution transformers, which is commonly referred to as a loss of life assessment. Calculating the expended life of a transformer consists of determining its winding hotspot temperature, which fluctuates with customer demand, ambient temperature, and cooling characteristics. Most residential transformers in service today do not possess the ability to connect to a smart grid communication system for continuous monitoring; therefore, they rely upon fusing for protection against extreme loading conditions. Smart meters can provide utility companies with the information required to identify distribution transformers that are experiencing higher than rated losses that can ultimately reduce their expected life.

8987,,"Real-time availability of electricity prices via a smart power grid has a potential bilateral benefit to electricity users and suppliers. The users can reduce their costs by consuming energy during low-price hours and balancing their energy usage during other hours. This in turn benefits energy utility companies by reducing their peak power demand. This article describes an optimal shrinking horizon model for electricity-consuming units based on user preferences. The proposed model optimizes the end user's electricity cost while meeting preferred comfort levels. The user can set preferences in the model using a tristate flexibility parameter for each electric-power-consuming unit. The electricity price model used in the optimization model is general and covers all pricing schemes in the electricity market today. The model derived can be described by a simple mixed integer linear program and solved by most optimization software in a short time.

8988,,"In this paper, we introduce the incremental welfare consensus algorithm for solving the energy management problem in a smart grid environment populated with distributed generators and responsive demands. The proposed algorithm is distributed and cooperative such that it eliminates the need for a central energy-management unit, central price coordinator, or leader. The optimum energy solution is found through local peerto-peer communications among smart devices. Each distributed generation unit is connected to a local price regulator, as is each consumer unit. In response to the price of energy proposed by the local price regulators, the power regulator on each generation/consumer unit determines the level of generation/consumption power needed to optimize the benefit of the device. The consensus-based coordination among price regulators drives the behavior of the overall system toward the global optimum, despite the greedy behavior of each unit. The primary advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) convergence to the global optimum without requiring a central controller/coordinator or leader, despite the greedy behavior at the individual level and limited communications; and 2) scalability in terms of per-node computation and communications burden.",WOS:000344542000018,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Rahbari-Asr, N., Ojha, U., Zhang, Z. and Chow, M.

This approach is based on matching pursuit decomposition (MPD) using Gaussian atom dictionary, hidden Markov model (HMM) of real-time frequency and voltage variation features, and fault contour maps generated by machine learning algorithms in smart grid (SG) systems. Specifically, the time-frequency features are extracted by MPD from the frequency and voltage signals, which are sampled by the frequency disturbance recorders in SG. A hybrid clustering algorithm is then developed and used to cluster the frequency and voltage signal features into various symbols. Using the symbols, two detection HMMs are trained for fault detection to distinguish between normal and abnormal SG operation conditions. Also, several identification HMMs are trained under different system fault scenarios, and if a fault occurs, the trained identification HMMs are used to identify different fault types. In the meantime, if the fault is detected by the detection HMMs, a fault contour map will be generated using the feature extracted by the MPD from the voltage signals and topology information of SG.

9044,,"Renewable energy sources continues to gain popularity. However, two major limitations exist that prevent widespread adoption: availability of the electricity generated and the cost of the equipment. Distributed generation, (DG) grid-tied photovoltaic-wind hybrid systems with centralized battery back-up, can help mitigate the variability of the renewable energy resource. The downside, however, is the cost of the equipment needed to create such a system. Thus, optimization of generation and storage in light of capital cost and variability mitigation is imperative to the financial feasibility of DC microgrid systems. PV and wind generation are both time dependent and variable but are highly correlated, which make them ideal for a dual-sourced hybrid system. This paper presents an optimization technique base on a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) which uses high temporal resolution insolation data taken at 10 seconds data rate instead of more commonly used hourly data rate. The proposed methodology employs a techno-economic approach to determine the system design optimized by considering multiple criteria including size, cost, and availability. The result is the baseline system cost necessary to meet the load requirements and which can also be used to monetize ancillary services that the smart DC microgrid can provide to the utility at the point of common coupling (PCC) such as voltage regulation.

9050,,"Power grid is one of the most critical infrastructures in a nation and could suffer a variety of cyber attacks. Recent studies have shown that an attacker can inject pre-determined false data into smart meters such that it can pass the residue test of conventional state estimator. However, the calculation of the false data vector relies on the network (topology and parameter) information of the entire grid. In practice, it is impossible for an attacker to obtain all network information of a power grid. Unfortunately, this does not make power systems immune to false data injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a local load redistribution attacking model based on incomplete network information and show that an attacker only needs to obtain the network information of the local attacking region to inject false data into smart meters in the local region without being detected by the state estimator. Simulations on the modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of this paper reveal the mechanism of local false data injection attacks and highlight the importance and complexity of defending power systems against false data injection attacks.",WOS:000338191200013,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Liu, X. and Li, Z.

9051,,"This paper presents a methodology for modeling the load demand of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Due to the stochastic nature of vehicle arrival time, departure time and daily mileage, probabilistic methods are chosen to model the driving pattern. However, these three elements of driving pattern are correlated with each other, which makes the probability density functions (pdfs)-based probabilistic methods inaccurate. Here a fuzzy logic based stochastic model is built to study the relationship between the three elements of driving pattern. Moreover, a load profile modeling framework (LPMF) for PHEVs is proposed to synthesize both the characteristics of driving pattern and vehicle parameters into a load profile prediction system. Based on this stochastic model of PHEV, a two-layer evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is proposed to integrate PHEVs into a residential distribution grid. A novel business model is developed for PHEVs to provide ancillary service and participate in peak load shaving. A virtual time-of-use rate is used to reflect the load deviation of the system. Then, an objective function is developed to aggregate the peak load shaving, power quality improvement, charging cost, battery degradation cost and frequency regulation earnings into one cost function. The ESPSO approach can benefit the system in four major aspects by: 1) improving the power quality; 2) reducing the peak load; 3) providing frequency regulation service; and 4) minimizing the total virtual cost. Finally, simulations are carried out based on different control strategies and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",WOS:000338191200024,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Tan, J. and Wang, L.

9057,,"A situational awareness system is essential to provide accurate understanding of power system dynamics, such that proper actions can be taken in real time in response to system disturbances and to avoid cascading blackouts. Event analysis has been an important component in any situational awareness system. However, most state-of-the-art techniques can only handle single event analysis. This paper tackles the challenging problem of multiple event detection and recognition. We propose a new conceptual framework, referred to as event unmixing, where we consider real-world events mixtures of more than one constituent root event. This concept is a key enabler for analysis of events to go beyond what are immediately detectable in a system, providing high-resolution data understanding at a finer scale. We interpret the event formation process from a linear mixing perspective and propose an innovative nonnegative sparse event unmixing (NSEU) algorithm for multiple event separation and temporal localization. The proposed framework has been evaluated using both PSS/E simulated cases and real event cases collected from the frequency disturbance recorders (FDRs) of the Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET). The experimental results demonstrate that the framework is reliable to detect and recognize multiple cascading events as well as their time of occurrence with high accuracy.",WOS:000338191200012,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Wang, W., He, L., Markham, P., Qi, H.

In the proposed method, every DG performs optimization with respect to its own objective function while considering the information received locally from the neighboring nodes in the microgrid, and the critical nodes without DG also contribute to optimization. The proposed distributed optimization and control scheme enables the microgrid to have a unified voltage profile, and incorporating the subgradient method facilitates its application even when the microgrid information is unknown.

By leveraging the communications in the building automation system (BAS) already present in most buildings, large commercial HVAC systems provide easier access to a large controllable resource than aggregating a large number of small residential loads. However, large commercial HVAC systems are complex with many variables, many end point controllers, and several internal control loops that interact with each other. In addition, the existing fleet of large commercial buildings is diverse with many different HVAC configurations and BAS architectures. Capturing these buildings as DR resources requires a method to greatly reduce the complexity of the HVAC DR control and is general and flexible enough that it can be easily deployed across the diverse fleet of existing buildings. We create such a DR control by developing a system model that uses a single state variable instead of the several hundred variables in a commercial HVAC system.

Further, using a set of valid assumptions, a new moving average voltage sensing (MAVS) algorithm is proposed, tested using simulations and validated using a high-voltage prototype. The wireless voltage sensor prototype is tested at up to 35 kV and is built to accommodate electric field energy harvesting in addition to voltage sensing.

9077,,"The thermal storage potential in commercial buildings is an enormous resource for providing various ancillary services to the grid. In this paper, we show how fans in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings alone can provide substantial frequency regulation service, with little change in their indoor environments. A feedforward architecture is proposed to control the fan power consumption to track a regulation signal. The proposed control scheme is then tested through simulations based on a calibrated high fidelity non-linear model of a building. Model parameters are identified from data collected in Pugh Hall, a commercial building located on the University of Florida campus. For the HVAC system under consideration, numerical experiments demonstrate how up to 15% of the rated fan power can be deployed for regulation purpose while having little effect on the building indoor temperature. The regulation signal that can be successfully tracked is constrained in the frequency band [1/tau(0,) 1/tau(1) where tau(0) approximate to 3 minutes and tau(1) approximate to 8 seconds. Our results indicate that fans in existing commercial buildings in the U.S. can provide about 70% of the current national regulation reserve requirements in the aforementioned frequency band.

9080,,"For the efficient operation of the smart grid, it is important that there is an instant by instant matching between the electricity supply and the power consumption. Electrical power storage provides a viable solution to managing power supply and electrical loads as well as unexpected imbalances. Electricity suppliers could deploy electricity storage facilities at various levels of the smart grid system: generation, transmission, substations and residential level. Storage would significantly address the power quality and reliability problems through peak shaving and frequency control. It also reduces the need for huge infrastructural expenditures by making them more efficient. At the residential level, smart storage together with dynamic pricing in the deregulated electricity markets presents the electricity suppliers with a strategy to achieve grid stability. In this paper, we consider a smart grid environment with a high penetration of households' storage batteries. By using an appropriate electricity price structure, the electricity supplier influences households' electricity consumption. On the other hand, the households aim to minimize their electricity bills by capitalizing on price fluctuation to schedule their electrical appliances and coordinate the charging and discharging of their batteries. The electricity supplier has a dynamic power limit for each hour that must not be exceeded by the hourly aggregate load of the households. Further, we assume that in supplying electrical power, the households' electrical devices are given priority over their storage devices. The policy is such that batteries will be charged by the residual power after the appliances loads have been satisfied. The households have to compete for the residual electricity so as to maximize the state of charge of their batteries. We have therefore modeled this system as a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium game where the households are considered as selfish but rational players whose objectives are to optimize their individual utilities.",WOS:000338191200032,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Adika, C.

It is assumed that a smart load can delay a time-flexible energy demand up to a fixed deadline. Under mild assumptions on the regularity of the stochastic price process, it is shown that the optimal strategy is to consume only when the price is less than or equal to a certain threshold that depends only on the time left to the deadline and the price statistics. This analysis is performed under both perfect and partial information about the statistics of the price process. Robust policies with performance guarantees are derived for the partial information case. Such performance bounds are also used for deriving upper and lower bounds on the economic value of load-shifting.

However, the amount of data/measurements increases with the scale of the physical grid, posing a significant stress on both the communication infrastructure as well as data processing control centers. This paper first investigates the effect of geographical footprint of distributed generation (DG) on the voltage states of a smart distribution system. We demonstrate that the strong coupling in the physical power system results in estimated voltage phasors exhibiting a correlation structure that allows for compression of measurements. Specifically, by exploiting principles of 1D and 2D compressed sensing, we develop two approaches, an indirect and direct method for state estimation starting from compressed power measurements. We illustrate the effectiveness of voltage estimation with significantly low number of random spatial, temporal as well as spatio-temporal power measurements using the IEEE 34 node distribution test feeder and a larger 100 node radial distribution system.

In this paper we have proposed a day-ahead demand-side bidding approach to realize the desired demand response. In our mechanism, customers submit their day-ahead electricity demands to the utility company through a secure communication infrastructure. The electricity supplier then generates the customers' hourly demand profile by aggregation of the individual requests. This information then forms the basis of procuring power in the wholesale market as well as developing a dynamic electricity pricing scheme. However, as expected, the actual electricity supply and the actual electricity consumption may not match. This could be due to the inability of the utility company to secure enough power at the wholesale market or due to changes in consumer power requirements. In the event the demand outstrips the supply, the customers willingly offer to shed some of their flexible appliances' loads but bid for prices at which they would like to pay for the curtailed load.

These applications are categorized as having either direct or indirect interactions between cyber and power networks. We previously studied direct interdependencies inside cyber-power networks and proposed the state mapping based model to evaluate its impact on the power system reliability. This paper focuses on indirect interdependencies between cyber and power networks.

9095,,"The weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is commonly employed to solve the state estimation problem in today's power systems, which are primarily measured by SCADA measurements, including bus power injection, branch power flow and bus voltage magnitude measurements. Despite being widely used, WLS estimator remains to be non-robust, i.e., it fails in the presence of bad measurements. The so called least absolute value (LAV) estimator is more robust, but is not widely used due to its higher computational cost. LAV estimator has the desirable property of automatic bad-data rejection provided that the measurement set does not include any ""leverage measurements.""There will be two important advantages to using LAV estimator when systems are observed by phasor measurements: 1) if the measurement set consists of only phasors, the leveraging effect of measurements can be easily eliminated by strategic scaling; 2) computational performance of LAV estimator will become competitive with that of WLS due to the linearity of the estimation problem for phasor measurements.

9096,,"In an isolated power grid or a micro-grid with a small carbon footprint, the penetration of renewable energy is usually high. In such power grids, energy storage is important to guarantee an uninterrupted and stable power supply for end users. Different types of energy storage have different characteristics, including their round-trip efficiency, power and energy rating, self-discharge, and investment and maintenance costs. In addition, the load characteristics and availability of different types of renewable energy sources vary in different geographic regions and at different times of year. Therefore joint capacity optimization for multiple types of energy storage and generation is important when designing this type of power systems. In this paper, we formulate a cost minimization problem for storage and generation planning, considering both the initial investment cost and operational/maintenance cost, and propose a distributed optimization framework to overcome the difficulty brought about by the large size of the optimization problem.

Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection.

The uncertainties are represented by scenarios, resulting in a large-scale and computationally demanding optimization problem. We use the optimality condition decomposition (OCD) to decompose the SMPC problem into subproblems which can be solved in parallel thereby reducing the computation time. Both a scenario-based decomposition and a temporal-based decomposition are formulated and numerically evaluated in terms of speed and convergence using a modified IEEE 39-bus test system.

9112,,"One of complementary value propositions of microgrids is to improve power system resiliency via local supply of loads and curtailment reduction. This subject is investigated in this paper by proposing a resiliency-oriented microgrid optimal scheduling model. The proposed model aims at minimizing the microgrid load curtailment by efficiently scheduling available resources when supply of power from the main grid is interrupted for an extended period of time. The problem is decomposed to normal operation and resilient operation problems. The normal operation problem solution, i.e., unit commitment states, energy storage schedules, and adjustable loads schedules, is employed in the resilient operation problem to examine microgrid capability in supplying local loads during main grid supply interruption. The schedule is revised via resiliency cuts if a zero mismatch is not obtained. Prevailing operational uncertainties in load, non-dispatchable generation, and the main grid supply interruption time and duration are considered and captured using a robust optimization method. The final solution, which is obtained in an iterative manner, is economically optimal, guarantees robustness against prevailing operational uncertainties, and supports a quick islanding with minimum consumer inconvenience and load curtailment.

We study a pricing scheme that conveys price and quantity information to the LA and compare it to a simpler price-only scheme. We prove that the price/quantity-based mechanism can yield a socially optimal solution. We also examine several numerical case studies to demonstrate the superior performance of the price/quantity-based scheme. The price/quantity scheme yields nearly identical PEV charging costs compared to the social optima, whereas the price-only scheme is highly sensitive to the choice of a regularization penalty term that is needed to ensure convergence. We also show that the time to compute an equilibrium with the price-only mechanism can be up to two orders of magnitude greater than with the price/quantity scheme and can involve 24 times more information exchange between the SO and LA.",WOS:000335155800032,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Xi, X.

9156,,"The advancement of renewable energy technologies has seen the emergence of customer owned grid tied wind and solar microgrids. These microgrids offer an opportunity to energy users to lower their energy costs as well as enabling the power suppliers to regulate the utility grid. However, the integration of the renewable energy based sources into the smart grid increases the complexity of the main grid. The success of this scheme will be heavily reliant on accurate real-time information exchange between the microgrid, the main grid, and the consumers. The communication between these agents will be critical in implementation of intelligent decisions by the smart grid. The microgrids will be required to relay energy forecasts information to the utility grid. Similarly, customers will be expected to submit energy demand schedules, to actively monitor energy price signals, to participate in energy bids, and to respond to energy management signals in real time. This kind of grid-user interaction will be overwhelming and could result in consumer apathy. There is therefore a need to develop smart systems that will autonomously execute all these tasks without the prompting of the customers. This paper presents one such approach.

9160,,"This paper evaluates the electric demand response (DR) management for distributed large-scale Internet data centers (IDCs) via the stochastic optimization approach. The electric DR of IDCs refers to the capability of optimally shifting cloud service tasks among distributed IDCs. Thus, the energy consumption reduction at certain IDC locations could be considered as the DR provision capacity in day-ahead DR programs. Cloud service tasks of IDCs include processing, storage, and computing tasks, which are further categorized into interruptible and non-interruptible tasks. The proposed model determines the optimal hourly DR capabilities of individual IDCs while considering uncertain coming cloud service tasks to individual IDCs. The major contribution of this paper is to rigorously formulate the DR capability of IDCs as changes in the electricity consumption when shifting cloud service tasks among distributed IDCs in different time zones, while considering the energy consumption for providing IT service, cooling, shifting cloud service tasks, environmental impacts, and uncertain coming tasks. The proposed model would enhance the financial situation and improve the environmental impacts of distributed IDCs by participating in day-ahead DR programs. The stochastic optimization adopts scenario-based approach via the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the total electricity cost, which is the expected electricity payment minus the revenue from the DR provision. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved by state-of-the-art MILP solvers.

At each time step, the system is modeled using convex objectives and constraints and solved to obtain a control schedule for the storage units across the MPC horizon. For each subsequent time step, the first step of the schedule is executed before repeating the optimization process to account for changes in the operating environment and predictions due to availability of additional information.

A DR program requires a large population of units to make a significant impact on power grid services like peak shaving and balancing. This paper investigates the importance of various HVAC physical parameters and their distributions that affect the aggregate response of a population of units to DR signals. This is a key step to the construction of HVAC models with DR functionality, given insufficient data, to predict the DR capacity available for dispatch. The HVAC model parameters include the size of floors, insulation efficiency, the amount of solid mass in the house, and efficiency. These parameters are usually assumed to follow Gaussian or Uniform distributions over the population. The impact of uncertainty in parameter distributions are quantified through the following steps: 1) Simulate the response of an HVAC population during the transient phase and during steady state for a given DR signal; 2) Use a quasi-Monte Carlo sampling method with linear regression and Prony analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of the DR output to the uncertainty in the parameter distributions; and 3) Identify important parameters based on their impact to the aggregate HVAC response.

9177,,"Although the unique characteristics of intermittent wind generation have been acknowledged and drastic impacts of sudden wind drops have been experienced, no effective integration approach has been developed. In this paper, without considering transmission capacity constraints for simplicity, aggregated wind generation is modeled as a discrete Markov process with state transition matrices established based on historical data. Wind generation is then integrated into system demand with multiple net demand levels at each hour. To accommodate the uncertain net demand, a stochastic unit commitment problem is formulated based on states instead of scenarios. The objective is to minimize the total commitment cost of conventional generators and their total expected dispatch cost while satisfying all possible net demand levels. The advantage of this formulation is that the state at a time instant summarizes the information of all previous instants in a probabilistic sense for reduced complexity. With state transition probabilities given, state probabilities calculated before optimization, and the objective function and constraints formulated in a linear manner, the problem is effectively solved by using branch-and-cut.

The paper has three salient contributions: 1) An aggregated battery circuit model with the open circuit voltage as a nonlinear function of the state of the charge (SOC) is derived and modeled in PSCAD. 2) Closed-loop feedback control strategies of the battery system are developed for the microgrid under both operation modes. At the grid-connected mode, power control is employed while at the autonomous mode, voltage and frequency control is employed for the battery to act as a synchronous generator by providing voltage and frequency support. 3) An upper level SOC based management system is also developed. Since SOC cannot be directly measured, an estimation scheme is derived based on power and voltage measurements from the battery.

With dynamic energy pricing models, consumers can use PV-based generation and controllable storage devices for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electric bill cost. The residential storage controller should possess the ability of forecasting future PV power generation as well as the power consumption profile of the household for better performance. In this paper, novel PV power generation and load power consumption prediction algorithms are presented, which are specifically designed for a residential storage controller. Furthermore, to perform effective storage control based on these predictions, the proposed storage control algorithm is separated into two tiers: the global control tier and the local control tier. The former is performed at decision epochs of a billing period (a month) to globally ""plan"" the future discharging/charging schemes of the storage system, whereas the latter one is performed more frequently as system operates to dynamically revise the storage control policy in response to the difference between predicted and actual power generation and consumption profiles. The global tier is formulated and solved as a convex optimization problem at each decision epoch, whereas the local tier is analytically solved. Finally, the optimal size of the energy storage module is determined so as to minimize the break-even time of the initial investment in the PV and storage systems.",WOS:000331985300048,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Wang, Y.

An adversary can inflict severe damage to the underlying physical system by compromising the control and monitoring applications facilitated by the cyber layer. Protection of critical assets from electronic threats has traditionally been done through conventional cyber security measures that involve host-based and network-based security technologies. However, it has been recognized that highly skilled attacks can bypass these security mechanisms to disrupt the smooth operation of control systems. There is a growing need for cyber-attack-resilient control techniques that look beyond traditional cyber defense mechanisms to detect highly skilled attacks. In this paper, we make the following contributions. We first demonstrate the impact of data integrity attacks on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) on power system frequency and electricity market operation. We propose a general framework to the application of attack resilient control to power systems as a composition of smart attack detection and mitigation. Finally, we develop a model-based anomaly detection and attack mitigation algorithm for AGC. We evaluate the detection capability of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm through simulation studies.

The utility scale energy storage applications have been often referred to as one of the potential solutions for improving the system frequency response, especially the speed of response. A new concept relating to the use of Dynamic Available AGC (DAA) of the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is proposed in this paper and applied in conjunction with the priority and proportional AGC signal distribution strategies. Additionally, this paper proposes an independent AGC control strategy based on Area Control Error (ACE) signal distribution to further enhance the impact of the fast response capability of the BESS. The same is accomplished by means of implementing an independent Proportional Integral (PI) controller without low-order filter typically associated with the ACE signal distribution. The AGC simulation results based on generation trip and normal load variance events, as tested on the El Salvador system model, indicate significant benefits to the system AGC performance when using the concept of the DAA for the BESS and the independent AGC control strategy.

This paper describes and evaluates a decentralized and ""packetized"" approach to PEV charge management, in which PEV charging is requested and approved for time-limited periods. This method, which is adapted from approaches for bandwidth sharing in communication networks, simultaneously ensures that constraints in the distribution network are satisfied, that communication bandwidth requirements are relatively small, and that each vehicle has fair access to the available power capacity. This paper compares the performance of the packetized approach to an optimization method and a first-come, first-served (FCFS) charging scheme in a test case with a constrained 500 kVA distribution feeder and time-of-use residential electricity pricing. The results show substantial advantages for the packetized approach.

It turns out that the consideration of the load mismatch risk in the objective function significantly complicates the risk-aware day-ahead scheduling problem (indeed it involves nonconvex optimization). A key step taken here is to utilize a hidden convexity structure to recast this problem as a two-stage stochastic linear program, and then solve it by using the L-shaped method. Since the computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of EVs, an estimation algorithm is developed based on importance sampling to mitigate the computational complexity. Further, a distributed risk-aware real-time dispatch algorithm is developed, in which the aggregator needs to compute only the shadow prices for each EV to optimize its own charging strategy in a distributed manner. It is shown, based on real data, that the proposed risk-aware day-ahead scheduling algorithm using importance sampling can significantly reduce the overall charging cost with a small number of samples.",WOS:000331985300016,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Yang, L., Zhang, J.

The performance of our model has been verified by forecasting wind power up to 48 hours ahead at seven wind farms for one and a half years. Our model ranked fourth in the Power and Energy Society (PES) wind power forecasting competition. The forecasting model uses 52 Neural Network (NN) sub-models and five Gaussian Process (GP) sub-models in parallel. For 48 hours, the NN sub-models forecast the future wind power based on historical wind power data and forecasted wind information. In parallel, for the first five hours, five GP sub-models are used to forecast wind power using only historical wind power in order to provide accurate wind power forecasts to NN sub-models.

SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity.

In this paper, we integrate the three aspects of voltage/VAR support: modeling, state estimation and network control in a single framework. Firstly, we develop an input to state nonlinear dynamic model that incorporates power flow equations along with load and distributed generation (DG) forecasts. Then, considering an extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach for nonlinear state estimation, we analyze the impact of dropped packets on stability of estimation process. Finally, we apply separation principle locally around some known state estimates, to design a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) based voltage/VAR support strategy. The control problem aims to minimize the aggregate reactive power injected by DG with the following constraints: 1) voltage regulation; 2) phase imbalance correction; and 3) maximum and minimum reactive power injection by individual generators. Considering computational complexity incurred in search for the optimal solution for large scale nonlinear control problems, we propose a successive time varying linear (STVL) approximation to our voltage/VAR control problem.

The PSD of the wind power follows different power laws over different frequency ranges and is approximated by a piecewise function. A scaling exponent of the power law for a particular piece can be approximated by the slope of an affine function fitted to a logarithmic plot of the PSD. Each piece of the function has a different trend as the total capacity increases. Slope trends, the first PSD value, and the last PSD value are trained to forecast the PSD. Then, future wind power scenarios are synthesized from the forecasted PSD. In this process, phase angles are searched using a genetic algorithm while satisfying forecasted statistical characteristics for the given capacity.

Compared with previous efforts to analyze the CVR outcome, this MSVR-based technique does not depend on selections of control groups or assumptions of any linear relationship between the load and its impact factors.

9242,,"Demand response and dynamic retail pricing of electricity are key factors in a smart grid to reduce peak loads and to increase the efficiency of the power grid. Air-conditioning and heating loads in residential buildings are major contributors to total electricity consumption. In hot climates, such as Austin, Texas, the electricity cooling load of buildings results in critical peak load during the on-peak period. Demand response (DR) is valuable to reduce both electricity loads and energy costs for end users in a residential building. This paper focuses on developing a control strategy for the HVACs to respond to real-time prices for peak load reduction. A proposed dynamic demand response controller (DDRC) changes the set-point temperature to control HVAC loads depending on electricity retail price published each 15 minutes and partially shifts some of this load away from the peak. The advantages of the proposed control strategy are that DDRC has a detailed scheduling function and compares the real-time retail price of electricity with a threshold price that customers set by their preference in order to control HVAC loads considering energy cost. In addition, a detailed single family house model is developed using OpenStudio and Energyplus considering the geometry of a residential building and geographical environment. This HVAC modeling provides simulation of a house. Comfort level is, moreover, reflected into the DDRC to minimize discomfort when DDRC changes the set-point temperature. Our proposed DDRC is implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and connected to the EnergyPlus model via building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB). The real-time retail price is based on the real-time wholesale price in the ERCOT market in Texas.

Specifically, the resident electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic usage is always guaranteed by theMG, while the quality usage is controlled based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i. e., QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual queues.

We model the cost function for each user and the constraints for the appliances. We then propose an approximate greedy iterative algorithm that can be employed by each user to schedule appliances. In the proposed algorithm, each user requires only the knowledge of the price of the electricity, which depends on the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. In order for the users to coordinate with each other, we introduce a penalty term in the cost function, which penalizes large changes in the scheduling between successive iterations.

Most current approaches ensure that each subsystem meets its individual specifications according to relevant metrics-stability of a physical system, safety and liveness of a cyber system, etc.-and then composes the overall system by functionality. The individual specifications are given in different semantics for each type of subsystem, and are in general equivalent to the cyber notion of correctness. This paper develops common semantics that span each aspect of a CPS through a new approach, unified invariants; unified invariants also ensure individual subsystem correctness but compose the overall system through logical truth instead of functionality. These individual invariants express and enforce system correctness common to the cyber, physical, and networking CPS subsystems and unified invariant approach ensures that the subsystems do not interfere with each others' correctness. In particular, the synthesis of switched dynamic CPSs will be unified by cyber, networking, and physical invariants rooted in the principal of Lyapunov-like functions. The goal is to make the resulting CPSs will be safe and stable at the system level, rather than just the subsystem level.",WOS:000329517300011,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Paul, T., Kimball, J.

Critical assessment of the performance of spatio-temporal wind power forecast is performed using realistic wind farm data from West Texas. It is shown that spatio-temporal wind forecast models are numerically efficient approaches to improving forecast quality. By reducing uncertainties in near-term wind power forecasts, the overall cost benefits on system dispatch can be quantified. We integrate the improved forecast with an advanced robust look-ahead dispatch framework. This integrated forecast and economic dispatch framework is tested in a modified IEEE RTS 24-bus system. Numerical simulation suggests that the overall generation cost can be reduced by up to 6% using a robust look-ahead dispatch coupled with spatio-temporal wind forecast as compared with persistent wind forecast models.",WOS:000329517300054,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Xie, L., Gu, Y.

We present two interactive models to jointly forecast plug-in electric vehicle sales and the diurnal recharging load curve in the U. S. between 2012 and 2020. The sales forecasting model is based on information about consumer preferences between hybrid electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, which can be extracted from historical data. The recharging load forecasting model is based on the assumption that electric vehicle users' recharging behavior will demonstrate a gradual transition from a convenience driven mode in 2012 to a cost driven mode in 2020. A case study is conducted for the Midwest ISO region. Compared to the sales forecasts from the literature, our results turn out to be less optimistic.

Methodologies used to study grid integration of variable generation can be adapted to the study of demand response. In the present work, we describe and implement a methodology to construct detailed temporal and spatial representations of demand response resources and to incorporate those resources into power system models.

We formulate a dynamic programming model for the control problem. The model deals with stochastic demand arrivals and schedules the demands based on their own allowable delays, which are specified by users. However, the dynamic programming model encounters the ""curses of dimensionality"" and some other difficulties, thus is hard to solve. We develop a decentralization-based heuristic first, and also propose an approximation approach based on Q-learning. Finally, we conduct numerical studies on a testing problem.

In this context, a novel load cleansing and imputation scheme is developed leveraging the low intrinsic-dimensionality of spatiotemporal load profiles and the sparse nature of ""bad data."" A robust estimator based on principal components pursuit (PCP) is adopted, which effects a twofold sparsity-promoting regularization through an l(1)-norm of the outliers, and the nuclear norm of the nominal load profiles. Upon recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to decentralized optimization, a distributed (D-) PCP algorithm is developed to carry out the imputation and cleansing tasks using networked devices comprising the so-termed advanced metering infrastructure.

Unlike the traditional approach of NILM in energy auditing, a new NILM system for DR is established based on a comprehensive analysis on the requirement of demand response. The new system is designed from both hardware and software aspects with a more practical load space and a more explicit measuring criteria.

DR programs typically have limits on the number and timing of events that may be triggered for a selected group of customers. This paper presents a methodology for optimizing the scheduling of DR events for various DR programs. The proposed optimization mechanism establishes a policy that triggers DR events according to the criteria that govern the cost to the utility and based on probability distributions of exogenous information that is accessible to utilities a priori, for decision making. The policy determines a dynamic threshold for triggering events that optimizes the expected savings over the planning horizon.

A numerical case study based on load and wind profiles of Illinois is constructed with 20 candidate generating units of various types. Numerical results show the impact of DR on both investment and operational decisions. We also propose a model in which DR provides operating reserves and discuss its impact on lowering the total capacity needed in the system. We observe that a relatively small amount of DR capacity is sufficient to enhance the system reliability.

Therefore, the control strategies ideally should be ""plug-and-play"", i.e., they should not require significant communication or architecture information, and they should work reliably as long as the supply/demand powers are reasonably balanced. Another unique issue of microgrids is the high resistance loss in distribution lines due to the low operating voltage. To reduce power losses, appropriate voltage control at distributed nodes is required which again must work in a plug-and-play fashion.

9357,,Motor loads require high amount of reactive power for a short period during their startup. The high reactive power drawn from the system causes voltage dips at startup time and potentially overvoltage after motor startup is over. The voltage dip and overvoltage may cause the relays to trip and the system to go unstable. This phenomenon is more challenging in weak distribution systems and isolated systems such as microgrids due to the limited inertia of the master generator. This paper presents a dynamic voltage controller that coordinates all the reactive power sources in the system to provide the necessary reactive power during motor startup.

9362,,"This paper proposes an appliance scheduling scheme for residential building energy management controllers, by taking advantage of the time-varying retail pricing enabled by the two-way communication infrastructure of the smart grid. Finite-horizon scheduling optimization problems are formulated to exploit operational flexibilities of thermal and non-thermal appliances using a model predictive control (MPC) method which incorporates both forecasts and newly updated information. For thermal appliance scheduling, the thermal mass of the building, which serves as thermal storage, is integrated into the optimization problem by modeling the thermodynamics of rooms in a building as constraints. Within the comfort range modeled by the predicted mean vote (PMV) index, thermal appliances are scheduled smartly together with thermal mass storage to hedge against high prices and make use of low-price time periods. For non-thermal appliance scheduling, in which delay and/or power consumption flexibilities are available, operation dependence of inter-appliance and intra-appliance is modeled to further exploit the price variation. Simulation results show that customers have notable energy cost savings on their electricity bills with time-varying pricing.

The microgrid is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers.

These are used in state estimation algorithms to make dispatch, re-balance and other energy management system [EMS] decisions. Coordinated cyber attacks on power meter readings can be designed to be undetectable by any bad data detection algorithm. These unobservable attacks present a serious threat to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of power meters on lines is presented. This requires O(n(2)m) flops for a power system with buses and line meters. If all lines are metered, there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks. These can be quickly detected with O(n(2)) flops using standard graph algorithms.

This paper considers the impact of frequency and voltage regulation on the optimal design of a conceptual, autonomous military microgrid. This microgrid comprises a solar panel and vehicles as power sources, with each vehicle incorporating a battery and generator. The power output and terminal voltage of these inverter-based sources must be regulated. The paper investigates the effects of battery DC voltage variations on a decentralized regulation scheme, and the resulting influence on optimal component sizing. To this end, controllers are first designed based on the typical assumption that the voltage on the DC side of each inverter is constant. The battery internal resistance is then considered and its impact on regulation performance is investigated. The results show that the battery internal resistance can affect the performance of both frequency and voltage regulation, and consequently must be taken into account in component sizing decisions.

Fuzzy technique is used to represent the relationship between the ventilation rate and the corresponding power consumption for mechanical ventilation systems. As compared with the traditional ON/OFF or fixed ventilation control scheme, the performance of the proposed intelligent control system has demonstrated its advantage in energy savings.

To consider such dynamic environmental properties, we use a multiagent-system-based approach in which individual homes are autonomous agents making rational decisions to buy, sell, or store electricity based on their present and expected future amount of load, generation, and storage, accounting for the benefits each decision can offer. In the proposed scheme, home agents prioritize their decisions based on the expected utilities they provide. Smart homes' intention to minimize their electricity bills is in line with the grid's aim to flatten the total demand curve.

9424,,"Efficiently integrating wind energy into the smart grid is gaining momentum under renewable portfolio standard (RPS) with deep wind penetration. Due to the randomness of wind energy production, ancillary service (AS) is needed in large amount to regulate wind power for system stability and reliability. As a result, the cost of wind power depends on the AS market and may be, quite higher than that of conventional power. Therefore, it is challenging to economically integrate wind energy with current power system to satisfy RPS. With the communication, sensing and advanced control features incorporated into the smart grid, the interactions among the grid components will facilitate solving this problem. In this paper, we consider the wind energy integration of small-scale utilities installed with wind turbines and acted as distributed energy resources (DERs). Since wind energy can be integrated to serve customer load or enter a separate green energy market, we propose a theoretical framework to dynamically determine the role of wind energy and provide long-term RPS guarantee.

This leads to a novel privacy-utility tradeoff problem with minimal assumptions that is tractable. For a stationary Gaussian model of the electricity load, it is shown that for a desired mean-square distortion (utility) measure between the measured and revealed data, the optimal privacy-preserving solution: i) exploits the presence of high-power but less private appliance spectra as implicit distortion noise, and ii) filters out frequency components with lower power relative to a distortion threshold; this approach encompasses many previously proposed approaches to smart meter privacy.",WOS:000325487800021,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Sankar, L., Rajagopalan, S.

In this paper, a new demand side management technique, namely, a new energy efficient scheduling algorithm, is proposed to arrange the household appliances for operation such that the monetary expense of a customer is minimized based on the time-varying pricing model. The proposed algorithm takes into account the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and intermittent renewable generation. Moreover, it considers the variable frequency drive and capacity-limited energy storage. Our technique first uses the linear programming to efficiently compute a deterministic scheduling solution without considering uncertainties. To handle the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and energy consumption, a stochastic scheduling technique, which involves an energy consumption adaptation variable beta, is used to model the stochastic energy consumption patterns for various household appliances. To handle the intermittent behavior of the energy generated from the renewable resources, the offline static operation schedule is adapted to the runtime dynamic scheduling considering variations in renewable energy. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to a traditional scheduling scheme which models typical household appliance operations in the traditional home scenario, the proposed deterministic linear programming based scheduling scheme achieves up to 45% monetary expense reduction, and the proposed stochastic design scheme achieves up to 41% monetary expense reduction. Compared to a worst case design where an appliance is assumed to consume the maximum amount of energy, the proposed stochastic design which considers the stochastic energy consumption patterns achieves up to 24% monetary expense reduction without violating the target trip rate of 0.5%.

In this paper, we seek to tackle this shortcoming by proposing a systematic approach to maximize green data center's profit, i.e., revenue minus cost. In this regard, we explicitly take into account practical service-level agreements (SLAs) that currently exist between data centers and their customers. Our model also incorporates various other factors such as availability of local renewable power generation at data centers and the stochastic nature of data centers' workload.

The paper also presents a new smart charging algorithm that manages PEV charging based on estimated transformer temperatures. We simulated the varied behavior of drivers from the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey, and transformer temperatures based an IEEE standard dynamic thermal model. Results are shown for Monte Carlo simulation of a 25 kVA overhead distribution transformer, with ambient temperature data from hot and cold climate locations, for uncontrolled and several smart-charging scenarios. These results illustrate the substantial impact of ambient temperatures on distribution transformer aging, and indicate that temperature-based smart charging can dramatically reduce both the mean and variance in transformer aging without substantially reducing the frequency with which PEVs obtain a full charge. Finally, the results indicate that simple smart charging schemes, such as delaying charging until after midnight can actually increase, rather than decrease, transformer aging.",WOS:000325487800028,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Hilshey, A.

9454,,"Real-time routing is a basic element of closed-loop, real-time sensing and control, but it is challenging due to dynamic, uncertain link/path delays. The probabilistic nature of link/path delays makes the basic problem of computing the probabilistic distribution of path delays NP-hard, yet quantifying probabilistic path delays is a basic element of real-time routing and may well have to be executed by resource-constrained devices in a distributed manner; the highly varying nature of link/path delays makes it necessary to adapt to in-situ delay conditions in real-time routing, but it has been observed that delay-based routing can lead to instability, estimation error, and low data delivery performance in general. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Timescale Estimation (MTE) method; by accurately estimating the mean and variance of per-packet transmission time and by adapting to fast-varying queueing in an accurate, agile manner, MTE enables accurate, agile, and efficient estimation of probabilistic path delay bounds in a distributed manner. Based on MTE, we propose the Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA) routing protocol; MTA integrates the stability of an ETX-based directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) with the agility of spatiotemporal data flow control within the DAG to ensure real-time data delivery in the presence of dynamics and uncertainties. We also address the challenges of implementing MTE and MTA in resource-constrained devices such as TelosB motes. We evaluate the performance of MTA using the NetEye and Indriya sensor network testbeds.

The possibility association of frequencies measured at different locations are modeled by a Bayesian network with the logical structure learned using Bayesian structure learning and real measurements in the U.

Such application of Bayesian network is a powerful mathematical tool in computational intelligence. Without the physical power network topology information, a two-branch search-and-score structure learning algorithm with L-1 regulation is proposed to learn the logical structure, achieving around 97% correct prediction rate for future frequency and 92% detection rate for false frequency data with 2% false alarm rate. The tool of epidemic propagation over this logical network is also exploited to analyze the propagation of frequency changes. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, such logical structure is demonstrated to be well approximated by the Small World network model.

However, power networks also tend to be more vulnerable due to the cascading failures from their interdependent information systems, i.e., the failures in the information systems can cause the failures of the coupled portion in power networks. Therefore, the accurate vulnerability assessment of interdependent power networks is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network nodes. In this paper, we study the Interdependent Power Network Disruptor (IPND) optimization problem to identify critical nodes in an interdependent power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its interdependent communication network. First, we show the IPND problem is NP-hard to be approximated within the factor of (2 - epsilon).

Different from the conventional 'topological observability' based approaches, this paper advocates a much more refined, information-theoretic criterion, namely the mutual information (MI) between PMU measurements and power system states. The proposed MI criterion not only includes observability as a special case, but also rigorously models the uncertainty reduction on power system states from PMU measurements. Thus, it can generate highly informative PMU configurations. The MI criterion can also facilitate robust PMU placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU outages. We propose a greedy PMU placement algorithm, and show that it achieves an approximation ratio of (1 - 1/e) for any PMU placement budget. We further show that the performance is the best that one can achieve, in the sense that it is NP-hard to achieve any approximation ratio beyond (1 - 1/e) Such performance guarantee makes the greedy algorithm very attractive in the practical scenario of multi-stage installations for utilities with limited budgets.

Energy storage is a key technology to enable reliable and cost-effective renewable energy. Given the fact that a large-scale energy storage device is usually costly to install and operate, we are naturally led to the following question: How much storage is necessary to guarantee the stability of a power grid network with DRESs? This paper represents a first step in systematically exploring the tradeoff between the capacity of energy storage devices and the outage probability, i.e., the probability of the occurrence of imbalance between the supply and demand. We first propose a secure scheduling and dispatch (SSD) algorithm that is capable of maintaining the grid stability in the presence of volatility in the power generation. We then derive a closed-form bound to quantify the tradeoff between the storage capacity and the outage probability. Under mild assumptions, we show that the outage probability decreases exponentially with respect to the square of the storage capacity. This finding implies that energy storage is an effective and economically viable solution to maintain the stability of a smart grid network, even in the presence of many volatile and intermittent renewable energy sources.

9498,,"The smart grid features ubiquitous interconnections of power equipments to enable two-way flows of electricity and information for various intelligent power management applications, such as accurate relay protection and timely demand response. To fulfill such pervasive equipment interconnects, a full-fledged communication infrastructure is of great importance in the smart grid. There have been extensive works on disparate layouts of communication infrastructures in the smart grid by surveying feasible wired or wireless communication technologies, such as power line communications and cellular networks. Nevertheless, towards an operable, cost-efficient and backward-compatible communication solution, more comprehensive and practical understandings are still urgently needed regarding communication requirements, applicable protocols, and system performance. Through such comprehensive understandings, we are prone to answer a fundamental question, how to design, implement and integrate communication infrastructures with power systems. In this paper, we address this issue in a case study of a smart grid demonstration project, the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) systems. By investigating communication scenarios, we first clarify communication requirements implied in FREEDM use cases. Then, we adopt a predominant protocol framework, Distributed Network Protocol 3.0 over TCP/IP (DNP3 over TCP/IP), to practically establish connections between electric devices for data exchanges in a small-scale FREEDM system setting, Green Hub. Within the real-setting testbed, we measure the message delivery performance of the DNP3-based communication infrastructure. Our results reveal that diverse timing requirements of message deliveries are arguably primary concerns in a way that dominates viabilities of protocols or schemes in the communication infrastructure of the smart grid. Accordingly, although DNP3 over TCP/IP is widely considered as a smart grid communication solution, it cannot satisfy communication requirements in some time-critical scenarios, such as relay protections, which claim a further optimization on the protocol efficiency of DNP3.",WOS:000325485600017,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Lu, X., Wang, W.

9505,,"Demand response is a key feature of the smart grid. The addition of bidirectional communication to today's power grid can provide real-time pricing (RTP) to customers via smart meters. A growing number of appliance companies have started to design and produce smart appliances which embed intelligent control modules to implement residential demand response based on RTP. However, most of the current residential load scheduling schemes are centralized and based on either day-ahead pricing (DAP) or predicted price, which can deviate significantly from the RTP. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme based on the optimal stopping rule as a real-time distributed scheduling algorithm for smart appliances' automation control. It determines the best time for appliances' operation to balance electricity bill reduction and inconvenience resulting from the operation delay. It is shown that our scheme is a distributed threshold policy when no constraint is considered. When a total power constraint exists, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be implemented in either a centralized or distributed fashion. Our scheme has low complexity and can be easily implemented.

The controller is trained offline to perform well under a wide variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural network based system identification eliminates the need to develop accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement units at generating stations within an area of the system. These representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the system ""seen"" by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with simulations of the system.

The proposed protocol considers both ""schedulable"" appliances which have delay flexibility, and ""critical"" appliances which consume power as they desire. An optimization problem is formulated for the energy management controller to decide the target values for each time slot, by incorporating the variation of electricity prices and distributed wind power uncertainty.

9514,,"A major source of inefficiency in power grids is the underutilization of generation capacity. This is mainly because load demand during peak hours is much larger than that during off-peak hours. Moreover, extra generation capacity is needed to maintain a security margin above peak load demand. As load demand keeps increasing and two-way communications are enabled by smart meters (SMs), demand response (DR) has been proposed as an alternative to installing new power plants in smart grids. DR makes use of real-time schemes to allow users to modify their load demand patterns according to their energy consumption costs. In particular, when load demand is high, energy consumption cost will be high and users may decide to postpone certain amount of their consumption needs. This strategy may effectively reduce the peak load demand and increases the off-peak demand, and hence could increase existing generation capacity utilization and reduce the need to install extra generation plants. In this paper, we consider a third-party managing the energy consumption of a group of users, and formulate the load scheduling problem as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem (CMOP). The optimization objectives are to minimize energy consumption cost and to maximize a certain utility, which can be conflicting and non-commensurable. We then develop two evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to obtain the Pareto-front solutions and the epsilon-Pareto front solutions to the CMOP, respectively, which are validated by extensive simulation results.",WOS:000325485600033,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Salinas, S., Li, M. and Li, P.","Mississippi State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",17,10.1109/Tsg.2012.2214068,Mar,1949-3053,1,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,energy consumption scheduling,evolutionary algorithms,multi-objective optimization,algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,232IB,,341-348,15235,Journal Article,,,Multi-Objective Optimal Energy Consumption Scheduling in Smart Grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36,Multi-Objective Optimal Energy Consumption Scheduling in Smart Grids,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325485600033,4,,,2013,,Mississippi State Univ,USA

Renewable energy sources are identified as valuable distributed generation assets during disasters because they do not require lifelines; yet, their variable generation nature leads to the need for significant local energy storage. Additional local energy storage may be desirable as a backup solution to address potential failures that would blackout the load because they reduce the impact of lifeline performance during disasters on micro-grid availability.

In this paper, we present a security-oriented cyber-physical state estimation (SCPSE) system, which, at each time instant, identifies the compromised set of hosts in the cyber network and the maliciously modified set of measurements obtained from power system sensors. SCPSE fuses uncertain information from different types of distributed sensors, such as power system meters and cyber-side intrusion detectors, to detect the malicious activities within the cyber-physical system. We implemented a working prototype of SCPSE and evaluated it using the IEEE 24-bus benchmark system. The experimental results show that SCPSE significantly improves on the scalability of traditional intrusion detection techniques by using information from both cyber and power sensors.

The 25 kV system parameters are scaled down to 12 kV and renewable sources including solar PV and wind turbines, an energy storage system, and a diesel generator for islanded mode have been added to the 34-bus system.

We denote such peaks as rebound peaks. We address the potential rebound peak problems of automated DR algorithms, and provide possible solutions. We illustrate why a rebound peak is possible via the insights we obtain from the optimal automated DR algorithm. We show that if the utility electricity supply cost is assumed to be a homogeneous function in the energy consumption over a certain time span, a system of multiple homes and utility company has the lowest total electricity supply cost if the electricity consumption from all the homes is flat over the time span.

9562,,This paper presents a series of analyses whose goal is to understand the effectiveness with which time-of-use (TOU) rates can economically incent off-peak charging in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). The total cost of fueling PHEV under modeled and real-world TOU rates is compared to the total cost of fueling PHEV under constant rates. Time-resolved vehicle energy consumption and fueling cost is derived for a variety of PHEV designs from travel survey data and charging behavior models. A decision tree model of PHEV consumer choices is proposed with effectiveness and cost metrics defined at each decision point. Results show that gasoline PHEV that charge off-peak incur higher gasoline costs than PHEV that charge at-will. These additional fueling costs reduce the magnitude of the economic incentives for off-peak charging that TOU rates can provide to PHEV consumers. These results are then used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of model and real-world TOU rates and to discuss implications for modeling PHEV total fueling cost.,WOS:000325485000012,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Davis, B.

9586,,"A microgrid is capable of providing highly reliable power supply to sensitive loads like semiconductor fabrication or computer data processing equipment. This is especially required when the sensitive loads are located in distribution systems that also contain several single-phase and/or nonlinear loads. Voltage source inverter (VSI) based distributed energy resources can provide power quality conditioning support. They require filters to accurately detect unbalance and harmonics in the system. The state-of-the-art filtering techniques in three-phase power systems involve employing complex bandpass filters that pass frequencies within a band without much attenuation. Such methods however give good dynamic performance only when there is a wide separation between the desired and undesired frequencies. In power distribution systems containing imbalances and harmonic generating loads, the gap between the two frequencies may be very small, and therefore such methods don't offer good performance.

The close dependency of major transmission paths requires an approach that takes that interaction into account while establishing operational transfer capability, and evaluates grid reliability and security on a system-wide basis. Thus, the concept of wide-area security region, which considers all essential constraints, including thermal, voltage stability, transient stability, and small signal stability, is proposed. This approach expands the idea of traditional transmission system nomograms to a multidimensional case, involving multiple system limits and parameters such as transmission path constraints, zonal generation or load, etc., considered concurrently. In this paper, the security region boundary is represented using piece-wise approximation with the help of linear inequalities (so called hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space, consisting of system parameters that are critical for security analysis. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are conducted to build the security region and the hyperplanes can be applied in real time with phasor information for on-line security assessment. Numerical simulations have been performed for the full size Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system model, which comprises 15 126 buses and 3034 generators.

PEVs are mobile and distributed devices with deferrable options for the supply/utilization of energy at various times and locations. The increased utilization of PEVs, which consume electricity rather than fossil fuel for driving, offers unique economic and environmental opportunities, and brings out new challenges to electric power system operation and planning. The storage capability of PEVs could help power systems mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources and reduce grid operation costs. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables PEVs to have bi-directional power flows once they are connected to the grid, i.e., they can either inject power to, and draw power from, the grid which adds further complexity to power system operations.

Firstly, power flow equations are formulated with arbitrarily located distributed generators in the network. Since reactive power injection is limited by economic viability and power electronics interface, we formulate voltage/VAR control as a constrained optimization problem. The formulation aims to minimize the combined reactive power injection by distributed generators, with constraints on: 1) power flow equations; 2) voltage regulation; 3) phase imbalance correction; and 4) maximum and minimum reactive power injection. The formulation is a nonconvex problem thereby making the search for an optimal solution extremely complex. So, a suboptimal approach is proposed based on methods of sequential convex programming (SCP). Comparing our suboptimal approach with the optimal solution obtained from branch and bound method, we show the trade-off in quality of our solution with runtime.

Aggregate Control, where feedback controllers are designed to achieve a desired closed-loop transient response between every pair of clusters, and finally 3. Control Inversion, where the aggregate control design is distributed and tuned to actual TCSC controllers in the full-order model until its inter-area responses match the respective inter-machine responses of the reduced-order system.

9626,,"The vision of a smart grid is predicated upon pervasive use of modern digital communication techniques to today's power system. As wide area measurements and control techniques are being developed and deployed for a more resilient power system, the role of communication network is becoming prominent. Power system dynamics gets influenced by the communication delays in the network. Therefore, extensive integration of power system and communication infrastructure mandates that the two systems be studied as a single distributed cyber-physical system. This paper proposes a power system and communication network co-simulation framework (GECO) using a global event-driven mechanism. The accuracy is tunable based on the time-scale requirements of the phenomena being studied. This co-simulation can improve the practical investigation of smart grid and evaluate wide area measurement and control schemes.

Realistic intra-hour load balancing signals are used to evaluate the operational characteristics of the HVAC load under different outdoor temperature profiles and different indoor temperature settings. The number of HVAC units needed is also investigated.

The main idea is to transmit only when a significant power consumption change occurs. On the other hand, the policy of transmitting only when change occurs may bring a security issue; i.e., an eavesdropper can monitor the daily life of the house owner, particularly the information of whether the owner is at home.

9657,,"This paper deals with load control in a multiple-residence setup. The utility company adopts a cost function representing the cost of providing energy to end-users. Each residential end-user has a base load, two types of adjustable loads, and possibly a storage device. The first load type must consume a specified amount of energy over the scheduling horizon, but the consumption can be adjusted across different slots. The second type does not entail a total energy requirement, but operation away from a user-specified level results in user dissatisfaction. The research issue amounts to minimizing the electricity provider cost plus the total user dissatisfaction, subject to the individual constraints of the loads. The problem can be solved by a distributed subgradient method. The utility company and the end-users exchange information through the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)-a two-way communication network-in order to converge to the optimal amount of electricity production and the optimal power consumption schedule. The algorithm finds near-optimal schedules even when AMI messages are lost, which can happen in the presence of malfunctions or noise in the communications network.

9659,,"Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS)-based closed-loop power system control faces lots of challenges such as network effects in WAMS communication which include network-induced delays, data packet dropouts and packet disordering, etc. As of now, design of wide area feedback controller robust against those network effects typically relies on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) methods. However, because LMIs methods results in conservative controller and sometimes feasible solution cannot be found although they exist, it is still difficult to implement wide area feedback control in real power systems. In order to overcome those problems, a more practical scheme is presented in this paper for WAMS-based closed-loop power system control. In the new scheme, a GPS receiver is configured at the wide area feedback controller/actuator which can calculate feedback signals' delays by comparing the time differences between their own clocks and time stamps of feedback signals. Then, by using synchronized sampling technology again, trajectories of power systems are extrapolated to compensate those network effects in WAMS communication. Therefore, in the new scheme, hardware technologies (e.g., GPS-based synchronized sampling technologies) instead of complicated LMIs methods are used to deal with network effects in WAMS communication. So the new control scheme can overcome the conservative nature from LMIs methods and can be implemented practically in real power systems.

A subset of these results is presented for illustration. This extensive study of a complex urban network suggests that: 1) before implementation of smart grid principles, it would be prudent to supplement steady-state analysis with time-domain analysis to avoid problems, such as installation of improperly rated equipment, and improper relay-protection coordination; and 2) EMTP-type programs may be used to conduct the time-domain analysis, despite the enormous number of elements contained in an urban network.",WOS:000325484200030,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Spitsa, V., Ran, X.

Based on the epsilon decomposition of the sensitivity matrix (inverse of Jacobian) obtained from the solution of the Newton-Raphson power flow problem, a large secondary network is divided into several small subnetworks. From the epsilon decomposition, the range of influence of each DG on the voltage of the entire network is determined. When voltage at particular nodes exceeds normal operating limits, the nearest DGs can be located and commanded to control the voltage. The control action can be coordinated using communications in a small-size subnetwork. The voltage regulation is achieved by solving a small linear programming optimization problem with an objective function that makes every DG to optimize its generation.

9687,,"As solar photovoltaic power generation becomes more commonplace, the inherent intermittency of the solar resource poses one of the great challenges to those who would design and implement the next generation smart grid. Specifically, grid-tied solar power generation is a distributed resource whose output can change extremely rapidly, resulting in many issues for the distribution system operator with a large quantity of installed photovoltaic devices. Battery energy storage systems are increasingly being used to help integrate solar power into the grid. These systems are capable of absorbing and delivering both real and reactive power with sub-second response times. With these capabilities, battery energy storage systems can mitigate such issues with solar power generation as ramp rate, frequency, and voltage issues. Beyond these applications focusing on system stability, energy storage control systems can also be integrated with energy markets to make the solar resource more economical. Providing a high-level introduction to this application area, this paper presents an overview of the challenges of integrating solar power to the electricity distribution system, a technical overview of battery energy storage systems, and illustrates a variety of modes of operation for battery energy storage systems in grid-tied solar applications.

9692,,"The grid faces a number of challenges related to large-scale integration of intermittent distributed generation (DG) such as photovoltaics (PV). Power quality challenges include voltage regulation issues, flicker, and frequency volatility. Operational challenges include the need for extension of the command-and-control infrastructure to millions of devices anticipated on the low-voltage (service) side of the distribution network. This paper presents an advanced grid-tied inverter controls concept designed to address such challenges. This controls concept is based on reproducing favorable characteristics of traditional generators that result in load-following tendencies, and is accordingly dubbed Generator Emulation Controls (GEC). Traditional generators are analyzed with specific focus on such favorable characteristics as inertial dynamics and controlled impedance. Details of GEC are then presented, and its implementation is outlined based on the evolution of conventional grid-tied inverter controls. This is followed by an examination of the system impact of GEC-operated devices. GEC allows DG inverters to perform voltage regulation support, reactive power compensation, and fault ride-through. GEC also allows DG inverters to form scalable inverter-based microgrids, capable of operating in grid-tied mode or separating and supporting an islanded load. Simulation results are presented to examine the impact on voltage regulation and power losses across a distribution feeder.

Each of the operating modes has an individually designed outer loop performing the corresponding regulation tasks, most commonly including the ac voltage and the dc voltage regulation. A modified 1 Phi, phase-locked loop (PLL) system is used for system-level operation with both small steady-state error and fast response; and a novel islanding detection algorithm based on PLL stability is proposed to facilitate the transition between grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode.

The proposed DSOPF control replaces the traditional AGC and secondary voltage control, and provides a coordinated AC power flow control solution to the smart grid operation in an environment with high short-term uncertainty and variability. The ACD technique, specifically the dual heuristic dynamic programming (DHP), is used to provide nonlinear optimal control, where the control objective is explicitly formulated to incorporate power system economy, stability and security considerations.

Active battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be different than that of the ultracapacitor, which will result in flexibility of design as well as cost and size reduction of the battery pack. In addition, the ultracapacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power and it can be used with high C-rates. Hence, the battery is not subjected to supply peak and sharp power variations, and the stress on the battery will be reduced and the battery lifetime would be increased.

The method is designed for simulation studies that require accurate models of sensors such as phasor measurement units and F-Net devices, which measure frequency at locations away from generating plants. These sensors are poised to become critical components in the control systems of electrical power grids, and therefore simulation tools that incorporate accurate models of these devices are essential. The method proposed here corrects two drawbacks of using numerically computed phase angle derivatives to approximate frequency. First, it eliminates spurious spikes in frequencies calculated at loads. Second, it eliminates instabilities induced by the simulator in studies of frequency responsive loads. The proposed method is derived from a simplified model of the generators and loads in an electrical system, but in the final analysis does not depend critically on these simplifications and is therefore applicable to more sophisticated models.

The STW cycle includes the raw material production stage, transportation and storage stages of energy sources, energy transportation/storage/distribution stage, and finally the vehicle operations stage. The STW calculation is divided into two sections for ease of analysis. They are the cycle from the source of the energy to the vehicle and the cycle from when the energy is delivered to the vehicle to the work done at the wheels.

To tackle these power system issues and maintain high system reliability, it is essential to have information about the condition of assets present on the grid. Presently, due to the absence of low cost flexible grid wide monitoring solutions, complete information of the system is not achievable. This paper deals with the development of a new class of sensors called the smart ""stick-on"" sensors. These are low cost, self-powered, universal sensors that provide a flexible monitoring solution for grid assets. These sensors can be mass deployed due to low cost, need low maintenance as they are self-powered, and can be used for monitoring a variety of grid assets. This paper also presents the details on the network architecture, interoperability and integration, and different design aspects of the stick-on sensor, such as novel energy harvesting techniques, power management, wide operating range, and reliability.

9726,,"This paper presents a spatial and temporal model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station located near a highway exit. Most previous studies have assumed a fixed charging location and fixed charging time during the off-peak hours for anticipating electric vehicle charging demand. Some other studies have based on limited charging scenarios at typical locations instead of a mathematical model. Therefore, from a distribution system perspective, electric vehicle charging demand is still unidentified quantity which may vary by space and time. In this context, this study proposes a mathematical model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station. The mathematical model is based on the fluid dynamic traffic model and the M/M/s queueing theory. Firstly, the arrival rate of discharged vehicles at a charging station is predicted by the fluid dynamic model. Then, charging demand is forecasted by the M/M/s queueing theory with the arrival rate of discharged vehicles. This mathematical model of charging demand may allow grid's distribution planners to anticipate a charging demand profile at a charging station. A numerical example shows that the proposed model is able to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of charging demand in a highway charging station.",WOS:000325427200040,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Bae, S. and Kwasinski, A.","Univ Texas Austin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",37,10.1109/Tsg.2011.2159278,Mar,1949-3053,1,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,charging demand,charging station,electric vehicle,energy management,modeling,planning,poisson processes,power demand,power distribution planning,spatial and temporal model,networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,231OS,,394-403,15447,Journal Article,,,Spatial and Temporal Model of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56,Spatial and Temporal Model of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand,,,,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325427200040,3,,,2012,,Univ Texas Austin,USA

IDC's energy efficiency is gaining more attention by data center operators and electricity market operators. Effective IDC electric demand management solutions are eagerly sought by all stakeholders. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model based IDC electric demand management solution is proposed, which integrates both the impacts of locational marginal electricity prices and power management capability of IDC itself. Dynamic voltage/frequency scaling of individual server, cluster server ON/OFF scheduling, and dynamic workload dispatching are optimized while complying with all the IDC system-wide and individual heterogeneous servers' operation constraints according to the IDC applications' temporal variant workload. Reduced electricity cost can be achieved together with guaranteed QoS requirement and reliability consideration by using the proposed model. World Cup '98 data is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. According to the experimental evaluation, electricity cost could be cut by more than 20% in a peak workload period and by more than 80% in a light workload period.

However, analyses to date have not evaluated the effect that automatic generator control signal energy content and call rate has on V2G ancillary service reliability and value. This research incorporates a new level of detail into the modeling of V2G ancillary services by incorporating probabilistic vehicle travel models, time-series automatic generation control signals, and time series ancillary services pricing into a non-linear dynamic simulation of the driving and charging behavior of PHEVs. Stochastic results are generated using Monte-Carlo methods. Results show that in order to integrate a V2G system into the existing market and power grid the V2G system will require: 1) an aggregative architecture to meet current industry standard reliability requirements; 2) the construction of low energy automatic generation control signals; 3) a lower percent call for V2G even if the pool of contracted ancillary service resources gets smaller; 4) a consideration of vehicle performance degradation due to the potential loss of electrically driven miles; and 5) a high-power home charging capability.",WOS:000325427200049,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Quinn, C., Zimmerle, D. and Bradley, T.

The key assumption here is that the grid is able to directly control the charging power of PEVs in real-time, through broadcasting a universal control signal. Using the transport-based load modeling principle, we develop a partial differential equation model for the collective charging of PEVs. We use real driving data to simulate the model and validate it against a PEV Monte Carlo simulation model. Adopting the sliding mode control theory, we then develop a robust output tracking controller for the system. The controller uses the real-time error between power supply and demand as the only measured signal, and attempts to suppress it despite the variation of the population of PEVs on the grid.

The massive northeastern power blackout of August 2003 and the most recent Florida blackout have both revealed serious defects in both system-level management and device-level designs of the power grid in handling attacks. At the system level, the control area operators lack the capability to 1) obtain real-time status information of the vastly distributed equipment; 2) respond rapidly enough once events start to unravel; and 3) perform coordinated actions autonomously across the region. At the device level, the traditional hardware lacks the capability to 1) provide reliable frequency and voltage control according to system demands and 2) rapidly reconfigure the system to a secure state through switches and power-electronics based devices. These blackouts were a wake-up call for both the industry and academia to consider new techniques and system architecture design that can help assure the security and reliability of the power grid. In this paper, we present a hardware-in-the-loop reconfigurable system design with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination schemes at both local and system levels that would tackle the vulnerabilities of the grid. The new system design consists of five key components: 1) a location-centric hybrid system architecture that facilitates not only distributed processing but also coordination among geographically close devices; 2) the insertion of intelligence into power electronic devices at the lower level of the power grid to enable a more direct reconfiguration of the physical makeup of the grid; 3) the development of a robust collaboration algorithm among neighboring devices to handle possible faulty, missing, or incomplete information; 4) the design of distributed algorithms to better understand the local state of the power grid; and 5) the adoption of a control-theoretic real-time adaptation strategy to guarantee the availability of large distributed systems.

9765,,"Malicious attacks against power systems are investigated, in which an adversary controls a set of meters and is able to alter the measurements from those meters. Two regimes of attacks are considered. The strong attack regime is where the adversary attacks a sufficient number of meters so that the network state becomes unobservable by the control center. For attacks in this regime, the smallest set of attacked meters capable of causing network unobservability is characterized using a graph theoretic approach. By casting the problem as one of minimizing a super-modular graph functional, the problem of identifying the smallest set of vulnerable meters is shown to have polynomial complexity. For the weak attack regime where the adversary controls only a small number of meters, the problem is examined from a decision theoretic perspective for both the control center and the adversary. For the control center, a generalized likelihood ratio detector is proposed that incorporates historical data. For the adversary, the trade-off between maximizing estimation error at the control center and minimizing detection probability of the launched attack is examined.

This paper is concerned with anomaly detection in the computer network environment of a substation. An anomaly inference algorithm is proposed for early detection of cyber-intrusions at the substations. The potential scenario of simultaneous intrusions launched over multiple substations is considered. The proposed detection method considers temporal anomalies. Potential intrusion events are ranked based on the credibility impact on the power system. Snapshots of anomaly entities at substations are described.

9767,,"The advent of the smart grid promises to usher in an era that will bring intelligence, efficiency, and optimality to the power grid. Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards.

In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks.

The substantial attack surface presented by the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) along with the dissemination of sensitive data including privacy, billing, and control information will provide attackers with significant economic incentive. In addition, the scale and complexity of the architecture will stress the capabilities of many security controls such as public key encryption (PKI), authentication, and access control. The aforementioned concerns produce a requirement for increased risk management including security models that have the capability to scale to such a complex environment. A security model is introduced to represent various privilege states in a large architecture and evaluates viable paths that an attacker could exploit. The resulting model is used to produce a quantitative information-based exposure metric to evaluate the completeness of implemented security mechanisms.

9770,,"Multicast has been envisioned to be useful in many smart grid applications such as demand-response, wide area protection, in-substation protection and various operation and control. Since the multicast messages are related to critical control, authentication is necessary to prevent message forgery attacks. In this paper, we first identify the requirements of multicast communication and multicast authentication in the smart grid. Based on these requirements, we find that one-time signature based multicast authentication is a promising solution, due to its short authentication delay and low computation cost. However, existing one-time signatures are not designed for the smart grid and they may have high storage and bandwidth overhead. To address this problem, we propose a new one-time signature scheme which can reduce the storage cost by a factor of 8 and reduce the signature size by 40% compared with existing schemes. Thus, our scheme is more appropriate for smart grid applications where the receivers have limited storage (e. g., home appliances and field devices) or where data communication is frequent and short (e. g., phasor data). These gains are at the cost of increased computations in signature generation and/or verification and fortunately our scheme can flexibly allocate the computations between the sender and receiver based on their computing resources. We formulate the computation allocation as a nonlinear integer programming problem to minimize the signing cost under a certain verification cost and propose a heuristic solution to solve it.",WOS:000208787700014,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Li, Q.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V2G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V2G network into practice. In V2G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protection rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable.

A distributed cooperative trust system has the potential to add an additional layer of protection designed to operate with greater autonomy. This trust component enables the agents in the system to make assessments using an estimate of the trustworthiness of cooperating protection agents based on their responsiveness and the consistency of their responses when compared with their peers. Results illustrate the improved decision-making capability of agents who incorporate this cooperative trust method in the presence of failures in neighboring relays.,WOS:000208787500007,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Borowski, J.

9806,,"This paper presents a novel appliance commitment algorithm that schedules thermostatically controlled household loads based on price and consumption forecasts considering users' comfort settings to meet an optimization objective such as minimum payment or maximum comfort. The formulation of an appliance commitment problem is described using an electrical water heater load as an example. The thermal dynamics of heating and coasting of the water heater load is modeled by physical models; random hot water consumption is modeled with statistical methods. The models are used to predict the appliance operation over the scheduling time horizon. User comfort is transformed to a set of linear constraints. Then, a novel linear-sequential-optimization-enhanced, multiloop algorithm is used to solve the appliance commitment problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm is fast, robust, and flexible.

9817,,"State estimation is a key element in today's power systems for reliable system operation and control. State estimation collects information from a large number of meter measurements and analyzes it in a centralized manner at the control center. Existing state estimation approaches were traditionally assumed to be able to tolerate and detect random bad measurements. They were, however, recently shown to be vulnerable to intentional false data injection attacks. This paper fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks, a special type of false data injection attacks, and analyzes their damage to power system operation in different time steps with different attacking resource limitations. Based on damaging effect analysis, we differentiate two attacking goals from the adversary's perspective, i.e., immediate attacking goal and delayed attacking goal. For the immediate attacking goal, this paper identifies the most damaging LR attack through a max-min attacker-defender model. Then, the criterion of determining effective protection strategies is explained. The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested on a 14-bus system. To the author's best knowledge, this is the first work of its kind, which quantitatively analyzes the damage of the false data injection attacks to power system operation and security.

9820,,Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has been proposed as a way to increase the adoption rate of electric vehicles (EVs). Unidirectional V2G is especially attractive because it requires little if any additional infrastructure other than communication between the EV and an aggregator. The aggregator in turn combines the capacity of many EVs to bid into energy markets. In this work an algorithm for unidirectional regulation is developed for use by an aggregator. Several smart charging algorithms are used to set the point about which the rate of charge varies while performing regulation. An aggregator profit maximization algorithm is formulated with optional system load and price constraints analogous to the smart charging algorithms. Simulations on a hypothetical group of 10 000 commuter EVs in the Pacific Northwest verify that the optimal algorithms increase aggregator profits while reducing system load impacts and customer costs.,WOS:000208787400014,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Sortomme, E. and El-Sharkawi, M.

Our algorithm is a power network adaption of the worst configuration heuristics, originally developed to study low probability events in physics and failures in error-correction. One finding is that, if the normal operational mode of the grid is sufficiently healthy, the failure modes, also called instantons, are sufficiently sparse, i.e., the failures are caused by load fluctuations at only a few buses.

This paper proposes the concept, architecture, and the customer incentives for implementing a new demand-side management system called Online Purchase Electricity Now (OPEN). The new system allows customers to directly order the electricity via the Internet as if purchasing a book online. Utility companies, after consolidating the customers' orders, decide an optimal generation and distribution scheme to satisfy customers' demands. The time epoch between the customers' order and the actual generation acts as the lead time during which virtual energy will be scheduled for production. Such a virtual energy provisioning system can improve the reliability and stability of the electric grid which is increasingly integrated with distributed energy resources.

In microgrid power systems, pulsed loads are particularly problematic since the total system inertia is finite. Examples include ships and aircraft with high-power radars, pulsed weapons, and electromagnetic launch and recovery systems. In these systems, energy is collected from the system over a finite time period, locally stored, and then rapidly utilized. Herein, a new strategy to accommodate these loads is presented.

9873,,"In order to design an efficient communication scheme and examine the efficiency of any networked control architecture in smart grid applications, we need to characterize statistically its information source, namely the power grid itself. Investigating the statistical properties of power grids has the immediate benefit of providing a natural simulation platform, producing a large number of power grid test cases with realistic topologies, with scalable network size, and with realistic electrical parameter settings. The second benefit is that one can start analyzing the performance of decentralized control algorithms over information networks whose topology matches that of the underlying power network and use network scientific approaches to determine analytically if these architectures would scale well. With these motivations, in this paper we study both the topological and electrical characteristics of power grid networks based on a number of synthetic and real-world power systems. The most interesting discoveries include: the power grid is sparsely connected with obvious small-world properties; its nodal degree distribution can be well fitted by a mixture distribution coming from the sum of a truncated geometric random variable and an irregular discrete random variable; the power grid has very distinctive graph spectral density and its algebraic connectivity scales as a power function of the network size; the line impedance has a heavy-tailed distribution, which can be captured quite accurately by a clipped double Pareto lognormal distribution.

Such technologies are useful, but reactive in nature, performing their function only after a fault occurs and an outage has been detected. They must presume that nonfaulted feeder sections and alternative feeders are healthy and capable of carrying increased power flow. Research at Texas A&M University has demonstrated that sophisticated, automated real-time analysis of feeder electrical waveforms can be used to predict failures and assess the health of distribution lines and line apparatus. Reliability can be substantially improved by detecting, locating, and repairing incipient failures before catastrophic failure, often before an outage occurs. Requirements for data and computation are substantially greater than for devices like digital relays and power-quality meters, but feasible with modern electronics.
