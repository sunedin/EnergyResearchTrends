4,"This paper proposes a predictive segmentation technique for identifying sub-groups in a large population that are both homogeneous with respect to certain patterns in customer attributes, and predictive with respect to a desired outcome. Our motivation is creating a highly-interpretable and intuitive segmentation and targeting process for customers of energy utility companies that is also optimal in some sense. In this setting, the energy utility wants to design a small number of message types to be sent to appropriately-chosen customers who are most likely to respond to different types of communications. The proposed method uses consumption, demographics, and program enrollment data to extract basic predictive patterns using standard machine learning techniques. We next define a feasible potential assignment of patterns to a small number of segments described by expert guidelines and hypotheses about consumer characteristics, which are available from prior behavioral research. The algorithm then identifies an optimal allocation of patterns to segments that is feasible and maximizes predictive power. This is formulated as maximizing the minimum enrollment rate from across the segments, which is then expressed as solving a mixed-integer linear-fractional program. We propose a bisection-based method to quickly solve this program by means of identifying feasible sets. We exemplify the methodology on a large-scale dataset from a leading U.S. energy utility, and obtain segments of customers whose likelihood of enrollment is more than twice larger than that of the average population, and that are described by a small number of simple, intuitive rules. The segments designed this way achieve a 2-3 x improvement in the probability of enrollment over the overall population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

12,"Demand response (DR) is becoming increasingly important as the volatility on the grid continues to increase. Current DR approaches are predominantly completely manual and rule-based or involve deriving first principles based models which are extremely cost and time prohibitive to build. We consider the problem of data-driven end-user DR for large buildings which involves predicting the demand response baseline, evaluating fixed rule based DR strategies and synthesizing DR control actions. The challenge is in evaluating and taking control decisions at fast time scales in order to curtail the power consumption of the building, in return for a financial reward. We provide a model based control with regression trees algorithm (mbCRT), which allows us to perform closed-loop control for DR strategy synthesis for large commercial buildings. Our data-driven control synthesis algorithm outperforms rule-based DR by 17% for a large DoE commercial reference building and leads to a curtailment of up to 380 kW and over $45,000 in savings. Our methods have been integrated into an open source tool called DR-Advisor, which acts as a recommender system for the building's facilities manager and provides suitable control actions to meet the desired load curtailment while maintaining operations and maximizing the economic reward. DR-Advisor achieves 92.8-98.9% prediction accuracy for 8 buildings on Penn's campus. We compare DR-Advisor with other data driven methods and rank 2nd on ASHRAE's benchmarking data-set for energy prediction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

18,"Monitoring is a crucial aspect of geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration risk management. Effective monitoring is critical to ensure CO2 is safely and permanently stored throughout the life-cycle of a geologic CO2 sequestration project. Effective monitoring involves deciding: (i) where is the optimal location to place the monitoring well(s), and (ii) what type of data (pressure, temperature, CO2 saturation, etc.) should be measured taking into consideration the uncertainties at geologic sequestration sites. We have developed a filtering-based data assimilation procedure to design effective monitoring approaches. To reduce the computational cost of the filtering-based data assimilation process, a machine-learning algorithm: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines is used to derive computationally efficient reduced order models from results of full-physics numerical simulations of CO2 injection in saline aquifer and subsequent multi-phase fluid flow. We use example scenarios of CO2 leakage through legacy wellbore and demonstrate a monitoring strategy can be selected with the aim of reducing uncertainty in metrics related to CO2 leakage. We demonstrate the proposed framework with two synthetic examples: a simple validation case and a more complicated case including multiple monitoring wells. The examples demonstrate that the proposed approach can be effective in developing monitoring approaches that take into consideration uncertainties.",WOS:000438181000023,Appl Energ,"Chen, B.

25,"High-fidelity and computationally efficient energy forecasting models for building systems are needed to ensure optimal automatic operation, reduce energy consumption, and improve the building's resilience capability to power disturbances. Various models have been developed to forecast building energy consumption. However, given buildings have different characteristics and operating conditions, model performance varies. Existing research has mainly taken a trial-and-error approach by developing multiple models and identifying the best performer for a specific building, or presumed one universal model form which is applied on different building cases. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a generalized system framework which can recommend appropriate models to forecast the building energy profiles based on building characteristics. To bridge this research gap, we propose a meta-learning based framework, termed Building Energy Model Recommendation System (BEMR). Based on the building's physical features as well as statistical and time series meta-features extracted from the operational data and energy consumption data, BEMR is able to identify the most appropriate load forecasting model for each unique building. Three sets of experiments on 48 test buildings and one real building were conducted. The first experiment was to test the accuracy of BEMR when the training data and testing data cover the same condition. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 90% of the buildings. The second experiment was to test the robustness of the BEMR when the testing data is only partially covered by the training data. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 83% of the buildings. The third experiment uses a real building case to validate the proposed framework and the result shows promising applicability and extensibility. The experimental results show that BEMR is capable of adapting to a wide variety of building types ranging from a restaurant to a large office, and gives excellent performance in terms of both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency.

Using this approach it is possible to obtain an optimal set of switches to open/close, in order to restore power to the loads, such that the weighted sum of the power delivered to the loads is maximized. This approach differs significantly from other methods previously studied for reconfiguration as it is a dynamic technique that produces not only the final reconfiguration, but also the correct order in which the switches are to be changed.

32,"EnergyPlus is the U.S. Department of Energy's flagship whole-building energy simulation engine and provides extensive simulation capabilities. However, the computational cost of these capabilities has resulted in annual building simulations that typically requires 2-3 min of wall-clock time to complete. While EnergyPlus's overall speed is improving (EnergyPlus 7.0 is 25-40% faster than EnergyPlus 6.0), the overall computational burden still remains and is the top user complaint. In other engineering domains, researchers substitute surrogate or approximate models for the computationally expensive simulations to improve simulation and reduce calibration time. Previous work has successfully demonstrated small-scale EnergyPlus surrogate models that use 10-16 input variables to estimate a single output variable. This work leverages feed forward neural networks and Lasso regression to construct robust large-scale EnergyPlus surrogate models based on 3 benchmark datasets that have 7-156 inputs. These models were able to predict 15-min values for most of the 80-90 simulation outputs deemed most important by domain experts within 5% (whole building energy within 0.07%) and calculate those results within 3 s, greatly reducing the required simulation runtime for relatively close results. The techniques shown here allow any software to be approximated by machine learning in a way that allows one to quantify the trade-off of accuracy for execution time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

39,"With the growing wind penetration into the power system worldwide, improving wind power forecasting accuracy is becoming increasingly important to ensure continued economic and reliable power system operations. In this paper, a data-driven multi-model wind forecasting methodology is developed with a two-layer ensemble machine learning technique. The first layer is composed of multiple machine learning models that generate individual forecasts. A deep feature selection framework is developed to determine the most suitable inputs to the first layer machine learning models. Then, a blending algorithm is applied in the second layer to create an ensemble of the forecasts produced by first layer models and generate both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. This two-layer model seeks to utilize the statistically different characteristics of each machine learning algorithm. A number of machine learning algorithms are selected and compared in both layers. This developed multi-model wind forecasting methodology is compared to several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated to provide 1-hour-ahead Wind speed forecasting at seven locations of the Surface Radiation network. Numerical results show that comparing to the single-algorithm models, the developed multi-model framework with deep feature selection procedure has improved the forecasting accuracy by up to 30%.

Theoretical analysis based on multi-parametric programming theory points out the unique one-to-one mapping between load and LMP vectors.

58,"Buildings are the dominant source of energy consumption and environmental emissions in urban areas. Therefore, the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop ''sensor based'' approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly, 10 min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit) granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model. Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In addition to implications for the development of residential energy forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices. Ultimately, accurate and cost effective wide-scale energy prediction is a vital step towards next-generation energy efficiency initiatives, which will require not only consideration of the methods, but the scales for which data can be distilled into meaningful information.

59,"A fault detection, identification, and location approach is proposed and studied in this paper. This approach is based on matching pursuit decomposition (MPD) using Gaussian atom dictionary, hidden Markov model (HMM) of real-time frequency and voltage variation features, and fault contour maps generated by machine learning algorithms in smart grid (SG) systems. Specifically, the time-frequency features are extracted by MPD from the frequency and voltage signals, which are sampled by the frequency disturbance recorders in SG. A hybrid clustering algorithm is then developed and used to cluster the frequency and voltage signal features into various symbols. Using the symbols, two detection HMMs are trained for fault detection to distinguish between normal and abnormal SG operation conditions. Also, several identification HMMs are trained under different system fault scenarios, and if a fault occurs, the trained identification HMMs are used to identify different fault types. In the meantime, if the fault is detected by the detection HMMs, a fault contour map will be generated using the feature extracted by the MPD from the voltage signals and topology information of SG.

64,"The ability to non-intrusively identify people will enable smart buildings to customize the environment to meet occupants' comfort level while saving energy. Occupant identification can help in energy savings effort in a building because we can retrieve each occupant's temperature preference profile and choose the temperature that minimizes the total discomfort of a group in the building. To enable occupant identification in buildings, many methods used can be intrusive, such as using cameras or requiring the users to carry mobile gadgets or a smart phone. Non-intrusive techniques are gaining interest in smart building applications. In this paper, we present a non-intrusive ultrasonic based sensing technique to identify people by sensing their body shape and movement. The ultrasonic sensors are placed on the top and sides of doors to measure the height and width as the occupant walks through the instrumented doorway. Height and width and their related features can give a unique signature to occupants to identify them. In this study, the proposed system senses a stream of height and width data, recognizes the walking event when a person walks through the door, and extracts features that capture a person's movement as well as physical shape. These features are fed to a clustering algorithm that associates each occupant with a distinct cluster. The system was deployed for a total of three months. The results show that the proposed approach achieves 95% accuracy with 20 occupants suggesting the suitability of our approach in commercial building settings. In addition, the results show that using girth to distinguish between occupants is more successful than using height. We show that this system generalizes beyond our datasets and works for different populations of different physical distributions.",WOS:000432884500061,Appl Energ,"Khalil, N., Benhaddou, D., Gnawali, O. and Subhlok, J.","Univ Houston, 4800 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77004 USA",44,Jun 15,0306-2619,,Applied Energy,occupant identification,Appl Energ,sensor networks,smart buildings,clustering,machine learning,recognition,system,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Gg7nh,814-828,96,Journal Article,Nonintrusive ultrasonic-based occupant identification for energy efficient smart building applications,0,Nonintrusive ultrasonic-based occupant identification for energy efficient smart building applications,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000432884500061,220,2018,,Univ Houston,USA
69,"Many cities across the United States have turned to building energy disclosure (or benchmarldng) laws to encourage transparency in energy efficiency markets and to support sustainability and carbon reduction plans. In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1 million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2 kbtuisf and for residential buildings is 31.2 kbtu/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings- those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall- are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability.

71,"Decision tree based machine learning methods find a great deal of application in power system reliability assessment studies, wherein essential knowledge in the form of operating rules or guidelines are produced that help operators maneuver the system away from insecurity. Independent test sets are generally used to validate these rules, with the motivation of estimating their classification accuracy and error rates, apart from checking their performance against some interesting situations. This paper proposes an importance sampling based method to generate intelligent test set for validating operating rules. The method is applied for testing decision tree rules derived against voltage collapse problems in western regions of the French power system, and is seen to produce test sets at lesser computation that estimates the rule's classification errors with good accuracy.

73,"As the number of renewable energy generation units and, consequently, solid-state based converters increases in the power grid, many power electronics concepts should be integrated into power system analysis and design. Thus, a power laboratory course with emphasis on the nexus between power electronics and power system is desired. However, the flexibility of instructors in designing a wide range of educational experiments is limited by the use of specialized educational setups. This problem can be resolved by allowing students to assemble their setups using laboratory scaled-down devices; however, implementation times can limit students to focus on the main concepts of the experiments. In particular, lacking experience with hardware description languages to develop switching patterns and control schemes for solid-state based converters further increases the implementation times. In this paper, a technique for rapidly implementing switching patterns and control schemes for power converters is proposed. This technique provides an easy-to-use laboratory allowing students to focus on reinforcing the theory learned in energy conversion, motor-drive, power electronics, and power system classes while still providing instructors with the flexibility to design a wide range of educational experiments.",WOS:000375774200042,Ieee T Power Syst,"Lamb, J., Singh, A. and Mirafzal, B.","Kansas State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Manhattan, KS 66520 USA",16,Jul,0885-8950,4,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,fpga applications in power laboratory,Ieee T Power Syst,power engineering education,solid-state based power converters,electric machines,electronics,education,systems,build,lab,,,,,,,,,,,English,Dl6ue,2957-2964,43,Journal Article,Rapid Implementation of Solid-State Based Converters in Power Engineering Laboratories,8,Rapid Implementation of Solid-State Based Converters in Power Engineering Laboratories,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000375774200042,31,2016,,Kansas State Univ,USA
74,"This paper introduces a potential learning scheme that can dynamically predict the stability of the reconnection of subnetworks to a main grid. As the future electrical power systems tend toward smarter and greener technology, the deployment of self sufficient networks, or microgrids, becomes more likely. Microgrids may operate on their own or synchronized with the main grid, thus controlmethods need to take into account islanding and reconnecting of said networks. The ability to optimally and safely reconnect a portion of the grid is not well understood and, as of now, limited to raw synchronization between interconnection points. A support vector machine (SVM) leveraging real-time data from phasor measurement units is proposed to predict in real time whether the reconnection of a subnetwork to the main grid would lead to stability or instability. A dynamics simulator fed with preacquired system parameters is used to create training data for the SVM in various operating states. The classifier was tested on a variety of cases and operating points to ensure diversity. Accuracies of approximately 85% were observed throughout most conditions when making dynamic predictions of a given network.",WOS:000418776400061,Ieee T Power Syst,"Lassetter, C., Cotilla-Sanchez, E. and Kim, J.","Oregon State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",34,Jan,0885-8950,1,Ieee Transactions on Power Systems,islanding,Ieee T Power Syst,machine learning,microgrid,reconnection,synchrophasor,power-system,analysis tools,networks,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Fr0tm,691-700,32,Journal Article,A Learning Scheme for Microgrid Reconnection,0,A Learning Scheme for Microgrid Reconnection,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000418776400061,33,2018,,Oregon State Univ,USA
77,"While there are growing interests in using pumped hydro storage to facilitate the integration of renewable resources, the flexibility of storage is not being fully utilized by existing energy and market management systems. Today, one common approach to operate pumped hydro storage is to determine schedules for a future time horizon based on a look-ahead operational planning stage, with limited adjustment in real-time. However, as renewable penetration levels increase, such approaches do not fully utilize the flexibility of pumped hydro storage. In this paper, a policy function approach is proposed to enhance the utilization of pumped hydro storage in real-time operations.

Inspired by the singular value perturbation theory, a bound on the change in the norm of the PC scores as a function of system state matrices is presented. It is shown that in the presence of bad data outliers these bounds for higher dimensional PC scores will be significantly larger compared to lower dimensions. The effect of the number of samples in the data window on the results of the analysis is established. Case studies on a simulated test system and on field data collected from a US utility are presented to support the analytical results.

91,"This paper introduces a novel method for single and simultaneous fault location in distribution networks by means of a sparse representation (SR) vector, Fuzzy-clustering, and machine-learning. The method requires few smart meters along the primary feeders to measure the pre- and during-fault voltages. The voltage sag values for the measured buses produce a vector whose dimension is less than the number of buses in the system. By concatenating the corresponding rows of the bus impedance matrix, an underdetermined set of equation is formed and is used to recover the fault current vector. Since the current vector ideally contains few nonzero values corresponding to fault currents at the faulted points, it is a sparse vector which can be determined by l(1)-norm minimization. Because the number of nonzero values in the estimated current vector often exceeds the number of fault points, we analyze the nonzero values by Fuzzy-c mean to estimate four possible faults. Furthermore, the nonzero values are processed by a new machine learning method based on the k-nearest neighborhood technique to estimate a single fault location. The performance of our algorithms is validated by their implementation on a real distribution network with noisy and noise-free measurement.",WOS:000359371600054,Ieee T Power Syst,"Majidi, M., Etezadi-Amoli, M. and Fadali, M.

The controller is trained offline to perform well under a wide variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural network based system identification eliminates the need to develop accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement units at generating stations within an area of the system. These representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the system ""seen"" by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with simulations of the system.

98,"An air handling unit's energy usage can vary from the original design as components fail or fault - dampers leak or fail to open/close, valves get stuck, and so on. Such problems do not necessarily result in occupant complaints and, consequently, are not even recognized to have occurred. In spite of recent progress in the research and development of diagnostic solutions for air handling units, there is still a lack of reliable, scalable, and affordable diagnostic solutions for such systems. Modeling limitations, measurement constraints, and the complexity of concurrent faults are the main challenges in air handling unit diagnostics. The focus of this paper is on developing diagnostic algorithms for air handling units that can address such constraints more effectively by systematically employing machine-learning techniques. The proposed algorithms are based on analyzing the observed behavior of the system and comparing it with a set of behavioral patterns generated based on various faulty conditions. We show how such a pattern-matching problem can be formulated as an estimation of the posterior distribution of a Bayesian probabilistic model.

100,"The world is rapidly urbanizing, and the energy intensive built environment is becoming increasingly responsible for the world's energy consumption and associated environmental emissions. As a result, significant efforts have been put forth to develop methods that can accurately model and characterize building energy consumption in cities. These models aim to utilize physics-based building energy simulations, reduced-order calculations and statistical learning methods to assess the energy performance of buildings within a dense urban area. However, current urban building energy models are limited in their ability to account for the inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors that can have a substantial impact on building energy use. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S) framework that integrates a network-based machine learning algorithm (ResNet) with engineering simulation to better understand how buildings consume energy on multiple temporal (hourly, daily, monthly) and spatial scales in a city (single building, block, urban). We validate the proposed DUE-S framework on a proof of concept case study of 22 densely located university buildings in California, USA. Our results indicate that the DUE-S framework is able to accurately predict urban scale energy consumption at hourly, daily and monthly intervals. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the integration of data-driven and engineering simulation approaches can partially capture the inter-building energy dynamics and impacts of the urban context and merits future work to explore how they can be improved to predict sub-urban scale energy predictions (single building, block). In the end, successfully predicting and modeling the energy performance of urban buildings has the potential to inform the decision-making of a wide variety of urban sustainability stakeholders including architects, engineers and policymakers.",WOS:000438181000090,Appl Energ,"Nutkiewicz, A., Yang, Z. and Jain, R.

102,"In recent years, many cities have adopted energy disclosure policies to better understand how energy is consumed in the urban built environment and how energy use and carbon emissions can be reduced. The diffusion of such policies has generated large-scale streams of building energy data, creating new opportunities to develop the fundamental science of urban energy dynamics. Nevertheless, there is limited research that rigorously analyzes building energy performance patterns over time. This paper provides a comprehensive framework to analyze building energy time series data and identify buildings with similar temporal energy performance patterns. We use data from approximately 15,000 properties in New York City, covering a six-year reporting period from 2011 to 2016. After pre-processing and merging the data for each constituent year, we use an unsupervised learning algorithm to optimally cluster the energy time series and statistical tests and supervised learning methods to infer how building characteristics vary between clusters. Our results show that energy reductions in New York City are mainly driven by its commercial building stock, with larger, newer, and higher value buildings demonstrating the largest improvements in energy intensity over the study period. Moreover, voluntary energy conservation schemes are found to be more effective in boosting energy performance of commercial properties, compared to residential buildings. Our results suggest two distinct temporal patterns of energy performance for commercial and residential buildings, characterized by energy use reductions and increases. This finding highlights the differential response to energy reporting and disclosure, and presents a more complex picture of energy use dynamics over time when compared to previous studies. In order to realize significant energy use improvements over time and reach energy and carbon reduction goals, cities need to design and implement comprehensive energy policy frameworks, bringing together information transparency and reporting with targeted mandates and incentives.",WOS:000433269000044,Appl Energ,"Papadopoulos, S., Bonczak, B. and Kontokosta, C.

105,"This work develops guidance and tools to understand the performance, improve the design, and simplify the evaluation of naturally ventilated low-rise commercial buildings in warm and hot climates. We conducted 50,000 detailed energy and airflow simulations in 427 locations across Brazil, varying 55 parameters representing building morphology, fenestration, construction properties, internal gains, operating times, wind modifiers, flowpaths, window control, and soil traits. Comfort performance was quantified by the average annual fraction of occupied hours that exceeded the upper limit of an adaptive comfort zone, and investigated with sensitivity analysis and machine learning methods. Results indicated that, after climate, building size (both footprint area and number of stories) and internal gains were most influential and were positively associated with discomfort. Adding air movement with ceiling fans and providing for night ventilation both proved highly effective comfort interventions. Except for roof solar absorptance, opaque envelope changes, including increasing insulation or thermal mass, had only marginal impacts. A support vector regression metamodel, requiring 29 easily obtainable inputs plus a weather file, was fit to the simulation results and successfully validated (R-2 = 0.97). The metamodel was developed as a simplified compliance path for naturally ventilated buildings to enhance Brazil's commercial building performance labeling program, which, because it currently provides such a path only for air conditioned buildings, may discouraging decision-makers from considering even more efficient passive solutions. We use a case study to show how the metamodel, which we will distribute publicly, can also serve as a design tool, and demonstrate that modifying a small set of parameters can drastically improve thermal performance and achieve sustainable comfort in hot and warm climates.

106,"This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of >= 1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to longterm prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building's schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building's load profiles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi layered perceptron model.",WOS:000425200700027,Appl Energ,"Rahman, A., Srikumar, V. and Smith, A.

107,"Building energy consumption makes up 40% of the total energy consumption in the United States. Given that energy consumption in buildings is influenced by aspects of urban form such as density and floor-area-ratios (FAR), understanding the distribution of energy intensities is critical for city planners. This paper presents a novel technique for estimating commercial building energy consumption from a small number of building features by training machine learning models on national data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). Our results show that gradient boosting regression models perform the best at predicting commercial building energy consumption, and can make predictions that are on average within a factor of 2 from the true energy consumption values (with an r(2) score of 0.82). We validate our models using the New York City Local Law 84 energy consumption dataset, then apply them to the city of Atlanta to create aggregate energy consumption estimates. In general, the models developed only depend on five commonly accessible building and climate features, and can therefore be applied to diverse metropolitan areas in the United States and to other countries through replication of our methodology.",WOS:000416300400068,Appl Energ,"Robinson, C., Dilkina, B., Hubbs, J., Zhang, W.

111,"Controlled islanding refers to the controlled separation of an interconnected power system into electrically isolated regions. The objective of this paper is to develop adaptive controlled islanding as a component of an emergency power system control strategy. There are two primary aspects of controlled islanding: 1) where to island and 2) when to island? Assisted by a decision tree (DT) approach, this paper seeks to address the ""when to island"" aspect. A decision tree based tool is proposed to recognize conditions existing in the system that warrant controlled islanding. A 29-generator, 179-bus system is employed to demonstrate the tool. Simulation data are used to train DTs, and the online performance of DTs is then evaluated as part of a controlled islanding strategy.",WOS:000241839700037,Ieee T Power Syst,"Senroy, N., Heydt, G.

112,"Time-of-use electricity pricing is touted as one of the solutions toward optimal load distribution in the future of smart grid. However, the benefits of such an approach are limited as human electricity usage can often be described as inelastic in nature, or not sensitive to pricing in economic theory. Water heating constitutes one of the largest components of such usage. This paper proposes technology to enable residential water heating to be converted from an inelastic to an elastic demand, which would respond to pricing incentives. This is accomplished by utilizing consumer hot water use patterns combined with thermal storage to calculate a user-specific temperature profile. Results demonstrated that such an approach could not only reduce electrical water heating costs significantly and allow for realization of large-scale grid benefits, but also improve customer experience as thermal storage capability would enable more hot water to be delivered at times of peak consumption.",WOS:000372014900005,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Shah, J.

115,"The U.S. wholesale power market comprises a large commodity market. The growth in power trading is due to the ongoing deregulation policy of the electric power industry. Most deregulation scenarios indicate a further separation of power production from transmission and retailing. The power production is opened to more competition. Unfortunately, the power trading mechanism is not clearly investigated in the level that we can predict a price change in the U.S. wholesale power market. Such a price change in the U.S. wholesale power market is explored from a simulation system with learning capabilities. Using the new intelligence system, we investigate the bidding strategies of traders in the wholesale power market and examine how the price change occurs under different economic and engineering environments.",WOS:000231001900016,Ieee T Power Syst,"Sueyoshi, T. and Tadiparthi, G.

Three important findings are identified in this research. First, the proposed approach can estimate fluctuations of electricity prices as well as other well-known methods such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. Second, multiple learning capabilities incorporated in adaptive agents do not have an advantage over limited learning capabilities in predicting the market price of electricity. Finally, a theoretical extension of multiple learning capabilities may have potential for developing the agent-based approach for power trading.",WOS:000246271100004,Ieee T Power Syst,"Sueyoshi, T. and Tadiparthi, G.

140,"Conventional wide-area control strategies that are deployed to damp inter-area oscillations use fixed a priori schemes based on modal analysis of the power system. As these controllers cannot be tuned online, such schemes fail to perform well during severe dynamic system changes. In this paper, a wide-area control architecture designed based on reinforcement learning and optimal adaptive critic network is proposed, that learns and optimizes the system closed-loop performance. Also, a value priority scheme is designed using a derived Lyapunov energy function for prioritization of local and the proposed wide-area global controller which ensures coherent damping of local and inter-area oscillations. The method increases the reliability and allows for automatic tuning of stabilizing controllers especially in the presence of wide-area monitoring constraints. Simulation results on 8-bus 5-machine and 68-bus 16-machine IEEE test systems highlight the efficiency of the proposed method.",WOS:000425530800005,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Yousefian, R. and Kamalasadan, S.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Power Energy & Intelligent Syst Lab, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",31,Mar,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,global wide-area control,Ieee T Smart Grid,lyapunov energy function,value priority,transient stability,real-time implementation,interarea oscillations,stabilizing control,damping controller,adaptive-control,control-system,design,communication,networks,pss,,,,,,English,Fw7ul,552-563,5,Journal Article,Energy Function Inspired Value Priority Based Global Wide-Area Control of Power Grid,0,Energy Function Inspired Value Priority Based Global Wide-Area Control of Power Grid,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000425530800005,9,2018,,Univ N Carolina,USA
141,"The increasing integration of distributed energy resources calls for new planning and operational tools. However, such tools depend on system topology and line parameters, which may be missing or inaccurate in distribution grids. With abundant data, one idea is to use linear regression to find line parameters, based on which topology can be identified. Unfortunately, the linear regression method is accurate only if there is no noise in both the input measurements (e.g., voltage magnitude and phase angle) and output measurements (e.g., active and reactive power). For topology estimation, even with a small error in measurements, the regression-based method is incapable of finding the topology using nonzero line parameters with a proper metric. To model input and output measurement errors simultaneously, we propose the error-in-variables model in a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for joint line parameter and topology estimation. While directly solving the problem is NP-hard, we successfully adapt the problem into a generalized low-rank approximation problem via variable transformation and noise decorrelation. For accurate topology estimation, we let it interact with parameter estimation in a fashion that is similar to expectation-maximization algorithm in machine learning. The proposed PaToPa approach does not require a radial network setting and works for mesh networks. We demonstrate the superior performance in accuracy for our method on IEEE test cases with actual feeder data from Southern California Edison.",WOS:000436009500075,Ieee T Power Syst,"Yu, J.
