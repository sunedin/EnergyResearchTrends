0,"In this paper, proper scheduling of the operation of multiple storage devices is sought so as to minimize the expected total cost (of conventional generation) in a power network with intermittent renewable generation. Since the power network constraints make it intractable to compute optimal storage operation policies through dynamic programming-based approaches, a Lyapunov optimization-based online algorithm (LOPN) is proposed, which makes decisions based only on the current state of the system (i.e., the current demand and renewable generation). The proposed algorithm is computationally simple and achieves asymptotic optimality (as the capacity of energy storage grows large). To improve the performance of the LOPN algorithm for the case with limited storage capacity, a threshold-based energy storage management (TESM) algorithm is proposed that utilizes the forecast information (on demand and renewable generation) over the next few time slots to make storage operation decisions. Numerical experiments are conducted on IEEE 6- and 9-bus test systems to validate the asymptotic optimality of LOPN, and compare the performance of LOPN and TESM. Numerical results show that TESM significantly outperforms LOPN when the storage capacity is relatively small.",WOS:000379696800035,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Lakshminarayana, S., Xu, Y. J., Poor, H.

1,"A major challenge to implementing residential demand response is that of aligning the objectives of many households, each of which aims to minimize its payments and maximize its comfort level, while balancing this with the objectives of an aggregator that aims to minimize the cost of electricity purchased in a pooled wholesale market. This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of households with a mixture of discrete and continuous energy levels. A distinctive feature of the method in this paper is that the non-convex demand response (DR) problem is decomposed in terms of households as opposed to devices, which allows incorporating more intricate couplings between energy storage devices, appliances, and distributed energy resources. The proposed method is a fast distributed algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The method is tested on systems with up to 2560 households, each with 10 devices on average. The proposed algorithm is designed to terminate in 60 iterations irrespective of system size, which can be ideal for an on-line version of this problem. Moreover, numerical results show that with minimal parameter tuning, the algorithm exhibits a very similar convergence behavior throughout the studied systems and converges to near-optimal solutions, which corroborates its scalability.",WOS:000379696800034,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Mhanna, S., Chapman, A.

2,"This paper gives a comprehensive discussion on applying the cloud computing technology as the new information infrastructure for the next-generation power system. First, this paper analyzes the main requirements of the future power grid on the information infrastructure and the limitations of the current information infrastructure. Based on this, a layered cloud-based information infrastructure model for next-generation power grid is proposed. Thus, this paper discussed how different categories of the power applications can benefit from the cloud-based information infrastructure. For the demonstration purpose, this paper develops three specific cloud-enabled power applications. The first two applications demonstrate how to develop practical compute-intensive and data-intensive power applications by utilizing different layered services provided by the state-of-the-art public cloud computing platforms.

3,"This paper proposes a framework for contingency management using smart loads, which are realized through the emerging paradigm of the Internet of things. The framework involves the system operator, the load serving entities (LSEs), and the end-users with smart home management systems that automatically control adjustable loads. The system operator uses an efficient linear equation solver to quickly calculate the load curtailment needed at each bus to relieve congested lines after a contingency. Given this curtailment request, an LSE calculates a power allowance for each of its end-use customers to maximize the aggregate user utility. This large-scale NP-hard problem is approximated to a convex optimization for efficient computation. A smart home management system determines the appliances allowed to be used in order to maximize the user's utility within the power allowance given by the LSE. Since the user's utility depends on the near-future usage of the appliances, the framework provides the Welch-based reactive appliance prediction (WRAP) algorithm to predict the user behavior and maximize utility. The proposed framework is validated using the New England 39-bus test system. The results show that power system components at risk can be quickly alleviated by adjusting a large number of small smart loads. Additionally, WRAP accurately predicts the users' future behavior, minimizing the impact on the aggregate users' utility.",WOS:000379696800037,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ciavarella, S., Joo, J.

5,"Many critical infrastructures are interdependent networks in which the behavior of one network impacts those of the others. Despite the fact that interdependencies are essential for the operation of critical infrastructures, such interdependencies can negatively affect the reliability and fuel the cascade of failures within and across the networks. In this paper, a novel interdependent Markov-chain framework is proposed that enables capturing interdependencies between two critical infrastructures with the ultimate goal of predicting their resilience to cascading failures and characterizing the effects of interdependencies on system reliability. The framework is sufficiently general to model cascading failures in any interdependent networks; however, this paper focuses on the electric-cyber infrastructure as an example. Using this framework it is shown that interdependencies among reliable systems, i.e., systems with exponentially distributed failure sizes, can make the individually reliable systems behave unreliably as a whole with power-law failure-size distributions.",WOS:000379696800025,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Rahnamay-Naeini, M. and Hayat, M.

6,"Electric vehicles (EVs) can be considered as flexible mobile battery storages in microgrids. For multiple microgrids in an area, coordinated scheduling on charging and discharging are required to avoid power exchange spikes between the multi-microgrid system and the main grid. In this paper, a two-stage integrated energy exchange scheduling strategy for multimicrogrid system is presented, which considers EVs as storage devices. Then, several dual variables, which are representative of the marginal cost of proper constraints, are utilized to form an updated price, thereby being a modification on the original electricity price. With this updated price signal, a price-based decentralized scheduling strategy is presented for the microgrid central controller. Simulation results show that the two-stage scheduling strategy reduces the electricity cost and avoids frequent transitions between battery charging/discharging states. With the proposed decentralized scheduling strategy, each microgrid only needs to solve its local problem and limits the total power exchange within the safe range.",WOS:000379696800001,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Wang, D., Guan, X.

7,"The decarbonization of transport and heating will introduce uncertain smart appliance growth in the power system, which fundamentally challenges traditional network pricing. In this paper, a new long-term distribution network charging is proposed to accommodate uncertain load growth. Instead of using fixed a load growth rate (LGR), it adopts a fuzzy model, developed based on a set of projected deterministic LGRs and confidence levels. This fuzzy model is incorporated into the pricing model through a-cut intervals. In order to improve computational efficiency, an analytical pricing approach is introduced. The vertex extension approach is used to build charge membership functions. Thereafter, a common defuzzification approach, center of gravity, is employed to defuzzify membership functions in order to generate deterministic charges. The new approach is benchmarked with two existing standard charging methods on a practical U.K. high-voltage distribution system.

8,"In this paper, we focus on the problems of load scheduling and power trading in systems with high penetration of renewable energy resources (RERs). We adopt approximate dynamic programming to schedule the operation of different types of appliances including must-run and controllable appliances. We assume that users can sell their excess power generation to other users or to the utility company. Since it is more profitable for users to trade energy with other users locally, users with excess generation compete with each other to sell their respective extra power to their neighbors. A game theoretic approach is adopted to model the interaction between users with excess generation. In our system model, each user aims to obtain a larger share of the market and to maximize its revenue by appropriately selecting its offered price and generation. In addition to yielding a higher revenue, consuming the excess generation locally reduces the reverse power flow, which impacts the stability of the system. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the energy expenses of the users. The proposed algorithm also facilitates the utilization of RERs by encouraging users to consume excess generation locally rather than injecting it back into the power grid.",WOS:000379696800004,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Samadi, P., Wong, V.

The proposed controller based on feedback linearization control theory relies on receiving timely phasor measurement unit (PMU) information from selected parts of the power grid to employ fast acting flywheels that are situated near synchronous generators. The local storage devices aim to balance a swing equation model of the synchronous generator to drive the associated rotor speed to stability. The advantages of the proposed controller include that it is tunable and integrates well with existing governor controls in contrast to other forms of PMU-based control. Further, a comparison is drawn between the proposed controller and recently proposed nonlinear controllers for transient stabilization.

It is demonstrated that if measurements are falsified by an attacker, voltage violation can occur in the system. However, by equipping the control with a detection algorithm, we verify that the damage can be limited especially when the number of attacked sensors is small through theoretical analysis and simulation case studies.

11,"Monitoring critical infrastructures is highly dependent on the accuracy of the installed sensors and the robustness of estimation algorithms. Data-injection attacks can degrade the operational reliability and security of any cyber-physical infrastructures. An attacker can compromise the integrity of the monitoring algorithms by hijacking a subset of sensor measurements and sending manipulated readings. Such approach can result in wide-area blackouts in power grids. This paper considers several cases of severe data-injections with high probabilities of information loss. To achieve an accurate supervision, a Bayesian-based approximated filter (BAF) has been proposed at each monitoring node using a distributed architecture. To maintain a reduced communication overhead and time complexity, upper and lower bound methods have been developed. The performance of the proposed technique has been demonstrated in a mature synchrophasor application known as the oscillation detection. Two test cases have been generated to examine the immunity of the proposed estimation scheme in New Zealand and Oman power grids. The tests were conducted in the presence of harsh data-injection attacks and multiple system disturbances.

Thereafter, we consider a probabilistic traffic model for modeling delays in any typical wide-area communication network, and study how the delays enter the process of information exchange between distributed phasor data concentrators that are employed to execute this consensus algorithm in a coordinated fashion. Finally, we propose four different strategies by which the convergence rate and accuracy of this consensus algorithm can be made immune to the asynchrony resulting from the network traffic.

For the envisioned application domain, nonlinear power-flow constraints render pertinent OPF problems nonconvex and computationally intensive for large systems. To address these concerns, we formulate a quadratic constrained quadratic program (QCQP) by leveraging a linear approximation of the algebraic power-flow equations.

A switched distributed controller is designed for each load bus in a transmission network. The targets of the designed controller are twofold. First, it makes controllable loads work together with generators to restore the system frequency quickly after a real power mismatch occurs in the grid. Second, it restores controllable loads to their nominal working conditions. To achieve the first target, a consensus-based distributed load-side controller is designed. Peer-to-peer communication between loads is used to achieve an average consensus according to which controllable load reacts to the frequency deviation. To achieve the second target, the load-side controller shifts its duties to AGC slowly after the frequency goes back into an ideal region, and hence, controllable loads will restore to their nominal conditions gradually.

In particular, the introduction of photovoltaic (PV) generation at the low voltage (LV) level has highlighted the ongoing need for more extensive and detailed modeling to quantify the full extent and nature of potential impacts. While a number of approaches have been developed to address the size of this problem, the most accurate and comprehensive approach is to carry out simulations for the entire network across multiple scenarios. However, this task is computationally complex and requires significant amounts of data.

20,"Severe peak rebounds are likely in absence of a system-wide coordination among customers participating in demand response programs. This paper aims to establish a decentralized system-wide framework to coordinate demand response of residential customers in a smart grid. The objective of the framework is to modify system load profile provided that customers' payments are minimized, and their comfort and privacy are preserved. Home load management (HLM) modules, embedded in customers' smart meters are autonomous agents of the framework. The energy service provider iteratively exchanges load information with HLM modules in the hope of achieving his desired load profile. In each iteration, the service provider announces system load profile to HLM modules. The modules, keeping in mind their own financial and comfort constraints, nonsequentially send back load reschedule proposals to modify system load profile. The received proposals are judged whether they improve system load profile or not. HLM modules with accepted proposals apply their proposed schedules. The modified system load profile is then released, and HLM modules' new proposals are gathered and judged. This procedure is repeated to the point at which no further improvement in the system load profile can be experienced.

The computations are collectively performed by processors embedded at each bus in the smart grid, using synchronized phasor measurements and communication of voltage phasors between neighboring buses. Our algorithms provably converge to the proper index values as would be calculated using centralized information, but do not require any central decision maker for coordination.

22,"Transient stability controller design based on an optimality principle is an emerging approach for resolving high order contingencies that can otherwise lead to rotor angle instability. It is difficult to design for high order contingencies due to their complexity. A challenging issue is the nonlinearity of the system, which limits the selection approaches available and results in a potentially large search space to find a suitable control action. Because rotor angle instability evolves rapidly, a fast control response is required. This paper develops a cost-based controller under the constraint of bounded computation. A method to downsize the admissible control search space is developed in a manner that retains controls most likely to provide the best cost. Subsequently, a further reduction in computation is designed through model elimination. A set of common cost metrics is applied for all controllers. Tradeoffs between the model-based and model-free approaches are demonstrated.

This paper studies the issue of providing QoS in terms of packet delay, packet error probability, and outage probability to a large number of sensors and smart meters in a neighborhood area network of a densely populated urban area. We assume the network is based on the IEEE 802.15.4g Standard. Given that bandwidth is limited, we propose to divide smart meters into groups and each group will take a turn to access a shared wireless channel in a time-division-multiplexing manner. Within each allocated time duration, a group of smart meters will compete for channel access using a simple slotted Aloha protocol. We have developed an analytical model to quantify the QoS metrics. Through the analytical model, we can determine the minimum concentrator density that is required to support a given smart meter density. We have verified the analytical model through simulations. The results show that we need less than ten concentrators per km(2) to support a node density of 500 units per km(2), while making sure that packet delay does not exceed 1.0 s, packet error probability is below 0.005 and outage probability is lower than 0.01.",WOS:000379696800014,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kong, P.

25,"Power system topology control through transmission line switching for economic gains and reliability benefits has been recently considered in day to day operations. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation for a more efficient application of topology control strategies in real world scenarios with anticipated increase in the presence of highly variable renewable generation and uncertain loads. Such uncertainties are modeled via the point estimation method embedded into the dc optimal power flow-based formulations for optimal switching solutions. Hourly and daily advantages of the proposed probabilistic framework, compared with the conventional operations and deterministic formulations, are discussed. As the anticipated economic gains would increase through sequential implementation of several switching actions, a new probabilistic decision making approach to identify the optimal number of switching actions at each hour is also proposed. This decision support tool uses the probabilistic reliability cost/value analytics in which not only the financial benefits, but also the costs of reliability risks, are taken into account.

We first design a pinning-based frequency/voltage controller containing a distributed voltage observer and then design a consensus-based active/reactive power controller, which are employed into the secondary control stage to generate the nominal set points used in the primary control stage for different distributed generators (DGs). By this approach, the frequencies and the weighted average value of all DGs' voltages can be pinned to the desired values while maintaining the precise active and reactive power sharing. With the proposed scheme, each DG only needs to communicate with its neighbors intermittently, even if their communication networks are local and time-varying, and their variant delays may be non-uniform. Sufficient conditions on the requirements for the network connectivity and the delay upper bound that guarantee the stability and reliability of the microgrid are presented.

27,"In the past two decades the frequent occurrences of large scale blackouts and catastrophic events has reduced the reliability of power grid to a great extent. A thorough analysis of the propagation of failures, in terms of line outages, combined with the topological characteristics of the grid aids, has been done to take corrective actions to save the system from complete collapse. It also helps to investigate the progress and understand the nature and intensity of blackouts. This motivates to establish the relationship between the network topological characteristics and cascading failure in the power grid. In this paper, the basic topological characteristics of the power network are studied in detail and the average propagation of failure under varying topological conditions is calculated as a branching process parameter. The variation in the mean propagation is studied in detail using a number of test bed networks with the alternate realistic networks derived from the standard IEEE networks imitating the real network conditions. The results confirm a qualitative agreement between the variations in topological parameter and the failure propagation rate in the cascading regime.

28,"Data injection attacks have emerged as a significant threat on the smart power grid. By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can manipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic benefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such works assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or defense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with multiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study the interactions between the defender and the attackers, two game models are considered. In the first, a Stackelberg game is proposed in which the defender acts as a leader that can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers, before deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties of the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the equilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited system information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In the second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot anticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, a hybrid satisfaction equilibrium-Nash equilibrium game is proposed. To find the equilibrium of this hybrid game, a search-based algorithm is introduced. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to illustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and defender. The results show that by defending a very small set of measurements, the grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks have no effect on the system. Moreover, the results also show how, at equilibrium, multiple attackers can play a destructive role toward each other by choosing to carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected. In addition, the obtained equilibrium strategies under the Stackelberg and the hybrid models are compared while characterizing the amount of loss that the defender endures due to its inability to anticipate the attackers' actions.",WOS:000379696800029,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Sanjab, A. and Saad, W.","Virginia Tech, Wireless VT Res Grp, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",21,10.1109/Tsg.2016.2550218,Jul,1949-3053,4,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,data injection attacks,smart grid security,game theory,stackelberg equilibrium,satisfaction equilibrium,nash equilibrium problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Dr1wy,2038-2049,14189,Journal Article,Data Injection Attacks on Smart Grids With Multiple Adversaries: A Game-Theoretic Perspective,0,Data Injection Attacks on Smart Grids With Multiple Adversaries: A Game-Theoretic Perspective,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000379696800029,7,2016

In this setting, optimal centralized attack construction strategies are studied. The decentralized case is examined in a game-theoretic setting. A novel utility function is proposed to model this trade-off and it is shown that the resulting game is a potential game. The existence and cardinality of the corresponding set of Nash equilibria of the game is analyzed. Interestingly, the attackers can exploit the correlation among the state variables to facilitate the attack construction.

Recognizing the practical limitations of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, which would be natural to apply in this context, we investigate two practical mechanisms that can be viewed as extensions of second price auction mechanisms and have limited message (bid) complexity. In the first mechanism, the elastic-supply multi-level second price, each PEV agent submits a number of price bids, one for each of a given set of energy levels (energy quantities). In the second mechanism, the elastic-supply progressive second price, the PEV agents submit a 2-D bid indicating the price as well as the desired energy quantity.

The integration of Hi-RAM into investment formulation allows for certain What-If investment scenario analysis on the use of advanced technologies, new plug-ins, and consumer response to power price fluctuations, and more. To demonstrate the significance of coupling of DER investment decisions and DSM strategies, three scenarios are presented.

This competitive environment motivates the use of a third-party (cloud-computing) platform that combines information from each provider and jointly optimizes resources in the entire grid. Since the power system structure and component values are confidential, the third-party computing platform must be either absolutely secure or information needs to be masked before sharing with the third party. In this paper, we propose an approach to obfuscate the sensitive information and solve the multi-party AC optimal power flow problem in a shared computing platform.

This paper studies the blackout case in the Indian power grid due to voltage collapse in the inter-regional corridor. First, the computer simulation models are tuned to match responses from the phasor measurement units at various locations in the grid. The inter-area mode with the frequency of 0.3 and 0.5 Hz with reduced damping were observed and resulted due to switching actions that occurred during the disturbance. This paper simulates the complex power grid network for various loading conditions of Northern region using power system simulator for engineering. Further, the system variables are analyzed using Prony method to estimate the inter-area mode for different NR loading conditions. The eigen values associated with the 0.3 Hz mode depict the movement from open left half plane into open right half plane with a slight increase in the parameter indicating ""hopf bifurcation.""

The regulation contractual framework requires that a regulation unit declares its regulation parameters at the beginning of the contract, the operator guarantees that the regulation signals will be within the range of these parameters, and the regulation unit is rewarded proportionally to what it declares and what it supplies. We study how this service can be provided by a unit with a non-ideal storage. We consider two broad classes of storage technologies characterized by different state of charge evolution equations, namely batteries and flywheels. We first focus on a single contract, and obtain formulas for the upward and downward regulation parameters that a unit with either a battery or a flywheel should declare to the operator to maximize its reward. We then focus on a multiple contract setting and show how to analytically quantify the reward that such a unit could obtain in successive contracts. We quantify this reward using bounds and expectation, and compare our analytical results with those obtained from a dataset of real-world regulation signals.

At the same time, they are increasing their renewable penetration and, therefore, risk for electric utilities. Integrating stochastic energy resources in noninterconnected systems may take advantage of an intelligent and optimized risk-averse unit commitment (UC) model. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic UC model with high renewable penetration including reserve requirements for the efficient management of uncertainty. In order to account for the uncertainty around the true outcomes of load, wind, and photovoltaic (PV) generation, a minimum conditional value at risk term has been included in the model formulation. A stochastic measure of the value of the stochastic solution is used to evaluate the benefits of using stochastic programming.

In the proposed method, the reference voltage of the EXS is considered as the input signal, while the terminal voltage and output active power of the machine are considered as output signals. The desired parameters are classified into three categories using a sensitivity analysis: 1) the parameters that affect the terminal voltage; 2) the parameters that affect the active power; and 3) the parameters that do not considerably affect either. A multistage genetic algorithm optimization is used to iteratively identify the parameters.

42,"Large-scale lithium-ion battery packs are widely adopted in systems such as electric vehicles and energy backup in power grids. Due to factors such as manufacturing difference and heterogeneous discharging conditions, cells in the battery pack may have different statuses, such as diverse voltage levels. This cell diversity is commonly known as the cell imbalance issue. For the charging of battery packs, the cell imbalance not only early on terminates the charging process before all cells are fully charged, but also leads to different desired charging currents among cells. In this paper, based on the advancement in reconfigurable battery systems, we demonstrate how to utilize system reconfigurability to mitigate the impact of cell imbalance on an efficient charging process. With the proposed reconfiguration-assisted charging (RAC), cells in the system are categorized according to their real-time voltages, and the charging process is performed in a category-by-category manner. To charge cells in a given category, a graph-based algorithm is presented to charge cells with their desired charging currents, respectively. We evaluate RAC through both experiments and simulations.

43,"The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the smart grid provides real-time information to both grid operators and customers, exploiting the full potential of demand response (DR). However, it introduces new privacy threats to customers. Prior works have proposed privacy-preserving methods in the AMI, such as temporal or spatial aggregation. A main assumption in these works is that fine-grained data do not need to be attributable to individuals. However, this assumption does not hold in incentive-based demand response (IDR) programs where fine-grained metering data are required to analyze individual demand curtailments, and hence, need to be attributable. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for IDR programs in the smart grid, which enables the DR provider to compute individual demand curtailments and DR rewards while preserving customer privacy. Moreover, a customer can reveal his/her identity and prove ownership of his/her power usage profile in certain situations, such as legal disputes.

50,"Microgrids have emerged as an alternative to alleviate increasing energy demands. However, because microgrids are primarily based on nonconventional energy sources (NCES), there is high uncertainty involved in their operation. The aim of this paper is to formulate a robust energy management system (EMS) for a microgrid that uses model predictive control theory as the mathematical framework. The robust EMS (REMS) is formulated using a fuzzy prediction interval model as the prediction model. This model allows us to represent both nonlinear dynamic behavior and uncertainty in the available energy from NCES. In particular, the uncertainty in wind-based energy sources can be represented. In this way, upper and lower boundaries for the trajectories of the available energy are obtained. These boundaries are used to derive a robust formulation of the EMS. The microgrid installed in Huatacondo was used as a test bench. The results indicated that, in comparison with a nonrobust approach, the proposed formulation adequately integrated the uncertainty into the EMS, increasing the robustness of the microgrid by using the diesel generator as spinning reserve. However, the operating costs were also slightly increased due to the additional reserves.

53,"Regulation service (RS) reserves, a critical type of bi-directional capacity reserves, are provided today by expensive and environmentally unfriendly centralized fossil fuel generators. This paper investigates provision of RS reserves by the demand side. We consider a smart building operator that is capable of modulating the aggregate consumption of the building loads via price signals in response to an unanticipated RS signal that an independent system operator broadcasts. We first model the RS signal and load behavior, and formulate the related stochastic dynamic programming (DP) problem. Then, in order to deal with the complexity of the DP problem resulting from the uncountably infinite allowable price set, we characterize certain key properties of the DP dynamics, solve the DP problem for a discretized price policy to observe the structure of the optimal policy and re-capture the continuous price policy in an analytic approximate policy iteration (API) algorithm using the above properties and structure.

In theory, the apparent power feed-in of these PV systems should be equal to the active power feed-in. Observations in distribution grids have shown a reactive power flow caused by these systems. The main purpose is, if this influence has to be considered in grid planning and power system management in smart grids. Therefore, measurement data of several low voltage grids is used. Three different scenarios for the unintended reactive power are simulated. Under normal operating conditions, the unintended reactive power is not relevant. Nevertheless, if voltage or overload problems are not explainable, they can be a result of the unintended reactive power flow.

55,"Inspired by induction machines working principles, this paper presents the idea of phase-locked-loop-less (PLL-less) operation of grid-connected voltage source converters (VSCs) under new concept of inducverter. The proposed controller eliminates the need for a dedicated synchronization process and the related PLL, and therefore it offers a simpler and more reliable control strategy compared to the conventional methods. In addition, it represents an improved performance, as it provides real and true auto-start and auto-synchronization with a grid without the need for grid voltage information. A current damping/synchronization unit enables grid auto-synchronization by using local current information and can track grid voltage frequency, angle, and amplitude variations while feeding constant amount of power, which is of high-interest in frequency varying grids and also in the case of grid voltage angle jump. Another advantage of the inducverter is that it introduces virtual inertia to the grid to regulate frequency, which enhances frequency dynamics of smart grids. Beside the current synchronization unit, the proposed strategy has a single-loop controller core with control over both power and current, which is implemented in a hybrid dq and abc frame using a virtual adaptive lead or lag impedance. The controller also offers stable and high-performance synchronization and operation under unbalanced and/or distorted grid conditions. The work beside synchronous current converters gives a bird's eye view to research in the new area of PLL-less and virtual inertia-based operation of VSCs and fulfill a unified set of controllers for the smart grid integration.

56,"Due to the high-measuring cost, the monitoring of power quality (PQ) is nontrivial. This paper is aimed at reducing the cost of PQ monitoring in power network. Using a real-world PQ dataset, this paper adopts a learn-from-data approach to obtain a device latent feature model, which captures the device behavior as a PQ transition function. With the latent feature model, the power network could be modeled, in analogy, as a data-driven network, which presents the opportunity to use the well-investigated network monitoring and data estimation algorithms to solve the network quality monitoring problem in power grid. Based on this network model, algorithms are proposed to intelligently place measurement devices on suitable power links to reduce the uncertainty of PQ estimation on unmonitored power links. The meter placement algorithms use entropy-based measurements and Bayesian network models to identify the most suitable power links for PQ meter placement. Evaluation results on various simulated networks including IEEE distribution test feeder system show that the meter placement solution is efficient, and has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty of PQ values on unmonitored power links.",WOS:000374971000036,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ali, S., Wu, K., Weston, K. and Marinakis, D.","Univ Victoria, Dept Comp Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",19,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2442837,May,1949-3053,3,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,bayesian networks (bns),conditional entropy (ce),monte carlo (mc) simulations,power quality (pq) monitoring,state estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Dk5pb,1552-1561,14217,Journal Article,A Machine Learning Approach to Meter Placement for Power Quality Estimation in Smart Grid,0,A Machine Learning Approach to Meter Placement for Power Quality Estimation in Smart Grid,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000374971000036,7,2016
57,"Demand-side participation is now widely recognized as being extremely critical for satisfying the growing electricity demand in the U.S. The primary mechanism for demand management in the U.S. is demand response (DR) programs that attempt to reduce or shift demand by giving incentives to participating customers via price discounts or rebate payments. Utilities that offer DR programs rely on automated DR devices (ADRs) to automate the response to DR signals. The ADRs are faulty, but the working state of the ADR is not directly observable; one can, however, attempt to infer it from the power consumption during DR events. The utility loses revenue when a malfunctioning ADR does not respond to a DR signal; however, sending a maintenance crew to check and reset the ADR also incurs costs. In this paper, we show that the problem of maintaining a pool of ADRs using a limited number of maintenance crews can be formulated as a restless bandit problem, and that one can compute a near-optimal policy for this problem using Whittle indices. We show that the Whittle indices can be efficiently computed using a variational Bayes procedure even when the load-shed magnitude is noisy, and when there is a random mismatch between the clocks at the utility and at the meter. The results of our numerical experiments suggest that the Whittle-index-based approximate policy is within 4% of the optimal solution for all reasonably low values of the signal-to-noise ratio in the meter readings.",WOS:000374971000023,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Abad, C. and Iyengar, G.","Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",22,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2465834,May,1949-3053,3,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,automated demand response (adr),bayes procedures,dynamic programming,markov-processes,complexity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Dk5pb,1411-1419,14218,Journal Article,A Near-Optimal Maintenance Policy for Automated DR Devices,0,A Near-Optimal Maintenance Policy for Automated DR Devices,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000374971000023,7,2016

In contrast to mechanisms in prior works, which charge the agents based on their day-ahead allocation, the proposed mechanism charges the agents based on their day-ahead allocation and their actual consumption. The mechanism is proven to be asymptotically dominant strategy incentive compatible, weakly budget balanced, and fair in charging the agents. However, the proposed mechanism's payment function, which requires computing a marginal allocation problem for each agent, renders the mechanism intractable for a large number of household agents if it is computed centrally. Thus, a distributed implementation of the mechanism is proposed, in which the agents share the computational burden with the aggregator.

Using this index greatly facilitates the analysis and measurement of voltage/current controllability levels of distribution systems. Different types of DGs are allocated in the system to optimize the voltage/current controllability by using the defined index. The results are compared with those obtained through the conventional approach of DG allocation, which is based on the minimization of energy losses.

61,"Distributed control methods based on consensus algorithms have become popular in recent years for microgrid (MG) systems. These kind of algorithms can be applied to share information in order to coordinate multiple distributed generators within a MG. However, stability analysis becomes a challenging issue when these kinds of algorithms are used, since the dynamics of the electrical and the communication systems interact with each other. Moreover, the transmission rate and topology of the communication network also affect the system dynamics. Due to discrete nature of the information exchange in the communication network, continuous-time methods can be inaccurate for this kind of dynamic study. Therefore, this paper aims at modeling a complete dc MG using a discrete-time approach in order to perform a sensitivity analysis taking into account the effects of the consensus algorithm. To this end, a generalized modeling method is proposed and the influence of key control parameters, the communication topology, and the communication speed are studied in detail.

62,"Utilizing battery storage devices in plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) for grid support using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept is gaining popularity. With appropriate control strategies, the PEV batteries and associated power electronics can be exploited for solar photovoltaic (PV) impact mitigation and grid support. However, as the PEV batteries have limited capacity and the capacity usage is also constrained by transportation requirements, an intelligent strategy is necessary for an effective utilization of the available capacity for V2G applications. In this paper, a strategy for an effective utilization of PEV battery capacity for solar PV impact mitigation and grid support is proposed. A controllable charging/discharging pattern is developed to optimize the use of the limited PEV battery capacity to mitigate PV impacts, such as voltage rise during midday or to support the evening load peak. To ensure an effective utilization of the available PEV battery capacity when used for travel (which is the main usage of the PEVs) or when interventions in the charging operation is caused by passing clouds, a strategy for dynamic adjustments in PEV charging/discharging rates is proposed.

In each house, there are two types of demands, essential and flexible demands, where the flexible demands are further categorized into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant demands. The delay-sensitive demands have higher priority to be served than the delay-tolerant demands. Meanwhile, in order to decrease the delay of delay-tolerant demands, such demands are allowed to be upgraded to the high-priority queue (i.e., the same queue that serves the delay-sensitive demands) with a given probability. An optimization problem is then formulated to minimize the total electricity cost and the operation delay of flexible demands by obtaining the optimal energy management decisions. Based on adaptive dynamic programming, a centralized algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In addition, a distributed algorithm is designed for practical implementation and the neural network is employed to estimate the pricing or demands when such system information is not known.

This microgrid-like EV parking deck is a localized grouping of distributed generation (solar), energy storage (EV batteries), and load (EV charging load). Although EV parking decks can enable greater adoption of renewable energy sources by scheduling charging loads to coincide with periods of strong sun, the inherent intermittency of renewable energy resources and variable EV parking behaviors complicates the economic operation. In this paper, the proposed first stage of this framework provides the parking deck operators with a stochastic approach for dealing with the uncertainty of solar energy so as to make an optimal price decision (marginal electricity sale price and parking fee rebate) at the day-ahead time scale. The second stage introduces a model predictive control-based operation strategy of EV charging dealing with the uncertainty of parking behaviors within the real-time operation. Case studies demonstrate the better performance of the proposed framework, offering an effective day-ahead marginal electricity price for tomorrow's operation and increasing the microgrid-like EV parking deck's revenue during the real-time operation.",WOS:000374971000050,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Guo, Y., Xiong, J.

71,"In smart grid, customers have access to the electricity consumption and the price data via smart meters; thus, they are able to participate in the demand response (DR) programs. In this paper, we address the interaction among multiple utility companies and multiple customers in smart grid by modeling the DR problem as two noncooperative games: the supplier and customer side games. In the first game, supply function bidding mechanism is employed to model the utility companies' profit maximization problem. In the proposed mechanism, the utility companies submit their bids to the data center, where the electricity price is computed and is sent to the customers. In the second game, the price anticipating customers determine optimal shiftable load profile to maximize their daily payoff. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the mentioned games are studied and a computationally tractable distributed algorithm is designed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DR method in increasing the utility companies' profit and customers' payoff, as well as in reducing the peak-to-average ratio in the aggregate load demand.

74,"In order to reduce the energy cost of data centers, recent studies suggest distributing computation workload among multiple geographically dispersed data centers by exploiting the electricity price difference. However, the impact of data center load redistribution on the power grid is not well understood yet. This paper takes the first step toward tackling this important issue by studying how the power grid can take advantage of the data centers' load distribution proactively for the purpose of power load balancing. We model the interactions between power grid and data centers as a two-stage problem where the utility company chooses proper pricing mechanisms to balance the electric power load in the first stage and the data centers seek to minimize their total energy cost by responding to the prices in the second stage. We show that the two-stage problem is a bilevel quadratic program, which is NP-hard and cannot be solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We introduce benchmark problems to derive upper and lower bounds for the solution of the two-stage problem. We further propose a branch and bound algorithm to attain the globally optimal solution, and propose a heuristic algorithm with low computational complexity to obtain an alternative close-to-optimal solution. We also study the impact of background load prediction error using the theoretical framework of robust optimization.

75,"Microgrids are emerging as an important constituent of large-scale smart grids. They are equipped with the controls necessary for managing the operation in islanded or grid connected mode and serve the loads with clean, reliable, and uninterruptible power. Microgrid must be equipped with a robust grid synchronization (GS) algorithm so as to allow a smooth transfer from islanded mode to grid tied mode. This gets even more critical when the availability of the power grid is irregular or the power grid is weak. This paper proposes a simple yet highly reliable GS technique based on controller area network (CAN) communication. The grid synchronizer block senses the three phase grid voltages, derives the phase angle (theta) using synchronously rotating reference frame-based phase lock loop, and transmits this information on the CAN network to all microsources (MS). The local controller associated with each MS receives the data with small but known and definite time latencies. This allows each MS to energize simultaneously in synchronization with the grid, facilitating easy GS of all the MS, minimizing the time required for GS of the complete microgrid.

The first part of this paper is to simulate work of a fast charger activity by exploiting empirical data that characterize EV user behavior. The second part describes the time series obtained by this simulator and its properties. We show that the power load aggregated over a number of fast chargers (after deseasonalizing and elimination of the linear trend) is a self-similar process with the Hurst parameter 0.57 < H < 0.67, where H varies depending on the multiplexing level. The main contribution of this paper is empirical evidence that a fitted fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (fARIMA) model taking into account self-similarity of the load time series can yield high-quality short-term forecasts when H is large enough. Namely, the fitted fARIMA model uniformly outperforms regular ARIMA algorithms in terms of root-mean-square error for predictions with time horizon up to 120 min for H >= 0.639. Moreover, we show that the fARIMA advantage on average grows as a function of the Hurst exponent H.

The situation gets worsened by the harmonic resonance introduced by the installation of power factor correction (PFC) capacitor banks in the distribution network. At the same time, more and more renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG) units are being installed in the residential area. These DG systems can be used as an effective way to mitigate the harmonic related power quality problems introduced by the nonlinear residential loads. In literature, very limited work has been done to identify harmonic compensation priorities that should be assigned to different DGs operating at different locations of the distribution system for improved compensation performance. This issue is addressed in this paper. A selective harmonic compensation scheme based on modal analysis is developed to assign compensation priorities on DGs operating at different distribution system nodes for improved compensation performance. A modeled residential distribution system containing distribution components such as distribution line, PFC capacitors, transformers, and household appliances along with DG units is used to verify the improvement of compensation performance.

The computed power references are sent to the lower layer PEV and wind controllers for execution. The PEV controller optimally allots the aggregated charging power to individual PEVs. The wind controller regulates the power output of wind turbine. In this way, a power balance between supply and demand in a microgrid is achieved.

The charging problem is formulated as a generalized Nash game with shared global constraints, where the congestion constraint and renewable energy utility constraint that couple all participators' strategies serve as the global constraints and should be satisfied for all possible outcomes of uncertainty. The normalized Nash equilibrium (NNE) is used to characterize a fair charging decision among the participants. It is shown that when the commission fee charged by the aggregator is a convex function and proportionally shared by the consumers, the NNE can be efficiently computed from a particular convex optimization problem, and is noninferior if the commission fee function is separable in players.

84,"One of the well-known methods to share active and reactive power in microgrids (MGs) is droop control. A disadvantage of this method is that in steady state the frequency of the MG deviates from the nominal value and has to be restored using a secondary control system (SCS). The signal obtained at the output of the SCS is transmitted using a communication channel to the generation sources in the MG, correcting the frequency. However, communication channels are prone to time delays, which should be considered in the design of the SCS; otherwise, the operation of the MG could be compromised. In this paper, two new SCSs control schemes are discussed to deal with this issue: 1) a model predictive controller (MPC); and 2) a Smith predictor-based controller.

Different from most existing distributed methods, the private confidential information, such as gradient or incremental cost of each generator, is not required for the information exchange, which makes more sense in real applications. Besides, the proposed method not only handles quadratic, but also nonquadratic convex cost functions with arbitrary initial values.

90,"In a residential area where many households have installed rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units, there is a reverse power flow from the households to the substation when the power generation from PV units is larger than the aggregate load of the households. This reverse power flow causes the voltage rise problem. In this paper, we study the use of demand side management to mitigate the voltage rise problem. We propose an autonomous energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which schedules the operation of deferrable loads to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse power flow. The proposed algorithm shifts the operation of deferrable loads from peak consumption hours to hours with high-power generation from the PV units. We use stochastic programming to formulate an energy consumption scheduling problem, which takes into account the uncertainty related to the amount of power generation from PV units. The formulated cost function comprises a monetary cost for energy consumption, the revenue from energy export, and an external cost for the voltage rise. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can mitigate the voltage rise problem in areas with high penetration of PV units and reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load.",WOS:000374971000040,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Yao, E.

The main objective is to enable the residential units (RUs) to decide on the fraction of their ES capacity that they want to share with the SFCs of the community in order to assist them in storing electricity, e.g., for fulfilling the demand of various shared facilities. To this end, a modified auction-based mechanism is designed that captures the interaction between the SFCs and the RUs so as to determine the auction price and the allocation of ES shared by the RUs that governs the proposed joint ES ownership. The fraction of the capacity of the storage that each RU decides to put into the market to share with the SFCs and the auction price are determined by a noncooperative Stackelberg game formulated between the RUs and the auctioneer. It is shown that the proposed auction possesses the incentive compatibility and the individual rationality properties, which are leveraged via the unique Stackelberg equilibrium solution of the game.

While any deficit can be obtained from the market, buildings may consider selling their unused power back to the market.

We formulate the control problem as an optimization problem to be solved repeatedly by the aggregator in a model predictive control framework. To solve the large-scale control problem in real-time requires decomposition methods. We propose a decomposition method based on Douglas-Rachford splitting to solve this large-scale control problem. The method decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, e.g., locally by each unit connected to an aggregator. The total power consumption is controlled through a negotiation procedure between all cooperating units and an aggregator that coordinates the overall objective. For large-scale systems, this method is faster than solving the original problem and can be distributed to include an arbitrary number of units.

In the islanded mode, the objective of each MG is to maintain a reliable power supply to its customers. In order to take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs and load consumption, we formulate the problems as two-stage stochastic programs.

97,"Hybridization of energy storages (ESs) with different ramp rates helps minimization of system bus voltage variation and extension of ESs lifetime in dc microgrids. Hybrid ES system (HESS) control is normally realized with centralized coordination. In this paper, HESS distributed control, which is independent of the communication link, is proposed to enhance system reliability. All ESs are configured as slack terminals to regulate system bus voltage with droop control. System net power decomposition and ESs power sharing are realized with localized low-pass filter (LPF) applied to ESs with low-ramp rates. The relationship between LPF cut-off frequency and ES ramp rate is elaborated in detail. However, bus voltage deviation and power tracking errors are the main drawbacks of HESS distributed control. Multilevel energy management system (EMS) is thus proposed to enhance system control accuracy. HESS distributed control is scheduled as the primary control. Bus voltage restoration and power sharing compensation are applied in secondary control to eliminate the voltage deviation and power tracking errors, respectively. In tertiary control, autonomous state of charge (SoC) recovery is implemented to limit SoC variation of ES with high-ramp rate.

This paper proposes technology to enable residential water heating to be converted from an inelastic to an elastic demand, which would respond to pricing incentives. This is accomplished by utilizing consumer hot water use patterns combined with thermal storage to calculate a user-specific temperature profile.

Smart grids containing tens, or hundreds, of wind generators require skilled very-short-term forecasts to operate effectively and spatial information is highly desirable. In addition, probabilistic forecasts are widely regarded as necessary for optimal power system management as they quantify the uncertainty associated with point forecasts. Here, we work within a parametric framework based on the logit-normal distribution and forecast its parameters. The location parameter for multiple wind farms is modeled as a vector-valued spatio-temporal process and the scale parameter is tracked by modified exponential smoothing.

Two power management aspects are considered: 1) equal power sharing, which is realized via a proposed distributed equal power sharing algorithm; and 2) optimal power dispatch, which is achieved through a proposed distributed equal incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional advantage of the ability to restore the average system voltage to its nominal value. The proposed algorithms are based on the application of the average consensus theory along with voltage sensitivity analysis. Each distributed generation (DG) unit exchanges information with its neighbors, thus locally updating its no-load voltage setting to achieve the supervisory control objectives.

106,"This paper presents the design and implementation of an advanced battery management system (BMS). The basic concept is to divide each series battery array into sub-arrays where each battery is individually monitored and managed. The proposed BMS continuously monitors the voltage, current, and energy of each battery. Based on these measurements, the BMS can calculate individual state of charge (SoC) levels and C-rates. Furthermore, the system has the capability to isolate each individual battery to apply different charging profiles and advanced diagnostics to detect the correct problems. Pulsed charging is deployed using different duty cycles for SoC balancing. The isolated battery is bypassed to maintain uninterrupted supply to the load despite reduced series array voltage. An unidirectional dc-dc boost converter maintains a constant output voltage level to the load, regardless of the number of batteries connected, until the problem is corrected. A hardware implementation of the proposed BMS is explained in detail. The performance of the system is tested experimentally under different loading conditions, including heavy pulsed loads.",WOS:000372014900034,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Elsayed, A. T., Lashway, C.

107,"This paper proposes a novel measurement procedure for load flow analysis in medium voltage (MV) smart grids. The new approach is based on power measurements at low voltage (LV) side of MV/LV distribution substations. Such measurements are carried out by means of power quality analyzers. If compared with the load flow methods based on measurements at the MV side, the proposed approach has a lower cost and it offers an equally reliable measurement system. The proposed algorithm takes the basic concept of the current summation backward/forward method; some modifications are introduced to use LV load powers measurements. To this aim, the MV/LV power transformer is properly modeled and taken into account in the algorithm. The proposed approach is validated by means of both simulations and experimental measurements; the test system is the MV distribution grid of Ustica Island, Italy. First, the proposed algorithm is compared with the MATLAB/Simulink load flow tool, which is based on the traditional Newton-Raphson method. Second, a comparison is carried out between the proposed method and the measurement data collected in the actual MV network of Ustica.

Besides, the advances in smart grid technologies motivate the electricity utility companies toward developing demand response (DR) programs to influence the electricity usage behavior of the customers. In this paper, we modify the conventional DR programs in smart grid to develop an integrated DR (IDR) program for multiple energy carriers fed into an energy hub in smart grid, namely a smart energy (S.

Simulation results show that in addition to load shifting, the customers in the S.

In order to support secure communications between smart meters and service providers, key management for authentication becomes a crucial security topic. Recently, several key distribution schemes have been proposed to provide secure communications for smart grid. However, these schemes do not support smart meter anonymity and possess security weaknesses. This paper utilizes an identity-based signature scheme and an identity-based encryption scheme to propose a new anonymous key distribution scheme for smart grid environments. In the proposed scheme, a smart meter can anonymously access services provided by service providers using one private key without the help of the trusted anchor during authentication. In addition, the proposed scheme requires only a few of computation operations at the smart meter side.

For large storage populations, the problem can be approximated as a differential game with infinite players (mean field game). Through the resolution of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs), it is possible to determine, as a fixed point, the optimal feedback strategy for each player and the resulting price of energy if that strategy is applied. Once this price is calculated, it can be communicated to the devices, which are able to independently determine their optimal charge profile.

111,"This paper aims to set up a probabilistic framework to assess the value of a portfolio of demand response (DR) customers under both operational (short-term) and planning (long-term) uncertainties through real options (ROs) modeling borrowed from financial theory. In an operational setting, DR is considered as an RO contract allowing an aggregator seeking to maximize its revenue to sell flexible demand in the day-ahead market and balance its energy portfolio in the balancing markets. Sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS) are used to value DR activation decisions based on market price evolutions. These decisions combine DR physical characteristics and portfolio scheduling optimization, whereby the aggregator chooses to exercise only the contracts probabilistically leading to a profit, also considering the physical payback effects of load recovery. Sensitivity of profits to changing market conditions and payback characteristics is also assessed. In an investment setting, subject to long-term uncertainties, the value of an investment in DR-enabling technology is quantified through the Datar-Mathews RO approach that applies hybrid SMCS and scenario analysis. The results show how the flexibility value of DR can be highlighted by modeling it as RO, particularly in high volatile markets, and how realistic inclusion of payback characteristics significantly decrease the benefits estimated for DR. In addition, the proposed RO framework generally allows hedging of the risks incurred under long-term and short-term uncertainties.",WOS:000372014900031,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Schachter, J.

Nevertheless, the high complexity of the new smart grids has resulted in much uncertainty in the DFR problem that necessities the use of a sufficient stochastic framework to deal with them. In this way, this paper proposes a new stochastic framework based on cloud theory to account the uncertainties associated with multiobjective DFR problem from the reliability point of view. Cloud theory is constructed based on fuzzy theory and probability idea. In comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation method, cloud models can give more information on the uncertainties associated with the problem. This special aspect of cloud models makes it possible to integrate the fuzziness and randomness of qualitative concepts through the cloud drops and then transforms them to the quantitative model. In order to solve the proposed problem, a fast and powerful optimization technique is required.

Specifically, using the statistical information of wind farm generation extracted from historical data, a Markov chainbased distributional forecast model for wind farm generation is developed in a rigorous optimization framework, in which the diurnal nonstationarity and the seasonality of wind generation are accounted for by constructing multiple finite-state Markov chains for each epoch of 3 h and for each individual month. Based on this distributional forecast model, the joint optimization of ED and interruptible load management is cast as a stochastic optimization problem. Additionally, a robust ED is formulated using an uncertainty set constructed based on the proposed distributional forecast, aiming to minimize the system cost for worst cases. The proposed stochastic ED is compared with four other ED schemes: 1) the robust ED; 2) deterministic ED using the persistence wind generation forecast model; 3) scenario-based stochastic ED; and 4) deterministic ED, in which perfect wind generation forecasts are used.

The geo-distributed DCs are suitable candidates for the DR programs due to their huge energy consumption and flexibility to distribute their energy demand across time and location, whereas the price signal is well-known for DR programs to reduce the peak-to-average load ratio. There are two dependencies that make the pricing design difficult: 1) dependency among utilities; and 2) dependency between DCs and their local utilities. Our proposed pricing scheme is constructed based on a two-stage Stackelberg game in which each utility sets a real-time price to maximize its own profit in Stage I and based on these prices, the DCs' service provider minimizes its cost via workload shifting and dynamic server allocation in Stage II. For the first dependency, we show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium. For the second dependency, we propose an iterative and distributed algorithm that can converge to this equilibrium, where the ""right prices"" are set for the ""right demands.""

A complete characterization of the tradeoffs between consumer surplus and retail profit is obtained. The Pareto front of achievable tradeoffs is shown to be concave, and each point on the Pareto front is achieved by an optimal day-ahead hourly price.

However, those cyber components are creating new security vulnerabilities that could lead to significant disruptions if exploited maliciously. We propose a comprehensive cost model designed to assist in the selection of responses to malicious attacks on an advanced metering infrastructure. The cost model reflects the costs of response actions due to outages in the distribution grid, disruptions of the electricity market, and violations of contractual agreements among stakeholders. We also present a realistic implementation of the cost model using ArcGIS for topology generation and GridLAB-D for grid simulation.

125,"The integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources requires increased flexibility in the operation of the electric grid. Storage, broadly speaking, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over time; network, on the other hand, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over geographical locations. The optimal control of storage networks in stochastic environments is an important open problem. The key challenge is that, even in small networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control problems on continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality and are intractable in general settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is known to give optimal or provably near-optimal performance for this problem. This paper provides an efficient algorithm to solve this problem with performance guarantees. We study the operation of storage networks, i.e., a storage system interconnected via a power network. An online algorithm, termed online modified greedy algorithm, is developed for the corresponding constrained stochastic control problem. A sub-optimality bound for the algorithm is derived and a semidefinite program is constructed to minimize the bound. In many cases, the bound approaches zero so that the algorithm is near-optimal. A task-based distributed implementation of the online algorithm relying only on local information and neighborhood communication is then developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers.

128,"This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for a dc distribution system for power system integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The dc distribution system is intended to integrate electric vehicles in a parking lot with an ac grid through bidirectional dc-dc converters (battery chargers) and a central voltage-sourced converter. Using an online constrained optimization algorithm, the proposed EMS manages the power flow within the dc system. Thus, the PEV owners can charge or discharge their batteries based on the state-of-charge of the batteries and their upcoming trip plans. The EMS offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: 1) the fast energy exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange time; and 2) the optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues through selling their stored energy. The proposed EMS seamlessly handles all charging/discharging requests from the PEV owners with different options and, at the same time, it takes into account the power demand and power generation limits of the ac grid to preclude under-voltage, over-voltage, and reverse power flow issues.

129,"In the restructured power industry, demand responsiveness is a key factor whose importance will be boosted due to the impetus provided by the development of smart grids. Within the context of pool-based electricity markets, this paper addresses the incorporation of price-responsive demand in multiperiod energy scheduling driven by consumer payment minimization. Although consumer payment minimization has drawn considerable attention mainly in an operational setting and also recently under a planning framework, available models and solution approaches typically neglect demand-side participation. The proposed scheduling model considers a marginal pricing scheme as well as the effects of both network constraints and intertemporal constraints associated with generation operation. Modeling demand-side participation leads to bilinear payment terms that significantly increase the mathematical complexity of the optimization process. The resulting problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel program for which no exact solution technique is currently available. This paper presents a novel methodology by which the original bilevel and bilinear problem is converted into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear program suitable for efficient off-the-shelf software. This transformation is based on the application of duality theory of linear programming, integer algebra, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions.

130,"Price-based management of distributed energy resources within microgrids is continuously gaining ground due to scalability and privacy limitations of centralized architectures. However, the concentration of flexible loads' response to the lowest-priced periods yields inefficient solutions. A previously proposed measure imposing a flexibility restriction on flexible loads might raise acceptability and feasibility concerns by the users. This paper develops a novel fully price-based approach where this hard restriction is replaced by a soft nonlinear price signal. This signal is customized to the operating properties of the different flexible load types by penalizing the square of the demand and the duration of cycle delay of loads with continuously adjustable power levels and deferrable cycles, respectively. This approach is shown to produce more efficient solutions than the flexibility restriction measure for both types of loads. For the latter type, randomization of the nonlinear prices brings additional benefits, especially in low operating diversity cases.

However, small disturbances may occur during the changing process and eventually yield transient oscillation, thus the focus of microgrid control is how to switch smoothly within different operation modes. In order to improve the dynamic characteristics of an inverter-based microgrid, this paper derived a precise small-signal state-space model of the whole microgrid including droop controller, network, and loads. The key control parameters of the inverter and their optimum ranges, which greatly influence the damping frequency of oscillatory components in the transient response, can be obtained through eigenvalue analysis. In addition, genetic algorithm is introduced to search for optimal settings of the key parameters during time-domain simulation in MATLAB/Simulink.

It prioritizes the use of reactive power, while active power curtailment is performed only as a last resort. The behavior of the scheme is studied using dynamic simulations on a single LV feeder and on a larger network composed of 14 LV feeders. Its performance is compared with a centralized scheme based on the solution of an optimal power flow (OPF) problem, whose objective function is to minimize the active power curtailment.

135,"Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are being increasingly deployed to improve monitoring and control of the power grid due to their improved data synchronization and reporting rates in comparison with legacy metering devices. However, one drawback of their higher data rates is the associated increase in bandwidth (for transmission) and storage requirements (for data archives). Fortunately, typical grid behavior can lead to significant compression opportunities for phasor angle measurements. For example, operation of the grid at nearnominal frequency results in small changes in phase angles between frames, and the similarity in frequencies throughout the system results in a high level of correlation between phasor angles of different PMUs. This paper presents several methods for preprocessing of phasor angles that take advantage of these system characteristics, including a new method-frequency compensated difference encoding-that is able to significantly reduce angle data entropy. After the preprocessor stage, the signal is input to an entropy encoder, based on Golomb-Rice codes, that is ideal for high-throughput signal compression.

Moreover, each agent can also exchange information with its neighboring agents of the network. After information is processed according to control laws, agents adjust the production of DGs to which they connect. Further, a systematic method is presented, which can be used to derive a set of control laws for agents from any given communication network, after the rules to establish the communication network are given. Furthermore, it has been seen that the output power supplied by DGs satisfies the load demand in the MG when agents use the proposed control laws.

Results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can effectively reflect and affect user's consumption behavior and achieve the optimal cost-efficient energy consumption profile. For practical consideration, we also take into account the service fee and distributed energy resources (DERs) in our framework, and analyze their impacts on the cost efficiency.

141,"With sustained growth of intermittent power supplies connected to grid, the randomness and volatility of intermittent power supplies will bring new challenges to power system optimization dispatch. For dealing with the uncertainty of large-scale intermittent power supply, this paper introduces robust optimization theory into optimization dispatch for hybrid wind/photovoltaic/hydro/thermal power systems. Meanwhile in order to make an ideal compromise between reliability and economy of system dispatch, this paper also introduces concept of uncertainty to cover shortcoming of conventional robust optimization which is conservative. A flexible robust optimization with adjustable uncertainty budget dispatch model is built for hybrid power system to achieve coordination between reliability and economy, and then the uncertainty budget decision methods are studied to reduce blindness of uncertainty budget decisions. Moreover, a new compound differential evolution (CDE) algorithm is designed in this paper. The diversity of individuals and convergence speed are taken into account in process of differential evolution (DE) calculation by introducing a series of operations into DE algorithm, such as individual ranking, population dividing, CDE, and population restructuring.

142,"This paper proposes a framework for enabling the reliability-differentiated services in a residential distribution network with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). A reliability-differentiated pricing mechanism is developed to satisfy the different reliability requirements of the customers while encouraging the customers to consume electricity in such a way that the reliability of the overall distribution system can be enhanced. A dynamic spinning reserve pricing scheme is developed to stimulate PHEVs to participate in spinning reserve by providing economic benefits when the state of the distribution system becomes risky. Based on the formulated reliability-differentiated system, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to coordinate the charging process of PHEVs in a decentralized fashion. At the upper level of the hierarchical game, an evolutionary game is formulated to optimize the management of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity of each PHEV. Under the V2G strategies obtained from the evolutionary game, a noncooperative game is formulated at the lower level to coordinate the charging sequences of PHEVs. Various simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical game approach. The simulation results show that the hierarchical game approach is effective in enhancing both reliability of the distribution system and economic profits of the PHEVs.",WOS:000372014900014,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Tan, J. and Wang, L.

In the proposed control scheme, some microsources (diesel engine generator, micro turbine, and fuel cell) are assumed to be responsible for balancing the load and power in the MG system.

This paper proposes a strategy for coordinating the operation of multiple voltage regulating devices and DG units in medium voltage (MV) distribution systems, under structural changes and DG availability, for effective voltage control. The proposed strategy aids to minimize the operational conflicts by allowing voltage regulating devices to operate in accordance with the priority scheme designed based on the electrical-distance between voltage regulating devices and DG units, while maximizing the voltage support by the DG units.

Then, the host device estimates the line impedances based on its impedance model and the collected parameters. For practical implementation, the proposed method is built under several assumptions.

152,"The increasing impact of electric vehicles on distribution networks can be alleviated by smart charging-the shifting of electric vehicle load to times when there is available capacity in the network. This work presents a market mechanism for smart charging that optimally allocates available charging capacity in a way that ensures network stability, while at the same time allowing vehicles to express individual preferences regarding their charging rates. Those who want higher rates can receive these, but must pay a higher price. The mechanism takes into account network-specific constraints such as total network load, voltage drop, and phase unbalance. However, since vehicles have differing impacts on these constraints, this leads to unequal access to the available resources (i.e., charging capacity), resulting in an unfair market. An additional constraint can be introduced to level the playing field for all users, but it leads to a reduction in aggregate performance. The mechanism is shown to be efficient and strategy-proof, so users cannot gain an unfair advantage by misrepresenting their preferences.

This simultaneous approach may present challenges when the concerned network consists of different types of systems operated by different entities (independent system operator, transmission system operator, or utility).

159,"During the holidays, the power load of the East China Grid dropped significantly, resulting in excess capacitive reactive power, which makes the grid voltage increase significantly. For ultra-high voltage alternating current/direct current (UHVAC/DC) hybrid system, restricted by the minimum input number of the alternating current filter (ACF) in the dc converter stations, multiple dc stations that operate at a low-power transmission mode will inject a large capacitive reactive power to 500 kV ac grid, leading to a dramatic voltage rise. In addition, the 1000 kV UHVAC system may also transport a large capacitive reactive power to 500 kV ac grid during the holidays. In this paper, an optimal reactive power control strategy based on multi-dc power modulation has been proposed. It includes two steps. First, the minimized reactive power interchange control strategy which minimizes the reactive power interchange (RPI) between the UHVAC grid and the 500 kV ac grid has been executed. After that, if the grid voltage still exceeds the upper limit, the multi-dc power modulation is used to minimize the RPI between the dc converter stations and the 500 kV ac grid. The example analysis shows that the proposed optimal reactive power control strategy can effectively optimize the reactive power distribution in the UHVAC/DC hybrid system, thus reasonably controling the grid voltage.",WOS:000367299800040,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Miao, Y.

This paper proposes a low computational cost, but yet accurate method, to extract signatures for load classification and characterization. Instead of utilizing digital signal processing and frequency-domain analysis, this paper abstracts the similarity of voltage-current (V-I) trajectories between loads and proposes to map V-I trajectories to a grid of cells with binary values. Graphical signatures can then be extracted for many applications.

In case of utility grid fault, BIC is disabled and the system changes to operate in islanded state. Localized battery energy storage (BES) voltage regulation mode (VRM) operation is activated to maintain system power balance. Operating mode changes of BES and BIC during islanding and reconnection might result in system voltage fluctuations and undesirable inrush current. Detailed transition procedure, which is crucial, has seldom been discussed in literature. In this paper, multiple-slack-terminal dc microgrid, in which both BIC and BES operate in VRM with droop control, is implemented to ensure smooth transitions between grid-tied and islanded states. BES operating mode change is eliminated, and thus, system bus voltage is actively regulated throughout the transitions. Contactor is installed at BIC dc side to decouple BIC operating mode change and grid connection. A counter is used to ensure bus voltages at both sides of contactor have been matched stably to minimize inrush current.

Two operation models will be introduced in this paper: 1) VPP dispatch model; and 2) the game theoretic model for multiVPP dispatch. In the VPP dispatch model, considering interactive coordination between VPP and energy consumers, a demand response model based on time-of-use pricing mechanism and interruptible loads is employed. And then the optimal results of VPP dispatch model are applied in the game theoretic model for multiVPP dispatch. During the process of market competition, the bidding strategy of each VPP is determined by its affordable power output and fuel cost. To solve the inherent variability and unpredictability of the renewable generation sources, the multi-time scale rolling scheduling strategy is adopted. Finally, taking the multiVPP, which consists of various distributed generations and battery storage devices, as an example, variables including transferred load, compensation capacity, optimal bidding strategy, and profits for each VPP are obtained.

164,"In this paper, a two-stage procedure is proposed in order to solve the centralized self-healing scheme for electrical distribution systems. The considered self-healing actions are the reconfiguration of the distribution grid and, if needed, node and zone load-shedding. Thus, the proposed procedure determines the status of the switching devices in order to effectively isolate a faulty zone and minimize the number of de-energized nodes and zones, while ensuring that the operative and electrical constraints of the system are not violated. The proposed method is comprised of two stages. The first stage solves a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem in order to obtain the binary decision variables for the self-healing scheme (i.e., the switching device status and energized zones). In the second stage, a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem is solved in order to adjust the steady-state operating point of the topology found in the first stage (i.e., correction of the continuous electrical variables and load-shedding optimization).

175,"This paper proposes a transformative architecture for the normal operation and self-healing of networked microgrids (MGs). MGs can support and interchange electricity with each other in the proposed infrastructure. The networked MGs are connected by a physical common bus and a designed two-layer cyber communication network. The lower layer is within each MG where the energy management system (EMS) schedules the MG operation; the upper layer links a number of EMSs for global optimization and communication. In the normal operation mode, the objective is to schedule dispatchable distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems (ESs), and controllable loads to minimize the operation costs and maximize the supply adequacy of each MG. When a generation deficiency or fault happens in an MG, the model switches to the self-healing mode and the local generation capacities of other MGs can be used to support the on-emergency portion of the system. A consensus algorithm is used to distribute portions of the desired power support to each individual MG in a decentralized way. The allocated portion corresponds to each MG's local power exchange target, which is used by its EMS to perform the optimal schedule. The resultant aggregated power output of networked MGs will be used to provide the requested power support.

The method is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, a subgradient-based consensus algorithm is used to recover frequency. The equal increment rate criteria is incorporated into this algorithm to achieve a minimal regulating cost, obtained by economically distributing power among distributed energy resources. Control signals updated with latest local measurements are executed in each iteration step to speed up the frequency recovery procedure. In the second stage, an average consensus algorithm is applied to resolve frequency oscillations caused by measurement errors. Numerical tests are described to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method and its applicability in the presence of communication time delay is discussed.",WOS:000367299800004,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Wang, Z.

180,"Due to various green initiatives, renewable energy will be massively incorporated into the future smart grid. However, the intermittency of the renewables may result in power imbalance, thus adversely affecting the stability of a power system. Frequency regulation may be used to maintain the power balance at all times. As electric vehicles (EVs) become popular, they may be connected to the grid to form a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. An aggregation of EVs can be coordinated to provide frequency regulation services. However, V2G is a dynamic system where the participating EVs come and go independently. Thus, it is not easy to estimate the regulation capacities for V2G. In a preliminary study, we modeled an aggregation of EVs with a queueing network, whose structure allows us to estimate the capacities for regulation-up and regulation-down separately. The estimated capacities from the V2G system can be used for establishing a regulation contract between an aggregator and the grid operator, and facilitating a new business model for V2G. In this paper, we extend our previous development by designing a smart charging mechanism that can adapt to given characteristics of the EVs and make the performance of the actual system follow the analytical model.",WOS:000367299800017,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Lam, A.

181,"Integration of centralized wind farms may induce cascading tripping incidents, which brings about critical challenges to secure operation of power grid. One of the major risks is the lack of coordinated voltage/reactive power control for multiple wind farms. Therefore, a robust master-slave two-level coordinated static voltage security region (VSR) is proposed in this paper, along with detailed modeling of the network topology and wind farms to achieve coordination among wind farms. The slave VSR on the wind-farm-side is designed to guarantee the operation of each wind unit within a secure range in order to protect wind units from serious over-voltage and low-voltage problems, whereas the master system-wide VSR aims to coordinate centralized wind farms to ensure security both under normal operating conditions and N - 1 contingency conditions. Furthermore, a hierarchically iterative coordination method is introduced to compute the voltage security range of each wind farm through the iteration process. A modified six-bus system with two wind farms, a real system from Northern China, and a large system with 972 wind units are studied, and results verify the effectiveness of the proposed two-level VSR and the hierarchically iterative coordination method.",WOS:000367299800047,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ding, T., Bo, R., Sun, H.

Clustering has a number of potential advantages for DNOs, including the identification of suitable candidates for demand response and the improvement of energy profile modeling. However, due to the high stochasticity and irregularity of household-level demand, detailed analytics are required to define appropriate attributes to cluster. In this paper, we present in-depth analysis of customer smart meter data to better understand the peak demand and major sources of variability in their behavior. We find four key time periods, in which the data should be analyzed, and use this to form relevant attributes for our clustering. We present a finite mixture model-based clustering, where we discover ten distinct behavior groups describing customers based on their demand and their variability.

The technique, known as the peak ratio analysis method (PRAM), improves both sensitivity and stability of LOM protection when compared with prevailing techniques. The technique is based on a rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) measurement from M-class PMUs, but the key novelty of the method lies in the fact that it employs a new ""peak-ratio"" analysis of the measured ROCOF waveform during any frequency disturbance to determine whether the potentially-islanded element of the network is grid connected or not. The proposed technique is described and several examples of its operation are compared with three competing LOM protection methods that have all been widely used by industry and/or reported in the literature: standard ROCOF phase offset relay and phase angle difference methods. It is shown that the PRAM technique exhibits comparable performance to the others, and in many cases improves upon their abilities, in particular for systems where the inertia of the main power system is reduced, which may arise in future systems with increased penetrations of renewable generation and high voltage dc (HVDC) infeeds.",WOS:000367299800029,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ding, F., Booth, C.

187,"Stochastic time delay is a new challenge for communication networks in wide-area damping control (WADC) systems. Uncertainties introduced by stochastic time delays increase the difficulty of modeling, analyzing the stability, and designing the controller. In this paper, a new approach for stability analysis and controller design through expectation modeling is proposed to solve for the uncertainty in wide-area controlled power systems introduced by the effect of a stochastic time delay. In the proposed method, the expectation model that considers the detailed stochastic time delay distribution is derived to accurately model the effect of a communication network on the wide-area control performance. Through a matrix transformation of the expectation model, the eigenvalue of the WADC system that considers time delay can then be calculated; this eigenvalue can be used for analyzing the system stability. A novel expectation model-based controller design procedure is established, through which traditional methods can be applied in the controller design of a power system with a stochastic time delay.

Though energy storage system (ESS) can act as a main power source to maintain system frequency and voltage stability, traditional droop control is usually invalid in practice due to the resistive line of low/medium voltage MG. Virtual impedance control can be a solution to decouple the active and reactive power allocations among ESSs. However, the control bandwidth is reduced since it requires low-pass filters with reduced bandwidth to calculate the average active and reactive power. In this paper, a novel ESSs control method is proposed with V/f droop control (VFDC) and P/Q droop control (PQDC) combined. It can distribute the active and reactive power precisely since the interference of line parameters uncertainty is prevented and system stability is enhanced. The comparison between traditional droop and the hybrid VFDC/PQDC is analyzed based on equivalent circuits.

Based on some recent development on functional observers, novel distributed functional observers are designed, one at each local area, to implement any given global state feedback controller. The designed observers are of reduced order and dynamically decoupled from others in contrast to conventional centralized observer (CO)-based controllers. The proposed scheme can cope better against accidental failures than those CO-based controllers.

In this paper, the integration of these end-user reactive-power-capable devices is investigated to provide voltage support to the grid. Due to the limitation on the number of smart homes, at first, the effective locations for injecting the reactive power into the distribution system is determined (i.e., Q-C buses) and showed how reactive power resources connected at those buses can be controlled. For control purposes, centralized support distributed voltage control (CSDVC) algorithm is proposed and the distribution system is decomposed into different areas by using e-decomposition. Then Q-C buses, as the candidate buses, for providing reactive power are obtained. Optimum reactive power injection in every candidate bus in each area and tap position of the regulator, if necessary, is calculated by using genetic algorithm. The CSDVC is proposed to cover the inaccuracy of the loads forecasting and the control area centers faults, and also to provide secure reactive power control.

Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate.

Proposed MAS is composed of zone agents (ZAs), feeder agents (FAs), and substation agents. In this framework, ZA locate and isolate the fault based on the locally available information, and assist the FA for reconfiguration and restoration.

As the PV penetration rate increases, the intermittency and uncertainty of PV systems will cause frequency regulation issues. When rapid fluctuations take place, the system requires fast responding regulation to recover the frequency within a short period of time. Traditional power plants with slow dynamics are less capable of tracking the fast-changing regulation signal. In this context, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered as an effective regulation source to respond immediately to frequency deviations. This paper addresses the sizing issue of an aggregated BESS by a series of system level performance tests with different BESS penetration rates.

The functions of communication networks are embedded into dispatching data networks in China, thus we use dispatching data networks in the paper. The structures of dispatching data networks are generally categorized into two types: 1) double-star; and 2) mesh. The correlation of nodes in double-star networks and power systems is ""degree to degree,""whereas ""degree to betweenness"" is the correlation for mesh networks. Furthermore, the interactive model between power grids and dispatching data networks is presented by a dynamic power flow model. Taking the IEEE 39-bus system and China's Guangdong 500-kV system as examples, in the case of random attacks on the interdependent system, simulation results show that the power grid coupled with double-star dispatching data networks has lower probability of catastrophic failures than with the mesh structure, because the double-star dispatching data network has outstanding capability of delivering information even though some communication nodes are out of order. In contrast, under intentional attacks, the decrement of the transmission performance of the double-star network is more serious than that in the mesh network.

This paper presents a new demand response model with elastic economic dispatch in a locational marginal pricing market. It models system economic dispatch as a feedback control process, and introduces a flexible and adjustable load cost as a controlled signal to adjust demand response. Compared with the conventional ""one time use"" static load dispatch model, this dynamic feedback demand response model may adjust the load to a desired level in a finite number of time steps and a proof of convergence is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation and boundary calculation using interval mathematics are applied for describing uncertainty of end-user's response to an independent system operator's expected dispatch.

A charge/discharge control strategy is developed that will continuously balance and dynamically adjust the power exchange with the grid in a real time, and mitigate the neutral current and neutral voltage rise.

We suggest two different types of plans, including constant deviation plans (CDPs) and proportional deviation plans (PDPs). We define an adjustable reference temperature for both CDPs and PDPs to limit the output temperature of each thermostat load and to control the number of devices eligible to participate in demand response program. We model thermostat loads as power throttling devices and design algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan parameters on peak load reduction. Based on the simulation results, we recommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable thermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with similar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple power throttling states, customer engagement plans with less temperature deviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical ON/OFF control, higher temperature deviations are required to achieve similar amount of peak load reduction.

The basic components of the hybrid power system include conventional thermal generators, wind farm, and solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. A set of batteries is available for energy storage and/or discharge. The most critical problem in operating a wind farm or solar PV module is that these renewable energy resources cannot be dispatched in the same manner as conventional plants, because they involve climatic factors such as wind velocity and solar irradiation. This paper proposes the optimal scheduling strategy taking into account the impact of uncertainties in wind, solar PV, and load forecasts, and provides the best-fit DA schedule by minimizing both DA and real-time adjustment costs including the revenue from renewable energy certificates. This strategy consists of a genetic algorithm (GA)-based scheduling and a two-point estimate-based probabilistic real-time optimal power flow.

We focus on the multi-objective energy consumption scheduling problem based on the third-party management. The aim is to provide diverse, uniformly-distributed, and accurate solutions to the third-party decision-maker. The novel contribution of this paper is that it provides an exact choice in energy consumption scheduling.

However, equal power sharing does not guarantee an efficient operation of the whole system. In order to achieve higher efficiency and lower energy losses, this paper proposes a tertiary control level including an optimization method for achieving efficient operation. As the efficiency of each converter changes with the output power, VR values are set as decision variables for modifying the power sharing ratio among converters. A genetic algorithm is used in searching for a global efficiency optimum. In addition, a secondary control level is added to regulate the output voltage drooped by the VRs. However, system dynamics is affected when shifting up/down the VR references. Therefore, a secondary control for system damping is proposed and applied for maintaining system stability.

Simulation results are given that show the seamless transitions between the two modes without any disconnection times for the CC-VSIs and VC-VSIs connected to the microgrid.",WOS:000364040300016,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Micallef, A., Apap, M., Spiteri-Staines, C. and Guerrero, J.

229,"We consider the sequential (i.e., online) detection of false data injection attacks in smart grid, which aims to manipulate the state estimation procedure by injecting malicious data to the monitoring meters. The unknown parameters in the system, namely the state vector, injected malicious data and the set of attacked meters pose a significant challenge for designing a robust, computationally efficient, and high-performance detector. We propose a sequential detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio to address this challenge. Specifically, the proposed detector is designed to be robust to a variety of attacking strategies, and load situations in the power system, and its computational complexity linearly scales with the number of meters. Moreover, it considerably outperforms the existing first-order cumulative sum detector in terms of the average detection delay and robustness to various attacking strategies. For wide-area monitoring in smart grid, we further develop a distributed sequential detector using an adaptive sampling technique called level-triggered sampling. The resulting distributed detector features single bit per sample in terms of the communication overhead, while preserving the high performance of the proposed centralized detector.",WOS:000364040300015,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Li, S., Yilmaz, Y. and Wang, X.

230,"High levels of penetration of distributed generation and aggressive reactive power compensation may result in the reversal of power flows in future distribution grids. The voltage stability of these operating conditions may be very different from the more traditional power consumption regime. This paper focuses on the demonstration of multistability phenomenon in radial distribution systems with reversed power flow where multiple stable equilibria coexist for the given set of parameters. The system may experience transitions between different equilibria after being subjected to disturbances such as short-term losses of distributed generation or transient faults. Convergence to an undesirable equilibrium places the system in an emergency or in extremis state. Traditional emergency control schemes are not capable of restoring the system if it gets entrapped in one of the low voltage equilibria. Moreover, undervoltage load shedding may have a reverse action on the system and can induce voltage collapse. We propose a novel pulse emergency control strategy that restores the system to the normal state without any interruption of power delivery. The results are validated with dynamic simulations of IEEE 13-bus feeder performed with SystemModeler software. The dynamic models can also be used for characterization of the solution branches via a novel approach, so-called the admittance homotopy power flow method.",WOS:000364040300038,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Nguyen, H.

A unique aspect of this architecture is to include a distributed inductive engine for learning the local dynamics of generators and loads in the micro-grid.

232,"Distribution systems are undergoing many enhancements and developments to enable the future smart grid, and distribution system state estimation (DSSE) provides the control centers with the information necessary for several of its applications and operational functions. However, the quality of DSSE typically suffers from a lack of adequate/accurate measurements. Recently, many electric utilities have started to install fairly accurate smart meters throughout their distribution networks, which create an opportunity to achieve higher quality DSSE. However, the signals provided by smart meters are generally not synchronized and the difference between the measurement times of smart meters can be significant. Therefore, a complete snapshot of the entire distribution system may not be available. This paper proposes a method to deal with the issue of nonsynchronized measurements coming from smart meters based on the credibility of each available measurement and appropriately adjusting the variance of the measurement devices. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two IEEE benchmark systems are used.

233,"Smart grid, as the next generation of power grid characterized by ""two-way"" communications, has been paid great attention to realizing green, reliable, and efficient electricity delivery for our future lives. In order to support the two-way communications in smart grid, a large number of smart meters (SMs) should be deployed to customers to report their near real-time data to control center for monitoring purpose. However, this kind of real-time report could disclose users' privacy, bringing down the users' willingness to participate in smart grid. In order to address the challenge, in this paper, by considering the lifetime of SMs as exponential distribution, we propose a diverse grouping-based aggregation protocol with error detection (DG-APED), which employs differential privacy technique into grouping-based private stream aggregation for secure smart grid communications. DG-APED can not only achieve privacy-preserving aggregation, but also perform error detection efficiently when some SMs are malfunctioning. Detailed security analysis shows that DG-APED can guarantee the security and privacy requirements of smart grid communications.

This paper proposes a cross-layer detection mechanism to fight against simultaneous attacks toward multiple PMUs. In the physical layer, we propose a GPS carrier-to-noise ratio (C/No) based spoofing detection technique. We apply the patch-monopole hybrid antenna to two GPS receivers and compute the difference between the standard deviation of each receiver's C/No. The priori probability of spoofing is calculated from the distributions of the difference. A counter is embedded in the physical layer to identify the most suspicious PMU. In the upper layer, the spoofing attack is considered similarly to the bad data injection toward the power system. A trustworthiness evaluation, which is based on both the physical layer information and power grid measurements, is applied to identify the PMU being attacked.

We introduce a framework and algorithms to do so that minimize electricity and bandwidth cost subject to job indivisibility, deadlines, priorities, and DC resource constraints. In doing so, we provide a way for DC operators to predict their operational costs for different DC placements and capacities, and thus make informed decisions about how to expand their DC network. Our distributed algorithm uses estimated job arrivals and day-ahead electricity prices to optimize over sliding time windows. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a Google DC trace and investigate the effects of different cost and performance criteria. The algorithm leverages heterogeneous job resource requirements and routing and scheduling flexibility: even deadline and indivisibility constraints yield little cost increase, though they significantly improve job completion times and localization at only one DC, respectively.

239,"In this paper, a converter-based dc microgrid is studied. By considering the impact of each component in dc microgrids on system stability, a multistage configuration is employed, which includes the source stage, interface converter stage between buses, and common load stage. In order to study the overall stability of the above dc microgrid with constant power loads (CPLs), a comprehensive small-signal model is derived by analyzing the interface converters in each stage. The instability issue induced by the CPLs is revealed by using the criteria of impedance matching. Meanwhile, virtual-impedance-based stabilizers are proposed in order to enhance the damping of dc microgrids with CPLs and guarantee the stable operation. Since droop control is commonly used to reach proper load power sharing in dc microgrids, its impact is taken into account when testing the proposed stabilizers. By using the proposed stabilizers, virtual impedances are employed in the output filters of the interface converters in the second stage of the multistage configuration. In particular, one of the virtual impedances is connected in series with the filter capacitor, and the other one is connected at the output path of the converter. It can be seen that by using the proposed stabilizers, the unstable poles induced by the CPLs are forced to move into the stable region.

In order to seamlessly transfer from islanded to grid-connected modes, it is necessary to synchronize microgrid voltage and frequency, and phase to the main grid. However, since the microgrid is often based on power electronic converters, the synchronization process is quite different compared with the quasi-synchronism control in conventional power systems. First, in order to address this concern, the microgrid synchronization criteria are derived. Based on these criteria, a novel distributed active synchronization strategy is proposed, which takes into account not only the fundamental component, but also positive and negative sequences of the harmonic components.

This paper aims at establishing a decentralized model for the optimal dispatch of DERs in smart grids. The objective function is to minimize expected procurement cost of demand while profit of private DER owners is not sacrificed. Unit management modules (UMMs) embedded in private DERs and a central agent are autonomous agents of the model. The approach is iterative. In each iteration, the central agent announces to UMMs its procurement strategy, which contains purchased powers and their prices. Then, UMMs optimize and send back their output power and selling price proposals in the hope of achieving higher profits. The energy service provider (ESP) gathers the bids and modifies the procurement strategy whenever bids are in line with the cost minimization objective. The service provider releases the last procurement strategy in response to which UMMs synchronously update and send back their bids. The mutual interaction between UMMs and ESP is continued to the point in which no further modification in ESP's procurement strategy is experienced.

Our approach is novel in that it guarantees individual rationality, meaning that it provides suppliers and consumers with a guaranteed incentive to participate in the real-time pricing market. Such an incentive is devised by offering a time-varying, situation-dependent subsidy that guarantees that a supplier/consumer profits by switching from a fixed-price contract to the real-time pricing contract. Although we assume that suppliers and consumers decide supply and demand quantities in a fully distributed manner to maximize their own profit, the proposed mechanism guarantees under moderate conditions that the market converges through an iterative process to a Nash equilibrium that maximizes social welfare. Furthermore, in order to guarantee safe operation of an electrical grid, our pricing mechanism increases stability of load frequency control, and at the same time, achieves supply-demand equilibrium by explicitly taking into account an equality constraint through dual decomposition method.

244,"It is known that the choice of gain (K) in the Sandia frequency shift (SFS) scheme has direct impacts on the stability of a system with grid-connected distributed generations (DGs). In this paper, a scheduled perturbation technique is proposed to reduce the stability impact of K. In the proposed technique, chopping fraction (cf) is used to compensate for reduction in the value of K, where higher cf values are used to achieve zero nondetection zone (NDZ) under low gain SFS. It is shown by analysis that theoretical reduction of NDZ can be always achieved for a nonzero value of cf. Simulations for single-and multi-DGs systems are performed to verify the analytical analysis. It is shown that an appropriate design of scheduled signal duty cycle (d) is of critical importance to realize the proposed reduction in NDZ. While close synchronization of perturbation signals for multi-DG system is required, a delay of 0.33 s is shown to be tolerated for a two-DG system. Synchronization can be achieved either through locally synchronized timers or by limited communication among DGs.

245,"This paper investigates the influence of control bandwidth on the stability of loads, which are interfaced through power electronic converters and are fed from a dc power source. When tightly regulated, these loads exhibit a constant power load (CPL) behavior. It is shown here that the ideal CPL assumption, prevalent in literature, may not represent the worst case in real-life applications. If the control bandwidth of the load is sufficiently high, the load behaves like a CPL, and the system stability margin decreases with the increase in output power. However, in a practical range, with a lower control bandwidth, the system stability margin is influenced critically by the converter's characteristic impedance, as well as its output power.

247,"In this paper, simultaneous control of active power and volt/var is explored with photovoltaic (PV) generators in distribution systems. The PV active power output can be controlled in the load-following mode when sufficient solar power is available to supply a local load, or the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode when a local load is large or injection to the system is allowed. Two selected control approaches, P-Q control in the load-following mode and P-V control in the MPPT mode, are investigated in this paper. The P-Q control is implemented with a relatively simple approach, while the P-V control demands an extra MPPT logic, which is solved based on a power balance between the dc and ac sides in a two-stage PV configuration. The control algorithms are tested with the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder with various system conditions like the presence of multiple PV generators, imbalance, harmonics, and faults. The MATLAB and SimPowerSystems simulation results clearly demonstrate the capability of the proposed control in maintaining the P/V bus as either a P-Q or P-V bus depending on different applications.",WOS:000364040300033,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Adhikari, S., Li, F.

This paper proposes a model of the electricity market that captures the uncertainties on both the operator and user sides. The system operator (SO) implements a temporal linear pricing strategy that depends on real-time demand and renewable generation in the considered period combining real-time pricing with time-of-use pricing. The announced pricing strategy sets up a noncooperative game of incomplete information among the users with heterogeneous, but correlated consumption preferences. An explicit characterization of the optimal user behavior using the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution concept is derived. This explicit characterization allows the SO to derive pricing policies that influence demand to serve practical objectives, such as minimizing peak-to-average ratio or attaining a desired rate of return.

252,"Price-directed demand in smart grids operating within deregulated electricity markets calls for real-time forecasting of the price of electricity for the purpose of scheduling demand at the nodal level (e.g., appliances, machines, and devices) in a way that minimizes energy cost to the consumer. In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naive forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM.

253,"Grid integration of wind generation is challenging in view of wind uncertainties and possible transmission congestions. Without considering transmission, a stochastic unit commitment problem was solved in our previous work by modeling aggregated wind as a Markov chain instead of scenarios for reduced complexity. With congestion, wind generation at different locations cannot be aggregated and is modeled as a Markov chain per wind node, and the resulting global states are a large number of combinations of nodal states. To avoid explicitly considering all such global states, interval optimization is synergistically integrated with the Markovian approach in this paper. The key is to divide the generation level of a conventional unit into a Markovian component that depends on the local state, and an interval component that manages extreme nonlocal states. With appropriate transformations, the problem is converted to a linear form and is solved by using branch-and-cut. Numerical results demonstrate that the over conservativeness of pure interval optimization is much alleviated, and the new approach is effective in terms of computational efficiency, simulation cost, and solution feasibility. In addition, solar generation shares a similar uncertain nature as wind generation, and can thus be modeled and solved similarly.",WOS:000364040300045,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Yu, Y. W., Luh, P.

Realizing such a decentralized and dynamic infrastructure will require the ability to solve large scale problems in real-time with hundreds of thousands of DERs simultaneously online.

This will change as the detection of separated areas with generation capacity and loads will become crucial for the activation of the required control actions in public networks. Here, we describe an algorithm that automatically selects the events that may cause the system islanding, recognizes the island configuration, and calculates the amount of power to shed (when required). This algorithm is the very core of a power management system both for industrial applications today and for future public networks. It can be used to start all the required reactions to islanding, e.g., frequency control and load-shedding.

Instead of controlling the output voltage of the inverter directly, the voltage droop slope is tuned to compensate for the mismatch in the voltage drops across feeders by using communication links. If the communication channel is disrupted, the controller will operate with the last tuned droop coefficient, which is shown to still outperform the controller with the initial fixed droop coefficient. Also, the net control action of the adaptive droop terms is demonstrated to have a negligible effect on the microgrid bus voltage. Since communication is not used within the tuning control loop, the strategy is inherently immune to delays in communication links.

258,"Of the numerous types of distributed generators (DGs), synchronous DGs represent the most substantial contribution to fault currents and, consequently, have the greatest effect on the operation of the protection system. On the other hand, many types of DGs require power electronic (PE) interfaces at the points where they connect to the grid, which are normally left idle during fault conditions. This paper presents a novel idea for employing the PE interfaces of inverter-based DGs (IBDGs) as a means of managing the fault current contribution of synchronous DGs through the modification of the IBDG current phase angle during fault conditions. This operation enables synchronous DGs and IBDGs to be kept connected to the system during fault conditions but with their contribution to the current having no effect on the magnitude of the fault current. Constraints related to DG locations and capacities are thus relieved. More interestingly, it is demonstrated that larger-capacity IBDGs are more effective for managing the fault current contribution of synchronous DGs, which means that for systems that include synchronous DGs, the availability of more numerous IBDGs would be beneficial.",WOS:000364040300046,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Rajaei, N. and Salama, M.

One of the major aspects of PLC is the link interface, for which orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely adopted. In this paper, we propose the application of orthogonal poly-phase-based multicarrier code division multiple access (OPP-MC-CDMA) due to its inherent better flexibility and signal-envelope properties which can be utilized to further enhance the reliability of PLC signals. The proposed OPP-MC-CDMA system is implemented with a minimum mean square error equalizer and nonlinear preprocessing to overcome the effects of bursty noise and multipath frequency-selective fading commonly experienced in PLC channels. We study the performance of this system in terms of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate with various constellation sizes of OPP codes under different noise scenarios and nonlinear processor's thresholds. For comparison-sake, the performance of the OFDM scheme is included. The results reveal that the proposed approach always provides superior performance over the OFDM one with a maximum output SNR gain of up to 5.25 dB.

The proposed scheme can integrate all information under a single host controller to realize low-cost manufacturing. It can also simplify the monitoring and supervision processes through machine-to-machine communications for the smart-grid. The voltage and current information for each module are periodically sampled and transferred to the central inverter (or another host server) through the ZigBee module.

Unfortunately, smart meters indirectly leak sensitive information about a home's occupancy, which is easy to detect because it highly correlates with simple statistical metrics, such as power's mean, variance, and range. To prevent occupancy detection, we propose using the thermal energy storage of electric water heaters already present in many homes. In essence, our approach, which we call combined heat and privacy (CHPr), modulates a water heater's power usage to make it look like someone is always home. We design a CHPr-enabled water heater that regulates its energy usage to thwart a variety of occupancy detection attacks without violating its objective-to provide hot water on demand-and evaluate it in simulation using real data. Our results show that a standard 50-gal CHPr-enabled water heater prevents a wide range of state-of-the-art occupancy detection attacks.",WOS:000360435900026,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Chen, D., Kalra, S., Irwin, D., Shenoy, P. and Albrecht, J.","Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",27,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2402224,Sep,1949-3053,5,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,data privacy,internet of things,smart grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Cq2mw,2426-2434,14425,Journal Article,Preventing Occupancy Detection From Smart Meters,1,Preventing Occupancy Detection From Smart Meters,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000360435900026,6,2015
265,"Frequency-dependent loads inherently contribute to primary frequency response. This paper describes additional contribution to primary frequency control based on voltage-dependent noncritical (NC) loads that can tolerate a wide variation of supply voltage. By using a series of reactive compensators to decouple the NC load from the mains to form a smart load (SL), the voltage, and hence the active power of the NC load, can be controlled to regulate the mains frequency. The scope of this paper focuses primarily on reactive compensators for which only the magnitude of the injected voltage could be controlled while maintaining the quadrature relationship between the current and voltage. New control guidelines are suggested. The effectiveness of the SLs in improving mains frequency regulation without considering frequency-dependent loads and with little relaxation in mains voltage tolerance is demonstrated in a case study on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution network. Sensitivity analysis is included to show the effectiveness and limitations of SLs for varying load power factors, proportion of SLs, and system strengths.",WOS:000360435900018,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Akhtar, Z., Chaudhuri, B. and Hui, S.

266,"There has been a growing interest in the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) not only in high-voltage transmission, but in lower-voltage distribution systems. For a distributed generation (DG) grid, this would require deployment of PMUs at critical locations, which implies accurate phase measurement with the support of a low delay, highly reliable network infrastructure. In the absence of such a network, the most cost-effective solution would be to consider a wireless network to support centralized control for situational awareness in the transmission, as well as the DG grid environment. Therefore, the main objective in this paper is to design and implement a scalable synchrophasor network using wireless LAN technology to assess network performance and requirements under real-world conditions. To achieve this, we have designed an emulation platform that can support physical and medium access control layers. The data communication at the application is based on the IEEE C37.118-2011-2 Standard. By considering a hierarchical network architecture for our testbed implementation, we propose an efficient method to reduce bandwidth, as well as provide capabilities for control and management at each hierarchical level. In addition, an efficient tree-based multihop routing protocol has been designed to match a specific distribution feeder structure.

Classical power control schemes targeting pure bits/joule energy efficiency for multiaccess wireless networks do not fit in well due to the stringent data rate reliability requirement caused by the massive amount of smart meter data.

269,"With the proposition to install a large number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the future power grid, it is essential to provide robust communications infrastructure for phasor data across the network. We make progress in this direction by devising a simple time division multiplexing scheme for transmitting phasor data from the PMUs to a central server. Time is divided into frames and the PMUs take turns to transmit to the control center within the time frame. The main contribution of this paper is a scheduling policy based on which PMU transmissions are ordered during a time frame. The scheduling scheme is independent of the approach taken to solve the PMU placement problem, and unlike strategies devised for conventional communications, it is intended for the power network since it is fully governed by the measure of electrical connectedness between buses in the grid. To quantify the performance of the scheduling scheme, we couple it with a fault detection algorithm used to detect changes in the susceptance parameters in the grid. Results demonstrate that scheduling the PMU transmissions leads to an improved performance of the fault detection scheme compared to PMUs transmitting at random.",WOS:000360435900036,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Nagananda, K.

Aggregated residential electro-thermal technologies (ETTs), such as electric heat pumps and (micro-) combined heat and power, are modeled in a unified nontechnology specific way. Day-ahead optimization is carried out considering uncertainty in outdoor temperature, electricity and hot water consumption, dwelling occupancy, and imbalance prices. Building flexibility is exploited through specification of a deadband around the set temperature or a price of thermal discomfort applied to deviations from the set temperature. A new expected thermal discomfort (ETD) metric is defined to quantify user discomfort. The efficacy of exploiting the flexibility of various residential ETT following the two approaches is analyzed. The utilization of the ETD metric to facilitate quantification of the expected total (energy and thermal discomfort) cost is also demonstrated. Such quantification may be useful in the determination of DR contracts set up by energy service companies.

271,"Estimating power system states accurately is crucial to the reliable operation of power grids. Traditional weighted least square (WLS) state estimation methods face the rising threat of cyber-attacks, such as false data injection attacks, which can pass the bad data detection process in WLS state estimation. In this paper, we propose a new detection method to detect false data injection attacks by tracking the dynamics of measurement variations. The Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) is used to calculate the distance between two probability distributions derived from measurement variations. When false data are injected into the power systems, the probability distributions of the measurement variations will deviate from the historical data, thus leading to a larger KLD. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 14 bus system using load data from the New York independent system operator with different attack scenarios. We have also tested our method on false data injection attacks that replace current measurement data with historical measurement data.

However, the evaluation of these promises has relied on simulations of individual TCLs that make important assumptions about the thermal dynamics and properties of the loads, the end-user's interactions with individual TCLs and the disturbances to their operation. In this paper, we first propose a data-driven modeling strategy to simulate individual TCLs-specifically, household refrigeration units (HRUs)-that allows us to relax some of these assumptions and evaluate the validity of the approaches proposed to date. Specifically, we fit probability distributions to a year-long dataset of power measurements for HRUs and use these models to create more realistic simulations. We then derive the aggregate system equations using a bottomup approach that results in a more flexible [linear time invariant (LTI)] system. Finally, we quantify the plant-model mismatch and evaluate the proposed strategy with the more realistic simulation. Our results show that the effects of invalid assumptions about the disturbances and time-invariant properties of individual HRUs may be mitigated by a faster sampling of the state variables and that, when this is not possible, the proposed LTI system reduces the plant-model mismatch.",WOS:000360435900040,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kara, E.

Finally, for an independent system operator, stored energy levels at microgrids must be maintained as close as possible to storage capacity to secure network emergency operation. To achieve these objectives, a multiobjective approach is proposed.

To evaluate the degree to which these inappropriate control commands influence the power system, we propose a cyber-physical equivalent model for HCSs. In this model, the HCS cyber network is abstracted to a directed graph consisting of data nodes and directed branches, and connectivity is described by using a node-branch incidence matrix. Using this strategy, we can describe the general information flow in an HCS using mathematical equations on the basis of which quantitative evaluation can be carried out. Furthermore, by using existing operation records, several kinds of typical cyber-contingencies are also modeled on the basis of which cyber-contingency assessment (cyber-CA) can be implemented by using a model-based approach. Considering the computational efficiency, such an approach keeps only key characteristics of the information flow rather than all features of the cyber network. In the case study, a coordinated secondary-voltage control system is studied as an example. The physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies on different data transmission and processing modules are compared. The results show that the model-based method provides improved efficiency compared with conventional simulation-based methods while maintaining accuracy.",WOS:000360435900020,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Xin, S.

282,"The integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) in power systems poses many research challenges. Research shows that the RES output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Consequently, the direction of the power flow on distribution lines can be reversed during some periods. As the voltage regulator is normally designed for unidirectional power flow, this may cause voltage violations on the distribution feeder. Therefore, most utilities try to set a penetration level (PL) limit for safe operation. On the other hand, time varying and unbalanced loading are the main characteristics of distribution systems. Moreover installation of intermittent and nondispatchable photovoltaic (PV) devices increases the control problems of distribution system. This paper presents an impedance-based monitoring method for detection of distribution system current behavior. It will be shown that by utilizing this monitoring technique, not only the small variation of PV PL can be easily detected, but also some fast transients such as the effect of cloud movement on PV system can be monitored. This monitoring technique employs only local measurements of bus voltages and line current to measure the apparent impedance seen at the installation point.

285,"Communications network plays a key role in the next-generation microgrid protection schemes, as the protective relays need to communicate with each other to dynamically track their tripping currents due to the time-varying nature of the loads and the distributed generation (DG) outputs. Hence, communications cost and reliability are some of the key factors that need to be considered before deploying a microgrid protection scheme. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a hybrid microgrid protection system, which implements traditional differential protection scheme along with an adaptive microgrid protection scheme. While the differential scheme is more sensitive, yet relies on extensive communications, the adaptive scheme is less sensitive but has low communications load. The joint deployment of these two schemes has the potential to increase the accuracy and precision of the whole protection scheme, while reducing the overall communications cost. Moreover, we propose a preemptive switching algorithm for the microgrid relays, which ensures a seamless transition from differential protection to adaptive protection based on the bit error rate of the communications links.

With the number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the North American grid scaling up to the thousands, system operators are gradually inclining toward distributed cyber-physical architectures for executing wide-area monitoring and control operations. Traditional centralized approaches, in fact, are anticipated to become untenable soon due to various factors such as data volume, security, communication overhead, and failure to adhere to real-time deadlines. To address this challenge, we propose three different communication and computational architectures by which estimators located at the control centers of various utility companies can run local optimization algorithms using local PMU data, and thereafter communicate with other estimators to reach a global solution. Both synchronous and asynchronous communications are considered. Each architecture integrates a centralized Prony-based algorithm with several variants of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

Jamming, as a kind of denial-of service attack, can be applied to interfere the real-time communication in smart grid. In this paper, we analyze the scenario in which the attacker can jam a reduced number of signal channels carrying measurement information in order to manipulate the locational marginal price and create the opportunity for gaining profit, and the defender is able to guarantee a limited number of channels in information delivery. Based on the electricity marketing model, we propose a multiact dynamic game between the attacker and defender, in which the optimal strategies are taken by the two sides to maximize their own profits.

288,"Clarification of the responsibility for carbon emission is fundamental in a carbon-constrained world. Existing statistical methods for carbon emission estimation usually attribute the emission responsibility to the generation side. However, a growing number of analysis across different sectors has pointed out that ""consumers"" rather than ""producers"" should be responsible for the CO2 emitted during the production. In power system, it is consumers that create the need for the combustion of fossil fuels and cause substantial carbon emission. In order to account carbon emission from the consumption-based perspective, carbon emission generated by various generators can be seen as a virtual attachment to the power flow and accumulated at the consumer's side. A novel analytical model for carbon emission flow (CEF) is proposed in this paper to quantify the carbon emission accompanying the power delivery process. The newly developed model of CEF can take into account the operational characteristics and the network features of power system, and elaborately characterize the relationship between power delivery and CEF. Some basic concepts of CEF in power networks are defined, and the fundamental characteristics and distribution principles of CEF are analyzed.

299,"Public-key cryptography (PKC) is widely used in smart grid (SG) communications to reduce the overhead of key management. However, PKC comes with its own problems in terms of certificate management. Specifically, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) need to be maintained and distributed to the smart meters (SMs) in order to ensure security of the communications. The size of CRLs may grow over time and eventually may introduce additional delay, bandwidth, and storage overhead when various applications are run on SG. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for creating customized CRLs with reduced size for IEEE 802.11s-based advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Rather than maintaining a huge-size single CRL that introduces unnecessary search time and storage, the idea is to cluster/group SMs within the AMI network and create CRLs based on these groups. The grouping is mainly done in such a way that they bring together the SMs that will be very likely to communicate so that the CRLs will be kept local to that group. To this end, we propose two novel grouping algorithms. The first algorithm is a bottom-up approach, which is based on the existing routes from the SMs to the gateway. Since the SMs will be sending their data to the gateway through the nodes on the route, this forms a natural grouping. The second approach is a top-down recursive approach, which considers the minimum spanning tree of the network and then divides it into smaller subtrees. Via grouping, the length of the CRL for each SM and the corresponding distribution overhead can be reduced significantly. Simulation results have shown that our approach can maintain a balance between the size of the CRL and the number of signatures generated by CAs while guaranteeing security of the communications.",WOS:000360435900019,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Akkaya, K., Rabieh, K., Mahmoud, M. and Tonyali, S.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA",20,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2390131,Sep,1949-3053,5,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,certificate revocations,grouping schemes,public key cryptography,security,smart grid,ad hoc networks,infrastructure,protocol,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Cq2mw,2366-2374,14460,Journal Article,Customized Certificate Revocation Lists for IEEE 802.11s-Based Smart Grid AMI Networks,1,Customized Certificate Revocation Lists for IEEE 802.11s-Based Smart Grid AMI Networks,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000360435900019,6,2015

The stimuli are generated at different locations in the distribution grid and detected at the transformer sub-station, through cross correlation between the received distorted signal and the sequence, the parameters of the propagation channel can be estimated.

301,"Demand response systems in the electricity grid, which rely on two way communication between the consumers and utility, require the transmission of instantaneous energy consumption to utilities. Perfect knowledge of a user's power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. It has been shown that an in-home energy storage system (such as a battery/inverter) that provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without inconvenience can also be used to hide a user's power usage pattern. A fundamental tradeoff exists between the costs saved and the degree of privacy achievable, and in this paper, the tradeoff achievable by a finite capacity battery assuming a zero tolerance for activity delay is studied using a Markov process model for user's demands and instantaneous electricity prices. Due to high computational complexity (continuous state-action space) of the stochastic control model, inner and upper bounds are presented on the optimal tradeoff. In particular, a class of battery charging policies based on minimizing revealing states is proposed to derive achievable privacy-cost savings tradeoff. The performance of this algorithm is compared with lower bounds derived using a greedy heuristic and upper bounds derived using an information theoretic rate distortion approach. The framework proposed is shown to be applicable even when users only desire partial information protection, such as presence/absence of activity or specific appliances they wish to hide.

302,"Large penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) can have a negative impact on the power grid, e.g., increased peak load and losses, that can be largely mitigated using coordinated charging strategies. In addition to shifting the charging process to the night valley when the electricity price is lower, this paper explicitly considers the EV owner convenience that can be mainly characterized by a desired state of charge at the departure time. To this end, the EV charging procedure is defined as an uninterruptible process that happens at a given discrete charging rate and the coordinated charging is formulated as a scheduling problem. The scalable real-time greedy (S-RTG) algorithm is proposed to schedule a large population of EVs in a decentralized fashion, explicitly considering the EV owner criteria. Unlike the majority of existing approaches, the S-RTG algorithm does not rely on iterative procedures and does not require heavy computations, broadcast messages, or extensive bi-directional communications. Instead, the proposed algorithm schedules one EV at a time with simple computations, only once (i.e., at the time the EV connects to the grid), and only requires low-speed communication capability making it suitable for real-time implementation.

To avoid shifting a large portion of consumer demand toward the least price intervals, which could create network issues due to loss of diversity, higher prices are applied when the consumer's demand goes beyond a prescribed power threshold. The arising mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem is solved in an iterative manner rolling throughout the day to follow the changes in the anticipated price signals and the variations in the controller inputs while information is updated.

In the CVR paradigm, optimal voltage profiles at the load buses are determined so as to yield load reductions and hence energy conservation. The system modifications required to operate at such voltages is known to be capital intensive, which is not desirable by investors. Hence, the proposed model determines the system savings and the appropriate price incentives to offer industries such that a minimum acceptable rate of return is accrued. In this model, the industrial facilities are represented by a combination of constant impedance, constant current, and constant power loads. A detailed case study for Ontario, Canada, is carried out considering that industrial loads are investing in voltage optimization to reduce their energy costs. The optimal incentives that need to be offered by the system planner, over a long-term horizon, and across various zones of Ontario, are determined using the presented mathematical model.

310,"As the penetration of renewable energy sources is increasing, the long-term voltage stability (LTVS) of fixed-speed induction generators (FSIGs) has raised a major concern for distribution power networks since they will always consume reactive power. When either the voltage profile of the FSIG severely declines due to the load consumption increasing in the nearby area, or the mechanical power of the wind turbine increases owing to the wind speed increasing, the loss of the stable equilibrium point will result in this class of long-term voltage instability problems. Although this problem is a local phenomenon, it may spread to the rest of the system and cause the cascaded blackout. Meanwhile, with massive deployment of synchrophasor technology, it is possible to improve system awareness and enable early warning to detect this class of LTVS problems in real-time. In this paper, a measurement-based algorithm for synchrophasor long-term voltage stability indicator (SLVSI) will be proposed. First, qualitative analysis of this class of LTVS problems is conducted by corresponding bifurcation diagrams and hysteretic curves. Secondly, a measurement- based FSIG equivalent model is proposed by utilizing real-time phasor measurements from synchrophasors. The above concept can be extended to distribution power networks with multiple FSIGs. The entire distribution power grid will be considered as a modified coupled single-port network. By exploring the concept of reactive power response factor, the corresponding Thevenin equivalent parameter of each individual FSIG branch is adjusted based on real-time phasor measurements. Thus, a SLVSI for each individual FSIG can be defined by modifying the conventional L-index.

By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes more congested and, therefore, controlling charging requests should be carefully aligned with the available resources.

In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV population is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty fleets. This necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to prevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This framework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer request rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality of service (QoS).

Here, we consider optimizing for the profit of the aggregator. To encourage customer participation in the residential DR program, a new pricing structure named customer incentive pricing (CIP) is proposed. The aggregator profit is optimized using a proposed heuristic framework, implemented in the form of a genetic algorithm, that must determine a schedule of customer assets and the CIP. To validate our heuristic framework, we simulate the optimization of a large-scale system consisting of 5555 residential customer households and 56 642 schedulable assets using real-pricing data over a period of 24-h. We show that by optimizing purely for economic reasons, the aggregator can enact a beneficial change on the load profile of the overall power system.",WOS:000356810900021,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Hansen, T.

317,"The evolution toward emerging active distribution networks (ADNs) can be realized via a real-time state estimation (RTSE) application facilitated by the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs). A critical challenge in deploying PMU-based RTSE applications at large scale is the lack of a scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely (i.e., sub-second) delivery of the high volume of synchronized and continuous synchrophasor measurements. We address this challenge by introducing a communication platform called C-DAX based on the information-centric networking (ICN) concept. With a topic-based publish-subscribe engine that decouples data producers and consumers in time and space, C-DAX enables efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery, as well as flexible and scalable (re) configuration of PMU data communication for seamless full observability of power conditions in complex and dynamic scenarios. Based on the derived set of requirements for supporting PMU-based RTSE in ADNs, we design the ICN-based C-DAX communication platform, together with a joint optimized physical network resource provisioning strategy, in order to enable the agile PMU data communications in near real-time. In this paper, C-DAX is validated via a field trial implementation deployed over a sample feeder in a real-distribution network; it is also evaluated through simulation-based experiments using a large set of real medium voltage grid topologies currently operating live in The Netherlands. This is the first work that applies emerging communication paradigms, such as ICN, to smart grids while maintaining the required hard real-time data delivery as demonstrated through field trials at national scale. As such, it aims to become a blueprint for the application of ICN-based general purpose communication platforms to ADNs.",WOS:000356810900058,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Chai, W. K., Wang, N., Katsaros, K.

318,"Robust control and management of the grid relies on accurate data. Both phasor measurement units and remote terminal units are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is crucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of tampered data-both for preventing attacks that may lead to blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control of current and future grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme based on the Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the conditional covariance test CMIT to learn the structure of the grid. Using the dc power flow model, we show that, under normal circumstances, the Markov graph of the voltage angles is consistent with the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between the calculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Our method can detect the most recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge of the bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state estimator; hence damaging power network control, monitoring, demand response, and pricing scheme. Specifically, under the stealthy deception attack, the Markov graph of phase angles changes. In addition to detecting a state of attack, our method can detect the set of attacked nodes. To the best of our knowledge, our remedy is the first to comprehensively detect this sophisticated attack and it does not need additional hardware.

319,"The circulating current among the paralleled solid state transformers (SSTs) originated by the line parameter and mismatched output impedance comes into appearance in the islanded operation of the novel microgrid, the future renewable electric energy delivery and management system. In this regard, the aggregated control strategy of both virtual inductance and external inductance is proposed in this paper to suppress circulating current. The ""matching concept"" regarding the parameter selection of virtual and external inductance is proposed to ensure the reliable operation of the system through constructing the complete small-signal model of SST. On the basis of aggregated control strategy and small-signal model, the adaptive virtual impedance control strategy is finally proposed by introducing the feedback of circulating current into the conventional virtual impedance control. The virtual impedance is adjusted adaptively according to the judgment algorithm to regulate the equivalent output impedance of SST. With this modification, the adjustment ability of virtual impedance control against sudden disturbance is improved and the circulating current is further reduced. The simulation results with nonlinear loading are presented to prove that the proposed control strategy, and the parameters determined by the matching concept substantially reduce the circulating current among SSTs and improve the accuracy of load sharing among SSTs.",WOS:000356810900003,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Zhang, M.

This paper considers the problem of robust placement of a limited number of voltage magnitude meters and phasor measurement units for state estimation in an active distribution system comprising topological reconfigurations. The trace of the inverse of the Fisher information matrix is chosen as criterion for the estimation accuracy. For meter placement in a single configuration distribution system, the greedy approach provides a near-optimal solution as well as a theoretical approximation guarantee. However, for meter placement in an active distribution system, a robust approach is required to optimize the worst case estimation accuracy among all possible configurations of the system. In this paper, a simple robust algorithm, called submodular saturation algorithm, for meter placement in active distribution systems is proposed. Numerical results on three different active distribution systems show that the submodular saturation algorithm outperforms the greedy algorithm and the genetic algorithm in most cases, and provides competitive results in other cases.",WOS:000356810900039,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Damavandi, M.

In a smart grid scenario, flexible devices are expected to aid the system in balancing the electric power in a technically and economically efficient way. To achieve this, the flexible devices' consumption data are theoretically recorded, elaborated, and their upcoming flexibility is bid to flexibility markets. However, there are many cases where explicit flexible device consumption data are absent. This paper presents a way to circumvent this problem and extract the potentially flexible load of a flexible device, namely a heat pump (HP), out of the aggregated energy consumption of a house. The main idea for accomplishing this is a comparison of the flexible consumer with electrically similar nonflexible consumers. The methodology is based on machine-learning techniques, probability theory, and statistics. After presenting this methodology, the general trend of the HP consumption is estimated and an hour-ahead forecast is conducted by employing seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average modeling. In this manner, the flexible consumption is predicted, establishing the basis for bidding flexibility in intraday markets, even in the absence of explicit device measurements.",WOS:000356810900027,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kouzelis, K., Tan, Z.

333,"Arc faults have always been a concern for electrical systems, as they can cause fires, personnel shock hazard, and system failure. Existing commercialized techniques that rely on pattern recognition in the time domain or frequency domain analysis using a Fourier transform do not work well, because the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the arc signal is not periodic. Instead, wavelet transform (WT) provides a time and frequency approach to analyze target signals with multiple resolutions. In this paper, a new approach using WT for arc fault analysis in dc systems is proposed. The process of detecting an arc fault involves signal analysis and then feature identification. The focus of this paper is on the former. Simulation models are synthesized to study the theoretical results of the proposed methodology and traditional fast Fourier transform analysis on arcing faults.

334,"Microgrid allows high penetration of renewable energy sources, and provides technical foundation for the grid connection and operation of distributed generations (DGs). The negative impacts caused by DGs should be reduced inside the microgrid. Photovoltaic (PV) generation is one of the major distributed energy sources, and the performance of PV generation systems connected to microgrid directly affects power quality and other technical indexes of the microgrid. Thus, the research of flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation system has both theoretical significance and practical value. This paper makes a concise exposition on the H-infinity control theory and applies this theory to the flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation systems. This paper focuses on the specific situation where the microgrid is grid tied to the main power grid. We establish the mathematical model of PV generation system and adopt the H-infinity control theory to design a voltage tracking controller. Theoretical analysis proved that our control system is internally stable.

EEMD is adopted to extract the features of complex disturbances, which is more suitable to the nonstationary signal processing. Rank wavelet support vector machine (rank-WSVM) is proposed to apply in the classification of complex disturbances. First, the characteristic quantities of complex disturbances are obtained with EEMD through defining standard energy differences of each intrinsic mode function. Second, after the optimization of rank-SVM, based on wavelet kernel function, the ranking function, and multilabel function are, respectively, constructed. Lastly, rank-WSVM is applied to classify the complex disturbances. Simulation results and real-time digital simulator tests show that for different signal to noise ratio, the rank-WSVM classification performance of complex disturbances including hamming loss, ranking loss, one-error, coverage, and average precision, is generally better than the other three methods, namely rank-SVM, multilabel naive Bayes, and multilabel learning with backpropagation.",WOS:000356810900011,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Liu, Z.

It is necessary to create a roadmap for holistic DA strategies in a smarter grid. Sustainable and resilient grid development is a paradigm shift requiring a new line of thinking in the engineering, operation, and maintenance of the power system.

This paper intends to comprehensively assess the potential impacts of DTR on the performance of a realistic Finnish distribution network. For doing so, first a step-by-step procedure is devised. Then, weather data and loading information of circuits in the network are gathered by advanced metering infrastructure available in the network. Thereafter, the gathered data are fed to mathematical models provided by the IEEE Standard 738-2006 and component dynamic thermal models to give thermal rating of circuits.

By connecting megawatt-scale wind turbines to the distribution system, the cost of building transmission facilities can be avoided and wind power supplied to consumers can be greatly increased; however, integrating megawatt-scale wind turbines on distribution feeders will impact the distribution feeder stability, especially voltage stability. Distributed wind turbine generators (WTGs) have the capability to aid in grid stability if equipped with appropriate controllers, but few investigations are focusing on this. This paper investigates the potential of using real-time measurements from distribution phasor measurement units for a new WTG control algorithm to stabilize the voltage deviation of a distribution feeder. This paper proposes a novel auxiliary coordinated-control approach based on a support vector machine (SVM) predictor and a multiple-input and multiple-output model predictive control on linear time-invariant and linear time-variant systems.

By controlling the magnitude of ac reactor current, the fault current is reduced and voltage of the point of common coupling is kept at an acceptable level. Also, by this TBSSFCL, switching overvoltage is reduced significantly. The proposed TBSSFCL can improve the power quality factors and also, due to its simple structure, the cost is relatively low.

349,"One of the important aspects of smart grid is to make the best use of existing assets. One way (among others) to achieve this objective is by scheduling effective maintenance routines. Abnormal conditions, including short circuits or overloads, would affect not only the exposed components, but also those farther away from the fault locations. This exposure may cause some of the components fail right away or at a later time. Therefore, the severity, frequency, and timings of system faults are important factors in planning maintenance programs. In this paper, the impact of increased current flows, in the form of short circuits and overloads, on component failure rates are studied and a maintenance scheduling model taking into account such impacts is developed.

The novelty of the algorithm lies in its capability to generate feasible solutions for the voltage estimation with a much smaller number of real measurements.

352,"We describe the general concept and practical feasibility of a dc-based open energy system (OES) that proposes an alternative way of exchanging intermittent energy between houses in a local community. Each house is equipped with a dc nanogrid, including photovoltaic panels and batteries. We extend these nanogrids with a bidirectional dc-dc converter and a network controller so that power can be exchanged between houses over an external dc power bus. In this way, demand-response fluctuations are absorbed not only by the local battery, but can be spread over all batteries in the system. By using a combination of voltage and current controlled units, we implemented a higher-level control software independent from the physical process. A further software layer for autonomous control handles power exchange based on a distributed multiagent system, using a peer-to-peer like architecture. In parallel to the software, we made a physical model of a four-node OES on which different power exchange strategies can be simulated and compared. First results show an improved solar replacement ratio, and thus a reduction of ac grid consumption thanks to power interchange. The concept's feasibility has been demonstrated on the first three houses of a full-scale OES platform in Okinawa.",WOS:000356810900005,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Werth, A., Kitamura, N. and Tanaka, K.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",33,10.1109/Tsg.2015.2408603,Jul,1949-3053,4,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,dc-dc converter,dc power distribution,dc power transmission,interconnected power system,microgrid,power system control,smart grid,multiagent system,operation,grids,,,,,,,,,,English,Cl2xl,1621-1630,14513,Journal Article,Conceptual Study for Open Energy Systems: Distributed Energy Network Using Interconnected DC Nanogrids,1,Conceptual Study for Open Energy Systems: Distributed Energy Network Using Interconnected DC Nanogrids,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000356810900005,6,2015
353,"High penetrations of photovoltaic (PV) systems within load pockets in distribution grids have changed pure consumers to prosumers. This can cause technical challenges in distribution and transmission grids, such as overvoltage and reverse power flow. Embedding voltage support schemes into PVs, such as standard cos phi(P) characteristic proposed by the German grid codes, may cause more changes in the steady-state behavior of distribution grids and, in turn, the transmission side. Accordingly, it is important to properly model active distribution grids to analyze the system impacts of these changes to plan and operate future smart power grids. However, due to the high dimension of distribution grids, considering a detailed distribution grid to study the transmission side or a fraction of the distribution grid is either cumbersome or impractical. Therefore, it is required to develop a reasonable equivalent that can fairly capture the dominant behavior of the distribution grids. The aim of this paper is to use gray-box modeling concepts to develop a static equivalent of distribution grids comprising a large number of PV systems embedded with voltage support schemes. In the proposed model, the PV systems are aggregated as a separate entity, and not as a negative load, which is traditionally done.

354,"In a multienergy system, there are different types of dependencies among the energy carriers. Internal dependencies refer to possible changes in the energy source in the presence of energy converters and storage, and are managed by the system operator through the control strategies applied to the equipment. External dependencies (EDs) are due to the choice of the energy supply according to customer preferences when alternative solutions are available. This paper introduces a new model of EDs within a multigeneration representation based on energy hubs. EDs are addressed through a stochastic model in order to take into account the possible uncertainty in the customers' decisions. This model is then used to introduce carrier-based demand response (DR) in which the user participates in DR programs aimed at promoting the shifting among different energy sources by preserving the service provided to the end users.

355,"This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h. Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation, the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data.

356,"Weak grids/microgrids are gaining considerable attention due to the installation of renewable power generation resources in areas that are remote from load centers. This paper presents a multivariable-droop synchronous current converter control strategy for current management of weak grid/microgrid applications, and offers a systematic and straightforward design approach using the loop shaping technique. The controller integrates current regulation, management, and limitation that are applicable to weak grids and microgrids (MGs). The multivariable synchronous current converter enables superior decoupling of d- and q-axis currents in weak grids and/or resistive grids where these control variables are highly coupled due to converter operation at large load-angles. Therefore, stable connection of weak (high impedance) resistive MGs to utility grids is feasible. The multivariable droop concept also realizes real power sharing by simultaneous drooping of both frequency and voltage amplitude, which enhances load sharing accuracy in resistive and/or weak grids. Similar to its predecessor, synchronous converters, the controller can eliminate phase-locked loop (PLL) and provides a unified controller, PLL, and load manager in one simple control methodology. This can facilitate grid auto-synchronization, which can improve the stability of voltage source converters in weak grid applications. Also, the controller can participate in the power system frequency, and voltage regulation and control.

In order to accurately set the protection relays, detailed fault current analysis considering low pass resistor capacitor filter effects are presented. The decision for fault isolation is made based on the unit judgment and the data received through high-level data communication from other interconnected units.

Projects at multiple utilities have focused on integrating AMI information, along with traditional supervisory control and data acquisition data sources, into utility distribution management systems to improve situational awareness on distribution feeders. Despite the clear benefits each of these systems offer, their ability to provide utilities with broad awareness of events affecting the health and status of the distribution system is limited, and often reactive in nature.

By effectively scheduling major household appliances in response to demand response (DR) schemes, residents can save their electricity bills. In this paper, an advanced HEMS facilitated by a nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique with an automated nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism is proposed. The NILM as an electricity audit is able to nonintrusively estimate power consumed by each of monitored major household appliances at a certain period of time. Data identified by the NILM are very useful for DR implementation.

360,"The integration of distributed generation (DG) in distribution grids is one of the pillars of smart grid deployment. However, an increasing amount of DG connected to distribution grids is likely to affect the operation of the grids themselves, e.g., changing the magnitude, and in some cases the direction, of power flows. In order to perform the transition to a smart grid, it is therefore essential to have the distribution system operators (DSOs) involved in the process. However, being that the DSOs' business is controlled by regulators, regulation has a fundamental impact on the speed and the actual performance of DSOs' involvement in the transition toward a smart grid. Therefore, a method is needed to assess network regulation impact on DSOs' incentive to integrate DG into their grids. This paper proposes a new method for the calculation of such incentive, and the method has been applied on a case study to the Portuguese, Danish, and Swedish regulations for different scenarios of DG penetration. The focus is on DSOs' operational costs and revenues.

By exploiting the vulnerabilities in cyber components and intruding into the local area networks of the control center, corporation, substations, or by injecting false information into communication links, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data, reconfigure devices, and send trip commands to the intelligent electronic devices that control the system breakers. Reliability of the power system can thus be impacted by various cyber attacks.

Two Bayesian attack graph models are built to illustrate the attack procedures and to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks. A mean time-to-compromise model is modified and adopted considering the known and zero-day vulnerabilities on the cyber components, and the frequencies of intrusions through various paths are estimated.

Building occupant energy-use data is segmented to facilitate the construction of independent energy-use profiles for workdays, nonworkdays, work hours, and nonwork hours, which in turn enable further classification of building occupants according to their energy-use patterns. The three new metrics, building occupant energy-use efficiency, entropy, and intensity enable the design of more targeted energy conservation campaigns. Building occupants with relatively low energy-use efficiency scores can be individually targeted for behavioral interventions aimed at increasing the efficiency of their energy-use. Furthermore, building occupants with relatively low energy-use entropy scores can be sent timely behavior intervention notifications based on predictions of their future energy-use.

367,"This paper proposes a novel adaptive wide area backup protection scheme for transmission lines. In the proposed scheme, both the faulted line and fault location are determined by a limited number of synchronized phasor measurements. Based on phasor measurement unit placement and network topology, subsets of lines and buses called backup protection zones (BPZs) are formed. After a fault occurs in the transmission network, the sum of zero- and/or positive-sequence currents entering the faulted BPZ highly increases, and hence, the faulted BPZ can be determined. The linear least squares method is then used to determine the faulted line, as well as the fault location by voltage and current phasors of the faulted BPZ. Accordingly, the proposed scheme provides a closed-form and noniterative solution for the faulted line and fault location identification problem. On the other hand, it readily determines the faulted line regardless of the fault type, fault resistance, and measurement errors. To show the effectiveness of the method, it is applied to the WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems.

370,"Energy management in microgrids is typically formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Solving it in a centralized manner does not only require high computational capabilities at the microgrid central controller (MGCC), but may also infringe customer privacy. Existing distributed approaches, on the other hand, assume that all generations and loads are connected to one bus, and ignore the underlying power distribution network and the associated power flow and system operational constraints. Consequently, the schedules produced by those algorithms may violate those constraints and thus are not feasible in practice. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the design of a distributed energy management strategy (EMS) for the optimal operation of microgrids with consideration of the distribution network and the associated constraints. Specifically, we formulate microgrid energy management as an optimal power flow problem, and propose a distributed EMS where the MGCC and the local controllers jointly compute an optimal schedule. We also provide an implementation of the proposed distributed EMS based on IEC 61850. As one demonstration, we apply the proposed distributed EMS to a real microgrid in Guangdong Province, China, consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbines, diesel generators, and a battery energy storage system.

371,"With the recent rapid development of smart grid technology, the distribution grids become more active, and the interaction between transmission and distribution grids becomes more significant. However, in traditional power flow calculations, transmission and distribution grids are separated, which is not suitable for such future smart grids. To achieve a global unified power flow solution to support an integrated analysis for both transmission and distribution grids, we propose a global power flow (GPF) method that considers transmission and distribution grids as a whole in this paper. We construct GPF equations, and develop a master-slave-splitting (MSS) iterative method with convergence guarantee to alleviate boundary mismatches between the transmission and distribution grids. In our method, the GPF problem is split into a transmission power flow and a number of distribution power flow sub-problems, which supports on-line geographically distributed computation. Each sub-problem can be solved using a different power flow algorithm to capture the different features of transmission and distribution grids. An equivalent method is proposed to improve the convergence of the MSS-based GPF calculation for distribution grids that include loops.

Many existing works focus on the effects of smart technologies, with scales ranging from a single household to an entire city. One area that is less studied is the adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we extend our prior work to develop a more robust framework for exploring the diffusion of basic smart grid technologies using a social-network-based model to study demand response adoption. This network is based around considering an end-user as a node, and any relationship where mutual trust and communication exists as an edge. In addition, we have incorporated mathematical representations of user personality traits in the decision-making progress to better simulate real-world actions. We observe greater usage of demand response when conventional electricity is high, when conscientiousness is high, and when the network is densely connected; all of these are reasonable results given logical behavior of the individual agents.

373,"This paper proposes a two-stage two-level model for the energy pricing and dispatch problem faced by a smart grid retailer who plays the role of an intermediary agent between a wholesale energy market and end consumers. Demand response of consumers with respect to the retail price is characterized by a Stackelberg game in the first stage, thus the first stage has two levels. A risk-aversive energy dispatch accounting for market price uncertainty is modeled by a linear robust optimization with objective uncertainty in the second stage. The proposed model is transformed to a mixed integer linear program (MILP) by jointly using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, the disjunctive constraints, and the duality theory. We propose a heuristic method to select the parameter in disjunctive constraints based on the interpretation of Lagrange multipliers.

In this paper, energy management in MGs is addressed in the light of economic efficiency, environmental restrictions, and reliability improvement via: 1) optimizing the type and capacity of distributed generation (DG) sources, as well as the capacity of storage devices (SD); and 2) developing an operational strategy (OS) for energy management in MGs.

This method includes two steps. In the first step, 2-D slave object functions (SOFs), operating costs, and consumer outage cost (as a reliability index) are minimized by quadratic programming and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, respectively. Then Pareto curve is drawn for SOF and fuzzy logic is employed to select the best SOF solution, OS, from Pareto curve. In the second step, using the best OS from step one for any iteration, PSO algorithms employed to solve master objective function, and to determine the optimum capacity and type of DGs and SDs.

The objective is to determine the maximum of the expected restorative loads by choosing the best arrangement of the power network configurations immediately from the beginning of the breakdown all the way to the end of the island mode. The intermittency nature of the renewable power, as well as the uncertainty of the duration of the breakdown pose new challenges to this classic optimization scheduling task.

The theory of optimal portfolio selection is adopted to generate customers' expected day-ahead energy demand graph called the weight graph, based on past days' history-energy demand, profit return, and corresponding risk. In such a scenario, the weight graph of energy ensures that the expected profit return and the corresponding risk to the customers are optimized. Consequently, we evaluate the dynamic scheduling scheme for optimizing the energy cost to the customers using the weight graph. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also assists in relieving the peak-demand on the grid, which, in turn, implies that the grid is capable of providing service to the scheduled appliances. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated with different performance metrics-peak-demand, demand variation, energy-cost, and utility of the customers.

The proposed distributed secondary voltage control utilizes an average voltage sharing scheme to compensate the voltage deviation caused by the droop control.

The distributed voltage compensators that resemble a centralized secondary voltage controller are implemented with the bi-proper anti-wind-up design method to solve the integration issues that necessarily lead to the saturation of the controller output efforts. The proposed concept of pilot bus voltage regulation shows the possibility of managing the terminal voltage without centralized structure. Moreover, the network dynamics are illustrated with a focus on cable resonance mode based on the eigenvalue analysis and small-signal modeling; analytical explanations with the development of equivalent circuits give a clear picture regarding how the controller parameters and droop gains affect the system damping performance.

384,"New voltage control algorithms are necessary to cope with the increasing amount of distributed generation and electric vehicles in distribution networks. Many of the newly proposed voltage control algorithms are based on linearized dependencies between the voltage magnitude, and the active and reactive power consumption. These linearized dependencies are normally obtained by algorithms, which rely on accurate grid topology information. Due to the traditionally passive operation of low voltage (LV) distribution networks, this information is typically missing, incomplete, or inaccurate. Therefore, this paper introduces a method to extract these linear dependencies based on historical smart meter data only. No information about the grid topology is required.

385,"Distributed energy generation and storage are widely investigated demand-side management (DSM) technologies that are scalable and integrable with contemporary smart grid systems. However, prior research has mainly focused on day-ahead optimization for these distributed energy resources while neglecting forecasting errors and their often detrimental consequences. We propose a novel game theoretic model predictive control (MPC) approach for DSM that can adapt to real-time data. The MPC-based algorithm produces subgame perfect equilibrium strategies for distributed generation and storage with perfect forecasting information, and is shown to be more effective than a day-ahead scheme when mean forecasting errors greater than 10% are present. This robust and continuous MPC approach reduces effective forecasting errors, and in doing so, achieves greater electricity cost savings and peak to average demand ratio reduction than the day-ahead optimization scheme.",WOS:000353521500031,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Stephens, E.

386,"The energy-saving dispatch could significantly enhance the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission reduction, as well as the sustainable development of the socio economy in China. With the rapid growth of smart grid, the use of demand response to dispatch loads with flexible consumption time and/or quantity has been a new trend in power industry. This paper proposes a new energy-saving dispatch problem while considering energy-saving and emission-reduction potentials of generation and demand sides, as well as the interaction between the two. A bi-level optimization model is established to address the interaction between the energy-saving dispatch of thermal units and that of users. The objective function of the upper level considers both the electric power generation cost and the carbon emission cost of thermal units, while the lower level integrates both compensation and incentive costs of electricity consumers into its objective function according to the influences of their regulation-based demand response to the power grid. Moreover, user benefits of reducing downtime and avoiding frequent load restarting are also considered in the lower layer model. An iterative algorithm is proposed and the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) method is used to solve the lower-layer model for seeking the optimal compromise solution on the Pareto frontier, which is derived by maximum deviations and entropy-based multiple attributes decision making method. Comparing with general NSGA-II and multiobjective genetic algorithms, the improved NSGA-II method can improve the spatial distribution of Pareto solution set and reduce the number of iterations, thus having stronger consistency among multiple objective functions and better performance.",WOS:000353521500036,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Liu, J.

However, the high intermittent nature of energy sources and unpredictable presence of PEV in the MG offers new technological challenges to the smart grid/MG energy management system (EMS). In this paper, we propose a new distributed real-time electricity allocation (DRTA) scheme for the smart grid/MG EMS whose objectives are to reduce the electricity bill of the residential customers, to increase the overall social benefit of smart MG/grid community, and to increase the energy efficiency and reliability of the MG to rely on locally generated electricity.

The approach is based on a tight interaction between a scheduling algorithm and a power-flow evaluation procedure. The scheduling algorithm finds the best charging periods for each EV. The power flow procedure checks the achievement of electrical constraints and evaluates the operational parameters of the grid. Simulations are carried out on a real electricity distribution system of a medium-sized Italian city. The results show that the proposed approach increases the number of rechargeable EVs up to 33%.

Since wide-area backup protection (WABP) is to operate at the range of a few hundred milliseconds, the delays associated with data and command communications and algorithm execution can be a troublesome issue in a large-scale power system. This paper briefly reviews a WABP scheme based on positive-sequence voltage phasor direct and indirect measurements. To overcome the problem of WABP delays, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is proposed to divide the power system into several protection regions. This process is accomplished in three stages in which the number and location of measurement devices (MDs), the number and boundary of protection regions, and the location of protection rooms, as well as the total number of communication links between MDs and protection rooms are optimized. The proposed WABP scheme is implemented in each region and individually protects the associated transmission lines.

In this paper, we introduce a game theoretic based decentralized control mechanism to alleviate negative impacts from the EV demand. The proposed mechanism takes into consideration the nonuniform spatial distribution of EVs that induces uneven power demand at each charging facility, and aims to: 1) avoid straining grid resources by offering price incentives, so that customers accept being routed to less busy stations; 2) maximize total revenue by serving more customers with the same amount of grid resources; and 3) provide charging service to customers with a certain level of quality-of-service (QoS), the latter defined as the long term customer blocking probability.

However, until now, there has been no study to show how and when a residential microgrid may be profitable. Therefore, in this paper, we present a design space exploration methodology of the microgrid by modeling all the energy resources at the residential level and conducting numerous simulations with various parameters. Moreover, a set of rules are defined to make the stakeholders in the microgrid profitable. Also, by analyzing the number of houses in the microgrid, we observe that the number of years it takes to return the capital costs invested in the microgrid may become adequately short for a certain range of the number of houses. For instance, if the aggregator owns the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, it may profit in less than five years when 500 houses participate in the microgrid where each house owns 500 sf solar panels. On the other hand, if the prosumers own the renewable energy resources, e. g., solar panels, the aggregator may profit in about a year. Typically, for an apartment-block type housing area in U.

Adopting the synchronous beacon-enabled mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides a slotted framework for low-power, real-time collection, and distribution of power information. However, the shared nature of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band introduces the beacon corruption issue, and confronts the 802.15.4-based network with service interruptions and large delays. This paper, experimentally and analytically, studies how interference from collocated networks affects the beaconing functionally and, consequently, network performance. Investigations indicate that beaconing contributes in low-power and low-delay communications over an 802.15.4 network only when its proper operation is guaranteed over a coexistent environment like ISM band; otherwise, the application delay is significantly compromised. In this regard, a standard-conforming enhancement, called the beacon corruption recovery scheme (BCRS), is proposed to mitigate effects of coexistence on beaconing performance by migration of the network to a cleaner channel.

The point estimate method is employed to deal with the probability of line overload and the severity function is applied to quantify line flow fluctuations. Moreover, with the Cholesky decomposition, the correlation between loads and power generations are simulated by the spatial transformation of probability distributions of random variables. In addition, Nataf transformation is used to address wind resource correlation. Finally, the line overload risk index is obtained, which can be used as an indicator for quantifying power system security.

Distribution management system is responsible for coordination among distributed reactive power sources, such as capacitors, photovoltaic and wind power generators, and SVRs. In this paper, a novel method for calculating voltage sensitivity to active, reactive power injection, and SVR taps in unbalanced distribution feeders is developed. The method is based on ABCD parameters of network components which are used in forward/backward sweep of power-flow solution. The method can deal with network unbalance, network shunt admittances, single-phase sections, and ungrounded sections. The initial sensitivities are calculated in one power-flow forward sweep through a recursive way, and the online updating of sensitivities is very easy and straightforward so the method is suitable for online voltage control. A novel sensitivity-based online optimization method is developed for online coordinated voltage control with no prior information about the load. The same ABCD parameters are used for developing a novel method for calculating short circuit currents in unbalanced distribution feeders.

402,"In the foreseeable future, power grids will be managed largely with demand-side management (DSM) programs. With the growing population of electric vehicles (EVs) and the emergence of aggregators, DSM will surely introduce more intense competition to the markets. Since EV charging produces a large amount of time-flexible load in power systems, competition of its management could become a major game. This paper first formulates the game of EV charging management to describe this major form of the future DSM competition and then studies three challenges inherent in it: 1) inefficiency of Nash equilibria; 2) the game of chicken; and 3) cheating on private information. It is found that a central regulator is required to prevent these drawbacks. Solutions are proposed and a central governing procedure is also presented. The notion of the game of EV charging management is compatible with DSM programs that are able to schedule load flexibly over multiple time periods.",WOS:000353521500024,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Xu, N.

403,"The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a potential candidate for medium/high-power applications, specifically for high-voltage direct current transmission systems. One of the main challenges in the control of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents while the capacitor voltages are maintained balanced. This paper proposes a control strategy for the MMC using finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). A bilinear mathematical model of the MMC is derived and discretized to predict the states of the MMC one step ahead. Within each switching cycle, the best switching state of the MMC is selected based on evaluation and minimization of a defined cost function. The defined cost function is aimed at the elimination of the MMC circulating currents, regulating the arm voltages, and controlling the ac-side currents. To reduce the calculation burden of the MPC, the submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing controller based on the conventional sorting method is combined with the proposed FCS-MPC strategy. The proposed FCS-MPC strategy determines the number of inserted/bypassed SMs within each arm of the MMC while the sorting algorithm is used to keep the SM capacitor voltages balanced. Using this strategy, only the summation of SM capacitor voltages of each arm is required for control purposes, which simplifies the communication among the SMs and the central controller. This paper also introduces a modified switching strategy, which not only reduces the calculation burden of the FCS-MPC strategy even more, but also simplifies the SM capacitor voltage balancing algorithm. In addition, this strategy reduces the SM switching frequency and power losses by avoiding the unnecessary switching transitions. The performance of the proposed strategies for a 20-level MMC is evaluated based on the time-domain simulation studies.",WOS:000353521500044,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Vatani, M., Bahrani, B., Saeedifard, M. and Hovd, M.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Cybernet, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",26,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2377112,May,1949-3053,3,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,bilinear model,calculation load reduction,circulating current control,model predictive control (mpc),modular multilevel converter (mmc),back hvdc system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Cg7xt,1520-1529,14564,Journal Article,Indirect Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control of Modular Multilevel Converters,10,Indirect Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control of Modular Multilevel Converters,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000353521500044,6,2015

In this paper, a multi-timescale cost-effective power management algorithm (PMA) is proposed for islanded MG operation targeting generation, storage, and demand management. Comprehensive modeling, cost, and emission calculations of the MG components are developed in this paper to facilitate high accuracy management. While the MGs overall power management and operation is carried out every several minutes to hours, depending on the availability of the required data, simulation for highly dynamic devices, such as batteries and electric water heaters (EWHs) used for demand response (DR), are performed every minute. This structure allows accurate, scalable, and practical power management taking into consideration the intrainterval dynamics of battery and EWHs. Two different on/off strategies for EWH control are also proposed for DR application. Then, the PMA is implemented using the two different DR strategies and the results are compared with the no-DR case. Actual solar irradiation, ambient temperature, nonEWH load demand, and hot water consumption data are employed in the simulation studies.

The customer preferences are in the format of payment cost, interruption cost, and different operational constraints. The projected algorithm is online, in which household appliances are initially scheduled based on the payment cost, and when the home load is interrupted, the scheduling will be updated to minimize customer interruption cost. Due to vehicle to home capability of PHEV, the home outage can be managed through solving the proposed optimization problem. Several realistic case studies are carried out to examine the performance of the suggested method. In addition, the impacts of common electricity tariffs on the HLC results are investigated.

To enable flexible expansion options to national/international systems, it is suggested to interconnect star points of radial systems using dc/dc converters. DC/dc converters enable inherent isolation of dc faults and provide firewall between radial dc grids. Each interconnecting cable is protected by a dc/dc at one end and a hybrid CB at the other end.

For the realization of smart energy management, we need to make an appropriate day-ahead schedule of power generation and battery charge cycles based on the prediction of demand and PV power generation, which inevitably involves nontrivial prediction errors. With this background, a novel framework is proposed to maintain the balance among the total amounts of power generation, demand, and battery charging power with explicit consideration of the prediction uncertainty, assuming that consumer storage batteries are not directly controllable by a supplier. The proposed framework consists of the following three steps: 1) the day-ahead scheduling of the total amount of generation power and battery charging power; 2) the day-ahead scheduling of utility energy consumption requests to individual consumers, which aim to regulate battery charging cycles on the consumer side; and 3) the incentive-based management of the entire power system on the day of interest.

420,"In order to analyze the fault trends more accurately, a failure rate model appropriate for general electric power equipment is established based on a nonparametric regression method, improved from stratified proportional hazards model (PHM), which can make maximum use of equipment lifecycle data as the covariates, including manufacturer, service age, location, maintainer, health index, etc. All of covariates are represented in the hierarchy process of equipment health condition, which is beneficial for processing and classifying the lifecycle data into multitype recurrent events quantitatively. Meanwhile, based on new definitions of single health cycle and time between events, recurrent inspecting events distributed with martingale process can correspond with event-specific failure function during equipment lifecycle. On this occasion, more inspecting events can be utilized in a complete cycle to predict potential risk and assess equipment health condition. Then, stratified nonparametric PHM is employed to build the multitype recurrent events-specific failure model appropriate for competing risk problem toward interval censored. Lastly, the example in terms of transformers demonstrates the modeling procedure. Results show the well asymptotic property and goodness-of-fit tested by both of graphical and analytical methods. Compared with existing failure models, such as age-based or CBF model, this improved nonparametric regression model can mine lifecycle data acquisition from asset management system, depict the failure trend accurately considering both individual and group features, and lay the foundation for health prognosis, maintenance optimization, and asset management in power grid.",WOS:000350338100051,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Qiu, J., Wang, H.

421,"This paper presents the design and implementation of a single-phase on-board bidirectional plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charger that can provide reactive power support to the utility grid in addition to charging the vehicle battery. The topology consists of two-stages: 1) a full-bridge ac-dc boost converter; and 2) a half-bridge bidirectional dc-dc converter. The charger operates in two quadrants in the active-reactive power (PQ) power plane with five different operation modes (i.e., charging-only, charging-capacitive, charging-inductive, capacitive-only, and inductive-only). This paper also presents a unified controller to follow utility PQ commands in a smart grid environment. The cascaded two-stage system controller receives active and reactive power commands from the grid, and results in line current and battery charging current references while also providing a stable dynamic response. The vehicle's battery is not affected during reactive power operation in any of the operation modes. Testing the unified system controller with a 1.44 kVA experimental charger design demonstrates the successful implementation of reactive power support functionality of PEVs for future smart grid applications.",WOS:000350338100028,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kisacikoglu, M.

Utilization of the DLC technique in DG technology can confirm the continuous injection of maximum active power in fundamental frequency from the DG source to the power grid, compensating all the reactive power and harmonic current components of grid-connected loads through the integration of DG link into the grid.

426,"Sales of privately-owned plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are projected to increase dramatically in coming years and their charging will impact residential service transformer loads. Transformer life expectancy is strongly related to the cumulative effects of internal winding temperatures, which are a function of loading. Thermal models exist (e.g., IEEE Standard C57.91) for predicting these internal temperatures, the most sophisticated being the Annex G model. While this model has been validated with measurements from large power transformers, small residential service transformers have been given less attention. Given increasing PEV loads, a better understanding of service transformer aging could be useful in replacement planning processes. Empirical data from this paper indicate that the Annex G model over-estimates internal temperatures in small 25 kVA 65 degrees C rise mineral-oil-immersed transformers. This paper presents an alternative model to Annex G by using a genetic program. Empirical results using a thermally-instrumented transformer suggest that this model is both simpler and more accurate at tracking empirical transformer data. We conclude that one can use a simple thermal model in combination with data from advanced metering infrastructure to more accurately estimate service transformer lifetimes, and thus better plan for transformer replacement.",WOS:000350338100058,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Seier, A., Hines, P.

430,"This paper presents game-theoretic frameworks for demand response at both electricity market and consumer levels. First, the interaction between a demand response aggregator (DRA) and electricity generators is modeled as a Stackelberg game in which the DRA, as the leader of the game, makes demand reduction bids, and generators, as followers, compete for maximizing their profits based on the reduced demand. Next, the interaction between the DRA and consumers is modeled as a mechanism design problem wherein the DRA seeks to minimize the aggregate inconvenience of consumers while achieving the targeted load curtailment. The inconvenience function of each consumer is captured by a type value, which is used by the DRA to solve the load curtailment problem. A Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-based mechanism is proposed, which guarantees that each consumer reveals its true type value to the DRA. A case study of the Stackelberg game shows that, in the South Australian electricity market where there is significant renewable penetration, peak period demand response provides the maximum potential profit, but off-peak demand response even in a concentrated market is not financially attractive.",WOS:000350338100026,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Nekouei, E., Alpcan, T. and Chattopadhyay, D.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",21,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2367494,Mar,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,demand response,electricity market,game theory,side management,model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Cc4qn,748-758,14591,Journal Article,Game-Theoretic Frameworks for Demand Response in Electricity Markets,3,Game-Theoretic Frameworks for Demand Response in Electricity Markets,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000350338100026,6,2015

432,"This paper presents a new modeling framework for analysis of impact and scheduling of price-responsive as well as controllable loads in a three-phase unbalanced distribution system. The price-responsive loads are assumed to be linearly or exponentially dependent on price, i.e., demand reduces as price increases and vice versa. The effect of such uncontrolled price-responsive loads on the distribution feeder is studied as customers seek to reduce their energy cost. Secondly, a novel constant energy load model, which is controllable by the local distribution company (LDC), is proposed in this paper. A controllable load is one that can be scheduled by the LDC through remote signals, demand response programs, or customer-end home energy management systems. Minimization of cost of energy drawn by LDC, feeder losses, and customers cost pertaining to the controllable component of the load are considered as objectives from the LDCs and customers' perspective. The effect of a peak demand constraint on the controllability of the load is further examined. The proposed models are tested on two feeders: 1) the IEEE 13-node test feeder; and 2) a practical LDC feeder system. Detailed studies examine the operational aspects of price-responsive and controllable loads on the overall system. It is observed that the LDC controlled load model results in a more uniform system load profile, and that with a reduction in the peak demand cap, the energy drawn decreases, consequently reducing feeder losses and LDC's and customers' costs.",WOS:000350338100031,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Sharma, I., Bhattacharya, K. and Canizares, C.","Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",30,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2372674,Mar,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,demand response (dr),optimal feeder operation,price-responsive loads,three-phase unbalanced distribution system,demand response,model,strategies,elasticity,peak,,,,,,,,,,,English,Cc4qn,795-807,14593,Journal Article,Smart Distribution System Operations With Price-Responsive and Controllable Loads,2,Smart Distribution System Operations With Price-Responsive and Controllable Loads,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000350338100031,6,2015

435,"Smart transmission grids are intended to utilize various measurements for enhanced operation. In particular, synchronized phasor measurements have found many applications in this context. This paper presents a linear weighted least-squares (WLS) method for fault location estimation of transmission lines by synchronized voltage measurements. The measurements may be taken from the faulted line terminals or buses far from the faulted line. The circuit equations of the network are used to find the transfer function between the fault location and each voltage measurement. Next, two auxiliary variables are defined to transform the nonlinear fault location estimation problem into a linear WLS problem. A closed-form solution is then obtained for fault location. The use of multiple measurements provides the opportunity of identifying erroneous measurements by a statistical test. The linearity of the problem expedites both estimation and identification procedures. Moreover, the method requires neither to classify the fault type nor to estimate the fault resistance. Furthermore, transmission lines are modeled by distributed parameters so that the method can be applicable to long lines.

438,"As the penetration of renewable energy resources increases in distribution networks, so does the need to manage these resources in an effective manner. Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.",WOS:000350338100032,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Shirzeh, H., Naghdy, F., Ciufo, P. and Ros, M.","Univ Wollongong, Dept Informat, Wollongong, NSW 2500, Australia",36,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2363844,Mar,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,energy management,plug and play (pnp),reinforcement learning (rl),smart grid,team formation,optimal power-flow,distribution-systems,restoration,management,operation,framework,algorithm,,,,,,,,English,Cc4qn,808-818,14599,Journal Article,Balancing Energy in the Smart Grid Using Distributed Value Function (DVF),1,Balancing Energy in the Smart Grid Using Distributed Value Function (DVF),<Go to ISI>://WOS:000350338100032,6,2015
439,"This paper presents a novel hierarchical control approach and new mathematical optimization models of greenhouses, which can be readily incorporated into energy hub management systems (EHMSs) in the context of smart grids to optimize the operation of their energy systems. In greenhouses, artificial lighting, CO2 production, and climate control systems consume considerable energy; thus, a mathematical model of greenhouses appropriate for their optimal operation is proposed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing greenhouse control systems. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of greenhouses; in particular, inside temperature and humidity, CO2 concentration, and lighting levels should be kept within acceptable ranges. Therefore, the proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing control systems in greenhouses. Effects of uncertainty in electricity price and weather forecast on optimal operation of the storage facilities are studied through Monte Carlo simulations.

440,"Moving toward a carbon free energy system has become an objective for many countries nowadays. Among other changes, the electrification of strategic sectors, such as heating and transportation, is inevitable. As a consequence, the current power system load will substantially increase. In this context, the nature of the expected loads (heat pumps, plug-in electric vehicles, etc.) makes the low voltage (LV) networks specially targeted. A promising solution to overcome the challenges resulting from their grid integration is demand response (DR). This paper introduces a hierarchical structure for controlling the DR of a LV grid. This is designed to maximize the grid utilization, thereby reducing the need for reinforcement; accommodate the maximum number of flexible loads; and satisfy the power and comfort requirements from each of the consumers in the network. The validation of the proposed concept is made using a model of an LV network currently operative in Denmark.

441,"Managing the widely distributed wood pole assets owned by typical electric power utilities in the USA is challenging in the absence of appropriate analytical tools. The traditional method of inspecting poles by headquarters or strictly age is insufficient for effective management since natural hazards cause the largest instantaneous pole replacements. A probabilistic framework is developed and presented in this paper to address this issue. Fragility assessment is conducted using Latin hypercube sampling to estimate pole failure probabilities conditional on wind speed intensities. Failure probability estimates are obtained using age-dependent fragility functions and appropriate distribution functions for maximum 3 s wind gust speeds. Pole locations from an electric power utility's database management system were imported into ArcMap, a component of Environmental Systems Research Institute geospatial processing program. Age distributions were extracted by county and used to estimate expected pole failures. A sort-algorithm on the failures-the inspection order indices gives the proposed appropriate order of pole locations to be inspected. These calculated values were added as a data layer into ArcMap generating a geospatial visualization of both the orders of pole inspections and probabilistic pole loss estimates for the electric utility by counties. Applying the framework will increase utilities' visibility into the vulnerability of their pole plants.

442,"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are expected to become widespread in the near future. However, high penetration of PHEVs can overload the distribution system. In smart grid, the charging of PHEVs can be controlled to reduce the peak load, known as demand-side management (DSM). In this paper, we focus on the DSM for PHEV charging at low-voltage transformers (LVTs). The objective is to flatten the load curve of LVTs, while satisfying each consumer's requirement for their PHEV to be charged to the required level by the specified time. We first formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem and then propose a decentralized water-filling-based algorithm to solve it. A moving horizon approach is utilized to handle the random arrival of PHEVs and the inaccuracy of the forecast nonPHEV load. We focus on decentralized solutions so that computational load can be shared by individual PHEV chargers and the algorithm is scalable.

444,"If several feeders are interrupted in a severe accident, distribution networks should be restored by reconfiguring switches automatically with smart grid technologies. Although there have been several restoration algorithms developed to find the new network configuration, they might fail to restore the whole network if the network were critically damaged. The network's design has to guarantee that it is restorable under any possible failure for secure power delivery, but it is a computationally hard task to examine all possible failures in a large-scale network with complex electrical constraints. This paper proposes a novel method to find all the critical (unrestorable) line cuts with great efficiency to verify the network design. The proposed method first runs a fast screening algorithm based on hitting set enumeration; the algorithm selects suspicious cuts without naively examining all possible cuts. Next, unrestorable cuts are identified from the suspicious ones with another algorithm, which strictly tests the restorability of the network under each suspicious cut without redundantly repeating heavy power flow calculations. Thorough experiments on two distribution networks reveal that the proposed method can find thousands of unrestorable cuts from the trillions of possible cuts in a large 432-Bus network with no significant false negatives.",WOS:000350338100036,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Inoue, T., Yasuda, N., Kawano, S., Takenobu, Y., Minato, S. and Hayashi, Y.","Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Exploratory Res Adv Technol ERATO, Minato Discrete Struct Manipulat Syst Project, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600814, Japan",22,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2359114,Mar,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,distribution network,hitting set,network reconfiguration,restoration,zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (zdd),distribution-systems,service restoration,loss reduction,reliability evaluation,reconfiguration,,,,,,,,,,English,Cc4qn,843-852,14605,Journal Article,Distribution Network Verification for Secure Restoration by Enumerating All Critical Failures,0,Distribution Network Verification for Secure Restoration by Enumerating All Critical Failures,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000350338100036,6,2015

As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, a competition among EVCSs to attract EVs is inevitable. Thereby, each EVCS sets its electricity price to maximize its revenue by taking into account the competition with neighboring EVCSs. We analyze the competitive interactions between EVCSs using game theory, where relevant physical constraints such as the transmission line capacity, the distance between EV and EVCS, and the number of charging outlets at the EVCSs are taken into account. We show that the game played by EVCSs is a supermodular game and there exists a unique pure Nash equilibrium for best response algorithms with arbitrary initial policy.

455,"Demand-management programs intend to maintain supply-demand balance and reduce the total energy cost. In this paper, we propose a user-aware demand-management approach that manages residential loads while taking into consideration user preferences. Maximizing users' savings and comfort can be two contradicting objectives. We identify a trade-off between these two objectives and propose an energy consumption optimization model, as well as a game theoretic approach to take this trade-off into account. User comfort is modeled in a simple yet effective way that considers waiting time, type of appliance, as well as a weight factor to prioritize comfort over savings.

456,"Service restoration is important in distribution networks following an outage. During the restoration process, the system operating conditions will fluctuate, including variation of the load demand and the output from distributed generators (DGs). These variations are hard to be predicted and the load demands are roughly estimated because of absence of real-time measurements, which can significantly affect the restoration strategy. In this paper, we report a robust restoration decision-making model based on information gap decision theory, which takes into account the uncertainty in the load and output of the DGs. For a given bounded uncertain set of parameters, the solutions can ensure feasibility and that an objective does not fall below a given threshold. We describe the implementation of a robust optimization algorithm based on a mixed integer quadratic constraint programming restoration model, the objective of which is to restore maximal outage loads.

457,"Aiming at eliminating the current drawbacks that exists in condition-based maintenance (CBM) decision-making, such defects as single objective model, difficulty in controlling the process, and individual rather than group decision-making, this paper proposed a multiobjective group decision-making CBM model based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory by establishing maintenance decision-making framework, setting index system and quantifying all the indices. The model takes decision-making indices as evidence sources and maintenance schemes as knowledge framework, solving the problem of difficulty in demarcation of objectives and constraints. Maintenance schemes are achieved according to mean residual life prediction based on maintenance guidance and current condition quantified by health index to estimate the most appropriately maintenance interval. After that, standardized values of indices under each scheme are normalized into mass function of D-S evidence theory. Then, considering comprehensive weights of indices decision-makers, multiobjective group decision-making results of maintenance types, and time intervals are obtained. Finally, a numerical case is studied to illustrate the proposed modeling process, and demonstrates that the model can effectively realize multiobjective group decision-making, as well as considering the intentions of decision makers while all indices can reach global optimum.",WOS:000350338100060,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Wang, H.

458,"This paper presents a flexible and robust numerical algorithm for fault location on transmission lines. The algorithm does not require line parameters to locate the fault, which is an advance over fault locators that do require such information. Line parameters are only approximately constant; they vary with different loading and weather conditions, which affects the accuracy of existing fault location algorithms. Thus, an approach which does not require line parameters would be more robust, accurate, and flexible. Accurately, locating faults on transmission lines is vital for expediting their repair, so the proposed solution could lead to an improvement in the security and quality of the energy supply. Development of the proposed algorithm was facilitated by new smart grid technologies in the field of wide-area monitoring, protection, and control. The proposed algorithm is based on emerging synchronized measurement technology, using synchronized data sampling at both line terminals; however, the ""SynchroCheck"" procedure is also proposed as a means of accurately locating faults when data sampling synchronization has been lost.

The optimization algorithm is made up of two phases: 1) an optimal power flow calculation; and 2) a linear optimization. The former, while taking into account the power system technical constraints, sets the upper bounds to the recharge power for each vehicle and the latter defines the recharge profiles of each PEV. In order to test the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm, a case study was set up. The connection of 300 PEVs to the Conseil International des Grands Reseaux lectriques (CIGRE) European low voltage benchmark network has been simulated. The proposed algorithm has been compared with a nonoptimal charging strategy, which assigns a flat charging profile by dividing the energy requested by the desired recharge time. The results show that the optimization algorithm both complies with the energy requests set by the end users and with the technical operation limits of the network.

In this paper, the control strategies that can mitigate or eliminate the accelerated aging that could result from load peaks caused by PEV charging is developed. The aging model makes it possible to develop charging control strategies that protect the transformer system while maximizing overall PEV charging quality.

475,"In the context of energy saving and carbon emission reduction, the electric vehicle (EV) has been identified as a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuel-driven vehicles. Due to a different refueling manner and driving characteristic, the introduction of EVs to the current logistics system can make a significant impact on the vehicle routing and the associated operation costs. Based on the traveling salesman problem, this paper proposes a new optimal EV route model considering the fast-charging and regular-charging under the time-of-use price in the electricity market. The proposed model aims to minimize the total distribution costs of the EV route while satisfying the constraints of battery capacity, charging time and delivery/pickup demands, and the impact of vehicle loading on the unit electricity consumption per mile. To solve the proposed model, this paper then develops a learnable partheno-genetic algorithm with integration of expert knowledge about EV charging station and customer selection.

The operators acknowledge network automation as an efficient investment toward a better service reliability. This paper aims to provide a new long-term cost/benefit analysis for an optimal level of distribution network automation. In the analysis, reduction in customer outage cost is considered as the benefit of implementing automation systems with capital investment, and annual operation and maintenance costs. In the Finnish regulation model, there is a special incentive based on customer outage cost reduction. As the main contribution of this paper, the impact of earth fault events and their required time-consuming fault management process is taken into account within the calculation of the benefit of automation systems. The solution of the analysis consists of the optimal number and location of remote-controlled sectionalizing switches, which are building blocks of automation systems.

478,"In modern power systems and electricity markets, demand response (DR) programs play an important role enabling the mitigation of critical load periods or price-peaking scenarios, thereby improving system reliability. Price fluctuations, in forward or real-time markets, can be an effective price-based DR mechanism for curtailing or shifting load. However, using dynamic pricing to achieve a desired load profile requires both an accurate demand forecast and knowledge of the price elasticity of demand, which is notoriously difficult to estimate. The limited accuracy of these parameter estimates is the main source of uncertainty limiting appropriate DR implementation. In this paper, we present a novel DR scheme that avoids the need to predict the price elasticity of demand or demand forecast, yet still delivers a significant DR. This is done based on the consumers' submissions of candidate load profiles ranked in the preference order. The load aggregator then performs the final selection of individual load profiles subject to the total system cost minimization.

480,"The purpose of underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) is to maintain the frequency of an interconnected or island power system within permissible limits in case of severe power deficits. Thus, the proper performance of UFLS scheme is of great importance. In hybrid power systems, disconnecting and connecting the power generation sources and loads result in variations in the system parameters. Moreover, the output power of some distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaic (PV) or wind turbine generator (WTG), might change during the load shedding process. These factors may affect the performance of the load shedding scheme and decrease the reliability of power system. Hence, in this paper, a UFLS scheme is proposed that has two advantages: 1) it is independent of power system parameters; and 2) it considers power generation variations during the load shedding process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed load shedding method, simulation studies are carried out on a hybrid power system including PV, WTG, fuel cell, diesel generator, and battery energy storage system.

The proposed method utilizes frequency and three-phase voltage signals recorded by phasor measurement unit at the point of common coupling of unit transformers to the high voltage grid. In the simulation setup, by taking the hybrid data simulation technique in use, the signals are being injected to the subsystem of generating units through a voltage source, which models the truncated external grid. The measured and simulated active power oscillations are then compared to each other and the effects of generating unit parameters on the oscillation mismatches are extracted. The maximum amplitude and damping ratio of oscillations are two main aspects of the observed mismatches. To recognize the most effective parameters on these aspects, a sensitivity analysis technique is applied. Next, identified parameters are adjusted to calibrate the generating unit dynamic model. Finally, quantitative and qualitative perspectives of the proposed method are investigated through different sorts of actual disturbances.

The proposed controller is based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques to approximate the optimal control policy according to the interaction between the controller and the power plant. Compared to existing ADP approaches with one action network and one critic network, our GrHDP architecture introduces an additional network, i.e., the reference network, to form an internal goal/reward representation. This better mapping between the system state and the control action significantly improves the control performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated via two cases.

The distribution network operator (DNO) and each MG are considered as distinct entities with individual objectives to minimize the operation costs. It is assumed that both the dispatchable and nondispatchable distributed generators (DGs) exist in the networked MGs. In order to achieve the equilibrium among all entities and take into account the uncertainties of DG outputs, we formulate the problem as a stochastic bi-level problem with the DNO in the upper level and MGs in the lower level. Each level consists of two stages. The first stage is to determine base generation setpoints based on the load and nondispatchable DG output forecasts and the second stage is to adjust the generation outputs based on the realized scenarios. A scenario reduction method is applied to enhance a tradeoff between the accuracy of the solution and the computational burden.

486,"With the emerging area of smart grids, one critical challenge faced by administrators of wide-area measurement systems is to analyze and model streaming data with limited resources on their embedded controllers. Usually, streaming data can be modeled as a multiset where each data item has its own frequency. In this paper, we study the problem on how to generate histograms of data items based on their frequency, so we can identify various issues such as power line tripping or line faults under constraints. The primary challenge for achieving this goal using conventional methods is that keeping an individual counter for each unique type of data is too memory-consuming, slow, and costly. In this paper, we describe a novel data structure and its associated algorithms, called the loglog bloom filter, for this purpose. This data structure extends the classical bloom filter with a recent technique called probabilistic counting, so it can effectively generate histograms for streaming data in one pass with sub-linear overhead. Therefore, this method is suitable for data processing in smart grids, where limited computational resources are available on the controllers. We analyze the performance, trade-offs, and capacity of this data structure, and evaluate it with real data traces collected through the frequency disturbance recorders deployed for the FNET/GridEye infrastructure.

487,"In this paper, a double-quadrant state-of-charge (SoC)-based droop control method for distributed energy storage system is proposed to reach the proper power distribution in autonomous dc microgrids. In order to prolong the lifetime of the energy storage units (ESUs) and avoid the overuse of a certain unit, the SoC of each unit should be balanced and the injected/output power should be gradually equalized. Droop control as a decentralized approach is used as the basis of the power sharing method for distributed energy storage units. In the charging process, the droop coefficient is set to be proportional to the nth order of SoC, while in the discharging process, the droop coefficient is set to be inversely proportional to the nth order of SoC. Since the injected/output power is inversely proportional to the droop coefficient, it is obtained that in the charging process the ESU with higher SoC absorbs less power, while the one with lower SoC absorbs more power. Meanwhile, in the discharging process, the ESU with higher SoC delivers more power and the one with lower SoC delivers less power. Hence, SoC balancing and injected/output power equalization can be gradually realized. The exponent n of SoC is employed in the control diagram to regulate the speed of SoC balancing. It is found that with larger exponent n, the balancing speed is higher.

We assume that the MG aggregator sells electricity to customers at a predefined retail rate and it also offers customers various contracts for adjusting their loads. Our design objective is to determine the optimal hourly bids that the MG aggregator submits to the day-ahead market to maximize its profit. To deal with various uncertainties, a risk-constrained scenario-based stochastic programming framework is proposed where the MG aggregator's risk aversion is modeled using conditional value at risk method. The proposed formulation enables customers' demand response (DR) aggregation to be integrated into the operation of the MG aggregator via contractual agreements. This design is not only beneficial for both MG aggregator and customers, but also facilitates the operation of the system operator (SO), since a single entity (i.e., the MG aggregator) is visible to the SO instead of two separate entities (i.e., a MG aggregator and a DR aggregator).

493,"Demand response (DR) programs are implemented to encourage consumers to reduce their electricity demand when needed, e.g., at peak-load hours, by adjusting their controllable load. In this paper, our focus is on controllable load types that are associated with dynamic systems and can be modeled using differential equations. Examples of such load types include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; water heating; and refrigeration. In this regard, we propose a new DR model based on a two-level differential game framework. At the beginning of each DR interval, the price is decided by the upper level (aggregator, utility, or market) given the total demand of users in the lower level. At the lower level, for each player (residential or commercial buildings that are equipped with automated load control systems and local renewable generators), given the price from the upper level, the electricity usage of air conditioning unit, and the battery storage charging/discharging schedules, are controlled in order to minimize the user's total electricity cost. The optimal user strategies are derived using the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also show that the proposed game can converge to a feedback Nash equilibrium. Based on the effect of real-time pricing on users' daily demand profile, the simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed game and show how we can optimize consumers' electricity cost in the presence of time-varying prices.",WOS:000346731400029,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Forouzandehmehr, N., Esmalifalak, M., Mohsenian-Rad, H. and Han, Z.","Univ Houston, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA",25,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2357346,Jan,1949-3053,1,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,autonomous demand response,real-time pricing,smart building,stochastic differential game,direct load control,management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Ax1um,291-300,14654,Journal Article,Autonomous Demand Response Using Stochastic Differential Games,4,Autonomous Demand Response Using Stochastic Differential Games,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000346731400029,6,2015

495,"Microgrid is a key enabling solution to future smart grids by integrating distributed renewable generators and storage systems to efficiently serve the local demand. However, due to the random and intermittent characteristics of renewable energy, new challenges arise for the reliable operation of microgrids. To address this issue, we study in this paper the real-time energy management for a single microgrid system that constitutes a renewable generation system, an energy storage system, and an aggregated load. We model the renewable energy offset by the load over time, termed net energy profile, to be practically predictable, but with finite errors that can be arbitrarily distributed. We aim to minimize the total energy cost (modeled as sum of time-varying strictly convex functions) of the conventional energy drawn from the main grid over a finite horizon by jointly optimizing the energy charged/discharged to/from the storage system over time subject to practical load and storage constraints. To solve this problem in real time, we propose a new off-line optimization approach to devise the online algorithm. In this approach, we first assume that the net energy profile is perfectly predicted or known ahead of time, under which we derive the optimal off-line energy scheduling solution in closed-form. Next, inspired by the optimal off-line solution, we propose a sliding-window based online algorithm for real-time energy management under the practical setup of noisy predicted net energy profile with arbitrary errors. Finally, we conduct simulations based on the real wind generation data of the Ireland power system to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, as compared with other heuristically designed algorithms, as well as the conventional dynamic programming based solution.",WOS:000346731400013,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Rahbar, K., Xu, J. and Zhang, R.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore",26,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2359004,Jan,1949-3053,1,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,convex optimization,distributed storage,energy management,microgrid,online algorithm,renewable energy,smart grid,system,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Ax1um,124-134,14656,Journal Article,Real-Time Energy Storage Management for Renewable Integration in Microgrid: An Off-Line Optimization Approach,18,Real-Time Energy Storage Management for Renewable Integration in Microgrid: An Off-Line Optimization Approach,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000346731400013,6,2015
496,"Global warming and environmental pollution concerns have promoted dramatic integrations of renewable energy sources all over the world. Associated with benefits of environmental conservation, essentially uncertain and variable characteristics of such energy resources significantly challenge the operation of power systems. In order to implement reliable and economical operations, a robust energy and reserve dispatch (RERD) model is proposed in this paper, in which the operating decisions are divided into pre-dispatch and re-dispatch. A robust feasibility constraint set is imposed on pre-dispatch variables, such that operation constraints can be recovered by adjusting re-dispatch after wind generation realizes. The model is extended to more general dispatch decision making problems involving uncertainties in the framework of adjustable robust optimization. By revealing the convexity of the robust feasibility constraint set, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming based oracle is presented to verify the robust feasibility of pre-dispatch decisions. A cutting plane algorithm is established to solve associated optimization problems.

497,"An average absolute frequency deviation value based active islanding detection technique is proposed in this paper. The inverter's classical q-axis current controller is modeled with a continuous periodic reference current of a small value. During the loss of mains, the island's frequency deviates with respect to the variation in the reference current; this is detected by making the use of an average absolute frequency deviation value. In case of a stable island formation, there is a small periodic frequency deviation owing to the small value of the periodic reference current, and the frequency deviation is so small that it falls inside the nondetection zone (NDZ) of the frequency relay. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it detects the stable island formation but without forcing the island to lose its stable operation. In case of nonislanding switching events, which may transiently impose a significant deviation in the frequency, the possibility of false detection is eliminated by reconfirming the occurrence of islanding once it is suspected. The reference current is kept to a small value to limit the degradation of the power quality and the power factor.

503,"As a consequence of the developments in electric transportation and the evolution toward smart grids, large-scale deployment of smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) becomes feasible. This leads to opportunities for different market parties to use the flexibility of EVs for various objectives that may be conflicting and result in a nonoptimal shifting of peak demands for the distribution grids. In this paper, we assess the financial impact of various EV charging strategies on distribution grids. We compare a strategy that minimizes network peak loads (from a network operators perspective) with a strategy to minimize charging costs (from the perspective of a commercial party). In a scenario with a high wind penetration in the system, the electricity prices are, for a significant part, determined by the instantaneous wind production. Therefore, we additionally study the effect of wind energy on electricity prices and, consequently, on the resulting EV load and network impacts. We obtain the network costs by calculating the impacts expressed in the net present value (NPV) of the investments costs and energy losses. We found that, in the case where EVs are basing their charge schedules on electricity prices, the increase in NPV compared with a no EV scenario was found to be 25% higher than in the case where the extra peak load due to EVs was minimized. The large difference in network impacts between the price based and network based charging strategies was only observed in the case with a high wind penetration. The results strongly suggest that the situation where EVs are controlled with a strategy to minimize charging costs that does not take the distribution grids into account may not lead to an optimal situation when the entire electricity delivery system is regarded.",WOS:000346731400033,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Veldman, E. and Verzijlbergh, R.

A real-time optimal dispatching algorithm is proposed and developed to optimally dispatch a privately owned CES unit to generate revenue by exploiting arbitrage opportunities in the day-ahead/week-ahead electricity market. Due to its special characteristics, CES can provide significantly more financial and technical benefits in a weekly scheduling compared with common daily scheduling. The electricity price modulation is proposed as a new approach to competitively offer subsidy by the utility regulator to CES owners to fill the gap between current and a stable expected rate of return. Using real-world price data from the Ontario wholesale electricity market, the method is validated. The results reveal significant benefits of weekly usage as compared to daily usage of CES.

An analytical formulation is presented to quantify the economic benefits of embedded HVDC by modeling its flow control as an injection-extraction pair in the economic dispatch of the transmission grid. A computationally efficient algorithm is proposed to rank the potential locations of such embedded HVDC. The algorithm is based on expected economic dispatch cost reduction weighted by the historical line shadow prices. The use of a distribution of historical data as a means of weighting also allows for incorporation of diurnal and seasonal influences on congestion patterns.

511,"Smart meters, designed for information collection and system monitoring in smart grid, report fine-grained power consumption to utility providers. With these highly accurate profiles of energy usage, however, it is possible to identify consumers' specific activities or behavior patterns, thereby giving rise to serious privacy concerns. This paper addresses these concerns by designing a cost-effective and privacy-preserving energy management technique that uses a rechargeable battery. From a holistic perspective, a dynamic programming framework is designed for consumers to strike a tradeoff between smart meter data privacy and the cost of electricity. In general, a major challenge in solving dynamic programming problems lies in the need for the knowledge of future electricity consumption events. By exploring the underlying structure of the original problem, an equivalent problem is derived, which can be solved by using only the current observations. An online control algorithm is then developed to solve the equivalent problem based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. It is shown that without the knowledge of the statistics of the time-varying load requirements and the electricity price processes, the proposed online control algorithm, parametrized by a positive value V, is within O(1/V) of the optimal solution to the original problem, where the maximum value of V is limited by the battery capacity.

512,"The concept of dynamic rating (DR) implies that the capacity of a component varies dynamically as a function of external parameters, while the rating traditionally is based on the worst-case. The value of DR thus lies in utilizing existing equipment to a greater extent. By implementing DR and correlating the new ratings with wind power generation, more generation can be implemented. The aim is hence to facilitate connection of renewable electricity production. This paper provides two main contributions: 1) a general dynamic line rating (DLR) calculation model on overhead lines; and 2) an economic optimization simulation model regarding wind power integration comparing DLR with more traditional approaches. These models can both be implemented together, but also separately. The DLR calculation model is easy to use by companies in daily operation where the dynamic line capacity is calculated as a function of static line capacity, wind speed, and ambient temperature. The DLR calculation model is furthermore compared with more comprehensive calculations that validate that the model is accurate enough. This paper also provides an application study where both proposed models are exemplified together and evaluated.

513,"In order to study the impact of dynamic demand response in the future smart grid, we examine in an abstract framework how a tradeoff between efficiency and risk arises under different market architectures. We first examine the system performance under noncooperative and cooperative market architectures. The statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes show that, although the noncooperative load scheduling scheme leads to an efficiency loss, the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail, resulting in less frequent aggregate demand spikes. Cooperative dynamic demand response, on the other hand, makes the market place more efficient at the cost of increased risk of aggregate demand spikes. The market architecture determines the locus of the system performance with respect to the tradeoff curve. We also investigate how a properly designed real-time electricity pricing mechanism can help the system operator achieve a target tradeoff between efficiency and risk in a noncooperative market. We further provide a convex characterization of the Pareto front of system performance measures, which serves as a benchmark of the tradeoffs for the system operator to evaluate the pricing rules.",WOS:000346731400028,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Huang, Q.

514,"Traditional proportional integral (PI) control has been extensively used for power control of voltage source converters in microgrid systems. Previous studies show that fixed-gain PI controllers cannot easily adapt to power changes, disturbances, and parameters variation, especially in large microgrids; hence the need for continuous algorithms to adjust the controller gains over the transients cannot be neglected. In this paper, a novel online tuning algorithm for PI controllers is proposed and implemented in a microgrid system. In this algorithm, which is based on the neuro-dynamic programming concept, a fuzzy critic is employed to evaluate the credibility of the control system performance and provide an evaluation signal, which is then used in the gain-tuning process. The PI controller gains are updated in an optimization process based on steepest decent rule so that the evaluation signal produced by the critic is minimized. The developed control structure, which is named critic-based self-tuning PI controller, is tested in a microgrid system with different penetrations of distributed generators and operational scenarios. The simulation results verify that implementation of a heuristic gain-tuning algorithm results in a model-independent controller with increased adaptivity compared with conventional PI control. Furthermore, due to simple learning rules, the convergence time is significantly reduced and the transient response is improved.

515,"This paper investigates the real-time control and energy management of a dc microgrid incorporating hybrid energy sources with various loading schemes. In the proposed dc microgrid, a supercapacitor bank, a power buffer, and a pulse load are directly connected to a dc bus. The proposed system configuration highly improves the grid redundancy and reduces the total power losses. Moreover, the supercapacitor bank not only supplies the pulse load, but also supports the grid during transient periods when it is highly loaded. However, the energy management and control of such a system is more complex, since the heavy pulse load can cause high power pulsation and voltage drop. To reduce the adverse effects of the pulse load, a new real-time energy management system (EMS) with an adaptive energy calculator (AEC) based on the moving average measurement technique is developed. The proposed microgrid was implemented in hardware and experimentally tested. The results were compared with other methods, such as direct voltage control and continuous current averaging approaches.

In the grid-connected mode, the voltage-sourced converter is operated in the active and reactive power (PQ) control mode, where a conventional control scheme is used to control the active and reactive power exchange with the grid. In the islanded mode, the proposed FLC is used to control the voltage of the islanded system despite the load variability and uncertainties. In addition, this paper also presents the use of the black-box nonlinear optimization technique to tune the parameters of the membership functions of the FLC in order to achieve optimal performance. The salient features of the proposed FLC are: 1) efficient to deal with the nonlinear systems; 2) design does not depend on the mathematical model of the system; and 3) less sensitive to the parameters variation than the conventional controllers. The frequency of the islanded system is dictated through the use of an internal oscillator. The effectiveness of the proposed FLC in controlling the voltage of the islanded system, irrespective of the load variability, is extensively validated based on simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.

V2G has been proven to reduce the EV owner cost, support the power grid, and generate revenues for the EV owner.

The aggregator combines the capacities of many EVs and bids their aggregated capacity into electricity markets. In this paper, an optimal bidding of ancillary services coordinated across different markets, namely regulation and spinning reserves, is proposed. This coordinated bidding considers electricity market uncertainties using fuzzy optimization.

The new topology uses a crowbar bidirectional thyristor switch across the output terminals of a conventional back-to-back DVR. In the event of a load short, the DVR controller will deactivate the faulty phase of the DVR and activate its crowbar thyristor to insert the DVR filter reactor into the grid to limit the fault current. A fault condition is detected by sensing the load current and its rate of change. The FCL-DVR will operate with different protection strategies under different fault conditions. Design of the FCL-DVR involves selecting important parameters, such as DVR power rating, dc link voltage of the DVR, output filter reactors and capacitors, and grid-tied transformers is proposed.

521,"The concept of electric spring (ES) has been proposed recently as an effective means of distributed voltage control. The idea is to regulate the voltage across the critical (C) loads while allowing the noncritical (NC) impedance-type loads (e.g., water heaters) to vary their power consumption and thus contribute to demand-side response. In this paper, a comparison is made between distributed voltage control using ES against the traditional single point control with STATic COMpensator (STATCOM). For a given range of supply voltage variation, the total reactive capacity required for each option to produce the desired voltage regulation at the point of connection is compared. A simple case study with a single ES and STATCOM is presented first to show that the ES and STATCOM require comparable reactive power to achieve similar voltage regulation. Comparison between a STATCOM and ES is further substantiated through similar case studies on the IEEE 13-bus test feeder system and also on a part of the distribution network in Sha Lo Wan Bay, Hong Kong. In both cases, it turns out that a group of ESs achieves better total voltage regulation than STATCOM with less overall reactive power capacity.

525,"Energy storage devices (ESDs) have the potential to revolutionize the electricity grid by allowing the smoothing of variable-energy generator output and the time-shifting of demand away from peak times. A common approach to study the impact of ESDs on energy systems is by modeling them as electric circuits in simulations. Although recent circuit models are becoming more accurate, to obtain statistically valid results, extensive simulations need to be run. In some cases, existing datasets are not large enough to obtain statistically significant results. The impact of ESDs on energy systems has also been recently studied using analytical methods, but usually by assuming ideal ESD behavior, such as infinite ESD charging and discharging rates, and zero self-discharge. However, real-life ESDs are far from ideal. We investigate the effect of nonideal ESD behavior on system performance, presenting an analytical ESD model that retains much of the simplicity of an ideal ESD, yet captures many (though not all) nonideal behaviors for a class of ESDs that includes all battery technologies and compressed air energy storage systems.

526,"With the cost of computation and information distribution continually decreasing, as well as accelerating deployment of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs), there is an opportunity to create an efficient electricity distribution and electrified transportation network by combining these technologies. This paper describes a technology whereby renewable energy can be seamlessly integrated into a local network keeping the network load constant, but using all the fluctuating energy locally when it is available. This technique is a type of demand side management (DSM) whereby consumption of deferrable electric loads is adjusted in order to provide maximum utility to the electricity network without impacting the end user. Many household loads are already suitable for DSM, and with an increased uptake of EVs, a sizable amount of demand could be controlled in this manner, which could in turn significantly improve the viability of fluctuating energy sources. In this paper a new DSM scheme, termed localized demand control (LDC), has been designed, and its operation and performance is compared with the classical DSM method of dynamic demand control. It is shown that the system dynamics of both controllers are similar, but LDC is intrinsically more stable over a wider range of applications.",WOS:000344542000010,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Lee, J.

528,"For distribution networks with a high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems, overvoltage is a common and major issue that needs be addressed to not only assure reliable and secure system operation, but also to fully utilize PV generation capacity. A new real power capping method is proposed in this paper to prevent overvoltages by adaptively setting the power caps for PV inverters in real time. The proposed method can maintain voltage profiles below a preset upper limit while maximizing the PV generation and fairly distributing the real power curtailments among all the PV systems in the network. As a result, each of the PV systems in the network has equal opportunity to generate electricity and shares the responsibility of voltage regulation. The method does not require global information and can be implemented either under a centralized supervisory control scheme or in a distributed way via consensus control.

At the same time, the need for increased number of small distributed and renewable energy resources can exceed the capabilities of an available computational resource. Therefore, the recent literature has seen a significant research effort on dividing the control task among different units, which gives rise to the development of several distributed techniques.

By employing the locational marginal pricing model, the proposed DCPs are able to reflect the real congestion cost and further direct the schedule of the responses of electric demands.

Aiming at maximizing the average profit of a PET in long term under the constraint of state of charge (SoC) dynamics of PET battery, this problem is formulated as a constrained binary programming problem in infinite time horizon. The main contribution of this paper consists of three parts. First, because the original infinite binary programming problem cannot be directly solved, it is divided into a series of periodic subproblems. Each of the subproblems is in finite time horizon and much easier to solve, which is also proven rigorously to be equivalent to the original one. Second, an efficient and optimal algorithm is proposed to solve the finite time constrained binary programming subproblem, which also yields the optimal initial SoC of PET.

This paper proposes an internal power balancing strategy for FCS based on flywheel energy storage system (ESS) which is able to mitigate those impacts by ramping the initial power peak. The balancing strategy was implemented in a distributed manner to grid and flywheel interfacing converters by means of distributed bus signaling (DBS) method.

It can be shown that the optimal charging schedule smooths out the energy consumption over time so as to minimize the total energy cost. In practice, however, it is hard to smooth out the energy consumption perfectly, because the future PEV charging demand is unknown at the moment when the charging rate of an existing PEV needs to be determined. In this paper, we propose an online coordinated charging decision ( ORCHARD) algorithm, which minimizes the energy cost without knowing the future information. Through rigorous proof, we show that ORCHARD is strictly feasible in the sense that it guarantees to fulfill all charging demands before due time. Meanwhile, it achieves the best known competitive ratio of 2.39. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a novel reduced-complexity algorithm to replace the standard convex optimization techniques used in ORCHARD. Through extensive simulations, we show that the average performance gap between ORCHARD and the offline optimal solution, which utilizes the complete future information, is as small as 6.5%.

In the first loop, hourly dispatches are scheduled for on-load tap changer (OLTC), capacitor banks (CBs), and static var compensators (SVCs) based on forecasted load and PV power output so as to minimize power losses and voltage deviations. The second loop is triggered when large variations of PV power output caused by rapid cloud movement happen. All SVCs and CBs become self-controlled based on local voltage measurements with the single control objective to minimize voltage deviations. SVCs will operate firstly to flatten the voltage profile.

Therefore, questions naturally arise as to when the increased data-dependence may be considered excessive. Two practical considerations emerge: 1) communications and computational overhead, in which redundant and irrelevant information acquisition and use results in heavy computational burden with limited performance return; and 2) increasing risks of power system disruption due to information delay from communication congestion or cyber attack. One strategy to improve smart grid resilience is to determine the appropriate degree of dependence on cyber information to balance performance with overhead and risk. In this paper, we present a hierarchical cyber-physical multiagent model of smart grid system operation based on flocking theory in the context of the transient stability problem.

One benefit is the continuous assessment of insulation degradation within distribution transformers, which is commonly referred to as a loss of life assessment. Calculating the expended life of a transformer consists of determining its winding hotspot temperature, which fluctuates with customer demand, ambient temperature, and cooling characteristics. Most residential transformers in service today do not possess the ability to connect to a smart grid communication system for continuous monitoring; therefore, they rely upon fusing for protection against extreme loading conditions. Smart meters can provide utility companies with the information required to identify distribution transformers that are experiencing higher than rated losses that can ultimately reduce their expected life.

The available power from the renewable DG units ensures restoration of more number of affected customers, thus, improving overall system reliability. In this paper, a probabilistic based analytical method is developed to assess system reliability in terms of system average interruption duration index and system average interruption frequency index for distribution feeders containing dispatchable and nondispatchable renewable DG units. The proposed method has been developed by implementing DG side restoration with comprehensive technical considerations, including possible failures of DG units, time-dependent patterns of load demand and DG power output, and single-stage and two-stage restoration.

545,"Wide-area power system stabilizer (WPSS) is one of the most potentially effective approaches to damp interarea low frequency oscillations in power systems. When WPSS is implemented in a real project, emphasis should be put on feedback signal delay problem. In order to intensively study the delay of phasor measurement unit data, field tests have been carried out in Guizhou power grid (GZPG), and results show that, in the long-term, the delay might change remarkably under some circumstances, such as when route switches or communication load increases. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive time delay compensation method to deal with such kind of delay. Bounded random delay is divided into several intervals and compensators are designed for each delay interval. Then appropriate compensators will be selected according to the delay measured online, based on the switching rules that is also demonstrated in this paper. The delay used here is the average delay before the compensator switching. The proposed compensator is demonstrated in a two area power system. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed adaptive compensator. A comparison with conventional methods is also presented.

546,"To enhance environmental sustainability, many countries will electrify their transportation systems in their future smart city plans, so the number of electric vehicles (EVs) running in a city will grow significantly. There are many ways to recharge EVs' batteries and charging stations will be considered as the main source of energy. The locations of charging stations are critical; they should not only be pervasive enough such that an EV anywhere can easily access a charging station within its driving range, but also widely spread so that EVs can cruise around the whole city upon being recharged. Based on these new perspectives, we formulate the EV charging station placement problem (EVCSPP) in this paper. We prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard. We also propose four solution methods to tackle EVCSPP, and evaluate their performance on various artificial and practical cases. As verified by the simulation results, the methods have their own characteristics and they are suitable for different situations depending on the requirements for solution quality, algorithmic efficiency, problem size, nature of the algorithm, and existence of system prerequisite.",WOS:000344542000019,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Lam, A.

The users can reduce their costs by consuming energy during low-price hours and balancing their energy usage during other hours. This in turn benefits energy utility companies by reducing their peak power demand. This article describes an optimal shrinking horizon model for electricity-consuming units based on user preferences. The proposed model optimizes the end user's electricity cost while meeting preferred comfort levels. The user can set preferences in the model using a tristate flexibility parameter for each electric-power-consuming unit. The electricity price model used in the optimization model is general and covers all pricing schemes in the electricity market today. The model derived can be described by a simple mixed integer linear program and solved by most optimization software in a short time.

548,"In this paper, we introduce the incremental welfare consensus algorithm for solving the energy management problem in a smart grid environment populated with distributed generators and responsive demands. The proposed algorithm is distributed and cooperative such that it eliminates the need for a central energy-management unit, central price coordinator, or leader. The optimum energy solution is found through local peerto-peer communications among smart devices. Each distributed generation unit is connected to a local price regulator, as is each consumer unit. In response to the price of energy proposed by the local price regulators, the power regulator on each generation/consumer unit determines the level of generation/consumption power needed to optimize the benefit of the device. The consensus-based coordination among price regulators drives the behavior of the overall system toward the global optimum, despite the greedy behavior of each unit. The primary advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) convergence to the global optimum without requiring a central controller/coordinator or leader, despite the greedy behavior at the individual level and limited communications; and 2) scalability in terms of per-node computation and communications burden.",WOS:000344542000018,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Rahbari-Asr, N., Ojha, U., Zhang, Z. and Chow, M.

549,"The main contribution of this paper is the construction of the efficient privacy-preserving protocol for smart metering systems (EPPP4SMS), which brings together features of the best privacy-preserving protocols in the literature for smart grids. In addition, EPPP4SMS is faster on the meter side-and in the whole round (encryption, aggregation, and decryption)-than other protocols based on homomorphic encryption and it is still scalable. Moreover, EPPP4SMS enables energy suppliers and customers to verify the billing information and measurements without leaking private information. Since the energy supplier knows the amount of generated electricity and its flow throughout electrical substations, the energy supplier can use this verification to detect energy loss and fraud. Different from verification based on digital signature, our verification enables new features; for example, smart meters and their energy supplier can compute the verification without storing the respective encrypted measurements. Furthermore, EPPP4SMS may be suitable to many other scenarios that need aggregation of time-series data keeping privacy protected, including electronic voting, reputation systems, and sensor networks.

550,"This paper studies how a system operator can estimate the amount of demand which will be curtailed in each hour and that which will be shifted between any two hours based on the short-term price elasticities of the demand (PED) in each hour (i.e., own price elasticity and the associated cross price elasticities), besides finding near optimal unit commitment schedule for generators. Ideally, the system operator would want to curtail and/or shift out as much demand as possible from the hours where the generation is expensive. However, such an action may not be desirable for the demand side. In reality, the demand side suffers a penalty (e. g., cost of rescheduling a scheduled job in a factory) when the demand is curtailed and/or shifted. According to our formulation, the system operator constructs a social optimal solution based on the PED and the penalty information related to the demand side. In other words, the total utility of the demand side is maximized, while the sum of the total power generation costs and the total penalty incurred by the demand side are jointly minimized.

In the proposed strategy, a consumer is encouraged to draw a certain amount of energy (i.e., quota) from the grid. When the actual energy demand is deviated from the quota, the consumer is faced with a higher electricity price. With the help of energy storage, the consumer can draw less electricity from the grid at a lower price by discharging energy when the demand is higher than the quota and draw more electricity from the grid at a lower price by charging energy when the demand is lower than the quota. As a result, the utility can implement load shaping and consumers can save energy cost simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed strategy can be implemented with low complexity and in a distributed fashion, which offers scalability to large number of consumers.

554,"Frequency control is essential to maintain the stability and reliability of power grids. For decades, generation side controllers, e. g., governors and automatic generation controllers, have been used to stabilize the frequency of power systems, which incur high operational costs. In smart grids, utilizing demand response is an appealing alternative to control the system frequency at the demand side, which can reduce the dependency of grids on expensive generation side controllers. Despite of economic advantages, the frequency oscillation problem, which occurs when smart appliances simultaneously respond to the system frequency by varying their power consumptions, is the main barrier to realize demand response enabled frequency control in practice. In this paper, we investigate a new distributed control algorithm by randomizing smart appliances' responses to solve this problem. We provide a comprehensive analysis to characterize various impacts of the randomized demand response on the system frequency in terms of its mean and variance over time. Furthermore, based on the frequency dynamics analysis, we determine the average frequency recovery time, the average number of responded smart appliances, and the probability of frequency overshoot, which provide important guidelines for designing our control algorithm.

This approach is based on matching pursuit decomposition (MPD) using Gaussian atom dictionary, hidden Markov model (HMM) of real-time frequency and voltage variation features, and fault contour maps generated by machine learning algorithms in smart grid (SG) systems. Specifically, the time-frequency features are extracted by MPD from the frequency and voltage signals, which are sampled by the frequency disturbance recorders in SG. A hybrid clustering algorithm is then developed and used to cluster the frequency and voltage signal features into various symbols. Using the symbols, two detection HMMs are trained for fault detection to distinguish between normal and abnormal SG operation conditions. Also, several identification HMMs are trained under different system fault scenarios, and if a fault occurs, the trained identification HMMs are used to identify different fault types. In the meantime, if the fault is detected by the detection HMMs, a fault contour map will be generated using the feature extracted by the MPD from the voltage signals and topology information of SG.

The complete small signal models for the inverter-dominated microgrids have been developed, which are very accurate and could be found in literature. However, the modeling procedure will become very complex when the number of inverters in microgrid is large.

The large-scale deployment of these devices requires upgrading existing reactive power control solutions. To improve energy efficiency and voltage profiles of the power grids under different operating conditions, this paper proposes a fully distributed multiple agent system based optimal reactive control solution. To update its control setting, a reactive controller only needs information measured locally or obtained from its neighboring buses. The updating rules of the subgradient based algorithm are derived under mild assumptions. The solution is able to provide comparable steady state performance as that of centralized optimization solutions. Due to the simplicity of communication topology and the reduced amount of data to process, the solution can provide timely response to changes of operating conditions.

The controller finds the normalized voltage deviation accounting for the sensitivity of voltage measurements to appliance state. The controller produces a signal indicating desired power consumption which can be mapped to temperature setpoint offsets of thermostat controlled loads. In networks where a lower voltage level corresponds to high system load (and vice versa), this controller acts to regulate voltage and increase the load factor. Simulations are conducted on low- and medium-voltage distribution systems with residential loads including voltage-sensitive water heaters. In low-voltage systems, the results of the simulations show the controller to be effective at reducing the extremes of voltage and increasing the load factor while respecting end-use temperature constraints.

566,"The distributed generator (DG) has a huge economical and environmental potential, especially if it is based on renewable energy sources (RESs). It is very important for the future development of smart grids. However, high penetration of DGs into distribution systems can cause voltage deviations beyond the statutory range, and reverse power flow toward the substation transformer. Consequently, it can increase the distribution system losses if it is not well supervised. Thus, in order to meet smart grid objectives, DGs have to be controlled in coordination with other power resources existing in the distribution system. Controllable loads (CLs) can also help in promoting smart grids through demand response (DR) application. Therefore, this paper proposes a decision technique of an optimal reference schedule for DGs, battery energy storage system (BESS), CLs, and tap changing transformers. The main objective of the proposed optimization problem is to achieve loss reduction in the distribution system. However, other aims such as voltage control and power flow smoothing have been achieved. The optimization is performed based on predicted values of load demand and DG generation.

567,"Demand response (DR) control can effectively relieve balancing and frequency regulation burdens on conventional generators, facilitate integrating more renewable energy, and reduce generation and transmission investments needed to meet peak demands. Electric water heaters (EWHs) have a great potential in implementing DR control strategies because: a) the EWH power consumption has a high correlation with daily load patterns; b) they constitute a significant percentage of domestic electrical load; c) the heating element is a resistor, without reactive power consumption; and d) they can be used as energy storage devices when needed. Accurately modeling the dynamic behavior of EWHs is essential for successfully designing DR controls.

568,"This paper presents a novel fault current management (FCM) technique for radial distribution systems with embedded inverter-based distributed generators (IB-DGs). At the point of connection to a power system, many distributed generators (DGs) require power electronic (PE) interfaces, which are normally idle during faults. The proposed FCM method employs these PE interfaces for control of the fault current. For this purpose, operation of IB-DGs is modified to FCM mode at the moment of fault and new current references are applied. Of the two controllable parameters of the IB-DG output current-current magnitude and current phase angle-the current phase angle is chosen as the means of controlling the fault current magnitude. The reference current phase angle is calculated based on the relation between the fault current elements and their phase angles. As a result of this novel operation, IB-DGs with larger capacity can be connected at different locations of the system without affecting the fault current magnitude. Also, implementing this technique in smart grids is economically proven, since the asset of power system which have been designed for normal operation are employed to manage the fault current magnitude. Moreover, possibilities of synchronization problems are reduced by keeping IB-DGs connected to the system at all the time. The evaluation of the proposed FCM technique using the standard IEEE 33-bus distribution system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for managing the fault current magnitude.",WOS:000342163500002,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Rajaei, N., Ahmed, M.

To offer different reliability options based on customer's preferences, a utility can deploy distributed generation (DG), sectionalizing switches (Normally Closed Switches: NCSs) and tie switches (Normally Open Switches: NOSs). During power outages, DG, as backup generation unit, is a means of providing higher reliability to customers who require it. Furthermore, a utility may need to reconfigure the networks such that NCSs and NOSs operate in an optimal way to deliver power to priority customers. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing utility liability while assuring the supply of power to priority customers. The optimization is performed off-line and the optimal switch combinations are stored in a database for use by the utility in real time. The information about customer preferences for uninterrupted service is needed to provide investment signals for NCSs, NOSs, and DG to utilities.

572,"Low voltage dc microgrids have been widely used for supplying critical loads, such as data centers and remote communication stations. Consequently, it is important to ensure redundancy and enough energy capacity in order to support possible increments in load consumption. This is achieved by means of expansion of the energy storage system by adding extra distributed energy storage units. However, using distributed energy storage units adds more challenges in microgrids control, since stored energy should be balanced in order to avoid deep discharge or over-charge in one of the energy storage units. Typically, voltage droop loops are used for interconnecting several different units in parallel to a microgrid. This paper proposes a new decentralized strategy based on fuzzy logic that ensures stored energy balance for a low voltage dc microgrid with distributed battery energy storage systems by modifying the virtual resistances of the droop controllers in accordance with the state of charge of each energy storage unit. Additionally, the virtual resistance is adjusted in order to reduce the voltage deviation at the common dc bus.

578,The recent deployment of distributed generation has led to a revolution in the use of distribution systems and the emergence of smart-grid concepts. Smart grids are intended primarily as a means of facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources and of achieving greater system reliability and efficiency. Energy storage systems offer a number of benefits that can help utilities move toward those goals. One of those benefits is the capacity to improve system reliability through successful islanding operation. This paper proposes a methodology for the cost-effective improvement of system reliability through the allocation of distributed storage units in distribution systems. The costs of energy storage installation are optimized with respect to reliability value expressed as customers' willingness to pay in order to avoid power interruptions. The primary goal of this research was thus to determine the optimal combination of storage units to be installed and the loads to be shed so that all possible contingencies can be effectively addressed.

579,"This paper proposes an optimal operational scheduling framework to be taken in use in the distribution management system (DMS) as the heart of smart active distribution networks (ADNs). The proposed algorithm targets to optimally control active elements of the network, distributed generations (DGs) and responsive loads (RLs), seeking to minimize the day-ahead total operation costs. The technical constraints of the components and the whole system are accommodated in the ac power flow fashion. As an innovative point, the DMS effectively utilizes the hourly network reconfiguration capabilities being realized by the deployment of remotely controlled switches (RCSs). Accordingly, besides the optimal schedule of active elements, the optimal topology of the network associated with each hour of the scheduling time horizon is determined as well. The effect of hourly reconfiguration on the capacity release of DGs and RLs is highlighted, which could be envisaged as a new trend in the reserve scheduling problem. Considering practical issues, the maximum daily switching actions of RCSs as well as switching costs are judicially included. The optimization procedure is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem and tackled with the genetic algorithm. To validate the satisfactory performance of the proposed framework, a 33-bus ADN is thoroughly interrogated.",WOS:000342163500025,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Golshannavaz, S., Afsharnia, S. and Aminifar, F.","Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 1439957131, Iran",27,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2335815,Sep,1949-3053,5,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,active distribution network (adn),distributed generation (dg),reconfiguration,remotely controlled switch (rcs),responsive load (rl),distribution-system,network reconfiguration,operation,algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,English,Ap6bw,2402-2411,14740,Journal Article,Smart Distribution Grid: Optimal Day-Ahead Scheduling With Reconfigurable Topology,14,Smart Distribution Grid: Optimal Day-Ahead Scheduling With Reconfigurable Topology,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000342163500025,5,2014

581,"Bus voltage stability is a key issue in future medium-voltage DC (MVDC) power systems on ships. The presence of high-bandwidth controlled load converters (Constant Power Load, CPL) may induce voltage instabilities. A control design procedure is presented which starts at the modeling level and comes to control implementation. A control method based on a Linearization via State Feedback (LSF), is proposed to face the CPL destabilizing effect and to ensure the MVDC bus voltage stability. A multiconverter shipboard DC grid is analyzed by means of a new comprehensive model, which is able to capture the overall behavior in a second-order nonlinear differential equation. Exploiting DC-DC converters that interface power sources to the bus, LSF technique is able to compensate for system nonlinearities, obtaining a linear system. Then, traditional linear control techniques can be applied to obtain a desired pole placement. With reference to system parameters mismatch, LSF control design is verified by means of a sensitivity analysis, evaluating the possibility of an over-linearization strategy.

The dc distribution system is interfaced with the host ac grid via a voltage-sourced converter and can also embed photovoltaic (PV) modules.

The dc distribution system is expected to be more efficient and economical than a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid, but it is prone to instabilities due to the constant-power property of the dc-dc converters. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by altering the power setpoints of the battery chargers, bidirectional dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware.

The ADN also owns distributed electrical energy storage. We show that it is possible to use the same broadcast signal deployed for controlling loads to manage the distributed storage. To this end, we propose an appropriate control law to be embedded into the distributed electrical storage controllers that reacts to the defined broadcast signal in order to control both active and reactive power injections. We analyze, in particular, the case where electrical storage systems consist of supercapacitor arrays and where the ADN uses the grid explicit congestion notification (GECN) for real-time demand response that the authors have developed in a previous contribution. We estimate the energy reserve required for successfully performing voltage control depending on the characteristics of the network. The performance of the scheme is numerically evaluated on the IEEE 34-node test feeder.

596,"In this paper, the interconnected dc distribution system is represented as a class of interconnected, nonlinear discrete-time systems with unknown dynamics. The dc distribution system comprises several dc sources, here called subsystems, along with resistive and constant-power loads (CPLs.) Each subsystem includes a dc-dc converter (DDC) and exploits distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic, wind, etc. Due to the power system frequent disturbances this system is prone to instability in the presence of the DDC dynamical components. On the other hand, designing a centralized controller may not be viable due to the distance between the subsystems (dc sources.) Therefore, in this paper the stability of the interconnected dc distribution system is enhanced through decentralized adaptive nonlinear controller design that employs neural networks (NNs) to mitigate voltage and power oscillations after disturbances have occurred. The adaptive NN-based controller is introduced to overcome the unknown dynamics of each subsystem's converter and stabilize the entire grid, assuming that only the local measurements are available to each converter. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in damping oscillations that occur in the presence of disturbances.",WOS:000342163500036,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kazemlou, S. and Mehraeen, S.","Kazemlou, S",35,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2313597,Sep,1949-3053,5,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,constant power loads (cpls),dc distribution system,decentralized control,discrete-time (dt) systems,neural networks (nn),nonlinear adaptive control,constant-power loads,nonlinear-systems,buck converters,stabilization,microgrids,stability,design,model,link,,,,,English,Ap6bw,2496-2507,14757,Journal Article,Decentralized Discrete-Time Adaptive Neural Network Control of Interconnected DC Distribution System,0,Decentralized Discrete-Time Adaptive Neural Network Control of Interconnected DC Distribution System,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000342163500036,5,2014
597,This paper presents a high speed current differential implementation approach for smart dc distribution systems capable of sub-millisecond fault detection. The approach utilizes the natural characteristics of dc differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection times compared to standard applications and hence meet requirements for dc converter protection (around 2 ms). Analysis is first developed to help quantify protection implementation challenges for a given dc system. Options for implementing the proposed technique are then illustrated. Results of scaled hardware testing are presented which validate the overall protection operating times in a low voltage environment. These results show the implementation approach can consistently achieve protection system operating within the order of a few microseconds.,WOS:000342163500048,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Fletcher, S. D.

599,"Aging network assets, significant variations in weather conditions, increased accommodation of intermittent distributed generation, and the network operating patterns deviate actual thermal limits of assets from deterministic thermal limits. In that context, the paper proposes a model integrated innovative approach to assess the security of energy supply in an active distribution network. The approach integrates models of dynamic thermal limits, stochastic variations in weather conditions, random outages, intermittent generation outputs, and random load fluctuations into Monte Carlo simulation and quantifies the level of insecurity. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by a case study. The results suggest that costs of outages can be significantly affected by combinatorial effects of weather patterns and dynamic thermal limits. Changes in weather patterns contribute more to the costs of the outages than dynamic variations in thermal limits. Latent capacities of assets do not necessarily reduce insecurity of energy supply. The paper also argues that assets in stressed distribution networks should be modeled with dynamic thermal limits for the quantification of true impacts.",WOS:000342163500009,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Jayaweera, D. and Islam, S.","Curtin Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",21,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2316523,Sep,1949-3053,5,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,active networks,intermittent generation,monte carlo simulation,random outages,stochastic limits,risk-assessment,power,load,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Ap6bw,2246-2254,14760,Journal Article,Security of Energy Supply With Change in Weather Conditions and Dynamic Thermal Limits,1,Security of Energy Supply With Change in Weather Conditions and Dynamic Thermal Limits,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000342163500009,5,2014
600,"There are many technical aspects and challenges in distributed generation (DG) that have not been properly understood and addressed so far. Distribution systems cannot be considered as balanced three-phase systems, because these are inherently unbalanced in steady-state operation. A full characterization of the unbalanced system with respect to system stability allows a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of such systems. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the effects of system unbalance on the stability of the distribution systems with synchronous generator (SG) and doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based DG units at different loading levels. Detailed steady-state and dynamic analyses of the system are performed. Based on classical voltage, small-perturbation and transient stability studies, it is demonstrated that system unbalance can significantly affect the distribution system dynamic performance, in ways that have not been discussed in the technical literature so far. A simple and effective control strategy based on an Unbalanced Voltage Stabilizer (UVS) is also proposed to improve the system control and the stability of unbalanced distribution systems with SG and DFIG. Eigenvalue analyses and time-domain simulations (TDS) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UVS for unbalance conditions.",WOS:000342163500017,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Nasr-Azadani, E., Canizares, C.

601,"At high penetrations, uncontrolled electric vehicle (EV) charging has the potential to cause line and transformer congestion in the distribution network. Instead of upgrading components to higher nameplate ratings, we investigate the use of real-time control to limit EV load to the available capacity in the network. Inspired by rate control algorithms in computer networks such as TCP, we design a measurement-based, real-time, distributed, stable, efficient, and fair charging algorithm using the dual-decomposition approach. We show through extensive numerical simulations and power flow analysis on a test distribution network that this algorithm operates successfully in both static and dynamic settings, despite changes in home loads and the number of connected EVs. We find that our algorithm rapidly converges from large disturbances to a stable operating point. We show that in a test setting, for an acceptable level of overload, only 70 EVs could be fully charged without control, whereas up to around 700 EVs can be fully charged using our control algorithm. This compares well with the maximum supportable population of approximately 900 EVs.

603,"It is generally accepted that if dynamic electricity pricing tariffs were to be introduced, their effectiveness in controlling domestic loads will be curtailed if consumers were relied on to respond in their own interests. The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household.

604,"Renewable energy sources continues to gain popularity. However, two major limitations exist that prevent widespread adoption: availability of the electricity generated and the cost of the equipment. Distributed generation, (DG) grid-tied photovoltaic-wind hybrid systems with centralized battery back-up, can help mitigate the variability of the renewable energy resource. The downside, however, is the cost of the equipment needed to create such a system. Thus, optimization of generation and storage in light of capital cost and variability mitigation is imperative to the financial feasibility of DC microgrid systems. PV and wind generation are both time dependent and variable but are highly correlated, which make them ideal for a dual-sourced hybrid system. This paper presents an optimization technique base on a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) which uses high temporal resolution insolation data taken at 10 seconds data rate instead of more commonly used hourly data rate. The proposed methodology employs a techno-economic approach to determine the system design optimized by considering multiple criteria including size, cost, and availability. The result is the baseline system cost necessary to meet the load requirements and which can also be used to monetize ancillary services that the smart DC microgrid can provide to the utility at the point of common coupling (PCC) such as voltage regulation. The hybrid smart DC microgrid community system optimized using high-temporal resolution data is compared to a system optimized using lower-rate temporal data to examine the effect of the temporal sampling of the renewable energy resource.",WOS:000342163500051,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Shadmand, M.

This paper incorporates demand response in DisCos' short-term decision model in a real-time pricing (RTP) environment wherein consumers are charged based on hourly varying prices. Besides the hourly RTP sale prices, the established model deals with other DisCo's short-term activities including hourly purchases from the grid, commitment of distributed generation (DG) units, dispatch of shunt compensators, and invocation of load curtailments (LCs). The stochastic nature of wholesale market prices and customers load is also considered in the model. The model is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which can be easily solved via commercial software packages. The objective is to maximize the DisCo's expected profit while its revenue is limited by regulating bodies.

They do, however, present significant protection challenges that existing schemes based on dc fuses and conventional electro-mechanical circuit breakers cannot manage due to the nature of dc faults and slow device performance. Therefore, this paper presents an advanced protection scheme that addresses the outstanding challenges for protecting an LVDC last mile distribution network. The scheme takes advantage of advanced local measurements and communications that will be naturally integrated in smart grids, and the excellent level of controllability of solid state circuit breakers. It thus provides fast dc fault detection and interruption during dc transient periods, in addition to achieving fault limitation and fast reliable restoration. The introductory part of the paper quantifies the potential benefits of LVDC last mile distribution networks, and discusses the potential LVDC architectures that best utilize the existing plant.

610,"Power grid is one of the most critical infrastructures in a nation and could suffer a variety of cyber attacks. Recent studies have shown that an attacker can inject pre-determined false data into smart meters such that it can pass the residue test of conventional state estimator. However, the calculation of the false data vector relies on the network (topology and parameter) information of the entire grid. In practice, it is impossible for an attacker to obtain all network information of a power grid. Unfortunately, this does not make power systems immune to false data injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a local load redistribution attacking model based on incomplete network information and show that an attacker only needs to obtain the network information of the local attacking region to inject false data into smart meters in the local region without being detected by the state estimator. Simulations on the modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model.

611,"This paper presents a methodology for modeling the load demand of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Due to the stochastic nature of vehicle arrival time, departure time and daily mileage, probabilistic methods are chosen to model the driving pattern. However, these three elements of driving pattern are correlated with each other, which makes the probability density functions (pdfs)-based probabilistic methods inaccurate. Here a fuzzy logic based stochastic model is built to study the relationship between the three elements of driving pattern. Moreover, a load profile modeling framework (LPMF) for PHEVs is proposed to synthesize both the characteristics of driving pattern and vehicle parameters into a load profile prediction system. Based on this stochastic model of PHEV, a two-layer evolution strategy particle swarm optimization (ESPSO) algorithm is proposed to integrate PHEVs into a residential distribution grid. A novel business model is developed for PHEVs to provide ancillary service and participate in peak load shaving. A virtual time-of-use rate is used to reflect the load deviation of the system. Then, an objective function is developed to aggregate the peak load shaving, power quality improvement, charging cost, battery degradation cost and frequency regulation earnings into one cost function. The ESPSO approach can benefit the system in four major aspects by: 1) improving the power quality; 2) reducing the peak load; 3) providing frequency regulation service; and 4) minimizing the total virtual cost.

614,"Connecting distributed generation (DG) to weak distribution networks can often cause voltage rise problems. Traditionally, these voltage rise problems have been mitigated by passive methods such as reinforcing the network. This can, however, lead to high connection costs of DG. The connection costs can in many cases be lowered if active voltage control methods are used instead of the passive approach. In this paper, two coordinated voltage control algorithms suitable for usage in distribution networks including several distributed energy resources are proposed and studied.

The control objective is to reduce the variation of nonrenewable power demand without affecting the user-perceived quality of experience. To solve the problem, first, a queueing model is built for the thermal dynamics of the HVAC unit based on the equivalent thermal parameters (ETP) model. Second, optimization problems are formulated. Based on an extended Lyapunov optimization approach, a control algorithm is proposed to approximately solve the problems.

617,"A situational awareness system is essential to provide accurate understanding of power system dynamics, such that proper actions can be taken in real time in response to system disturbances and to avoid cascading blackouts. Event analysis has been an important component in any situational awareness system. However, most state-of-the-art techniques can only handle single event analysis. This paper tackles the challenging problem of multiple event detection and recognition. We propose a new conceptual framework, referred to as event unmixing, where we consider real-world events mixtures of more than one constituent root event. This concept is a key enabler for analysis of events to go beyond what are immediately detectable in a system, providing high-resolution data understanding at a finer scale. We interpret the event formation process from a linear mixing perspective and propose an innovative nonnegative sparse event unmixing (NSEU) algorithm for multiple event separation and temporal localization. The proposed framework has been evaluated using both PSS/E simulated cases and real event cases collected from the frequency disturbance recorders (FDRs) of the Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET).

To this end, the DR baseline is a key factor in a successful DR program since it influences the incentive allocation mechanism and customer participation. Previous studies have investigated baseline accuracy and bias for large, industrial and commercial customers. However, the analysis of baseline performance for residential customers has received less attention. In this paper, we analyze DR baselines for residential customers. Our analysis goes beyond accuracy and bias by understanding the impact of baselines on all stakeholders' profit. Using our customer models, we successfully show how customer participation changes depending on the incentive actually received. We found that, in general, bias is more relevant than accuracy for determining which baseline provides the highest profit to stakeholders.

623,"In this paper, we investigate a practical demand side management scenario where the selfish consumers compete to minimize their individual energy cost through scheduling their future energy consumption profiles. We adopt an instantaneous load billing scheme to effectively convince the consumers to shift their peak-time consumption and to fairly charge the consumers for their energy consumption. For the considered DSM scenario, an aggregative game is first formulated to model the strategic behaviors of the selfish consumers. By resorting to the variational inequality theory, we analyze the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game. Subsequently, for the scenario where there is a central unit calculating and sending the real-time aggregated load to all consumers, we develop a one timescale distributed iterative proximal-point algorithm with provable convergence to achieve the NE of the formulated game. Finally, considering the alternative situation where the central unit does not exist, but the consumers are connected and they would like to share their estimated information with others, we present a distributed synchronous agreement-based algorithm and a distributed asynchronous gossip-based algorithm, by which the consumers can achieve the NE of the formulated game through exchanging information with their immediate neighbors.",WOS:000338191200021,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Chen, H., Li, Y.

624,"Cooperative distributed optimization is proposed in this paper to optimally dispatch the reactive power of the distributed generators (DGs). The overall objective is to minimize the cost function that is the sum of all quadratic voltage errors of the DG nodes and other critical nodes in the system. It is assumed that each DG is only aware of its own cost function defined as the quadratic voltage error of its respective node. In the proposed method, every DG performs optimization with respect to its own objective function while considering the information received locally from the neighboring nodes in the microgrid, and the critical nodes without DG also contribute to optimization. The proposed distributed optimization and control scheme enables the microgrid to have a unified voltage profile, and incorporating the subgradient method facilitates its application even when the microgrid information is unknown.

We describe optimization methods for coordinating consumption of electrical energy within the community, with the purpose of reducing grid loading and active power losses. For this we present a simplified model of the electrical grid, including system losses and capacity constraints. Coordination is performed in a distributed fashion, where each consumer optimizes his or her own consumption pattern, taking into account both private objectives, specific to each individual consumer, as well as objectives common to all consumers. In our work, the common objective is to minimize active losses in the grid, and ensure that grid capacity limits are obeyed. These objectives are enforced by coordinating consumers through a nonlinear penalty on power consumption.

627,"Existing standards impose limits on the allowable feeder voltage variation in a distributed generation environment. These stipulations must be respected by the distributed power generators (suppliers), which put a cap on the penetration level. A possible solution is to provide reactive power support to improve the voltage profile. This paper proposes a novel scheme, where an auxiliary circuit (comprising an inverter and reactive power bank, RPB), in conjunction with a PV-grid system, increases the system's reactive power compensation capacity up to 300% compared to the original or dedicated VAR capacity of the main PV inverter. In spite of using only the conventional discrete form of capacitor/inductor bank, the entire VAR range can be controlled. This enables the local Photovoltaic Distributed Generation System (PV-DGS) to provide the necessary reactive power support for the mitigation of large voltage variation on the feeder because of reverse power flow, intermittent solar radiation and load variation. This, in turn, supports increased PV penetration into the power system. As an extension of the proposed scheme, any existing conventional reactive power banks may be retrofitted with a given PV grid system to realize the proposed functionality.

By leveraging the communications in the building automation system (BAS) already present in most buildings, large commercial HVAC systems provide easier access to a large controllable resource than aggregating a large number of small residential loads. However, large commercial HVAC systems are complex with many variables, many end point controllers, and several internal control loops that interact with each other. In addition, the existing fleet of large commercial buildings is diverse with many different HVAC configurations and BAS architectures. Capturing these buildings as DR resources requires a method to greatly reduce the complexity of the HVAC DR control and is general and flexible enough that it can be easily deployed across the diverse fleet of existing buildings. We create such a DR control by developing a system model that uses a single state variable instead of the several hundred variables in a commercial HVAC system.

Facing with series-compensated lines, subsynchronous resonance (SSR) may strike the power system by jeopardizing its stability and mechanical facilities. The operation of such transmission lines is broadening as a direct result of emergent desire to exploit distant wind energy resources in large scales. This paper verifies the capability of unified power flow controller (UPFC) in attenuating SSR in wind farm integrations. SSR is local in its nature; hence, local measurements are merely employed here for controlling the series convertor while wide-area signals could be as well utilized in parallel for other objectives such as inter-area oscillation damping. An equivalent self-excited induction generator (SEIG) represents the wind farm and is connected to the system through a series-compensated line. The UPFC is located at the wind terminal of the linking line; thus, the needed reactive power of SEIG is produced by the shunt branch of UPFC.

This is achieved by using an information sharing model with a distributed model predictive control method based on dual-decomposition and sub-gradient iterations.

631,"Real-time demand response management (DRM) in smart grid (SG) requires a reliable wireless communication network with sufficient spectrum resources. However, the allocated spectrum for wireless communications is heavily under-utilized in the spatial and temporal dimensions. To solve the spectrum scarcity problem, cognitive radio (CR) and dynamic spectrum sharing have been proposed, but this can result in poor reliability. In this paper, the influence of wireless communication reliability on DRM is analyzed and the relationship between outage and DRM performance is derived. Outage results from not only interference and noise, but also the unavailability of spectrum resources. Therefore, joint spatial and temporal spectrum sharing is proposed to improve spectrum utilization. The SG network is divided into a Temporal Spectrum Sharing Region (TSSR) and a Free Spatial Spectrum Sharing Region (Free-SSSR). SG nodes in the TSSR can utilize the licensed spectrum when primary users (PUs) are idle, while in the Free-SSSR they can simultaneously share this spectrum with the PUs without using power control. Performance results are presented which show that joint spatial and temporal spectrum sharing can increase the SG spectrum utilization opportunities and lower the outage probability, which is beneficial for DRM performance.",WOS:000338191200046,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Li, Q., Feng, Z.

The method uses wavelets to analyze transients associated with small disturbances imposed by power converters and determine the net impedance back to the source.

By defining a new probabilistic index, this paper presents approaches for clustering active distribution systems into a set of microgrids with optimized reliability and supply-adequacy indices. After proposing two different methods for optimally designing the microgrids, as two corrective actions to improve the defined index, the advantages of installing distributed reactive sources (DRSs) and distributed energy storage resources (DESRs) are investigated. The problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper. The well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as a test case and through several sensitivity studies, the robustness of the design and the effect of interconnecting different amounts of DRSs' and DESRs' capacities on the defined index are investigated. It is found that by properly designing the system and integrating the DRSs and DESRs, the index can be improved from 23% in the base system without distributed generators (DGs) to 77% in the basic microgrid design with distributed generators and to 93% considering all resources.",WOS:000338191200030,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Arefifar, S.

The algorithm can provide a DLF solution in a specific area of interest in the distribution system without the necessity of including all of the distribution system laterals in the DLF problem. The system laterals excluded from the DLF solution are replaced by equivalent loads using a proposed lumping technique. The proposed DLF zooming method thus reduces the size of the DLF problem and hence minimizes the effect of system size on the DLF solution time. The construction of the DLF problem is based on a novel automated recursive process, which enables fast accommodation of changes in the network topology of smart grid.

For ease of use, and to increase commercial appeal among utilities, these sensors should be designed to have a low cost, long life (> 10years), be self-powered, and require no maintenance. This paper deals with the development of a novel low-cost wireless voltage sensor for medium- and high-voltage (MV/HV) utility assets such as cables, transformers, switchgear, capacitor banks, and conductors. A review of existing techniques along with their drawbacks is outlined in this paper. Further, the challenges pertaining to the development a low-cost floating voltage sensor such as variability of voltage, self-calibration requirements, and distance-to-earth variations are presented. These challenges are circumvented by deriving a detailed mathematical model of the sensor. Further, using a set of valid assumptions, a new moving average voltage sensing (MAVS) algorithm is proposed, tested using simulations and validated using a high-voltage prototype. The wireless voltage sensor prototype is tested at up to 35 kV and is built to accommodate electric field energy harvesting in addition to voltage sensing.

637,"The thermal storage potential in commercial buildings is an enormous resource for providing various ancillary services to the grid. In this paper, we show how fans in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings alone can provide substantial frequency regulation service, with little change in their indoor environments. A feedforward architecture is proposed to control the fan power consumption to track a regulation signal. The proposed control scheme is then tested through simulations based on a calibrated high fidelity non-linear model of a building. Model parameters are identified from data collected in Pugh Hall, a commercial building located on the University of Florida campus. For the HVAC system under consideration, numerical experiments demonstrate how up to 15% of the rated fan power can be deployed for regulation purpose while having little effect on the building indoor temperature. The regulation signal that can be successfully tracked is constrained in the frequency band [1/tau(0,) 1/tau(1) where tau(0) approximate to 3 minutes and tau(1) approximate to 8 seconds. Our results indicate that fans in existing commercial buildings in the U.S. can provide about 70% of the current national regulation reserve requirements in the aforementioned frequency band.

To address the operational challenges associated with these technologies and energy resources, this paper formulates a stochastic problem for microgrid energy scheduling.

640,"For the efficient operation of the smart grid, it is important that there is an instant by instant matching between the electricity supply and the power consumption. Electrical power storage provides a viable solution to managing power supply and electrical loads as well as unexpected imbalances. Electricity suppliers could deploy electricity storage facilities at various levels of the smart grid system: generation, transmission, substations and residential level. Storage would significantly address the power quality and reliability problems through peak shaving and frequency control. It also reduces the need for huge infrastructural expenditures by making them more efficient. At the residential level, smart storage together with dynamic pricing in the deregulated electricity markets presents the electricity suppliers with a strategy to achieve grid stability. In this paper, we consider a smart grid environment with a high penetration of households' storage batteries. By using an appropriate electricity price structure, the electricity supplier influences households' electricity consumption. On the other hand, the households aim to minimize their electricity bills by capitalizing on price fluctuation to schedule their electrical appliances and coordinate the charging and discharging of their batteries. The electricity supplier has a dynamic power limit for each hour that must not be exceeded by the hourly aggregate load of the households. Further, we assume that in supplying electrical power, the households' electrical devices are given priority over their storage devices. The policy is such that batteries will be charged by the residual power after the appliances loads have been satisfied. The households have to compete for the residual electricity so as to maximize the state of charge of their batteries. We have therefore modeled this system as a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium game where the households are considered as selfish but rational players whose objectives are to optimize their individual utilities.",WOS:000338191200032,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Adika, C.

The deployment of energy storage in the distribution network provides an alternative to conventional reinforcement. This paper presents a control methodology for energy storage to reduce peak demand in a distribution network based on day-ahead demand forecasts and historical demand data. The control methodology pre-processes the forecast data prior to a planning phase to build in resilience to the inevitable errors between the forecasted and actual demand. The algorithm uses no real time adjustment so has an economical advantage over traditional storage control algorithms. Results show that peak demand on a single phase of a feeder can be reduced even when there are differences between the forecasted and the actual demand. In particular, results are presented that demonstrate when the algorithm is applied to a large number of single phase demand aggregations that it is possible to identify which of these aggregations are the most suitable candidates for the control methodology.",WOS:000338191200059,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Rowe, M., Yunusov, T., Haben, S., Singleton, C., Holderbaum, W. and Potter, B.","Univ Reading, Sch Syst Engn, Reading RG6 6UR, Berks, England",34,10.1109/Tsg.2014.2323115,Jul,1949-3053,4,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,dno,energy storage,forecast,load uncertainty,lv network,smart grid,household-level,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,Ak1qs,2115-2124,14802,Journal Article,A Peak Reduction Scheduling Algorithm for Storage Devices on the Low Voltage Network,8,A Peak Reduction Scheduling Algorithm for Storage Devices on the Low Voltage Network,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000338191200059,5,2014

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of developing an efficient universal islanding detection method that can be applied to both inverter and synchronous-based DG. The proposed method relies on extracting a group of features, from measured data simulated for both types of DGs, from which the best features are selected for islanding detection. A random forest (RF) classification technique is used to detect islanding and non-islanding situations with an objective of minimizing the non-detection zone as well as avoiding nuisance DG tripping during non-islanding conditions. Islanding and non- islanding cases were generated for the IEEE 34- bus system and used to train and test the proposed technique. In the paper, - fold cross-validation was used in order to test the accuracy of the proposed algorithm for detecting islanding. The results show that the proposed methodology has zero non-detection zone, high accuracy, and fast response when applied to both types of DGs independently of the size of the island.

It is assumed that a smart load can delay a time-flexible energy demand up to a fixed deadline. Under mild assumptions on the regularity of the stochastic price process, it is shown that the optimal strategy is to consume only when the price is less than or equal to a certain threshold that depends only on the time left to the deadline and the price statistics. This analysis is performed under both perfect and partial information about the statistics of the price process. Robust policies with performance guarantees are derived for the partial information case. Such performance bounds are also used for deriving upper and lower bounds on the economic value of load-shifting.

However, the amount of data/measurements increases with the scale of the physical grid, posing a significant stress on both the communication infrastructure as well as data processing control centers. This paper first investigates the effect of geographical footprint of distributed generation (DG) on the voltage states of a smart distribution system. We demonstrate that the strong coupling in the physical power system results in estimated voltage phasors exhibiting a correlation structure that allows for compression of measurements. Specifically, by exploiting principles of 1D and 2D compressed sensing, we develop two approaches, an indirect and direct method for state estimation starting from compressed power measurements. We illustrate the effectiveness of voltage estimation with significantly low number of random spatial, temporal as well as spatio-temporal power measurements using the IEEE 34 node distribution test feeder and a larger 100 node radial distribution system.

However, daily charging of EVs, in particular rapid charging, may impact power systems, especially during peak hours, and the effects may occur in different places as traffic conditions change. To address these issues, we describe an integrated rapid-charging navigation strategy that considers both the traffic conditions and the status of the power grid. The system is based on an intelligent transport system (ITS), and contains four modules: a power system control center (PSCC), an ITS center, charging stations, and EV terminals. The PSCC calculates the available charging capacity and station charging capacity based on power grid data and transmits the results to the charging stations. The charging stations determine their charging plans and estimate the available charging power for future EVs (CPFE), and transmit these data to the ITS center. After receiving CPFE data and traffic data from the ITS center, the EV terminal estimates the total time for charging (TTC) for different stations, which includes the driving time, waiting time, and charging time. The driver can view these results and choose to be navigated to the charging station corresponding to the minimum TTC. The modular design of the navigation system reduces data transmission, which protects the drivers' privacy since they can choose which charging station to use and are not required to send any data to the ITS system.

It is shown in this paper that the inclusion of these two elements results in an active power mismatch between the scheduled and the actually achieved DR. A new term that is capable of quantifying this mismatch is introduced and is termed as ""demand responsemismatch (DRM)."" To overcome such problem, this paper proposes a mixed integer non linear program (MINLP) to find the optimal size and location of STATCOM and/or optimal transformer tap setting that can minimize the DRM. The phenomenon of DRM is illustrated using a standard 16-bus U.K. generic distribution system (UKGDS) while considering different load power factors, load reduction amounts, load models, as well as DR locations.",WOS:000338191200020,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Rahiman, F.

Specifically, a multilevel architecture is introduced and evaluated for the following main purposes: to reduce the computational complexity, to deal with different decentralized microgrids, different decision makers, and multiple objectives. A two-level decision architecture based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is presented, in which the upper decision level has the function of fixing the values of a certain set of parameters (reference values), by assuming a certain structure of the control strategies to be applied at the lower decision level. On the basis of such parameters, each decision maker at the lower level solves its own optimization problem by tracking the reference values provided by the upper level.

651,"By offering appropriate incentives, electricity users can be incentivized to alter their power consumption patterns so as to achieve the electricity supplier's intended profile. In this paper we have proposed a day-ahead demand-side bidding approach to realize the desired demand response. In our mechanism, customers submit their day-ahead electricity demands to the utility company through a secure communication infrastructure. The electricity supplier then generates the customers' hourly demand profile by aggregation of the individual requests. This information then forms the basis of procuring power in the wholesale market as well as developing a dynamic electricity pricing scheme. However, as expected, the actual electricity supply and the actual electricity consumption may not match. This could be due to the inability of the utility company to secure enough power at the wholesale market or due to changes in consumer power requirements. In the event the demand outstrips the supply, the customers willingly offer to shed some of their flexible appliances' loads but bid for prices at which they would like to pay for the curtailed load. We assume that customers are rational but selfish and are only concerned with maximizing their own benefits. In this study, this demand-side bidding problem is mathematically formulated and solved.

652,"The major issue in smart grid (SG) communications networks is the latency management of a vast amount of SG traffic in the access network that connects power substations to a large number of SG monitoring devices. There are three possible deployments for the SG access network considered by power industries: 1) a public access network with a mix of SG and human-to-human (H2H) traffic; 2) a private access network exclusively assigned to SG communications; and 3) a mix of private and public access networks, referred to as hybrid access networks. The SG communications traffic is classified as fixed-scheduling (FS) and event-driven (ED). The FS and ED traffic, generated by SG devices, occur on a periodic basis and as a response to electricity supply conditions, respectively. In this paper, we develop traffic models for public, private, and hybrid SG access networks based on queuing theory. By using these models, we derive an expression for the mean queuing delay for each traffic class in each network.

Both structure (where to build pipes) and size (pipe capacities) are decision variables in a mathematical description of the optimization problem. The validity of its results are then tested on a case study in Munich, using a published district heating extension plan as reference. The district heating model employs an idealized graph of the street network to represent potential sites for pipes. This street graph is derived from publicly available data, which is also the main source for estimating the heat demand of buildings. Heat demand of individual buildings is aggregated along streets; heat supply, in turn, is possible at pre-defined source locations.

Despite being widely used, WLS estimator remains to be non-robust, i.e., it fails in the presence of bad measurements. The so called least absolute value (LAV) estimator is more robust, but is not widely used due to its higher computational cost. LAV estimator has the desirable property of automatic bad-data rejection provided that the measurement set does not include any ""leverage measurements.""There will be two important advantages to using LAV estimator when systems are observed by phasor measurements: 1) if the measurement set consists of only phasors, the leveraging effect of measurements can be easily eliminated by strategic scaling; 2) computational performance of LAV estimator will become competitive with that of WLS due to the linearity of the estimation problem for phasor measurements.

656,"In an isolated power grid or a micro-grid with a small carbon footprint, the penetration of renewable energy is usually high. In such power grids, energy storage is important to guarantee an uninterrupted and stable power supply for end users. Different types of energy storage have different characteristics, including their round-trip efficiency, power and energy rating, self-discharge, and investment and maintenance costs. In addition, the load characteristics and availability of different types of renewable energy sources vary in different geographic regions and at different times of year. Therefore joint capacity optimization for multiple types of energy storage and generation is important when designing this type of power systems. In this paper, we formulate a cost minimization problem for storage and generation planning, considering both the initial investment cost and operational/maintenance cost, and propose a distributed optimization framework to overcome the difficulty brought about by the large size of the optimization problem.

The grid voltages are analyzed according to the probabilistic and deterministic limits of the EN50160 standard, for a 100% EV penetration rate. The impact on the EV user comfort is evaluated in terms of charging time and electrically driven distances. The chosen voltage droop charging eliminates critical voltages below 0.85 pu and reduces voltage unbalance, with a limited impact on the total charging time.

In lieu of the traditional N-1 security formulation, a risk based approach is employed. The resulting risk constrained economic dispatch is solved efficiently by decomposing it into a two stage process by using newly defined locational security impact factors (LSIF).

667,"Cyber intrusions to substations of a power grid are a source of vulnerability since most substations are unmanned and with limited protection of the physical security. In the worst case, simultaneous intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers.

Unlike the solutions reported in the literature, the proposed charging architecture guarantees the feasibility of the charging decisions by means of a novel prediction unit that can forecast future PEVs power demand and through an innovative two-stage optimization unit that ensures effective charging coordination.

The objective is to minimize the expectation of the sum of the production and ramping costs for generators while satisfying all the system constraints. The uncertainties are represented by scenarios, resulting in a large-scale and computationally demanding optimization problem. We use the optimality condition decomposition (OCD) to decompose the SMPC problem into subproblems which can be solved in parallel thereby reducing the computation time. Both a scenario-based decomposition and a temporal-based decomposition are formulated and numerically evaluated in terms of speed and convergence using a modified IEEE 39-bus test system.

672,"One of complementary value propositions of microgrids is to improve power system resiliency via local supply of loads and curtailment reduction. This subject is investigated in this paper by proposing a resiliency-oriented microgrid optimal scheduling model. The proposed model aims at minimizing the microgrid load curtailment by efficiently scheduling available resources when supply of power from the main grid is interrupted for an extended period of time. The problem is decomposed to normal operation and resilient operation problems. The normal operation problem solution, i.e., unit commitment states, energy storage schedules, and adjustable loads schedules, is employed in the resilient operation problem to examine microgrid capability in supplying local loads during main grid supply interruption. The schedule is revised via resiliency cuts if a zero mismatch is not obtained. Prevailing operational uncertainties in load, non-dispatchable generation, and the main grid supply interruption time and duration are considered and captured using a robust optimization method. The final solution, which is obtained in an iterative manner, is economically optimal, guarantees robustness against prevailing operational uncertainties, and supports a quick islanding with minimum consumer inconvenience and load curtailment.

Extensive efforts are underway to overcome these issues, which tend to put a limit on the maximum PV power injection capability for a given local area electric power system. This paper proposes a new control scheme that enables a centralized PV-grid system to damp out the low frequency power swings on the local area network as an ancillary activity apart from its regular function. The proposed scheme enhances the power system stability without incorporating any additional devices or systems (e. g., PSS). The analytical basis of the control law used in this scheme is derived from the structure preserving energy function (SPEF) model. A notable feature of the scheme that makes it highly feasible is that it requires only locally measurable signals. Further, it does not affect the MPPT control of the PV system in any manner. All these features make it highly relevant and suitable for smart grid applications.

Uncontrolled versus smart charging schemes are compared for various scenarios, from both the customer's and the LDC's perspective. Various objective functions, such as energy drawn by the LDC, total feeder losses, total cost of energy drawn by LDC and total cost of PEV charging are considered. Studies are carried out considering two sample systems i.e., the IEEE 13-node test feeder and a real distribution feeder. Analyses are also presented considering a probabilistic representation of the initial state of charge (SOC) and start time of charging for various scenarios to take into account the difference in customers' driving patterns.

These undesirable features can lead to energy loss and/or can necessitate a large reserve in the form of fast-ramping fuel-based generators. Energy storage can be used to mitigate these effects. In this paper, we are interested in the tradeoff between the use of the reserves and the energy loss. Energy loss includes energy that is either wasted, due to the inefficiency of the storage cycle and the inevitable forecasting errors, or lost when the storage capacity is insufficient. We base our analysis on an initial model proposed by Bejan, Gibbens, and Kelly. We first provide theoretical bounds on the trade-off between energy loss and the use of reserves. For a large storage capacity, we show that this bound is tight, and we develop an algorithm that computes the optimal schedule. Second, we develop a scheduling strategy that is efficient for small ormoderate storage. We evaluate these policies on real data from the U. K. grid and show that they outperform existing heuristics.

However, when asked to report their energy demand, users may have an incentive to cheat in order to consume more while paying less, causing extra costs for grid operation. So it is important to ensure truthfulness among users for demand side management. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method that can prevent users' cheating. In the proposed model, the smart meter can record user's consumption information and communicate with the energy provider's terminal. Users' preferences and consumption patterns are modeled in form of a utility function. Based on this, we propose an enhanced AGV (Arrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet) mechanism to ensure truthfulness. In this incentive method, user's payment is related to its consumption credit. One will be punished to pay extra if there is a cheat record in its consumption history.

At the heart of our protocol lies the idea of tunable sparse network coding, which adopts the transmission of sparsely coded packets at the beginning of the transmission process but then switches to a denser coding structure towards the end. Our systematic mechanism maintains the sparse structure during the recombination of packets at the intermediate nodes. The performance of our protocol is compared by means of simulations of IEEE reference grids against standard master-slave protocols used in real systems.

687,"Hybrid ac/dc microgrids have been planned for the better interconnection of different distributed generation systems (DG) to the power grid, and exploiting the prominent features of both ac and dc microgrids. Connecting these microgrids requires an interlinking ac/dc converter (IC) with a proper power management and control strategy. During the islanding operation of the hybrid ac/dc microgrid, the IC is intended to take the role of supplier to one microgrid and at the same time acts as a load to the other microgrid and the power management system should be able to share the power demand between the existing ac and dc sources in both microgrids. This paper considers the power flow control and management issues amongst multiple sources dispersed throughout both ac and dc microgrids. The paper proposes a decentralized power sharing method in order to eliminate the need for any communication between DGs or microgrids. This hybrid microgrid architecture allows different ac or dc loads and sources to be flexibly located in order to decrease the required power conversions stages and hence the system cost and efficiency.

The use of multi protocol label switching based technique is one option to overcome this problem. A cost effective and simpler detection device is needed for condition monitoring and integrating the sensor signals into the smart grid monitoring system. Remote and on-line monitoring of ultra wide band partial discharge signal in a switch-yard is a new concept in smart grid technology that will help avoid damage of switchyard devices. It is possible to convert the radio frequency partial discharge signal into an equivalent milli-volt or milli-ampere output for remote or centralized monitoring of switchyard devices. Multi Protocol Label Switching based data transfer rate is faster than the conventional data transfer system of a power grid.

The benefit to consumers is made the primary concern to encourage consumers to participate voluntarily in energy trading with the central power station (CPS) in situations of energy deficiency. A novel system model motivating energy trading under the goal of social optimality is proposed. A single-leader multiple-follower Stackelberg game is then studied to model the interactions between the CPS and a number of energy consumers (ECs), and to find optimal distributed solutions for the optimization problem based on the system model. The CPS is considered as a leader seeking to minimize its total cost of buying energy from the ECs, and the ECs are the followers who decide on how much energy they will sell to the CPS for maximizing their utilities. It is shown that the game, which can be implemented distributedly, possesses a socially optimal solution, in which the sum of the benefits to all consumers is maximized, as the total cost to the CPS is minimized.

However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection attacks can bypass the security system and introduce arbitrary errors to state estimates. In this paper, we use graphical methods to study defending mechanisms against false-data injection attacks on power system state estimation. By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables with minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a graph. Based on the graphical characterization, we propose both exact and reduced-complexity approximation algorithms. In particular, we show that the proposed tree-pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity, while yielding negligible performance degradation compared with the optimal algorithms.

From a technical and economical point of view, it is paramount to quantify the amount of energy that can be saved by implementing these LC events. This paper proposes a new causal methodology to estimate such energy savings using a Kalman filter that includes a parametric second-order model of the aggregate demand of a population of ACs. The proposed methodology relies only on readings of aggregate electrical power at the feeder level and does not require historical load data, or a control group, and hence, it can be used where other methods reported in the literature are inapplicable.

This paper presents a system of systems (SoS) framework for optimally operating active distribution grids. The proposed SoS framework defines both distribution company (DISCO) and microgrids (MGs) as independent systems, and identifies the process of information exchange among them. As the DISCO and MGs are physically connected together, the operating condition of one might impact the operating point of other systems. The proposed mathematical model uses a decentralized optimization problem aimed at maximizing the benefit of each independent system.

Using a dynamic programming (DP) argument, we first show that the optimal control policy for a single-battery ESU, under piecewise linear cost functions, has a threshold structure that can be expressed and stored in a very compact form. We then extend the analysis to an ESU with multiple (heterogeneous) batteries, where DP is generally impractical because of the explosion of the computational complexity with the number of batteries. We hence define a simple method to map the optimal solution of a suitable single-battery ESU into an admissible policy for the multiple-battery ESU, whose complexity grows only linearly with the number of batteries. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed approach can yield significant cost reduction in comparison with other policies, under realistic users' power requests, and with different costs functions.

710,"This paper proposes a flexible optimization method, based on state of the art algorithms, for the smart control of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to balance wind power production. The problem is approached from the perspective of a balance responsible party (BRP) with a large share of wind power in its portfolio. The BRP uses controllable PHEVs to minimize the imbalance of its portfolio resulting from wind power forecast errors. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation in combination with dynamic programming is used to solve the multistage stochastic problem. The main difficulty for applying MDPs to this problem is to efficiently include time interdependence of the wind power forecast error. In the presented approach, the probability distribution and time interdependence of the forecast error are represented by a scenario tree. Because of the MDP formulation, the algorithm is adaptable to deal with different transition models and constraints. This feature enables to use the algorithm in a dynamic environment such as the future smart grid. To demonstrate this, a generic charging model for PHEVs is used in the BRP wind balancing case.

Both standalone and grid-connected operation modes in the dc side of the microgrid are analyzed. Concretely, a three-level hierarchical control system is implemented. In the primary control level, the decentralized control is realized by using the droop method. Local ac current proportional-resonant controller and dc voltage proportional-integral controller are employed. When the local load is connected to the dc bus, dc droop control is applied to obtain equal or proportional dc load current sharing. The common secondary control level is designed to eliminate the dc bus voltage deviation produced by the droop control, with dc bus voltage in the hybrid microgrid boosted to an acceptable range. After guaranteeing the performance of the dc side standalone operation by means of the primary and secondary control levels, the tertiary control level is thereafter employed to perform the connection to an external dc system. Meanwhile, the impact of the bandwidth of the secondary and tertiary control levels is discussed.

Moreover, high reactive power demand makes it more challenging due to the limitation of reactive capability of the wind generating system. A Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system consisting of a PermanentMagnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG), a hybrid energy storage, a dump load and a mains load is considered in this paper.

These microgrids offer an opportunity to energy users to lower their energy costs as well as enabling the power suppliers to regulate the utility grid. However, the integration of the renewable energy based sources into the smart grid increases the complexity of the main grid. The success of this scheme will be heavily reliant on accurate real-time information exchange between the microgrid, the main grid, and the consumers. The communication between these agents will be critical in implementation of intelligent decisions by the smart grid. The microgrids will be required to relay energy forecasts information to the utility grid. Similarly, customers will be expected to submit energy demand schedules, to actively monitor energy price signals, to participate in energy bids, and to respond to energy management signals in real time. This kind of grid-user interaction will be overwhelming and could result in consumer apathy. There is therefore a need to develop smart systems that will autonomously execute all these tasks without the prompting of the customers. This paper presents one such approach.

720,"This paper evaluates the electric demand response (DR) management for distributed large-scale Internet data centers (IDCs) via the stochastic optimization approach. The electric DR of IDCs refers to the capability of optimally shifting cloud service tasks among distributed IDCs. Thus, the energy consumption reduction at certain IDC locations could be considered as the DR provision capacity in day-ahead DR programs. Cloud service tasks of IDCs include processing, storage, and computing tasks, which are further categorized into interruptible and non-interruptible tasks. The proposed model determines the optimal hourly DR capabilities of individual IDCs while considering uncertain coming cloud service tasks to individual IDCs. The major contribution of this paper is to rigorously formulate the DR capability of IDCs as changes in the electricity consumption when shifting cloud service tasks among distributed IDCs in different time zones, while considering the energy consumption for providing IT service, cooling, shifting cloud service tasks, environmental impacts, and uncertain coming tasks. The proposed model would enhance the financial situation and improve the environmental impacts of distributed IDCs by participating in day-ahead DR programs. The stochastic optimization adopts scenario-based approach via the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the total electricity cost, which is the expected electricity payment minus the revenue from the DR provision.

721,"Among many significant smart grid initiatives and challenges considered by many utilities and within the research community, are those associated with the energy management and conservation, in particular the management of energy demand during peak load periods. In this paper, a novel method for peak load curtailment by using a fuzzy system approach is presented. The proposed method is based on the application of fuzzy logic principles for peak load curtailment in a smart grid environment. The inputs to the system are the utility peak load data consisting of many energy demand scenarios, and the outputs are the necessary demand response power reductions required for the load curtailment during the peak load periods.

722,"In this paper, we develop optimization and control methods for a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) storage system. The storage component consists of two separate units, a large slower moving unit for energy shifting and arbitrage and a small rapid charging unit for smoothing. We use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to allow the units to automatically and dynamically adapt to changes in PV output while responding to external system operator requests or price signals. At each time step, the system is modeled using convex objectives and constraints and solved to obtain a control schedule for the storage units across the MPC horizon. For each subsequent time step, the first step of the schedule is executed before repeating the optimization process to account for changes in the operating environment and predictions due to availability of additional information. We present simulation results that demonstrate the ability of this optimization framework to respond dynamically in real time to external price signals and provide increased system benefits including smoother power output while respecting and maintaining the functional requirements of the storage units and power converters.",WOS:000331985300050,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Wang, T., Kamath, H. and Willard, S.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",38,10.1109/Tsg.2013.2292525,Mar,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,batteries,distributed power generation,distributed energy resources,dynamic pricing,energy management,energy storage,photovoltaic systems,power quality,power system control,smoothing,solar power generation,electric-power systems,energy-storage,solar,limits,wind,pv,,,English,Ab7qh,1010-1017,14883,Journal Article,Control and Optimization of Grid-Tied Photovoltaic Storage Systems Using Model Predictive Control,7,Control and Optimization of Grid-Tied Photovoltaic Storage Systems Using Model Predictive Control,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000331985300050,5,2014

We formulate a Markov decision problem to minimize an EV's expected cost over a fixed charging horizon. We account for both Markov random prices and a Markov random regulation signal. We also propose an enhancement to the classical discrete stochastic dynamic programming method. This enhancement allows optimization over a continuous space of decision variables via linear programming at each state.

724,"This paper proposes a decentralized storage strategy to support voltage control in low-voltage (LV) residential feeders with high photovoltaic (PV) capacity installed. The proposed strategy is capable of preventing overvoltage situations during high PV generation periods, by the use of locally controlled battery energy storage systems (ESS) at the PV system grid interface. The traditional way of operating a domestic ESS is based on charging the battery as soon as the PV generation exceeds the consumption, without taking into account overvoltage events during high PV generation hours; the proposed storage concept improves the traditional approach, thanks to the provision of voltage support. A novel method, based on voltage sensitivity analysis, identifies a common power threshold that triggers the ESSs activation in the feeder. A Belgian residential LV feeder is used as a case study.

725,"Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units are one of the major resources providing demand response (DR) in residential buildings. A DR program requires a large population of units to make a significant impact on power grid services like peak shaving and balancing. This paper investigates the importance of various HVAC physical parameters and their distributions that affect the aggregate response of a population of units to DR signals. This is a key step to the construction of HVAC models with DR functionality, given insufficient data, to predict the DR capacity available for dispatch. The HVAC model parameters include the size of floors, insulation efficiency, the amount of solid mass in the house, and efficiency. These parameters are usually assumed to follow Gaussian or Uniform distributions over the population. The impact of uncertainty in parameter distributions are quantified through the following steps: 1) Simulate the response of an HVAC population during the transient phase and during steady state for a given DR signal; 2) Use a quasi-Monte Carlo sampling method with linear regression and Prony analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of the DR output to the uncertainty in the parameter distributions; and 3) Identify important parameters based on their impact to the aggregate HVAC response.

731,"The need for high-speed multi-function protective relays in both traditional transmission systems and the new emerging paradigm of the smart grid is growing. As a widely used protective scheme for transmission lines, a distance relay's high speed and reliable operation to clear faults is essential. This paper proposes a real-time low-latency hardware digital distance protective relay on the field programmable gate array (FPGA). Taking advantage of inherent hard-wired architecture of the FPGA, the proposed hardware distance relay design is paralleled and fully pipelined to achieve low latencies in various relay modules which are developed in textual VHDL language. This low-latency feature allows fast operating and data throughput so that the relay can handle high-frequency sampled data and reach higher computational efficiency. In addition, the parallelism and hardwired architecture of the FPGA makes the design more reliable in computation than the sequential software-based numeric relay. The FPGA-based distance relay can operate on both phasor-based signals and instantaneous signals with 2.09 mu s and 0.35 mu s latency respectively based on the clock frequency of 100 MHz.

737,"Although the unique characteristics of intermittent wind generation have been acknowledged and drastic impacts of sudden wind drops have been experienced, no effective integration approach has been developed. In this paper, without considering transmission capacity constraints for simplicity, aggregated wind generation is modeled as a discrete Markov process with state transition matrices established based on historical data. Wind generation is then integrated into system demand with multiple net demand levels at each hour. To accommodate the uncertain net demand, a stochastic unit commitment problem is formulated based on states instead of scenarios. The objective is to minimize the total commitment cost of conventional generators and their total expected dispatch cost while satisfying all possible net demand levels. The advantage of this formulation is that the state at a time instant summarizes the information of all previous instants in a probabilistic sense for reduced complexity. With state transition probabilities given, state probabilities calculated before optimization, and the objective function and constraints formulated in a linear manner, the problem is effectively solved by using branch-and-cut.

741,"Integration of residential-level photovoltaic (PV) power generation and energy storage systems into the smart grid will provide a better way of utilizing renewable power. With dynamic energy pricing models, consumers can use PV-based generation and controllable storage devices for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electric bill cost. The residential storage controller should possess the ability of forecasting future PV power generation as well as the power consumption profile of the household for better performance. In this paper, novel PV power generation and load power consumption prediction algorithms are presented, which are specifically designed for a residential storage controller. Furthermore, to perform effective storage control based on these predictions, the proposed storage control algorithm is separated into two tiers: the global control tier and the local control tier. The former is performed at decision epochs of a billing period (a month) to globally ""plan"" the future discharging/charging schemes of the storage system, whereas the latter one is performed more frequently as system operates to dynamically revise the storage control policy in response to the difference between predicted and actual power generation and consumption profiles. The global tier is formulated and solved as a convex optimization problem at each decision epoch, whereas the local tier is analytically solved. Finally, the optimal size of the energy storage module is determined so as to minimize the break-even time of the initial investment in the PV and storage systems.",WOS:000331985300048,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Wang, Y.

742,"The objective of this work is to develop a mathematical model for the integration of electric vehicle (EVs) to the grid. Integrating the EV with the grid would help in simultaneous charging of numerous EVs and provide peak hour energy to the grid (from EV). This bi-directional exchange of energy between the grid and EV results in a complex financial calculations. So a simple model has been proposed. The energy provided by the EV to the grid depends on the battery capacity. Battery capacity is affected by capacity losses (CL). The model includes the possible cases of CL, such as CL due to battery usage (discharge during vehicle transportation) and CL due to the grid interaction. The main cause for a higher per kilometer (Km) transportation cost in EV, when compared to conventional vehicle, is the high cost of the battery and its maintenance. In this model, the economic analysis has been done in such a way that the battery related liabilities do not become a financial burden to EV owners. The above scenario has been evaluated for different combinations of charge rate and discharge rate ranging from to.

However, these new DERs may challenge the distribution grid due to insufficient capacity in peak hours.

Firstly, a theoretical market framework is described. Within this framework, FOs who represent their customer's (EV owners) interests will centrally guarantee the EV owners' driving requirements and procure the energy for their vehicles with lower cost.

Autonomous DSM programs have recently been proposed to achieve this goal by coordinating the users' energy consumption, using smart meters. On the other hand, this objective can be achieved only when the users actively contribute in DSM programs. Devising a fair billing mechanism is important to encourage the users to keep their contribution in the programs to achieve system optimality in the sense of minimum cost of the system. Another important issue in implementing DSM programs is protecting the users' privacy which is short addressed in DSM literature. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fairness, optimality and privacy in DSM systems. Next, we introduce a class of optimal billing mechanisms. We propose a subclass of optimal billing mechanisms which is fair in terms of distributing the energy cost across the users based on their contribution in minimizing the total cost of system.

This paper expands and evaluates appliance load signatures based on V-I trajectory-the mutual locus of instantaneous voltage and current waveforms-for precision and robustness of prediction in classification algorithms used to disaggregate residential overall energy use and predict constituent appliance profiles.

If the frequency drops below the threshold, the GFA controller output a switching off signal to shed some load.

749,"In the near future, with more distributed generators connected and new demands arising from the electrification of heat and transport in the distribution networks, infrastructure will become ever more stressed. However, building costly new circuits to accommodate generation and demand growth is time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, active network management (ANM) has been promoted in many countries, aiming to relieve network pressure. Previous research in ANM was focused on distribution areas with significant renewable penetration, where ANM reduced network pressure through significantly enhanced generation curtailment strategies rather than adopting traditional asset investment. This paper proposes the use of electric vehicles (EVs) as responsive demand to complement network stress relief that was purely based on generation curtailment. It is achieved by allowing EVs to absorb excessive renewable generation when they cause network pressure, and it thus can provide additional measures to generation curtailment strategies. The approach is illustrated on a practical extra-high voltage distribution system. The analyses clearly demonstrate the combined management of demand and generation is superior to previous sole generation management. The combined management strategy can achieve 7.9% improvement in utilization of renewable energy, and subsequently increase the net investment profit by 566 pound k.",WOS:000331985300031,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Zhou, L., Li, F.

752,"The paper deals with developing and testing frequency-adaptive PMU algorithms with wider linearity range than specified in IEEE Std C37.118-1. This goal is achieved by means of three different concepts encompassing robust state-of-the-art design approaches: 1) FIR bandpass filtering, 2) extended Kalman filtering (EKF), and 3) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) demodulation with FIR low-pass smoothing. While FIR-based PMUs are linear phase with no overshoot in either phase or amplitude step responses, the adaptive EKF PMU is more computer-intensive but allows for a reduced group delay and better out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with overshoot. Frequency measurement performances of the various PMUs are assessed in detail. It turned out that FIR PMUs are best for meeting Std C37-118-1 metrics but they are outperformed by EKF under changing harmonics.

However, the vehicle to grid (V2G) capacity varies over time based on the availability of the EVs and their individual state of charge (SOC). Hence a real-time V2G capacity estimation is important for utilizing EVs as SES efficiently. In this paper, an algorithm for half-hourly V2G capacity estimation using real-time EV scheduling is proposed. The algorithm is implemented as part of the Building Energy Management System (BEMS). The BEMS uses forecasted building load demand without EVs and predicted charging profiles of the EVs connected to the building for estimating the V2G capacity. The estimated V2G capacity and the availability of RESs are considered by the BEMS to schedule the EV charging/discharging. The proposed algorithm is applied to study three case scenarios using BEMS on residential, office, and commercial buildings in Singapore.

Contrary to classic DR approaches, the proposed scheme aims to continuously support the grid needs in terms of voltage control by broadcasting low-bit rate control signals on a fast time scale (i.e., every few seconds). Overall, the proposed DR mechanism is designed to i) indirectly reveal storage capabilities of end-customers and ii) have a negligible impact on the end-customer.

Domestic loads, likely to form significant proportions of the loads on islanded power systems such as those in remote rural communities, are currently modeled with homogenous and coarse load profiles developed from aggregated data. An objective of AMR deployment is to clarify the nature and variability of the residential LV customer. In this paper, an algorithm for tracking the consistency of the behavior of small loads is presented. This would allow them to be assessed for their availability to provide demand services to the grid.

759,"Electric power industry is experiencing a movement from the existing conventional electric grid to a more reliable, efficient and secure smart grid. In order to achieve these goals, components such as energy storage will be included, and potentially in large scale. Many feasible applications of energy storage in power systems have been investigated. The major benefits of energy storage include electric energy time-shift, frequency regulation and transmission congestion relief. In this paper, we focus on the reliability improvement of the bulk power system brought by the utilization of energy storage in the local distribution systems integrated with renewable energy generation. An intelligent operation strategy for energy storage which improves reliability considering the renewable energy integration is presented. The smart grid communication and control network is utilized to implement the proposed energy storage operation. A bulk power system reliability evaluation framework is proposed to study the reliability impact brought by the energy storage integration and operation.

760,"Generation connected to electrical distribution systems requires reliable and timely detection of loss-of-mains (islanding). Passive loss-of-mains detection relays typically use measurements of parameters such as frequency, phase, and the magnitudes of voltage and current. If a part of the power network becomes islanded and there is a very close match between generation and demand of both active and reactive power, there is a risk that the relay will not be able to detect the loss-of-mains (LOM) event quickly, or perhaps at all. This is the ""non-detection zone""or NDZ. This paper proposes a combination of 2 generator control techniques which allow the NDZ to be avoided even when the generator has significant inertia. Firstly, the natural instability (when islanded) of a grid-connected control scheme consisting of integral and droop controls is recognized and exploited. Secondly, a simple strategy is added which makes occasional small, steady-state adjustments to the reactive power output of the generator. The scheme has been tested in the laboratory and shows that the 2 second detection time required by IEEE 1547 can be achieved, even when an exact match of active power generation and demand is initially configured, and the generator has a significant inertia.",WOS:000331985300007,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Roscoe, A.

762,"Cyber systems play a critical role in improving the efficiency and reliability of power system operation and ensuring the system remains within safe operating margins. An adversary can inflict severe damage to the underlying physical system by compromising the control and monitoring applications facilitated by the cyber layer. Protection of critical assets from electronic threats has traditionally been done through conventional cyber security measures that involve host-based and network-based security technologies. However, it has been recognized that highly skilled attacks can bypass these security mechanisms to disrupt the smooth operation of control systems. There is a growing need for cyber-attack-resilient control techniques that look beyond traditional cyber defense mechanisms to detect highly skilled attacks. In this paper, we make the following contributions. We first demonstrate the impact of data integrity attacks on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) on power system frequency and electricity market operation. We propose a general framework to the application of attack resilient control to power systems as a composition of smart attack detection and mitigation. Finally, we develop a model-based anomaly detection and attack mitigation algorithm for AGC. We evaluate the detection capability of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm through simulation studies. Our results show that the algorithm is capable of detecting scaling and ramp attacks with low false positive and negative rates.

763,"With ever-increasing penetration of non-dispatchable intermittent generation resources in electric grids all over the world, the system operators are facing more challenges to meet the system AGC requirements which aim to maintain the target grid frequency and scheduled tie flows. The utility scale energy storage applications have been often referred to as one of the potential solutions for improving the system frequency response, especially the speed of response. A new concept relating to the use of Dynamic Available AGC (DAA) of the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is proposed in this paper and applied in conjunction with the priority and proportional AGC signal distribution strategies. Additionally, this paper proposes an independent AGC control strategy based on Area Control Error (ACE) signal distribution to further enhance the impact of the fast response capability of the BESS. The same is accomplished by means of implementing an independent Proportional Integral (PI) controller without low-order filter typically associated with the ACE signal distribution. The AGC simulation results based on generation trip and normal load variance events, as tested on the El Salvador system model, indicate significant benefits to the system AGC performance when using the concept of the DAA for the BESS and the independent AGC control strategy. The AGC simulation results also indicate that the utilization of 10 MW/3.66 MWh BESS can replace about 36 MW conventional AGC units on the tested system model without compromising on the AGC performance of the system for day-to-day variations experienced in the system load.",WOS:000331985300056,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Cheng, Y.

For DBP, optimization problem is formulated with the objective of maximizing expected reward, which is received when the the amount of energy saving satisfies the contract. For a general distribution of energy consumption, we give a general condition for the optimal bid and outline an algorithm to find the solution without numerical integration. Furthermore, for Gaussian distribution, we derive closed-form expressions of the optimal bid and the corresponding expected reward. Regarding hotel energy, we characterize loads in the hotel and introduce several energy consumption models that capture major energy use. With the proposed models and DBP, simulation results show that DBP provides economics benefits to the hotel and encourages load scheduling.

This paper describes and evaluates a decentralized and ""packetized"" approach to PEV charge management, in which PEV charging is requested and approved for time-limited periods. This method, which is adapted from approaches for bandwidth sharing in communication networks, simultaneously ensures that constraints in the distribution network are satisfied, that communication bandwidth requirements are relatively small, and that each vehicle has fair access to the available power capacity. This paper compares the performance of the packetized approach to an optimization method and a first-come, first-served (FCFS) charging scheme in a test case with a constrained 500 kVA distribution feeder and time-of-use residential electricity pricing. The results show substantial advantages for the packetized approach. The algorithm provides all vehicles with equal access to constrained resources and attains near optimal travel cost performance, with low complexity and communication requirements.

769,"This paper studies risk-aware day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch for electric vehicle (EV) charging, aiming to jointly optimize the EV charging cost and the risk of the load mismatch between the forecast and the actual EV loads, due to the random driving activities of EVs. It turns out that the consideration of the load mismatch risk in the objective function significantly complicates the risk-aware day-ahead scheduling problem (indeed it involves nonconvex optimization). A key step taken here is to utilize a hidden convexity structure to recast this problem as a two-stage stochastic linear program, and then solve it by using the L-shaped method. Since the computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of EVs, an estimation algorithm is developed based on importance sampling to mitigate the computational complexity. Further, a distributed risk-aware real-time dispatch algorithm is developed, in which the aggregator needs to compute only the shadow prices for each EV to optimize its own charging strategy in a distributed manner. It is shown, based on real data, that the proposed risk-aware day-ahead scheduling algorithm using importance sampling can significantly reduce the overall charging cost with a small number of samples.",WOS:000331985300016,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Yang, L., Zhang, J.

With the emerging smart grid technologies and large scale integration of variables resources into the grid, the market for ancillary services is expected to grow, and thus, their prices become increasingly important. The prices of ancillary services feature different patterns and characteristics when compared to electric energy prices.

The performance of our model has been verified by forecasting wind power up to 48 hours ahead at seven wind farms for one and a half years. Our model ranked fourth in the Power and Energy Society (PES) wind power forecasting competition. The forecasting model uses 52 Neural Network (NN) sub-models and five Gaussian Process (GP) sub-models in parallel. For 48 hours, the NN sub-models forecast the future wind power based on historical wind power data and forecasted wind information. In parallel, for the first five hours, five GP sub-models are used to forecast wind power using only historical wind power in order to provide accurate wind power forecasts to NN sub-models.

In this paper, we augment this concept by introducing SOCCA, a cyber-physical security evaluation technique to plan not only for accidental contingencies but also for malicious compromises. SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity. The results are valuable in both cyber and physical domains.

In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces.

780,"Reactive power injection in smart grid distribution networks via distributed generators is envisioned to play a vital role in voltage/VAR support. In this paper, we integrate the three aspects of voltage/VAR support: modeling, state estimation and network control in a single framework. Firstly, we develop an input to state nonlinear dynamic model that incorporates power flow equations along with load and distributed generation (DG) forecasts. Then, considering an extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach for nonlinear state estimation, we analyze the impact of dropped packets on stability of estimation process. Finally, we apply separation principle locally around some known state estimates, to design a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) based voltage/VAR support strategy. The control problem aims to minimize the aggregate reactive power injected by DG with the following constraints: 1) voltage regulation; 2) phase imbalance correction; and 3) maximum and minimum reactive power injection by individual generators. Considering computational complexity incurred in search for the optimal solution for large scale nonlinear control problems, we propose a successive time varying linear (STVL) approximation to our voltage/VAR control problem.

This paper proposes a new communication-based protection scheme for isolated microgrids where a data mining approach is used to identify the relay settings and parameters. A feature selection technique is implemented to help identify the most relevant electrical features required for the fault detection and to establish the best communication strategy to use between relays.

782,"Scenarios of near future wind power are synthesized by considering the power spectral density (PSD), statistical characteristics, and the future capacity. The PSD of the wind power follows different power laws over different frequency ranges and is approximated by a piecewise function. A scaling exponent of the power law for a particular piece can be approximated by the slope of an affine function fitted to a logarithmic plot of the PSD. Each piece of the function has a different trend as the total capacity increases. Slope trends, the first PSD value, and the last PSD value are trained to forecast the PSD. Then, future wind power scenarios are synthesized from the forecasted PSD. In this process, phase angles are searched using a genetic algorithm while satisfying forecasted statistical characteristics for the given capacity. Our approach is simulated and validated for wind power for seven years in ERCOT and is used to synthesize a future wind power scenario at 10,000 MW capacity.

783,"We address demand-side management of dispatchable loads in a residential microgrid by means of decentralized controllers deployed in each household. Controllers simultaneously optimize two possibly conflicting objectives: minimization of energy costs for the end user (considering a known, time-dependent tariff) and stabilization of the aggregate load profile (load flattening). The former objective can be optimized independently by each controller. On the other hand, the latter could benefit from a communication infrastructure that allows the controllers to explicitly exchange information and coordinate. To study how different levels of communication pervasiveness affect system performance, we developed a realistic micro-simulation environment accounting for the behavior of residents, dispatchable and non-dispatchable household loads, and the effects on the distribution network. We considered a generic model of communication among household controllers, not tied to any specific technology, and based on the partitioning of the households in a number of groups (neighborhoods). Controllers within the same neighborhood enjoy full connectivity, but cannot interact with controllers outside of their neighborhood. Through extensive simulation experiments, we observed that even communication neighborhoods constituted by as few as 3-4 households are sufficient to effectively stabilize the aggregate network load profile, with minimal bandwidth consumption. Increasing the neighborhood size leads to comparatively negligible performance improvements. We conclude that effective load flattening can be achieved with minimal requirements of communication infrastructure and transmitted information.",WOS:000329517300009,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Giusti, A., Salani, M., Di Caro, G.

785,"In the smart grid, the large scale wind power penetration tends to expand vastly. Nevertheless, due to the intermittent power generation from wind, this may cause a problem of large frequency fluctuation when the load-frequency control (LFC) capacity is not enough to compensate the unbalance of generation and load demand. Also, in the future transport sector, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is widely expected for driving in the customer side. Generally, the power of PHEV is charged by plugging into the home outlets as the dispersed battery energy storages. Therefore, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power control can be applied to compensate for the inadequate LFC capacity. This paper focuses on the new coordinated V2G control and conventional frequency controller for robust LFC in the smart grid with large wind farms. The battery state-of-charge (SOC) is controlled by the optimized SOC deviation control. The structure of frequency controller is a proportional integral (PI) with a single input. To enhance the robust performance and robust stability against the system uncertainties, the PI controller parameters and the SOC deviation are optimized simultaneously by the particle swarm optimization based on the fixed structure mixed H-2/H-infinity control.

786,"The electricity market plays a key role in realizing the economic prophecy of smart grids. Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to construct prediction intervals of MCPs with a two-stage formulation. In the first stage, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to estimate point forecasts of MCPs and model uncertainties involved. In the second stage, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the noise variance.

However, in order to be successful, these markets will heavily rely on accurate forecasts of consumption and/or production from its participants. This issue has not been widely researched in the context of such markets, and it presents a clear roadblock for wide market adoption as forecasting errors result in penalty and opportunity costs. Forecasting individual demand often leads to large errors. However, these errors can be reduced through the creation of groups, however small.

Since more and more dispersed generators are installed on the demand side of power systems and they are reconfigured frequently, developing automatic approaches is indispensable for effectively managing a large-scale distribution network. Existing fast methods employ local updates that gradually improve the loss to solve such an optimization problem. However, they eventually get stuck at local minima, resulting in arbitrarily poor results. In contrast, this paper presents a novel optimization method that provides an error bound on the solution quality. Thus, the obtained solution quality can be evaluated in comparison to the global optimal solution. Instead of using local updates, we construct a highly compressed search space using a binary decision diagram and reduce the optimization problem to a shortest path-finding problem.

The effect of wind uncertainty on the competitive market equilibrium is then quantified. Perturbation analysis methods are used to compare the equilibria in the nominal and perturbed markets. This analysis is used to quantify the effect of RERs uncertainty and its possible mitigation using DR.

795,"By leveraging recent advances in atmospheric reanalysis it is possible to more fully characterize the effects of low frequency weather phenomena simultaneously affecting the native load and power output of weather-sensitive generators. To this end, this paper describes load ""hindcasting""-a method of using reanalysis data to re-synthesize multiple decades of historical load data such that it represents a current and consistent load profile. When used together with coincident, reanalysis-derived records of weather-sensitive power output, load hindcasting enables a robust, long-term characterization of these resources that accounts for weather variability spanning decades. Drawing from the field of short-term load forecasting, hierarchical load hindcasting models are developed for summer weekday hours in New England using weather variables from the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

797,"Environmental issues in power systems operation lead to a rapid deployment of renewable wind generations. Wind generation is usually given the highest priority by assigning zero or negative energy bidding prices in the day-ahead power market, in order to effectively utilize available wind energy. However, when congestions occur, negative wind bidding prices would aggravate negative locational marginal prices (LMPs) in certain locations. The paper determines the proper amount of demand response (DR) load to be shifted from peak hours to off peaks under the Independent System Operator's (ISO) direct load control, for alleviating transmission congestions and enhancing the utilization of wind generation. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is to minimize the total operation cost while incorporating explicit LMP formulations and non-negative LMP requirements into the network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problem, which are derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the economic dispatch (ED) problem.

A multistage Support Vector Regression (MSVR)-based model is proposed to estimate the load without voltage reduction during the CVR period. The first stage is to select a set of load profiles that are close to the profile under estimation by a Euclidian distance-based index; the second stage is to train the SVR prediction model using the pre-selected profiles; the third stage is to re-select the estimated profiles to minimize the impacts of estimation errors on CVR factor calculation. Compared with previous efforts to analyze the CVR outcome, this MSVR-based technique does not depend on selections of control groups or assumptions of any linear relationship between the load and its impact factors. In order to deal with the variability of CVR performances, a stochastic framework is proposed to assist utilities in selecting target feeders.

To overcome this issue, this paper presents detailed small-signal admittance models, analysis, and stabilization of a voltage-source inverter (VSI)-based microgrid with direct online IM load. The resultant source (VSI) and load (IM) admittances form a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system.

802,"Demand response and dynamic retail pricing of electricity are key factors in a smart grid to reduce peak loads and to increase the efficiency of the power grid. Air-conditioning and heating loads in residential buildings are major contributors to total electricity consumption. In hot climates, such as Austin, Texas, the electricity cooling load of buildings results in critical peak load during the on-peak period. Demand response (DR) is valuable to reduce both electricity loads and energy costs for end users in a residential building. This paper focuses on developing a control strategy for the HVACs to respond to real-time prices for peak load reduction. A proposed dynamic demand response controller (DDRC) changes the set-point temperature to control HVAC loads depending on electricity retail price published each 15 minutes and partially shifts some of this load away from the peak. The advantages of the proposed control strategy are that DDRC has a detailed scheduling function and compares the real-time retail price of electricity with a threshold price that customers set by their preference in order to control HVAC loads considering energy cost. In addition, a detailed single family house model is developed using OpenStudio and Energyplus considering the geometry of a residential building and geographical environment. This HVAC modeling provides simulation of a house. Comfort level is, moreover, reflected into the DDRC to minimize discomfort when DDRC changes the set-point temperature. Our proposed DDRC is implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and connected to the EnergyPlus model via building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB). The real-time retail price is based on the real-time wholesale price in the ERCOT market in Texas. The study shows that DDRC applied in residential HVAC systems could significantly reduce peak loads and electricity bills with a modest variation in thermal comfort.",WOS:000329517300012,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Yoon, J.

804,"More and more cloud computing services are handled by different Internet operators in distributed Internet data centers (IDCs), which incurs massive electricity costs. Today, the power usage of data centers contributes to more than 1.5% market share of electricity consumption across the United States. Minimization of these costs benefits cloud computing operators, and attracts increasing attentions from many research groups and industrial sectors. Along with the deployment of smart grid, the electrical real-time pricing policy promotes power consumers to adaptively schedule their electricity utilization for lower operational costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to enable electrical energy buffering in batteries to predictively minimize IDC electricity costs in smart grid. Batteries are charged when electricity price is low and discharged to power servers when electricity price is high. A power management controller is used per battery to arbitrate the charging and discharging actions of the battery. The controller is designed as a MPC-based (model predictive control) controller. To this end, an MPC power minimization problem is formulated based on a discrete state-space model with states of battery power level and cost.

In this paper, we present a novel framework for smart energy management based on the concept of quality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic usage is always guaranteed by theMG, while the quality usage is controlled based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i. e., QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual queues.

In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for the demand response based on cost minimization. Each user in the system will find an optimal start time and operating mode for the appliances in response to the varying electricity prices. We model the cost function for each user and the constraints for the appliances. We then propose an approximate greedy iterative algorithm that can be employed by each user to schedule appliances. In the proposed algorithm, each user requires only the knowledge of the price of the electricity, which depends on the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. In order for the users to coordinate with each other, we introduce a penalty term in the cost function, which penalizes large changes in the scheduling between successive iterations.

The way these effects may be included in relevant models is described for the case of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to generating probabilistic forecasts.

814,"The classical approach to long term load forecasting is often limited to the use of load and weather information occurring with monthly or annual frequency. This low resolution, infrequent data can sometimes lead to inaccurate forecasts. Load forecasters often have a hard time explaining the errors based on the limited information available through the low resolution data. The increasing usage of smart grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technologies provides the utility load forecasters with high resolution, layered information to improve the load forecasting process. In this paper, we propose a modern approach that takes advantage of hourly information to createmore accurate and defensible forecasts. The proposed approach has been deployed across many U. S. utilities, including a recent implementation at North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC), which is used as the case study in this paper. Three key elements of long term load forecasting are being modernized: predictive modeling, scenario analysis, and weather normalization. We first show the superior accuracy of the predictive models attained from hourly data, over the classical methods of forecasting using monthly or annual peak data.

817,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of subsystems of distributed computation interconnected by computer networks that monitor and control switched physical entities interconnected by physical infrastructures. Finding a common semantic among these diverse subsystems that facilitates system synthesis, verification, and monitoring is a significant challenge of a CPS research program. Logical and temporal correctness of computational components, network timing, and frequency response are all system aspects that conspire to impede design, verification, and monitoring. Most current approaches ensure that each subsystem meets its individual specifications according to relevant metrics-stability of a physical system, safety and liveness of a cyber system, etc.-and then composes the overall system by functionality. The individual specifications are given in different semantics for each type of subsystem, and are in general equivalent to the cyber notion of correctness. This paper develops common semantics that span each aspect of a CPS through a new approach, unified invariants; unified invariants also ensure individual subsystem correctness but compose the overall system through logical truth instead of functionality. These individual invariants express and enforce system correctness common to the cyber, physical, and networking CPS subsystems and unified invariant approach ensures that the subsystems do not interfere with each others' correctness. In particular, the synthesis of switched dynamic CPSs will be unified by cyber, networking, and physical invariants rooted in the principal of Lyapunov-like functions.

This situation creates new requirements concerning the communication interface, computational intelligence and the ability to process data or signals and also to share information. Therefore, a considerable increase in data exchange and in storage is likely to occur. In this context, one must achieve an efficient use of channel communication bandwidth and a reduced need of storage space for power system data. Here, we review the main compression techniques devised for electric signal waveforms providing an overview of the achievements obtained in the past decades.

Furthermore, in the last few years, many countries are interested in renewable energies such as solar and wind. Renewable energy resources are mainly used for environmental and economic reasons such as reducing the carbon emission. It might also be used to reinforce the electric network especially during high peak periods. However, the injection of such energy resources in the low-voltage (LV) network can leads to high voltage constrains. To overcome this issue, one can motivate customers to use thermal or electric storage devices during high-production periods of PV to foster the integration of renewable energy generation into the network. In this paper, we are interested in forecasting household-level electricity demand which represents a key factor to assure the balance supply/demand in the LV network.

This method can be used in conjunction with available bad data detection (BDD) methods to isolate multiple bad data which are otherwise difficult to handle. The proposed procedure relies on secure measurements of bus voltage magnitudes to define a measurement residual using potentially compromised active and reactive power flow measurements on transmission lines. The proposed residual can be calculated in real-time. In addition, the component of the proposed residual on any particular line depends only locally on the component of the data attack on the same line. This makes the proposed residual well-suited for distributed data attack isolation in large-scale power networks. Furthermore, it can be shown that the proposed procedure becomes more effective when measurements from multiple time instances can be utilized.

With increased variable consumption from EVs together with anticipated increased production from variable sources, due to renewable wind and solar power, also the balancing of the electric power system incur increased attention. This emphasizes the importance of developing models to estimate and investigate the stochasticity of personal car travel behavior and induced EV charging load.

Multiple scenarios are presented to the closed-loop PFM test environment to demonstrate the algorithms ability of detecting and alleviating thermal overloads and recognizing when the constraint has passed.

The main objective is to effectively compensate the harmonic currents of nonlinear loads using electronically-coupled distributed generation (DG) units. The proposed control strategy consists of a multi proportional resonant controller (MPRC) with adjustable resonance frequency and a harmonic impedance controller (HIC). The MPRC and HIC are, respectively, proposed to regulate the microgrid voltage and to share the harmonic currents of the nonlinear loads among the DG units. A conventional droop scheme is also employed to share the average powers of the loads between the DG units. Moreover, a virtual negative-sequence impedance control loop is augmented to the proposed control system to compensate the negative-sequence currents of the unbalanced loads.

829,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) charged in a manner that is optimal to the power system will tend to increase the utilization of the lowest cost power generating units on the system, which in turn encourages investment in these preferable forms of generation. Were these gains to be substantial, they could be reflected in future charging tariffs as a means of encouraging EV ownership. However, where the impact of EVs is being quantified, much of the system benefit can only be observed where generator scheduling is performed by unit-commitment based methods. By making use of a rapid, yet robust unit-commitment algorithm, in the context of a capacity expansion procedure, this paper quantifies the impact of EVs for a variety of demand and wind time-series, relative fuel costs and EV penetrations.

830,"Power line communications ( PLCs) have recently absorbed interest in the smart grid since they offer communication capability in an easy and simple deployment. The main role of PLC access network ( PLC-AN), which is constructed with medium and low voltage distribution networks, is to exchange control signals between substations and end users or to provide the Internet access to homes. Since a transmission signal of narrowband PLC penetrates electronic devices, a use of opportunistic routing ( OR) can be a viable option in PLC-AN design. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of OR use in PLC-AN and propose a customized OR for it, named PLC-OR, which uses static geographical information. For doing this, we formulate a bit-meter per second maximization problem and solves it in a distributed manner. Through simulations, we confirm that our proposed PLC-OR successfully reduces packet transmission time compared to the traditional sequential routing while achieving the same level of reliability in packet delivery.",WOS:000329517300030,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Yoon, S.

832,"Many demand response resources are technically capable of providing ancillary services. In some cases, they can provide superior response to generators, as the curtailment of load is typically much faster than ramping thermal and hydropower plants. Analysis and quantification of demand response resources providing ancillary services is necessary to understand the resources' economic value and impact on the power system. Methodologies used to study grid integration of variable generation can be adapted to the study of demand response. In the present work, we describe and implement a methodology to construct detailed temporal and spatial representations of demand response resources and to incorporate those resources into power system models. In addition, the paper outlines ways to evaluate barriers to implementation.

834,"We propose privacy-preserving energy management strategies for a microgrid system that consists of several cells and a central control center, with each cell composed of a local controller, a distributed renewable energy generator, and some energy consuming customers. It is assumed that the cells can cooperate by exchanging their locally generated energy and they can obtain external energy, both through the control center. The goal of energy management is to distribute the energy flow within the microgrid system to meet the energy demands of the customers and to minimize the cost of the external energy imported to the system. The problem is formulated as a linear optimization problem with privacy constraints. However, the privacy constraint, i e., the constraint that the information related to the customers' behaviors in a cell cannot be disclosed to other cells and/or the control center, makes the standard linear programming tools not directly applicable. This motivates us to develop privacy-preserving schemes for effective energy management in such systems. To this end, we develop a dual decomposition-based algorithm and a fast suboptimal algorithm to solve the energy management problem with privacy constraints in a distributed fashion.

836,"The vast installation of intermittent energy sources (especially wind) has distorted the normal strict pattern of the net demand (demand minus RES production), increasing the importance of real-time balancing markets, which handle efficiently imbalances between supply and demand. In this paper, the incorporation of demand response bids within a real-time balancing market is modeled. The price signal, to which the demand responds, is a price derived from the total cost incurred by increasing or decreasing power of generation units, with a pay-as-bid pricing scheme. The demand price is defined implicitly as a function of the upward and downward supply offers. The proposed balancing market clearing model is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem. All inter-zonal and intra-zonal dc transmission constraints are incorporated to the problem, thus making it a problem of interregional balancing, and nodal prices are derived from its clearing. The credits/debits to generators for providing balancing energy are balanced in zonal and system level with the debits/credits of elastic and inelastic demand entities. The proposed model can be useful for designing future real-time balancing markets, in view of the forthcoming active participation of price-responsive demand and the significant RES penetration targets set by most countries.",WOS:000328064100025,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Vlachos, A.

We assume that users are equipped with smart appliances that allow delay in satisfying demands, and one central controller that makes energy usage decisions on when and how to satisfy the scheduled demands. We formulate a dynamic programming model for the control problem. The model deals with stochastic demand arrivals and schedules the demands based on their own allowable delays, which are specified by users. However, the dynamic programming model encounters the ""curses of dimensionality"" and some other difficulties, thus is hard to solve. We develop a decentralization-based heuristic first, and also propose an approximation approach based on Q-learning. Finally, we conduct numerical studies on a testing problem.

If the transmission violation detected by the Energy Management System (EMS) requires redispatch, system operator will transfer the transmission constraint information to UDS for resolution through a manual process. Dispatchers need to make an educated guess on constraint trends to support their manual redispatch process.

This paper advocates statistical inference methods to robustify power monitoring tasks against the outlier effects owing to faulty readings and malicious attacks, as well as against missing data due to privacy concerns and communication errors. In this context, a novel load cleansing and imputation scheme is developed leveraging the low intrinsic-dimensionality of spatiotemporal load profiles and the sparse nature of ""bad data.""

Upon recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to decentralized optimization, a distributed (D-) PCP algorithm is developed to carry out the imputation and cleansing tasks using networked devices comprising the so-termed advanced metering infrastructure.

Threemetrics are introduced to quantitatively measure the spatial and/or temporal similarity of metered power profiles.

In addition, batteries are employed to disguise the actual appliance power profile along with the scheduling horizon and enhance the electric privacy protection.

849,"This paper concerns mathematical conditions under which a system-level optimization of supply and demand scheduling can be implemented as a distributed optimization in which users and suppliers, as well as the load serving entities, are decision makers with well-defined sub-objectives. We start by defining the optimization problem of the system that includes the sub-objectives of many different players, both supply and demand entities in the system, and decompose the problem into each player's optimization problem, using Lagrange dual decomposition. A demand entity or a load serving entity's problem is further decomposed into problems of the many different end-users that the load serving entity serves. By examining the relationships between the global objectives and the local/individual objectives in these multiple layers and the optimality conditions of these decomposable problems, we define the requirements of these different objectives to converge. We propose a novel set of methods for coordinating supply and demand over different time horizons, namely day-ahead scheduling and real-time adjustment. We illustrate the ideas by simulating simple examples with different conditions and objectives of each entity in the system.",WOS:000328064100036,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Joo, J. Y. and Ilic, M.

850,"This paper suggests a decentralized optimization of residential demand to minimize the cost to the utility company and customers while maintaining customer satisfaction. As an important feature, distribution system constraints such as equipment capacity, line flow limits, and phase balance constraints are taken into account. Due to the large amount of uncertainty in the residential demand, a two-stage pricing is considered. In the first stage, day-ahead prices as well as residential appliance scheduling are determined through interaction of the utility company and residential customers. Uncertainty of the customer demand is also considered in the day-ahead pricing. In the second stage, on the other hand, prices will be updated based on the actual residential loads. Similar to locational marginal price (LMP) in transmission system, customers on different nodes are charged with different prices.

851,"Automatic bus transfer scheme (ABTS) is the practice of transferring a load bus to an alternate source when the normal power supply fails or is tripped thus ensuring continuity of supply. This paper comprehensively reviews existing schemes and implementations of ABTS especially for motor bus. To limit the fault levels, during certain situations, the transformers supplying a primary distribution substation can be run in split instead of parallel operation. This is because during outages if one transformer is lost, overloading of remaining transformers, if it occurs, can be managed. This paper proposes an ABTS for a primary distribution substation for a utility facing such a situation and present details of its implementation. In the proposed scheme which is enabled by digital communications, if a transformer is lost, the bus section circuit breaker (CB) will be closed automatically after the incomer CB trips. The proposed ABTS has been implemented in the bus section relay for a new 11 kV switchboard where inter-relay communication is based on the IEC 61850 suites of standard.

We begin with an analysis of partial schemes which are being implemented in many established markets. These schemes can be considered inefficient due to externalities that occur amongst DR beneficiaries including the transmission network company (Transco), distribution network companies (Discos), and retail electricity companies (Recos). This limitation of existing schemes motivates the development of a new concept-demand response exchange (DRX)-a separated market for trading DR fairly and flexibly across all beneficiaries.

854,"Demand response is increasingly important in many power systems but Transmission System Operators (TSO) require confirmation that the response is available if it is to be used effectively. Demand response may be used to minimise the amount of spinning reserve obtained from partially loaded generators. The ability of the proposed smart metering communication system in the U.K. to report the available demand response from domestic appliances was examined. This communication system expects to send all data traffic at an average rate of about 190 Mbytes per minute through a central Data Communication Company (DCC) to any actor operating in the power system. It is unlikely that this communication system will, in addition, support reporting demand response in near real-time. Using load profiles of fridges, cooking appliances and washers and dryers, the load profiles of 40 000 houses were constructed. These load profiles were used to calculate the average number of load changes in a typical house, a 11/0.4 kV transformer and a high voltage substation. Using these average numbers of load changes and the number of transformers and substations in the U.K. power system, the number of messages sent by all smart meters in the U.K. was calculated. It is shown that the wide area network proposed for the U.K. need to send an additional 162 Mbytes per minute to report demand response in near real-time. Then, a hierarchically arranged communication system that follows the hierarchy of electrical network was examined. It was assumed that aggregating units are installed at distribution transformers and substations. It is shown that by aggregating and sending only measurement changes, the number of bytes sent through the U.K. smart metering communication system per minute could be reduced from 162 M to 30 k. This has important implications as the U.K. is now finalizing the specifications for smart metering communications for about 27 million smart electricity meters that will be installed in the period 2014-2020.",WOS:000328064100012,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Samarakoon, K., Ekanayake, J. and Jenkins, N.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Inst Energy, Cardiff CF24 3AA, S Glam, Wales",24,10.1109/Tsg.2013.2258045,Dec,1949-3053,4,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,communication network,demand response,load control,smart grid,smart meter,supply and demand,implementation,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,266ZT,1842-1851,15015,Journal Article,Reporting Available Demand Response,18,Reporting Available Demand Response,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000328064100012,4,2013
855,"This paper proposes a new formulation for a stochastic unit commitment (UC) problem that incorporates two major and common sources of uncertainty in short-term generation scheduling, namely, unavailability of generators and load uncertainty. The objective is to minimize operating cost and expected loss of load cost subject to reliability constraints in terms of loss of load probability. The problem is first formulated as a two-stage recourse model in stochastic programming framework where generator unavailability is expressed by a discrete set of outage scenarios and system demand is set to be a nominal value in power balance equations. Then, load uncertainty is represented as a continuous random variable in loss of load probability constraint, which is approximated by a mixed-integer piecewise linear function and integrated to the second stage problem. As a result, the UC problem has a much smaller dimension as compared to the original two-stage recourse model. The proposed formulation can be solved in a timely manner even though the formulation requires some extra binary decision variables. Although loss of load probability constraint is approximated in the optimization problem, simulation results show that the optimal solutions yield desired reliability performance.

856,"In this paper, a comprehensive dedicated framework is set up to analyze distributed multi-generation (DMG) systems for the purpose of identifying and quantifying their potential to participate in real-time demand response (DR) programmes. At first, flexibility of DMG systems with multiple interconnected plant components is exploited to identify the optimal operational strategy in the presence of half-hourly pricing. Then, the costs and benefits of providing further real-time DR are assessed by taking into account different energy shifting strategies. The novel concept of electricity shifting potential is introduced to establish the upper limit to the possible reduction of the electricity flowing from the electrical grid to the DMG system. The maximum profitable energy shifting that can be activated in the presence of given DR incentives is established on the basis of a DR profitability map. The key point is that energy shifting can be deployed inside the local DMG system to respond to given DR signals without reducing the users' energy demand and thus without affecting their comfort level.

We aim to optimally schedule the usage of all the energy resources in the system and minimize the long-term time averaged expected total cost of supporting all users' load demands. In particular, we first formulate an optimization problem, which turns out to be a time-coupling problem and prohibitively expensive to solve. Then, we reformulate the problem using Lyapunov optimization theory and develop a dynamic energy management scheme that can dynamically solve the problem in each time slot based on the current system state only. We are able to obtain both a lower and an upper bound on the optimal result of the original optimization problem.

860,"In a deregulated market, wholesale energy costs and distribution investment costs contribute significantly to consumers' electricity bills. However, in a low carbon electrical power system, the two cost pressure points may not be synchronous in time and space with each other. This paper develops a novel methodology for home area energy management as a key vehicle for demand response, using electricity storage devices. The aim is to enable energy storage at consumer premises to not only take advantage of lower wholesale energy prices, but also to support low voltage (LV) distribution networks for reducing network investment. New operation strategies for domestic energy storage to facilitate demand response (DR) are developed in the paper. They have the capability to maximize the overall savings in energy costs and investment costs. In the proposed approach, the operation of home-area energy storage devices is jointly conducted by end customers and network operators. The purpose is to fight for an optimal balance between DRs to energy price and to network congestion, and thus to maximize benefits for both consumers and network operators. An intensive study is carried out to investigate the impacts of different dispatch strategies on wholesale energy costs and network investment costs. Benefit quantification methods are introduced as well to evaluate the total benefits in terms of savings in energy costs and investment costs that can be brought along by the proposed operation approach.

In this paper we show how to formulate the problem of planning short-term load curtailment in a dense urban area, in the presence of uncertainty in electricity demand and in the state of the distribution grid, as a stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem. We propose three rolling-horizon look-ahead policies to approximately solve the optimization problem: a deterministic one and two based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP) techniques. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the ADP-based policies yield curtailment plans that are more robust on average than the deterministic policy, but at the expense of the additional computational burden needed to calibrate the ADP-based policies. We also show how the worst case performance of the three approximation policies compares with a baseline policy where all curtailable loads are curtailed to the maximum amount possible.",WOS:000328064100050,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Simao, H.

The solution here goes further in that it also supports the control of slow single-phase and fast three-phase charging through one and the same power electronic converter. A unified control methodology for the on-board chargers in electric vehicles is proposed. The control is distinguished in that it can perform four-quadrant operation while connected in single-phase or three-phase mode. The operation and network synchronization are automatically adjusted based on given terminal voltage and current measurements without the need for supplementary status signals. An analysis illustrates how the various measurements are processed for obtaining single-and three-phase flexibility while retaining compatibility with well-established methods of converter current mode control.

While the direct control of the consumption level of households is envisaged as a possibility, a credible alternative is that of indirect control based on price signals to be sent to these end-consumers. A methodology is described here allowing to estimate in advance the potential response of flexible end-consumers to price variations, subsequently embedded in an optimal price-signal generator. In contrast to some real-time pricing proposals in the literature, here prices are estimated and broadcast once a day for the following one, for households to optimally schedule their consumption. The price-response is modeled using stochastic finite impulse response (FIR) models. Parameters are estimated within a recursive least squares (RLS) framework using data measurable at the grid level, in an adaptive fashion. Optimal price signals are generated by embedding the FIR models within a chance-constrained optimization framework.

PEV charging stations will most likely be available at home and at work, offering flexible charging options. Ideally, each vehicle will charge when electricity prices are relatively low, to minimize the cost to the consumer and maximize societal benefits. A demand response (DR) service for a fleet of PEVs could yield such charging schedules by regulating consumer electricity use during certain time periods, in order to meet an obligation to the market. We construct an automated DR mechanism for a fleet of PEVs that facilitates vehicle charging to meet the needs of the vehicles and satisfy a load scheduling obligation. Our dynamic algorithm depends only on the knowledge of driving behaviors from a previous similar day, and uses a simple adjusted pricing scheme to instantly assign feasible and satisfactory charging schedules to thousands of vehicles in a fleet as they plug-in. The charging schedules generated using our adjusted pricing scheme can ensure that a new demand peak is not created and can reduce the consumer cost by over 30% when compared to standard charging, which may also increase peak demand by 3.5%.

885,"Retailers face the problem of meeting instantaneous and variable loads using two strategies: i) purchasing electricity from the pool market, and ii) signing bilateral contracts with producers. Since pool prices are highly volatile, retailers sign bilateral contracts with generators reducing the exposure to pool prices risks. Ideally, retailers would like to match sold energy to customers with energy from bilateral contracts. However, unpredictable variations in customers' loads force retailers to buy or sell energy in the pool market. This paper analyzes and proposes, from the retailers perspective, a model to set price changes which encourage customers to shift their loads considering time-of-use tariffs. This load redistribution will produce savings for the retailers, reducing the energy bought in the pool market during periods with high prices. On the other hand, customers redistributing their loads will get savings according to the new prices.

DR is represented in terms of linear price-responsive demand functions. A numerical case study based on load and wind profiles of Illinois is constructed with 20 candidate generating units of various types. Numerical results show the impact of DR on both investment and operational decisions. We also propose a model in which DR provides operating reserves and discuss its impact on lowering the total capacity needed in the system. We observe that a relatively small amount of DR capacity is sufficient to enhance the system reliability. When compared to the case with no DR, a modest level of DR results in less wind curtailment and better satisfaction of reserve requirements, as well as improvements in both the social surplus and generator utilization, as measured by capacity factors.",WOS:000328064100066,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Jin, S., Botterud, A. and Ryan, S.

We formulate the optimization problem based on a general plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) model, taking into account the randomness in vehicle mobility, time-of-use electricity pricing, and realistic battery modeling. Stochastic inventory theory is applied to analyze the problem. We mathematically prove that a state-dependent (S, S') policy is optimal for the daily energy cost minimization of each vehicle, and develop an estimation algorithm to calculate the parameters of the optimal policy for practical applications. Furthermore, we investigate the multi-vehicle aggregator design problem by considering the power system constraints. A policy adjustment scheme is proposed to adjust the values of S and S' with respect to the optimal policy adopted by each PHEV, such that the aggregated recharging and discharging power constraints of the power system can be satisfied, while minimizing the incremental cost (or revenue loss) of PHEV owners. Based on characteristics of the state-dependent (S, S') policy and our proposed policy adjustment scheme, the optimal aggregator operation problem is transformed into a convex optimization one which can be readily solved by existing algorithms.

The objective is to maximize the total expected net benefits over the planning horizon, incorporating the costs and benefits of electricity consumption, generation, ancillary services, load-shedding, storage and load-shifting. The overall framework could be characterized as a secure, stochastic, combined unit commitment and AC optimal power flow problem, solving for an optimal state-dependent schedule over a pre-specified time horizon. Uncertainty is modeled to expose the scenarios that are critical for maintaining system security, while properly representing the stochastic cost. The optimal amount of locational reserves needed to cover a credible set of contingencies in each time period is determined, as well as load-following reserves required for ramping between time periods. The models for centrally-dispatched storage and time-flexible demands allow for optimal tradeoffs between arbitraging across time, mitigating uncertainty and covering contingencies.

Operation policies decide the storage operation based on the probability density function of one step ahead wind power, which is forecasted by a Gaussian process. In this optimization problem, it is assumed that a financial penalty is incurred when violating the ramp rate limit (RRL), and that the penalty is linearly proportional to the number of MW per period above or below the RRLs. The L-shaped method is used to reduce the number of constraints caused by various wind power scenarios.

Often, there are several voltage source inverters (VSIs) based distributed generations (DGs) with a specific local droop characteristic for each DG in a MG. A load change in a MG may lead to imbalance between generation and consumption and it changes the output voltage and frequency of the VSIs according to the droop characteristics. If the load change is adequately large, the DGs may be unable to stabilize the MG. In the present paper, following a brief survey on the conventional voltage/frequency droop control, a generalized droop control (GDC) scheme for a wide range of load change scenarios is developed. Then to remove its dependency to the line parameters and to propose a model-free based GDC, a new framework based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed.

For microgrids that are not connected to the large electric grid, new control strategies must be designed to maintain proper grid voltage and frequency. In addition, microgrids with distributed power sources and load nodes may have frequent reconfiguration in grid architecture. Therefore, the control strategies ideally should be ""plug-and-play"", i.e., they should not require significant communication or architecture information, and they should work reliably as long as the supply/demand powers are reasonably balanced. Another unique issue of microgrids is the high resistance loss in distribution lines due to the low operating voltage. To reduce power losses, appropriate voltage control at distributed nodes is required which again must work in a plug-and-play fashion.

A phase management scheme is developed that defines optimal time shifts on the periodic loads in order to provide peak power and energy cost reduction over a limited time horizon. A gradient descent optimization technique, based on Taylor series, is applied to determine the phases of the pulses in discrete time steps. Three optimization strategies and two control schemes are explored. Minimization of peak power loads, minimization of energy costs and flattening of the power curve are modeled. A centralized and a distributed control scheme are explored. It is found that respectable peak power and cost reduction can be achieved in the centralized control scheme but redundant data transfer in the network and increased complexity is necessary. On the other hand, the distributed control scheme reduces the overall complexity but does not present significant savings.",WOS:000325488200010,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Koutitas, G. and Tassiulas, L.","Int Hellen Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece",17,10.1109/Tsg.2013.2246874,Sep,1949-3053,3,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,demand response,direct load control,smart grid,smart sensors/actuators network,synchronization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,232IX,1305-1313,15066,Journal Article,Periodic Flexible Demand: Optimization and Phase Management in the Smart Grid,4,Periodic Flexible Demand: Optimization and Phase Management in the Smart Grid,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325488200010,4,2013
906,"This paper presents the results of the development of Smart Grid transmission network applications in the Great Britain (GB) power system. A new Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) application for monitoring inter-area oscillations is developed. The core of this novel application is a fast nonlinear algorithm for the real-time estimation of the dominant inter-area oscillation mode, which processes GPS synchronized information obtained from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) installed in the power system. It is based on the Newton-Type Algorithm (NTA), an efficient parameter estimator. The paper focuses on the practical application of the new WAMS application: two data sets were tested, one based on computer simulations and the other based on real-life data records. The computer simulated oscillatory signals were obtained through dynamic simulations of the full GB power system model consisting of over 200 generators. The real-life data records used information collected by the FlexNet Wide Area Monitoring System (FlexNET-WAMS) installed in the GB network.

This proposed minimum-information-loss (MIL) method is distinguished in that it seamlessly unifies the maximum a-posteriori estimation of both analog and digital quantities such as bus voltages and switch statuses. Both analog and digital estimation residuals are obtained. MIL takes into account the a priori probabilities of the quantities to be measured and the losses incurred along the measurement's information channels with noise when minimizing the overall loss of information. For the identification of network topology errors and switch statuses, MIL processes digital data directly without using auxiliary analog pseudo-measurements.

908,"The integration of a massive number of small-scale wind turbines and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) brought about urgent technical challenge to power distribution network operators (DNOs) in terms of secure power supply and energy dispatching optimization. In this paper, we exploited three coordinated wind-PEV energy dispatching approaches in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) context, i.e., valley searching, interruptible and variable-rate energy dispatching, aiming to promote the user demand response through optimizing the utilization efficiency of wind power generation as well as meeting the dynamic power demands. This issue is addressed in a stochastic framework considering the uncertainties of wind power generation as well as the statistical PEV driving patterns. The performances of the proposed solutions are assessed through a comparative study through numerical simulation experiments covering sufficient system scenarios by the use of scenario generation and reduction techniques. The result demonstrates that the energy dispatch based on the latter two approaches can achieve better matching between power generation and demands as well as PEV user satisfaction.

Conventional protection concepts are normally based on protection schemes that consist of definite or inverse time overcurrent relays. In future power systems, these schemes can lead to high fault clearing times, unselective tripping and massive DG disconnections, which are not acceptable in a deregulated multi-owner energy market. This research work proposes an efficient intelligent communication-based protection algorithm that implements different multi-functional protection principles supported by blocking schemes. The real-time organization of both the hardware architecture and communication infrastructure of the protection algorithm is illustrated in detail.

With the integration of a two-way communication infrastructure, a smart grid allows its operator to monitor the production and usage of power in real time. Upon detection of significant events, the operator may send requests to intelligent loads to curtail their power usage. The operator can use load curtailments reactively for adaptation to the loss of generation capacity (e. g., with unpredictable renewable energy sources), or proactively for profit maximization by avoiding the use of expensive energy sources during peak hours. In this paper, we optimize operator profits for the different cases of load curtailment, under various practical constraints including the physical properties of the power system, and different cost and valuation functions for heterogeneous generation units and loads, respectively. We also investigate the requirements imposed by different cases of the load curtailment on the cyber infrastructure.

911,"Wind power is gaining in significance as an important renewable source of clean energy. However, due to their inherent uncertainty, wind generators are often unable to participate in the forward electricity markets like the more predictable and controllable conventional generators. Given this, virtual power plants (VPPs) are being advocated as a solution for increasing the reliability of such intermittent renewable sources. In this paper, we take this idea further by considering VPPs as coalitions of wind generators and electric vehicles, where wind generators seek to use electric vehicles (EVs) as a storage medium to overcome the vagaries of generation. Using electric vehicles in this manner has the advantage that, since the number of EVs is increasing rapidly, no initial investment in dedicated storage is needed. In more detail, we first formally model the VPP and then, through an operational model based on linear programming, we show how the supply to the Grid and storage in the EV batteries can be scheduled to increase the profit of the VPP, while also paying for the storage using a novel scheme. The feasibility of our approach is examined through a realistic case-study, using real wind power generation data, corresponding electricity market prices and electric vehicles' characteristics.",WOS:000325488200011,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Vasirani, M., Kota, R., Cavalcante, R.

Specifically, each household may have renewable generation, energy storage as well as inelastic and elastic energy loads, and the load serving entity attempts to coordinate the energy consumption of these households in order to minimize the total energy cost within this neighborhood. The renewable generation, the energy demand arrival, and the energy cost function are all stochastic processes and evolve according to some, possibly unknown, probabilistic laws. We develop an online control algorithm, called Lyapunov-based cost minimization algorithm (LCMA), which jointly considers the energy management and demand management decisions. LCMA only needs to keep track of the current values of the underlying stochastic processes without requiring any knowledge of their statistics. Moreover, a decentralized algorithm to implement LCMA is also developed, which can preserve the privacy of individual household owners.

917,Motor loads require high amount of reactive power for a short period during their startup. The high reactive power drawn from the system causes voltage dips at startup time and potentially overvoltage after motor startup is over. The voltage dip and overvoltage may cause the relays to trip and the system to go unstable. This phenomenon is more challenging in weak distribution systems and isolated systems such as microgrids due to the limited inertia of the master generator. This paper presents a dynamic voltage controller that coordinates all the reactive power sources in the system to provide the necessary reactive power during motor startup. The presented Model Predictive Control (MPC) based dynamic Volt/Var Control (VVC) scheme considers the dynamics of the microgrid in the VVC formulation to overcome the voltage dip caused by motor startup. This method uses predictions of voltage behavior of the system based on a simplified system model and tries to eliminate the effect of motor startup by coordinating the reactive power sources in the system.,WOS:000325488200012,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Falahi, M., Butler-Purry, K.

Finite-horizon scheduling optimization problems are formulated to exploit operational flexibilities of thermal and non-thermal appliances using a model predictive control (MPC) method which incorporates both forecasts and newly updated information. For thermal appliance scheduling, the thermal mass of the building, which serves as thermal storage, is integrated into the optimization problem by modeling the thermodynamics of rooms in a building as constraints. Within the comfort range modeled by the predicted mean vote (PMV) index, thermal appliances are scheduled smartly together with thermal mass storage to hedge against high prices and make use of low-price time periods. For non-thermal appliance scheduling, in which delay and/or power consumption flexibilities are available, operation dependence of inter-appliance and intra-appliance is modeled to further exploit the price variation.

924,"Optimal power flow (OPF) is considered for microgrids, with the objective of minimizing either the power distribution losses, or, the cost of power drawn from the substation and supplied by distributed generation (DG) units, while effecting voltage regulation. The microgrid is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers. The resulting algorithm entails iterative message-passing among groups of consumers and guarantees faster convergence compared to competing alternatives.",WOS:000325488200026,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Dall'Anese, E., Zhu, H. and Giannakis, G.

In this paper, a new index is proposed, ""protection coordination index"" (PCI), which can serve as an effective measure when planning the protection of meshed distribution systems with DG. A two-phase non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem is proposed to determine the PCI by optimally calculating variations in the maximum DG penetration level with changes in the protection coordination time interval. Furthermore, the influence of connecting a DG at a certain location on the system PCIs is examined.

That is, the resulting worst load voltage change can precisely remain within the range of predefined constraint using the feasible control inputs.

These are used in state estimation algorithms to make dispatch, re-balance and other energy management system [EMS] decisions. Coordinated cyber attacks on power meter readings can be designed to be undetectable by any bad data detection algorithm. These unobservable attacks present a serious threat to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of power meters on lines is presented. This requires O(n(2)m) flops for a power system with buses and line meters. If all lines are metered, there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks.

Impacts of PHEVs on distribution networks, although have been proven to be noticeable, have not been thoroughly investigated for future years.

As some of these effective characteristics depend on vehicle owner's behavior, their behavior and interests are considered in the proposed model. Also, to get a more practical model of PHEVs, the number of vehicles in a residential distribution network, the PHEV penetration level for upcoming years, distribution of PHEVs in the network, and estimation of household load growth for upcoming years are extracted from related published reports.

We employ a parallel autonomous optimization scheme, where each user requires only the knowledge of the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. All the users can execute distributed optimization simultaneously. The distributed optimization is coordinated through a soft constraint on changes of load schedules between iterations.

Simplified power-time flexibility models for appliances are introduced on which generic economic simulations can be based.

This shows that classical load shifting of washing appliances creates sufficient value in the day-ahead market to justify investments in smart energy control services. Cooling appliances create significant value on the balance market and while full scale deployment would lead to significant price erosion in today's market, it could accommodate additional unbalance caused future sustainable generation.

This paper considers the impact of frequency and voltage regulation on the optimal design of a conceptual, autonomous military microgrid. This microgrid comprises a solar panel and vehicles as power sources, with each vehicle incorporating a battery and generator. The power output and terminal voltage of these inverter-based sources must be regulated. The paper investigates the effects of battery DC voltage variations on a decentralized regulation scheme, and the resulting influence on optimal component sizing. To this end, controllers are first designed based on the typical assumption that the voltage on the DC side of each inverter is constant. The battery internal resistance is then considered and its impact on regulation performance is investigated. The results show that the battery internal resistance can affect the performance of both frequency and voltage regulation, and consequently must be taken into account in component sizing decisions.

Further, the effect of parametric uncertainty in the effective dc-link capacitance is mitigated by modifying the robust disturbance rejection controller, via the polynomial method, to ensure that the closed-loop poles are allocated in the pre-defined region in the complex plane even under parameter variation.

941,"PJM Interconnection operates the largest synchronized transmission system in North America, where one of the great challenges is being able to meet the system-wide voltage control performance requirements both pre-and post-contingency. Based on a characteristic analysis of the contingencies distribution, a practical method using an iteration scheme between the optimal power flow (OPF) and a contingency assessment (CA) is proposed to develop a control strategy, so that the calculated optimal voltage schedule solutions are better not only for pre-contingency system conditions, also for the post-contingency (N - 1) system conditions. At step T, a CA considering all contingencies is carried out and those that may lead to the maximized voltage violations are saved as active contingencies for step T + 1. At the same time, another CA, considering only the current active contingencies, is computed in parallel using a trial OPF result as input. According to the post-contingency indices, the new voltage constraints will be compressed and the final OPF is called again to calculate the optimal strategies. The detailed architecture of the PJM optimal voltage control (OVC) system is presented in this paper.

942,"This paper presents a technique to extract load signatures non-intrusively by using the smart meter data. Load signature extraction is different from load activity identification. It is a new and important problem to solve for the applications of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). For a target appliance whose signatures are to be extracted, the proposed technique first selects the candidate events that are likely to be associated with the appliance by using generic signatures and an event filtration step. It then applies a clustering algorithm to identify the authentic events of this appliance. In the third step, the operation cycles of appliances are estimated using an association algorithm. Finally, the electric signatures are extracted from these operation cycles. The results can have various applications. One is to create signature databases for the NILM applications. Another is for load condition monitoring. Validation results based on the data collected from three actual houses and a laboratory experiment have shown that the proposed method is a promising solution to the problem of load signature collection.",WOS:000325488200022,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Dong, M., Meira, P.

944,"Electricity consumption for plugged-in electric loads (PELs) accounts for more use than any other single end-use service in residential and commercial buildings. PELs possess potentials to be efficiently managed for many purposes. However, few existing load identification methods are designed for PELs to handle challenges such as the diversity within each type of PELs and similarity between different types of PELs with similar front-end power supply units. Existing methods provide only absolute decisions which are not reliable when handling these challenges. This paper presents a simple yet efficient and practical hybrid supervised self-organizing map (SSOM)/Bayesian identifier for PELs. The proposed identifier can classify PELs into clusters by inherent similarities due to similar front-end power supply topologies, extract and utilize statistical information, and provide the probability of the unknown load belonging to a specific type of load.

Nowadays, the concept of microgrids has become a key subject in the smart grid area, demanding a systematic procedure for their optimal construction. According to the IEEE Std 1547.4, large distribution systems can be clustered into a number of microgrids to facilitate powerful control and operation infrastructure in future distribution systems. However, clustering large systems into a set of microgrids with high reliability and security is not reported in current literature. To fill-out this gap, this paper presents a systematic and optimized approach for designing microgrids taking into account system reliability- and supply-security-related aspects. The optimum design considers sustained and temporary faults, for system reliability via a combined probabilistic reliability index, and real and reactive power balance, for supply security. The loads are assumed to be variable and different distributed generation (DG) technologies are considered. Conceptual design, problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper.

The objective is to improve the voltage profile along the feeders of a distribution system. Using only local measurements, the actual operating conditions of the feeder are firstly estimated; then, the set-point is evaluated by solving an optimal voltage profile problem. The off-line coordination avoids any modification to the architecture of existing control systems and requires communication only in the case of significant changes of the distribution system topology.

951,"With the development of smart grid, residents have the opportunity to schedule their power usage in the home by themselves for the purpose of reducing electricity expense and alleviating the power peak-to-average ratio (PAR). In this paper, we first introduce a general architecture of energy management system (EMS) in a home area network (HAN) based on the smart grid and then propose an efficient scheduling method for home power usage. The home gateway (HG) receives the demand response (DR) information indicating the real-time electricity price that is transferred to an energy management controller (EMC). With the DR, the EMC achieves an optimal power scheduling scheme that can be delivered to each electric appliance by the HG. Accordingly, all appliances in the home operate automatically in the most cost-effective way. When only the real-time pricing (RTP) model is adopted, there is the possibility that most appliances would operate during the time with the lowest electricity price, and this may damage the entire electricity system due to the high PAR. In our research, we combine RTP with the inclining block rate (IBR) model. By adopting this combined pricing model, our proposed power scheduling method would effectively reduce both the electricity cost and PAR, thereby, strengthening the stability of the entire electricity system.

The idea is to equip each user with an energy consumption scheduling (ECS) device to automatically control the user's flexible load to minimize his energy expenditure, based on the updated electricity pricing information. While most prior works on autonomous DR have focused on coordinating the operation of ECS devices in order to achieve various system-wide goals, such as minimizing the total cost of generation or minimizing the peak-to-average ratio in the load demand, they fall short addressing the important issue of fairness. That is, while they usually guarantee optimality, they do not assure that the participating users are rewarded according to their contributions in achieving the overall system's design objectives. Similarly, they do not address the important problem of co-existence when only a sub-set of users participate in a deployed autonomous DR program.

The efficiency of the proposed solution stems by modeling the smart microgrid as a linear network where loads are approximated as impedances. This simplification allows avoiding explicit use of power flow equations, and having a number of equation proportional to the number of DERs rather than to the total number of nodes (loads and DERs).

In particular, in the equivalent circuit of the faulted system, the method applies voltage injection and superposition principle, obtains net fault voltage and current, and calculates the line inductance to the fault as fault distance. The steps for implementing the formula from substation sampled data are detailed and illustrated, followed by validation test results with eleven actual transient faults.",WOS:000325487800048,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kim, C., Bialek, T. and Awiylika, J.","Howard Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Washington, DC 20059 USA",16,10.1109/Tsg.2012.2231442,Jun,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,fault location,self-clearing faults,sub-cycle faults,transitory faults,distribution system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,232IU,1105-1112,15120,Journal Article,An Initial Investigation for Locating Self-Clearing Faults in Distribution Systems,1,An Initial Investigation for Locating Self-Clearing Faults in Distribution Systems,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325487800048,4,2013

HPC has seen the maturation of cluster computing, the advent of multi-core computing, the creation of grid and cloud computing, and the sudden rise of the graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose computing. These changes have also been coupled with the slow ending of Moore's law. Electric power systems have also undergone many changes including the introduction of the advanced metering infrastructure and other advanced technologies for data collection, the inclusion of renewable/distributed power generation, and the addition of electric vehicles as stochastic loads. Clear goals have also been set for the development of the smart grid-a unique cyber-physical system (CPS) that requires the interaction of the electric power system and HPC.

We first set the information network topology such that the prosumers exchange price (power) information with their neighbors according to a chosen information network topology. Based on the exchanged information and the prosumers own measured power demand, each prosumer uses a local control strategy to turn on and off its power generator to cooperatively achieve the global balance. More specifically, the local control strategy results from a distributed model predictive control method based on dual decomposition and sub-gradient iterations.

Energy losses also change significantly when microFITs are implemented. This paper addresses these problems with respect to the connection of a large number of microFITs and single phase loads to three phase distribution systems. In this research, a probabilistic model has been utilized for estimating hourly solar irradiance, and a genetic algorithm has been employed as a means of generating a non-dominated Pareto front for minimizing the current unbalance and energy loss in the distribution system. A decision-making process has been developed in order to determine a single optimum solution from the Pareto front generated. Operational controls, such as voltage drop, transmission limits, and voltage unbalance limits, are taken into consideration in this analysis.

Our design is multi-stage. As the demand information of the appliances is gradually revealed over time, the operation schedule of controllable appliances is updated accordingly.

Second, we estimate PEV availability based on data sampled from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Third, we predict regulation demand on a per minute basis using published models from the California ISO for 20% and 33% renewable electricity supply. Our key results are as follows: First, the amount of regulation up and regulation down energy delivered by PEVs can be balanced by using a hybrid of two scheduling strategies. Second, the percentage of regulation energy that can be delivered with PEVs is always significantly higher than the percentage of conventional regulation power capacity that is deferred by PEVs. Third, regulation up is harder to satisfy with PEVs than regulation down. Fourth, the scheduling strategies we employ here have a limited impact on load following requirements.

968,"The problem of optimal control of power distribution systems is becoming increasingly compelling due to the progressive penetration of distributed energy resources in this specific layer of the electrical infrastructure. Distribution systems are, indeed, experiencing significant changes in terms of operation philosophies that are often based on optimal control strategies relying on the computation of linearized dependencies between controlled (e. g., voltages, frequency in case of islanding operation) and control variables (e. g., power injections, transformers tap positions). As the implementation of these strategies in real-time controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the derivation of analytical dependency between controlled and control variables becomes a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage and power flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical derivation of node voltages and line currents as a function of the nodal power injections and transformers tap-changers positions. Compared to other approaches presented in the literature, the one proposed here is based on the use of the compound matrix of a generic multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to estimate the computational benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant improvements are also quantified versus traditional methods.

To consider such dynamic environmental properties, we use a multiagent-system-based approach in which individual homes are autonomous agents making rational decisions to buy, sell, or store electricity based on their present and expected future amount of load, generation, and storage, accounting for the benefits each decision can offer. In the proposed scheme, home agents prioritize their decisions based on the expected utilities they provide.

984,"Efficiently integrating wind energy into the smart grid is gaining momentum under renewable portfolio standard (RPS) with deep wind penetration. Due to the randomness of wind energy production, ancillary service (AS) is needed in large amount to regulate wind power for system stability and reliability. As a result, the cost of wind power depends on the AS market and may be, quite higher than that of conventional power. Therefore, it is challenging to economically integrate wind energy with current power system to satisfy RPS. With the communication, sensing and advanced control features incorporated into the smart grid, the interactions among the grid components will facilitate solving this problem. In this paper, we consider the wind energy integration of small-scale utilities installed with wind turbines and acted as distributed energy resources (DERs). Since wind energy can be integrated to serve customer load or enter a separate green energy market, we propose a theoretical framework to dynamically determine the role of wind energy and provide long-term RPS guarantee.

The study compares four semiconductor-based devices for dc fault isolation: series hybrid dc breaker, half bridge and full bridge dc chopper, and LCL thyristor converter. The study considers performance of devices, costs and losses, and also application with larger dc grids. A hybrid dc CB has lowest losses, but the component sizing crucially depends on the speed of fault detection. It is demonstrated that fast communication between various devices in the dc grid is mandatory but might be very challenging. On the other hand, dc choppers and LCL converter component sizing is not dependent on the speed of protection, and there is no need for communication across dc grids. Additionally, they offer the capability of voltage stepping and dc cable power regulation. The LCL converter provides inherent fault current interruption and needs no overrating for dc faults.

However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (""prosumers"") distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability.

996,"The development of a smarter electric grid will depend on increased deployments of information and communication technology (ICT) to support novel communication and control functions. Unfortunately, this additional dependency also expands the risk from cyber attacks. Designing systems with adequate cyber security depends heavily on the availability of representative environments, such as testbeds, where current issues and future ideas can be evaluated. This paper provides an overview of a smart grid security testbed, including the set of control, communication, and physical system components required to provide an accurate cyber-physical environment. It then identifies various testbed research applications and also identifies how various components support these applications. The PowerCyber testbed at Iowa State University is then introduced, including the architecture, applications, and novel capabilities, such as virtualization, Real Time Digital Simulators (RTDS), and ISEAGE WAN emulation. Finally, several attack scenarios are evaluated using the testbed to explore cyber-physical impacts.

997,"This paper focuses on the problem of energy imbalance management in a microgrid. The problem is investigated from the power market perspective. Unlike the traditional power grid, a microgrid can obtain extra energy from a renewable energy source (RES) such as a solar panel or a wind turbine. However, the stochastic input from the RES brings difficulty in balancing the energy supply and demand. In this study, a novel pricing scheme is proposed that provides robustness against such intermittent power input. The proposed scheme considers possible uncertainty in the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of the power market. It uses all available information on the power supply, power demand, and imbalanced energy. The parameters of the scheme are evaluated using an H-infinity performance index. It is shown that the parameters can be obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality problem, which is efficiently solvable due to its convexity.

The controller logics for setting up the baseline load, generating priority lists, issuing dispatch commands, and tuning the simplified forecaster model using measurement data are described. To study the impacts of different control parameter settings on control performance and device lifetimes, a system consisting of 1000 heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units in their heating modes is modeled to provide a +/- 1-MW CRR 24 hours a day. Four cases are modeled to evaluate the impact of forecasting errors, minimum HVAC turn-off times, response delays, and consumer overrides. The results demonstrate that a centralized TCA load controller can provide robust, good quality CRRs with reduced communication needs for the two-way communication network and inexpensive load control devices.

1001,"High quality demand side management has become indispensable in the smart grid infrastructure for enhanced energy reduction and system control. In this paper, a new demand side management technique, namely, a new energy efficient scheduling algorithm, is proposed to arrange the household appliances for operation such that the monetary expense of a customer is minimized based on the time-varying pricing model. The proposed algorithm takes into account the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and intermittent renewable generation. Moreover, it considers the variable frequency drive and capacity-limited energy storage. Our technique first uses the linear programming to efficiently compute a deterministic scheduling solution without considering uncertainties. To handle the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and energy consumption, a stochastic scheduling technique, which involves an energy consumption adaptation variable beta, is used to model the stochastic energy consumption patterns for various household appliances. To handle the intermittent behavior of the energy generated from the renewable resources, the offline static operation schedule is adapted to the runtime dynamic scheduling considering variations in renewable energy. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to a traditional scheduling scheme which models typical household appliance operations in the traditional home scenario, the proposed deterministic linear programming based scheduling scheme achieves up to 45% monetary expense reduction, and the proposed stochastic design scheme achieves up to 41% monetary expense reduction. Compared to a worst case design where an appliance is assumed to consume the maximum amount of energy, the proposed stochastic design which considers the stochastic energy consumption patterns achieves up to 24% monetary expense reduction without violating the target trip rate of 0.5%. Furthermore, the proposed energy consumption scheduling algorithm can always generate the scheduling solution within 10 seconds, which is fast enough for household appliance applications.",WOS:000325487800031,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Chen, X.

Essentially, our approach consists of three steps: aggregation, optimization, and control. In the aggregation step, individual PHEV charging constraints are aggregated upwards in a tree structure. In the optimization step, the aggregated constraints are used for scalable computation of a collective charging plan, which minimizes costs for electricity supply. In the real-time control step, this charging plan is used to create an incentive signal for all PHEVs, determined by a market-based priority scheme. These three steps are executed iteratively to cope with uncertainty and dynamism.

Because the maximum peak power tracking algorithm may result in a supply-demand imbalance, an alternative algorithm is needed for load sharing. In this paper, a fully distributed control scheme is presented to coordinate the operations of multiple doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) in a microgrid. According to the proposed control strategy, each bus in a microgrid has an associated bus agent that may have two function modules. The global information discovery module discovers the total available wind generation and total demand. The load sharing control module calculates the generation reference of a DFIG. The consensus-based algorithm can guarantee convergence for microgrids of arbitrary topologies under various operating conditions. By controlling the utilization levels of DFIGs to a common value, the supply-demand balance can be maintained. In addition, the detrimental impact of inaccurate and outdated predictions of maximum wind power can be alleviated.

1011,"The widespread use of distributed generation (DG), which is installed in medium-voltage distribution networks, impacts the future development of modern electrical systems that must evolve towards smart grids. A fundamental topic for smart grids is automatic distributed voltage control (ADVC). The voltage is now regulated at the MV busbar acting on the on-load tap changer of the HV/MV transformer. This method does not guarantee the correct voltage value in the network nodes when the distributed generators deliver their power. In contrast, the ADVC allows control of the voltage acting on a single generator; therefore, a better voltage profile can be obtained. In this paper, an approach based on sensitivity theory is shown to control the node voltages regulating the reactive power injected by the generators. After the theoretical analysis, a numerical example is presented to validate the theory. The proposed voltage regulation method has been developed in collaboration with Enel Distribuzione S. p. A.

1012,"While a large body of work has recently focused on reducing data center's energy expenses, there exists no prior work on investigating the trade-off between minimizing data center's energy expenditure and maximizing their revenue for various Internet and cloud computing services that they may offer. In this paper, we seek to tackle this shortcoming by proposing a systematic approach to maximize green data center's profit, i.e., revenue minus cost. In this regard, we explicitly take into account practical service-level agreements (SLAs) that currently exist between data centers and their customers. Our model also incorporates various other factors such as availability of local renewable power generation at data centers and the stochastic nature of data centers' workload. Furthermore, we propose a novel optimization-based profit maximization strategy for data centers for two different cases, without and with behind-the-meter renewable generators. We show that the formulated optimization problems in both cases are convex programs; therefore, they are tractable and appropriate for practical implementation.

1013,"This paper describes a method for estimating the impact of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging on overhead distribution transformers, based on detailed travel demand data and under several different schemes for mitigating overloads by shifting PEV charging times (smart charging). The paper also presents a new smart charging algorithm that manages PEV charging based on estimated transformer temperatures. We simulated the varied behavior of drivers from the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey, and transformer temperatures based an IEEE standard dynamic thermal model. Results are shown for Monte Carlo simulation of a 25 kVA overhead distribution transformer, with ambient temperature data from hot and cold climate locations, for uncontrolled and several smart-charging scenarios. These results illustrate the substantial impact of ambient temperatures on distribution transformer aging, and indicate that temperature-based smart charging can dramatically reduce both the mean and variance in transformer aging without substantially reducing the frequency with which PEVs obtain a full charge. Finally, the results indicate that simple smart charging schemes, such as delaying charging until after midnight can actually increase, rather than decrease, transformer aging.",WOS:000325487800028,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Hilshey, A.

1014,"Real-time routing is a basic element of closed-loop, real-time sensing and control, but it is challenging due to dynamic, uncertain link/path delays. The probabilistic nature of link/path delays makes the basic problem of computing the probabilistic distribution of path delays NP-hard, yet quantifying probabilistic path delays is a basic element of real-time routing and may well have to be executed by resource-constrained devices in a distributed manner; the highly varying nature of link/path delays makes it necessary to adapt to in-situ delay conditions in real-time routing, but it has been observed that delay-based routing can lead to instability, estimation error, and low data delivery performance in general. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Timescale Estimation (MTE) method; by accurately estimating the mean and variance of per-packet transmission time and by adapting to fast-varying queueing in an accurate, agile manner, MTE enables accurate, agile, and efficient estimation of probabilistic path delay bounds in a distributed manner. Based on MTE, we propose the Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA) routing protocol; MTA integrates the stability of an ETX-based directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) with the agility of spatiotemporal data flow control within the DAG to ensure real-time data delivery in the presence of dynamics and uncertainties. We also address the challenges of implementing MTE and MTA in resource-constrained devices such as TelosB motes. We evaluate the performance of MTA using the NetEye and Indriya sensor network testbeds. We find that MTA significantly outperforms existing protocols, e. g., improving deadline success ratio by 89% and reducing transmission cost by a factor of 9.7 in the NetEye testbed.",WOS:000325485600028,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Liu, X.

1015,"Under fixed retail rates, electricity demands have no incentive to change their usage pattern. In contrast, under time-varying rates, suppliers can reflect the actual supply cost during the peak hours in retail prices enabling end-users to respond to the prices and reduce their loads or shift their loads from the high-price hours to the low-price hours. Load shifting may increase the reliability of the system, but may increase CO2 emission if coal-fired generators are the marginal generator used during the low-price hours. CO2 emission taxation is one of ISO's options to deal with the CO2 emission problem. In this paper, a new time-varying rate design method considering the CO2 emission taxation is suggested. In addition, market power problem and non-shifting elastic loads are considered.

The SDN offers new opportunities in the improvement of the efficiency of power distribution networks. The DERs will be distributed in the existing distribution networks, interconnected in customer areas and operated on its own schedule without communication to the control center of the existing distribution system. The DER units have both positive and negative effects regarding SDN operations. With the appropriate operation of the DER units in the SDN, losses can be reduced during normal operations and they can support local loads during abnormal conditions. Thus, the positive effects of the DER units need to be enabled in the SDN by adopting advanced operation schemes. In this paper, the smart control functions for the DER units in the SDN are defined and classified. In addition, the integration schemes for the SDN with DER units are introduced.

1017,"Smart grid is widely considered to be the next generation of power grid, where power generation, management, transmission, distribution, and utilization are fully upgraded to improve agility, reliability, efficiency, security, economy, and environmental friendliness. Demand response management (DRM) is recognized as a control unit of the smart grid, with the attempt to balance the real-time load as well as to shift the peak-hour load. Communications are critical to the accuracy and optimality of DRM, and hence at the core of the control performance of the smart grid. In this paper, we introduce cognitive radio into the smart grid to improve the communication quality. By means of spectrum sensing and channel switching, smart meters can decide to transmit data on either an original unlicensed channel or an additional licensed channel, so as to reduce the communication outage. Considering the energy cost taxed by spectrum sensing together with the control performance degradation incurred by imperfect communications, we formulate the sensing-performance tradeoff problem between better control performance and lower communication cost, paving the way towards a green smart grid. The impact of the communication outage on the control performance of DRM is also analyzed, which reduces the profit of power provider and the social welfare of the smart grid, although it may not always decrease the profit of power consumer. By employing the energy detector, we prove that there exists a unique optimal sensing time which yields the maximum tradeoff revenue, under the constraint that the licensed channel is sufficiently protected.

1018,"Power distribution systems should meet demands such as high reliability, efficiency, and penetration of renewable energy generators (REGs) in a smart grid. In general, power distribution systems are radial in nature. One-way power flow is the advantage of a radial system. However, the introduction of REGs causes bidirectional power flow. Furthermore, there are limits to improvements in reliability and efficiency in a radial system. Therefore, the upgrading of primary feeders from a radial to a loop configuration has been considered in the Korea Smart Distribution Project. An advanced power distribution system (APDS), in which primary feeders operate in a loop configuration, has been explored in this paper. First, the design scheme of a conventional power distribution system configuration that adopts distribution automation is introduced. Subsequently, an upgrading scheme of loop configuration using normally opened tie switches and a tie switch selection algorithm for loss minimization are described. Finally, the advantages of the upgraded configuration are reported through case studies. It is observed that the APDS configuration can integrate more REGs from the viewpoint of voltage regulation.

The distinct feature of this newly emerging technology is the incorporation of advanced information and communication technologies (ICT), which collects more detailed information on how energy is generated, distributed, and consumed. Various smart metering technologies have also been proposed to support the optimization on sustainable energy usage. Despite the obvious benefits of these technologies, people may still hesitate to adopt them because of possible privacy breach. On the other hand, we observe that the major target information for making the sustainable energy system smart is the aggregated statistics of energy usage, not the full detailed usage profiles which would compromise customers' privacy. Thus, how to design schemes to collect aggregated statistics while preserving customers' privacy becomes an important research problem. In this paper, we propose two schemes to deal with this problem.

The possibility association of frequencies measured at different locations are modeled by a Bayesian network with the logical structure learned using Bayesian structure learning and real measurements in the U. S. power grid. Frequency data analysis and the detection of incorrect frequency measurements (caused by equipment error or malicious attack) are performed over the logical Bayesian network structure. Such application of Bayesian network is a powerful mathematical tool in computational intelligence. Without the physical power network topology information, a two-branch search-and-score structure learning algorithm with L-1 regulation is proposed to learn the logical structure, achieving around 97% correct prediction rate for future frequency and 92% detection rate for false frequency data with 2% false alarm rate. The tool of epidemic propagation over this logical network is also exploited to analyze the propagation of frequency changes. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, such logical structure is demonstrated to be well approximated by the Small World network model.

In spite of the recent remarkable progress in the field of sensors and equipments, it is hard to detect device malfunctions or degraded devices automatically in the supervisory monitoring system. The object of the proposed system is not the state estimation itself, but its application to the supervisory detection of the malfunction or degradation of the devices. The supervisory monitoring process consists of a two step procedure-topology processing and normal state estimation. In a substation, the on-off states of the circuit breakers determine the topology.

1030,"The traditional power grid system was constructed in a centralized and radial topology where power is generated and delivered from one end to the other. Conventional methods for unidirectional power flow analysis will no longer be effective to control renewable energy sources implemented at the consumption sector efficiently; new strategies are called for to facilitate the bidirectional flow incurred by power production of the distributed energy resource units. The transformation will require intelligent distribution automation by means of decentralized power management as well as information and communications technologies to actualize smart grid modernization. In this paper, we design autonomous distribution networks that take scalability into account by dividing the legacy distribution network into a set of subnetworks. We tackle the power flow and power balance issues individually in parallel to optimize the global distribution operation by our proposed power-control method. Meanwhile, we propose an overlay multi-tier communications infrastructure for the underlying power network to analyze the traffic of data information and control message required for associated power flow operation. Based on the proposed schemes, we show that we can potentially improve the utilization of renewable energy production and achieve data traffic reduction under decentralized operations as compared to legacy centralized management.",WOS:000325485600007,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Lo, C.

1031,"This paper is concerned with the power dispatch problem of distributed generators (DGs) for optimal operation of a microgrid. The objective is to minimize the fuel cost during the grid-connected operation, while ensuring stable operation after islanding. To achieve this goal, the economic dispatch (ED) problem and related constraints are formulated. The constraints considered in this study are: i) reserve for variation in load demand, ii) reserve for variation in the power outputs of non-dispatchable DGs, iii) flow limits between two adjacent areas, and iv) reserve for the stable islanded operation. The first three constraints, which have been employed in ED problem for conventional power systems, are modified to apply to Microgrids. We also provide a detailed formulation of the constraint for stable islanded operation in accordance with two power-sharing principles: i) fixed droop and ii) adjustable droop. The problem is solved using a modified direct search method, and the effect of the constraints on the operational cost is investigated via numerical simulations.",WOS:000325485600041,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ahn, S.

The commands/packets initiated by the controllers in crisis cases should be delivered fast and immune from any interruption. The HAN controller, which acts as a gateway, should not cause any delay by decrypting and re-encrypting the packets, nor should it has any chance to modify them. Considering the required level of security and quality of service, we design our protocol with an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach. We improve and implement the Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol in two steps. First, we propose an auxiliary mechanism that is an ECC version of PAKE, and then extend it to a multilayer consensus model. We reduce the number of hash functions to one, and utilize a primitive password shared between an appliance and HAN controller to construct four valid individual consensus and authenticated symmetric keys between the appliance and upstream controllers by exchanging only 12 packets.

Among many enabling technologies, the latest research results from both the power and energy community and computational intelligence (CI) community have demonstrated that CI research could provide key technical innovations into this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach based on both trajectory and frequency domain information integrated with evolutionary algorithm to achieve the optimal control of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) based wind generation. Instead of optimizing all the control parameters, our key idea is to use the sensitivity analysis to first identify the critical parameters, the unified dominate control parameters (UDCP), to reduce the optimization complexity. Based on such selected parameters, we then use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal values to achieve the control objective.

The framework is based on probabilistic relational models which combines probabilistic reasoning offered by Bayesian networks together with architecture models in form of entity relationship diagrams. In the analysis, both the physical infrastructure, and the logical structure of the system, is regarded in terms of qualitative modeling and quantitative analysis. Moreover, the framework treats the aspect of failures caused by software. An example is detailed with the framework applied to an IEC 61850-based SA system. The logical structure, including functions and their relations, is modeled in accordance with Pieces of Information for COMmunication (PICOM) defined in the IEC 61850 standard. By applying PICOMs as frame of reference when modeling functions the model instantiation becomes more standardized compared to subjectively defining functions.

1036,"The anticipated proliferation of cyber components for collecting information and controlling operations of smart grids increases their vulnerability to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.",WOS:000325485600005,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ma, C.

Specifically, in day-ahead scheduling, with the distributional information of wind generation and demand, we characterize the optimal procurement of the energy supply from base-load generation and the day-ahead price; in real-time scheduling, with the realizations of wind generation and the demand of traditional energy users, we optimize real-time price to manage opportunistic demand so as to achieve system-wise reliability and efficiency. More specifically, we consider two different models for opportunistic energy users: non-persistent and persistent, and characterize the optimal scheduling and pricing decisions for both models by exploiting various computational and optimization tools.

However, power networks also tend to be more vulnerable due to the cascading failures from their interdependent information systems, i.e., the failures in the information systems can cause the failures of the coupled portion in power networks. Therefore, the accurate vulnerability assessment of interdependent power networks is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network nodes. In this paper, we study the Interdependent Power Network Disruptor (IPND) optimization problem to identify critical nodes in an interdependent power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its interdependent communication network. First, we show the IPND problem is NP-hard to be approximated within the factor of (2 - epsilon).

Different from the conventional 'topological observability' based approaches, this paper advocates a much more refined, information-theoretic criterion, namely the mutual information (MI) between PMU measurements and power system states. The proposed MI criterion not only includes observability as a special case, but also rigorously models the uncertainty reduction on power system states from PMU measurements. Thus, it can generate highly informative PMU configurations. The MI criterion can also facilitate robust PMU placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU outages. We propose a greedy PMU placement algorithm, and show that it achieves an approximation ratio of (1 - 1/e) for any PMU placement budget. We further show that the performance is the best that one can achieve, in the sense that it is NP-hard to achieve any approximation ratio beyond (1 - 1/e) Such performance guarantee makes the greedy algorithm very attractive in the practical scenario of multi-stage installations for utilities with limited budgets.

In this paper biogeography based optimization (BBO) technique has been applied to come up with the best ""Q"" and ""R"" matrices such that the frequency excursion following a disturbance in a microgrid is minimized. As all the states in a practical system may not be measurable hence, we have used Kalman estimator to estimate them. These estimated states along with other measured states are used by the LQR to produce the desired control signal. The microgrid is made smarter by using the agent based scheme integrated with a master controller and a proper communication protocol.

It allows network operators to optimize the use of dispersed generation resources and enables real-time communication between customers and utility service providers to allow optimization and balancing of energy usage. Such an improvement in the flexibility and control of the distribution network is only possible if the control center operator has more accurate knowledge of the real-time situation of the network.

1051,"We propose a decentralized security framework for smart grids that supports data aggregation and access control. Data can be aggregated by home area network (HAN), building area network (BAN), and neighboring area network (NAN) in such a way that the privacy of customers is protected. We use homomorphic encryption technique to achieve this. The consumer data that is collected is sent to the substations where it is monitored by remote terminal units (RTU). The proposed access control mechanism uses attribute-based encryption (ABE) which gives selective access to consumer data stored in data repositories and used by different smart grid users. RTUs and users have attributes and cryptographic keys distributed by several key distribution centers (KDC). RTUs send data encrypted under a set of attributes. Since RTUs are maintained in the substations they are well protected in control rooms and are assumed to be trusted. Users can decrypt information provided they have valid attributes. The access control scheme is distributed in nature and does not rely on a single KDC to distribute the keys which makes the approach robust.

1055,"Future power grid systems are envisioned to be integrated with many distributed renewable energy sources (DRES). Energy storage is a key technology to enable reliable and cost-effective renewable energy. Given the fact that a large-scale energy storage device is usually costly to install and operate, we are naturally led to the following question: How much storage is necessary to guarantee the stability of a power grid network with DRESs? This paper represents a first step in systematically exploring the tradeoff between the capacity of energy storage devices and the outage probability, i.e., the probability of the occurrence of imbalance between the supply and demand. We first propose a secure scheduling and dispatch (SSD) algorithm that is capable of maintaining the grid stability in the presence of volatility in the power generation. We then derive a closed-form bound to quantify the tradeoff between the storage capacity and the outage probability. Under mild assumptions, we show that the outage probability decreases exponentially with respect to the square of the storage capacity. This finding implies that energy storage is an effective and economically viable solution to maintain the stability of a smart grid network, even in the presence of many volatile and intermittent renewable energy sources.

The performance of multiuser selection scheme is evaluated in two cases: in the absence of interference and in the presence of multiuser interference (MUI). In the former case, the closed-form capacity outage probability as well as the numerical values of the bit error rate (BER) are obtained via the probability density function (PDF) of signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classic indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channel. In the latter case, the multiuser interference cancellation coefficient as a random variable is added for the calculation of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). In addition, due to free space path loss and log-normal shadowing, the sum of MUI is treated as another log-normal-distributed random variable by exploiting central limit theorem.

1058,"The smart grid features ubiquitous interconnections of power equipments to enable two-way flows of electricity and information for various intelligent power management applications, such as accurate relay protection and timely demand response. To fulfill such pervasive equipment interconnects, a full-fledged communication infrastructure is of great importance in the smart grid. There have been extensive works on disparate layouts of communication infrastructures in the smart grid by surveying feasible wired or wireless communication technologies, such as power line communications and cellular networks. Nevertheless, towards an operable, cost-efficient and backward-compatible communication solution, more comprehensive and practical understandings are still urgently needed regarding communication requirements, applicable protocols, and system performance. Through such comprehensive understandings, we are prone to answer a fundamental question, how to design, implement and integrate communication infrastructures with power systems. In this paper, we address this issue in a case study of a smart grid demonstration project, the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) systems. By investigating communication scenarios, we first clarify communication requirements implied in FREEDM use cases. Then, we adopt a predominant protocol framework, Distributed Network Protocol 3.0 over TCP/IP (DNP3 over TCP/IP), to practically establish connections between electric devices for data exchanges in a small-scale FREEDM system setting, Green Hub. Within the real-setting testbed, we measure the message delivery performance of the DNP3-based communication infrastructure. Our results reveal that diverse timing requirements of message deliveries are arguably primary concerns in a way that dominates viabilities of protocols or schemes in the communication infrastructure of the smart grid. Accordingly, although DNP3 over TCP/IP is widely considered as a smart grid communication solution, it cannot satisfy communication requirements in some time-critical scenarios, such as relay protections, which claim a further optimization on the protocol efficiency of DNP3.",WOS:000325485600017,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Lu, X., Wang, W.

During a BV's interaction with power grid, it may be in one of the following states: charging, fully-charged (FC), and discharging. In this paper, we identify that there are unique security challenges in a BV's different battery states. Accordingly, we propose a battery status-aware authentication scheme (BASA) to address the issue for V2G networks. In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator. In addition, we perform comprehensive security analysis, which shows that BASA achieves both privacy preservation and security protection during battery state transitions.

1065,"Demand response is a key feature of the smart grid. The addition of bidirectional communication to today's power grid can provide real-time pricing (RTP) to customers via smart meters. A growing number of appliance companies have started to design and produce smart appliances which embed intelligent control modules to implement residential demand response based on RTP. However, most of the current residential load scheduling schemes are centralized and based on either day-ahead pricing (DAP) or predicted price, which can deviate significantly from the RTP. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme based on the optimal stopping rule as a real-time distributed scheduling algorithm for smart appliances' automation control. It determines the best time for appliances' operation to balance electricity bill reduction and inconvenience resulting from the operation delay. It is shown that our scheme is a distributed threshold policy when no constraint is considered. When a total power constraint exists, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be implemented in either a centralized or distributed fashion. Our scheme has low complexity and can be easily implemented.

1067,"Due to the recent global trend toward stricter restrictions on both greenhouse gases emission and energy consumption, there is an emerging attention on electric vehicles (EVs). It is anticipated that proliferation of EV will be expanded rapidly in the near future. Accordingly, there is a need to analyze the consumer preferences for the EVs as the basic data for developing the relevant industries' strategies in the newly emerging market of EVs or establishing the government policies to popularize EVs. This paper analyzes the consumer preferences for the EV on the basis of the stated preference data from consumers in Korea. A conjoint method and a mixed logit model using the Bayesian approach were used to estimate the preferences of consumers. The stated preference data of the conjoint method is collected through a face-to-face survey conducted in June 2009. The consumer preferences on the key attributes that affect the choices of EV are estimated by a mixed logit model. Marginal willingness to pay is calculated to quantitatively analyze the consumer preferences on the key attributes. The results of this paper show that the consumers have greater preference for EV with swappable battery rather than unswappable battery, and for lump-sum payment rather than installment of the subsidies.",WOS:000325485600047,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ko, W. and Hahn, T.

1068,"This paper illustrates the development of an intelligent local area signals based controller for damping low-frequency oscillations in power systems. The controller is trained offline to perform well under a wide variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural network based system identification eliminates the need to develop accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement units at generating stations within an area of the system. These representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the system ""seen"" by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with simulations of the system. Results obtained on the 68-bus New England/New York benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations without additional control effort.",WOS:000325485600054,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Molina, D., Venayagamoorthy, G.

1069,"Decentralized inverter control is essential in distributed generation (DG) microgrids for low deployment/operation cost and high reliability. However, decentralized inverter control suffers from a limited system stability mainly because of the lack of communications among different inverters. In this paper, we investigate stability enhancement of the droop based decentralized inverter control in microgrids. Specifically, we propose a power sharing based control strategy which incorporates the information of the total real and reactive power generation of all DG units. The information is acquired by a wireless network (such as a WiFi, ZigBee, and/or cellular communication network) in a decentralized manner. Based on the desired power sharing of each DG unit and the acquired information of total generation, additional control terms are added to the traditional droop controller. We evaluate the performance of the proposed control strategy based on small-signal stability analysis. As timely communication may not be established for a microgrid with low-cost wireless communication devices, two kinds of analytical models are developed with respect to negligible and nonnegligible communication delays, respectively.

1072,"Smart sensing and wireless communication technologies enable the electric power grid system to deliver electricity more efficiently through the dynamic analysis of the electricity demand and supply. The current solution is to extend the traditional static electricity pricing strategy to a time-based one where peak-time prices are defined to influence electricity usage behavior of customers. However, the time-based pricing strategy is not truly dynamic and the electricity resource cannot be optimally utilized in real time. In this paper, we propose a usage-based dynamic pricing (UDP) scheme for smart grid in a community environment, which enables the electricity price to correspond to the electricity usage in real time. In the UDP scheme, to simplify price management and reduce communication overhead, we introduce distributed community gateways as proxies of the utility company to timely respond to the price enquiries from the community customers. We consider both community-wide electricity usage and individual electricity usage as factors into price management: a customer gets higher electricity unit price if its own electricity usage becomes larger under certain conditions of the community- wide collective electricity usage. Additionally, we protect the privacy of the customers by restricting the disclosure of the individual electricity usage to the community gateways. Lastly, we provide privacy and performance analysis to demonstrate that the UDP scheme supports real-time dynamic pricing in an efficient and privacy-preserving manner.",WOS:000325485600014,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Liang, X.

Specifically, a joint access and scheduling approach for appliances is developed to enable in-home appliances to coordinate power usage so that the total energy demand for the home is kept below a target value. The proposed protocol considers both ""schedulable"" appliances which have delay flexibility, and ""critical"" appliances which consume power as they desire. An optimization problem is formulated for the energy management controller to decide the target values for each time slot, by incorporating the variation of electricity prices and distributed wind power uncertainty. We model the evolution of the protocol as a two-dimensional Markov chain, and derive the steady-state distribution, by which the average delay of an appliance is then obtained.

1074,"A major source of inefficiency in power grids is the underutilization of generation capacity. This is mainly because load demand during peak hours is much larger than that during off-peak hours. Moreover, extra generation capacity is needed to maintain a security margin above peak load demand. As load demand keeps increasing and two-way communications are enabled by smart meters (SMs), demand response (DR) has been proposed as an alternative to installing new power plants in smart grids. DR makes use of real-time schemes to allow users to modify their load demand patterns according to their energy consumption costs. In particular, when load demand is high, energy consumption cost will be high and users may decide to postpone certain amount of their consumption needs. This strategy may effectively reduce the peak load demand and increases the off-peak demand, and hence could increase existing generation capacity utilization and reduce the need to install extra generation plants. In this paper, we consider a third-party managing the energy consumption of a group of users, and formulate the load scheduling problem as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem (CMOP). The optimization objectives are to minimize energy consumption cost and to maximize a certain utility, which can be conflicting and non-commensurable.

This paper aims at developing a tool to demonstrate the use of FES units for securing critical loads during a utility outage in a microgrid environment. The FES is modeled, simulated and evaluated in the MATLAB/SIMULINK (R) environment. A data center is used to represent a facility microgrid case study. It illustrates how an FES can help improve the load serving capability and provide a highly reliable ride-through capability for critical loads during a utility disturbance. In comparison with batteries, the application of FES for power security is new on the horizon. This limits the availability of experimental data. The simulation model presented in this paper will enable the analysis of short-term ride-through applications of FES during an islanded operation of a facility microgrid. As a result, it can provide a guideline for facility engineers in a data center or other types of facility microgrids to better design their backup power systems based on FES technology, which can be used in combination with traditional fuel-based generators.",WOS:000325485000041,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Arghandeh, R., Pipattanasomporn, M. and Rahman, S.","Virginia Tech, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",31,10.1109/Tsg.2012.2212468,Dec,1949-3053,4,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,data centers,energy storage,flywheel,islanded operation,microgrid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,232HY,1955-1962,15245,Journal Article,Flywheel Energy Storage Systems for Ride-through Applications in a Facility Microgrid,12,Flywheel Energy Storage Systems for Ride-through Applications in a Facility Microgrid,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325485000041,3,2012
1085,"The dynamical behavior of power systems under stress frequently deviates from the predictions of deterministic models. Model-free methods for detecting signs of excessive stress before instability occurs would therefore be valuable. The mathematical frameworks of ""fast-slow systems"" and ""critical slowing down"" can describe the statistical behavior of dynamical systems that are subjected to random perturbations as they approach points of instability. This paper builds from existing literature on fast-slow systems to provide evidence that time series data alone can be useful to estimate the temporal distance of a power system to a critical transition, such as voltage collapse. Our method is based on identifying evidence of critical slowing down in a single stream of synchronized phasor measurements. Results from a single machine, stochastic infinite bus model, a three machine/nine bus system and the Western North American disturbance of 10 August 1996 illustrate the utility of the proposed method.",WOS:000325485000027,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Cotilla-Sanchez, E., Hines, P.

1086,"Many commercial office buildings have become micro smart grids with on-site power generations, storage devices, and uncertain demands. Due to the pervasive nonlinearity and randomness of such a multi-energy system, simulation is usually the only faithful way to accurately describe the system dynamics and for performance evaluation. However, simulation is usually time-consuming and each sample path provides only noisy observations. Thus finding the optimal energy management policy is nontrivial. In this paper, a joint schedule problem is considered to schedule solar power, wind power, combined cooling, heating, and power generation, high temperature chiller, liquid desiccant fresh air unit, battery, and power grid in order to satisfy the electricity load, sensible heat load, and latent heat load in buildings with the minimal expected cost. We make two major contributions in this paper. First, three simulation-based policy improvement (SBPI) methods are developed to improve from given base policies. Second, the performance of these methods are systematically analyzed through numerical experiments. We show that when there are sufficient computing budget, the SBPI methods improve the given base policies. Different methods are recommended for problems with different computing budget.

1087,"This paper discusses how micro-grids availability during natural disasters and in their aftermath can be assessed. The analysis focuses on two critical groups of components that allow micro-grids to improve power supply availability: distributed generators and local energy storage. For distributed generators and, due to their importance during natural disasters, this paper presents a novel focus by exploring the importance of lifelines for system availability. Renewable energy sources are identified as valuable distributed generation assets during disasters because they do not require lifelines; yet, their variable generation nature leads to the need for significant local energy storage. Additional local energy storage may be desirable as a backup solution to address potential failures that would blackout the load because they reduce the impact of lifeline performance during disasters on micro-grid availability. Analysis of micro-grids availability is performed based on Markov state space models and calculated using minimal cut sets approximations.

Transmission side uses more directional type relays, while distribution systems, e. g., radial and ring-main sub-transmission systems use nondirectional types. The fault direction may be forward (between relay and grid), or reverse (between relay and source), the normal power flow being from source to the grid. Traditional directional overcurrent relays utilize the reference voltage phasor for estimating the direction of the fault. This requires measurement of both current and voltage using respective sensors. This makes the directional overcurrent relays more costly than the nondirectional type.

To guarantee excellent power management, a modular power conversion system is realized by parallel connection of small MHPCS units. The hybrid system includes fuel cells (FC) as main and supercapacitors (SC) as complementary power sources. The SC energy storage compensates the slow transient response of the FC stack and supports the FC to meet the grid power demand. The proposed control strategy of the MHPCS comprises three control loops; dc-link voltage controller, power management controller, and load current sharing controller. Each distributed generation (DG) unit uses an adaptive proportional resonance (PR) controller for regulating the load voltage, and a droop control strategy for average power sharing among the DG units.

1101,"This paper uses a charging selection concept for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to maximize user convenience levels while meeting predefined circuit-level demand limits. The optimal PEV-charging selection problem requires an exhaustive search for all possible combinations of PEVs in a power system, which cannot be solved for the practical number of PEVs. Inspired by the efficiency of the convex relaxation optimization tool in finding close-to-optimal results in huge search spaces, this paper proposes the application of the convex relaxation optimization method to solve the PEV-charging selection problem. Compared with the results of the uncontrolled case, the simulated results indicate that the proposed PEV-charging selection algorithm only slightly reduces user convenience levels, but significantly mitigates the impact of the PEV-charging on the power system. We also develop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the PEV-charging selection problem in a decentralized manner, i.e., the binary charging decisions (charged or not charged) are made locally by each vehicle. Using the proposed distributed optimization algorithm, each vehicle is only required to report its power demand rather than report several of its private user state information, mitigating the security problems inherent in such problem.

Thus, the secondary control level is applied to manage the compensation of SLB voltage unbalance and harmonics by sending proper control signals to the primary level.

Since renewables need to be in the mix for energy surety, a high renewable-energy penetrated microgrid is analyzed in this paper. The standard IEEE 34 bus distribution feeder is adapted and managed as a microgrid by adding distributed generation and load profiles. The 25 kV system parameters are scaled down to 12 kV and renewable sources including solar PV and wind turbines, an energy storage system, and a diesel generator for islanded mode have been added to the 34-bus system. The distribution generations (DG) and renewables are modeled in detail using PSCAD software and practical constraints of the components are considered. The monitoring of the microgrid for measuring power quality and control requirements for these DGs and storage are modeled to maintain the power quality of the system when loads are varied.

1109,"Demand response (DR) is very important in the future smart grid, aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours. However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation.",WOS:000325485000025,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Tsui, K.

1112,"Most of the research on Hybrid Power Systems (HPS) is to provide an economical and sustainable power to the rural electrification. This paper focuses on the design of an HPS for the building which is a part of the urban electrification. In the developing countries, the rate of increase in the demand is more than the rate of increase in the supply, which is a major challenge resulting in very frequent outages. There are number of motives to build integrated and synergistic renewable energy based HPS including environmental, economic, and social benefits. Most of these HPS topologies use inverters to interface the renewable sources to the buildings with an offering of low quality power. Hence, modern sustainability initiatives call for a design for both new HPS and retrofitting of an existing HPS topology. With this aspect, this paper describes the topology of retrofitting HPS with dc Motor-Synchronous Generator set instead of the use of inverter to an existing building power system. This can improve the power quality, reliability of the supply, and ensures stable plant operation. The proposed HPS topology can be used in small-to-medium sized isolated constructions like green buildings, industries, and universities. Different renewable energy sources like Photo Voltaics (PV), Wind Power (WP), and Fuel Cells (FC) are integrated to form HPS.

Internet data centers (IDCs) are energy consuming CPSs that support the reliable operations of many important online services. Along with the increasing Internet services and cloud computing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations had been surging significantly. Such mass power consumption has brought extremely heavy burden on IDC operators. While most previous work only consider about dynamical optimization of IDC under electricity markets, the reaction of IDC toward electricity market has been overlooked. Due to the fact that IDCs are usually large-volume users in the electricity market, they might have market power to affect the electricity price. In this paper, we study how to address the challenge of interactions between IDC operation and electricity market price. To this end, we propose a supply function to model the market power of IDC and formulate a total electricity cost minimization problem as a non-linear programming. Then we present CMC algorithm inspired by the economics concept. CMC algorithm not only solves the optimization problem efficiently, but also uncovers the impetus of the work load distribution.

1120,"Evolving faults are faults beginning in one phase of a distribution circuit and spreading to another phase after a few cycles. This paper develops a time-domain algorithm for estimating the location of such faults. The algorithm is divided into two parts, namely, the single line-to-ground portion of the fault and the line-to-line-to-ground portion of the fault. The arc voltage that exists during faults is taken into consideration while deriving this methodology. For the single line-to-ground portion of the fault, the distance to the fault is estimated in terms of the loop or self-reactance between the monitor and the fault. On the other hand, for the line-to-line-to-ground and line-to-line portion of the fault the distance is estimated in terms of the positive-sequence reactance. The reactance-to-fault estimate is more robust than that of the resistance-to-fault, because it is unaffected by fault resistance. Two evolving fault cases and two line-to-line fault cases are analyzed in detail and the error in the location estimates is found to be below 10% in each case. Ten additional cases are analyzed and linear regression analysis is conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the fault location estimates.",WOS:000325485000002,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kulkarni, S. and Santoso, S.","Kulkarni, S",26,10.1109/Tsg.2012.2207469,Dec,1949-3053,4,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,fault location,fault diagnosis,power distribution faults,time-domain analysis,power distribution-systems,circuit analysis,voltage,arc,,,,,,,,,,,,English,232HY,1584-1593,15281,Journal Article,Time-Domain Algorithm for Locating Evolving Faults,2,Time-Domain Algorithm for Locating Evolving Faults,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325485000002,3,2012

1122,This paper presents a series of analyses whose goal is to understand the effectiveness with which time-of-use (TOU) rates can economically incent off-peak charging in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). The total cost of fueling PHEV under modeled and real-world TOU rates is compared to the total cost of fueling PHEV under constant rates. Time-resolved vehicle energy consumption and fueling cost is derived for a variety of PHEV designs from travel survey data and charging behavior models. A decision tree model of PHEV consumer choices is proposed with effectiveness and cost metrics defined at each decision point. Results show that gasoline PHEV that charge off-peak incur higher gasoline costs than PHEV that charge at-will. These additional fueling costs reduce the magnitude of the economic incentives for off-peak charging that TOU rates can provide to PHEV consumers. These results are then used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of model and real-world TOU rates and to discuss implications for modeling PHEV total fueling cost.,WOS:000325485000012,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Davis, B.

Based on this observation, a parametric utility model is introduced, from which the price elastic behaviors of aggregated loads are effectively modeled as a set of multi-dimensional demand-price functions.

1133,"Smart grid is a modern infrastructure for improving the efficiency and reliability of power grid by integrating automated control, sensing and metering technologies, modern communication infrastructure and modern energy management techniques. Security and quality-of-service (QoS) are two most critical requirements for the communications network in smart grid. Frequency hopping (FH) technology, due to its inherent security, is a promising candidate technology in the physical layer of smart gird communication infrastructure. Unfortunately, all the existing FH systems can support only a single level of QoS due to the fact that traditional FH sequence sets can provide the same level of Hamming cross-correlation. In this paper, an FH-based communication network is developed for smart grid, particularly the advanced smart metering (AMI), to address the above two key challenges. A novel type of FH sequence set which meets the multi-level QoS requirement is designed. Then, the data traffic in AMI is investigated and modeled as a general Poisson process which is validated by real measurements of power consumptions.

1136,"Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) as an essential network component of smart grid, provides services by periodically collecting the charging status of a battery vehicle (BV). A BV is normally associated with a default interest group (e. g., power grid operator). When the BV accesses its default charging or communication point, it works in the home mode. The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis.

The proposed real-time price-based DR management application can be imbedded into smart meters and automatically executed on-line for determining the optimal operation of residential appliances within 5-minute time slots while considering uncertainties in real-time electricity prices. Operation tasks of residential appliances are categorized into deferrable/non-deferrable and interruptible/non-interruptible ones based on appliances' DR preferences as well as their distinct spatial and temporal operation characteristics. The stochastic optimization adopts the scenario-based approach via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the expected electricity payment for the entire day, while controlling the financial risks associated with real-time electricity price uncertainties via the expected downside risks formulation. Price uncertainty intervals are considered in the robust optimization for minimizing the worst-case electricity payment while flexibly adjusting the solution robustness.

1146,"A microgrid is capable of providing highly reliable power supply to sensitive loads like semiconductor fabrication or computer data processing equipment. This is especially required when the sensitive loads are located in distribution systems that also contain several single-phase and/or nonlinear loads. Voltage source inverter (VSI) based distributed energy resources can provide power quality conditioning support. They require filters to accurately detect unbalance and harmonics in the system. The state-of-the-art filtering techniques in three-phase power systems involve employing complex bandpass filters that pass frequencies within a band without much attenuation. Such methods however give good dynamic performance only when there is a wide separation between the desired and undesired frequencies. In power distribution systems containing imbalances and harmonic generating loads, the gap between the two frequencies may be very small, and therefore such methods don't offer good performance. This paper proposes improved methods of filtering signals in three-phase, three-wire power systems, especially when there is a narrow gap between the desired and undesired frequencies.

The conceptual design of the proposed interface is to provide control system robustness against system-level interactions without strict knowledge of complete microgrid system dynamics. To increase the robustness against converter-microgrid interactions, the microgrid system is modeled by a dynamic equivalent circuit, which might include uncertainties induced due to microgrid impedance variation and interactions with the equivalent microgrid bus-voltage. The equivalent microgrid model along with local load interactions and uncertainties are augmented with the DG interface power circuit model to develop a robust voltage controller. To account for power angle interaction dynamics, an angle feed-forward control approach is adopted, where the angle of the equivalent microgrid bus, as seen by each DG unit, is estimated and used for feed-forward control. Unlike conventional droop controllers, the proposed scheme yields two-degree-of-freedom controller, resulting in stable and smooth power sharing performance over a wide range for the static droop gain and also at different loading conditions.

This represents a significant barrier to more widespread adoption of dc power distribution for microgrid applications.

This paper shows however that there are severe limitations to the effectiveness of such schemes when employed for more complex microgrid network architectures. Even current differential schemes, which offer a more effective, though costly, protection solution, must be carefully designed to meet the design requirements resulting from the unique fault characteristics of dc microgrids. This paper presents a detailed analysis of dc microgrid behavior under fault conditions, illustrating the challenging protection requirements and demonstrating the shortcomings of non-unit approaches for these applications.

The proposed method has five operating states and four subcontrols, which are emergency control, restorative control, corrective control and preventive control. The entire self-healing UPG is controlled by the multiagent system (MAS). The agent system has three layers, each of which comprises several agents. This paper discusses the design and function of each agent, as well as the agents' structures and their communication methods. A practical test case based on the urban power grid in Jiangning County in China is employed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed agent-based system to perform self-healing functionality.

1158,"The vehicle electrification will have a significant impact on the power grid due to the increase in electricity consumption. It is important to perform intelligent scheduling for charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs). However, there are two major challenges in the scheduling problem. First, it is challenging to find the globally optimal scheduling solution which can minimize the total cost. Second, it is difficult to find a distributed scheduling scheme which can handle a large population and the random arrivals of the EVs. In this paper, we propose a globally optimal scheduling scheme and a locally optimal scheduling scheme for EV charging and discharging. We first formulate a global scheduling optimization problem, in which the charging powers are optimized to minimize the total cost of all EVs which perform charging and discharging during the day. The globally optimal solution provides the globally minimal total cost. However, the globally optimal scheduling scheme is impractical since it requires the information on the future base loads and the arrival times and the charging periods of the EVs that will arrive in the future time of the day. To develop a practical scheduling scheme, we then formulate a local scheduling optimization problem, which aims tominimize the total cost of the EVs in the current ongoing EV set in the local group. The locally optimal scheduling scheme is not only scalable to a large EV population but also resilient to the dynamic EV arrivals. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the locally optimal scheduling scheme can achieve a close performance compared to the globally optimal scheduling scheme.",WOS:000325484500004,Ieee T Smart Grid,"He, Y.

Since then, there has not been any further development of the Hooke's law in the electric regime. In this paper, this technological gap is filled by the development of ""electric springs."" The scientific principle, the operating modes, the limitations, and the practical realization of the electric springs are reported. It is discovered that such novel concept has huge potential in stabilizing future power systems with substantial penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in a practical power system setup fed by an ac power source with a fluctuating wind energy source. The electric spring is found to be effective in regulating the mains voltage despite the fluctuation caused by the intermittent nature of wind power. Electric appliances with the electric springs embedded can be turned into a new generation of smart loads, which have their power demand following the power generation profile.

Two control schemes are investigated that can provide energy management, taking into account user's comfort, via binary on-off policies of the smart flexible devices. A dynamic control algorithm is introduced that considers real time network characteristics and initiates command flow when critical parameters exceed predefined thresholds. To sustain fairness in the system, priority based and round robin scheduling algorithms are proposed. A continuous control algorithm is also explored to define the higher bounds of energy savings. To quantify the discomfort of users that participate in this type of services, a heuristic consumer utility metric is proposed and measurements with a flexible device (air conditioning unit) are performed to model empirically possible time intervals of the control scheme. Reciprocal fair energy management schemes are investigated being both operator and user centric.

1161,"Based on the traditional network expansion planning formulation, a new formulation is built by taking into consideration the curtailment of renewable energy generation (REG), e.g., wind farm generation. The objective is to minimize the total cost of building new circuits and to curtail the output of REG generation. Loss in REG generation curtailment is computed according to its annual output duration curve. In the proposed formulation, operational conditions under peak and trough load levels, the different outputs of REG, and the N-1 security criterion are altogether considered. The whole formulation is solved by Benders' decomposition method. The proposed method is tested on a practical network. Network expansion schemes obtained from the classical and the proposed methods are compared and analyzed. Test results show that network investment can be reduced or deferred by deploying the autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS).

This approach expands the idea of traditional transmission system nomograms to a multidimensional case, involving multiple system limits and parameters such as transmission path constraints, zonal generation or load, etc., considered concurrently. In this paper, the security region boundary is represented using piece-wise approximation with the help of linear inequalities (so called hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space, consisting of system parameters that are critical for security analysis. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are conducted to build the security region and the hyperplanes can be applied in real time with phasor information for on-line security assessment. Numerical simulations have been performed for the full size Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system model, which comprises 15 126 buses and 3034 generators. Simulation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, and proved that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the wide-area situation awareness for a bulk power system like WECC.",WOS:000325484500027,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Makarov, Y.

1176,"This paper proposes an accurate and precise genetic algorithm(GA) for frequency estimation of electrical power system (EPS) signals. The problem of estimating the frequency of a distorted electrical signal is modeled as an optimization problem. A regularization technique is used to guide the GA to a plausible solution from a practical point of view when the signal has significant output distortions. In this approach, the GA using regularization (GAR) enables the balanced investigation of a number of potential solutions, largely exploring the search space from one side, and weighing the suitable solutions according to practical purposes from the other side. The GAR is programmed in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. This is made possible due to 1) the implicit parallelism of FPGAs in computing their instructions and 2) the suitable choice of steps of GARs to explore this parallelism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an EPS was simulated having typical operation conditions. The relatively high robustness exhibited by the GAR to harmonics and noise makes it a promising equipment in the challenge of construction of smart power grids.",WOS:000325484500030,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Coury, D.

1177,"Recently, the concept of microgrids (clusters of distributed generation, energy storage units, and reactive power sources serving a cluster of distributed loads in grid-connected and isolated grid modes) has gained a lot of interest under the smart grid vision. However, there is a strong need to develop systematic procedure for optimal construction of microgrids. This paper presents systematic and optimized approaches for clustering of the distribution system into a set of virtual microgrids with optimized self-adequacy. The probabilistic characteristics of distributed generation (DG) units are also considered by defining two new probabilistic indices representing real and reactive power of the lines. Next, the advantages of installing both distributed energy storage resources (DESRs) and distributed reactive sources (DRSs) are investigated to improve the self-adequacy of the constructed micro-grids. The new strategy facilitates robust infrastructure for smart distribution systems operational control functions, such as self-healing, by using virtual microgrids as building blocks in future distribution systems. The problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper. The well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as a test case and through several sensitivity studies, the effect of the total DESRs or DRSs capacities on the design and the robustness of the algorithm are investigated.",WOS:000325484500043,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Arefifar, S.

The negative sequence component of the voltage signal is used in islanding detection of these resources from the grid.

1179,"In this paper, the coordinated integration of aggregated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) fleets and renewable energy sources (wind energy) in power systems is studied by stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (Stochastic SCUC) model, which minimizes the expected grid operation cost while considering the random behavior of the many PEVs. PEVs are mobile and distributed devices with deferrable options for the supply/utilization of energy at various times and locations. The increased utilization of PEVs, which consume electricity rather than fossil fuel for driving, offers unique economic and environmental opportunities, and brings out new challenges to electric power system operation and planning. The storage capability of PEVs could help power systems mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources and reduce grid operation costs. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables PEVs to have bi-directional power flows once they are connected to the grid, i.e., they can either inject power to, and draw power from, the grid which adds further complexity to power system operations. PEVs signify customers' random behavior when considering their driving patterns, locational energy requirements, topological grid interconnections, and other constraints imposed by the consumers.

1180,"The energy sector is moving into the era of distributed generation (DG) and microgrids (MGs). The stability and operation aspects of converter-dominated DG MGs, however, are faced by many challenges. Important among these, are: 1) the absence of physical inertia; 2) comparable size of power converters; 3) mutual interactions among generators; 4) islanding detection delays; and 5) large sudden disturbances associated with transition to islanded mode, grid restoration, and load power changes. To overcome these difficulties, this paper presents a new large-signal-based control topology for DG power converters that is suitable for both grid-connected and islanding modes of operation without any need to reconfigure the control system and without islanding detection. To improve MG stability, the proposed control structure is realized via two steps. First, an emulated inertia and damping functions are adopted. Second, to guarantee stability and high performance of the MG system during sudden harsh transients such as islanding, grid reconnection, and large load power changes, a nonlinear MG stabilizer is proposed. An augmented converter model is developed and used to design the MG stabilizer via the adaptive backstepping (AB) technique to guarantee large-angle stability and robustness against unmodeled dynamics.

The consensus of recent research is that current slow central network control based upon Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is no longer sufficient and Distributed Network Operators (DNOs) wish to adopt novel management mechanisms coupled with advanced communication infrastructures to meet the emerging control challenges. In this paper, we address this issue from the communication perspective by exploiting the effectiveness of using a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network as the key component of the underlying communication infrastructure to support a recently suggested active network management solution. The key factors that would affect the communication performance over satellite links are discussed and an analytical LEO network model is presented. The delivery performance of several major data services for supporting the management solution is evaluated against a wide range of satellite link delay and loss conditions under both normal and emergency traffic scenarios through extensive simulation experiments.

1184,"This paper demonstrates how reactive power injection from distributed generators can be used to mitigate the voltage/VAR control problem of a distribution network. Firstly, power flow equations are formulated with arbitrarily located distributed generators in the network. Since reactive power injection is limited by economic viability and power electronics interface, we formulate voltage/VAR control as a constrained optimization problem. The formulation aims to minimize the combined reactive power injection by distributed generators, with constraints on: 1) power flow equations; 2) voltage regulation; 3) phase imbalance correction; and 4) maximum and minimum reactive power injection. The formulation is a nonconvex problem thereby making the search for an optimal solution extremely complex. So, a suboptimal approach is proposed based on methods of sequential convex programming (SCP).

Aggregate Control, where feedback controllers are designed to achieve a desired closed-loop transient response between every pair of clusters, and finally 3. Control Inversion, where the aggregate control design is distributed and tuned to actual TCSC controllers in the full-order model until its inter-area responses match the respective inter-machine responses of the reduced-order system. It is shown that the inversion problem can be posed equivalently as decomposing the swing dynamics into fast and slow states, and designing the controllers such that the slow dynamics can optimally track a desired closed-loop signal designed for the aggregate model.

In addition, smart pricing can be used to seek social benefits and to implement social objectives. To achieve social objectives, the utility company may need to collect various information about users and their energy consumption behavior, which can be challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method to tackle this problem. We assume that each user is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) as part of its smart meter. All smart meters are connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure. This allows two-way communication among smart meters and the utility company. We analytically model each user's preferences and energy consumption patterns in form of a utility function. Based on this model, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism which aims to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the aggregate utility functions of all users minus the total energy cost. Our design requires that each user provides some information about its energy demand. In return, the energy provider will determine each user's electricity bill payment.

The frequency restoration is designed using the DR as the first option to intercept frequency decline for a large disturbance, followed by the scheduled spinning reserve to raise frequency back to the pre-disturbance level. The proposed scheme is especially developed to intelligently deploy DR for coordinating with different spinning reserve constraints and contingency scenarios.

1195,"With more and more renewable energy generation (REG) connections, busbar voltage violation and line overloading problems may occur for some parts of a distribution network. However, building new circuits to accommodate REG may have high monetary and environmental costs. This paper considers distribution automation as a supplementary scheme to traditional primary asset investments and analyzes the operational benefits from introducing an autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS) to a practical distribution system with rich renewable sources. The benefits are quantified in terms of optimal power flow control and investment deferral, and the resulting quantification will inform distribution network operators of the trade-offs between investment in the automation system and in the primary assets, thus helping them to make cost-effective investment decisions. Time-series-based simulation for over an entire year is implemented to calculate the benefits of active power loss and curtailment reductions for AuRA-NMS over the current practice. Part I of this paper illustrates the current schemes for voltage control and constraint management, advanced voltage control and constraint management enabled by the distribution automation, and the annual benefit by introducing the AuRA-NMS to the system with different considerable new DG integrations.

However, system-level dynamic interactions might be yielded due to the active control nature and tight regulation of power converters to meet load/generation requirements. This paper presents an assessment and mitigation strategies of such interactions in hybrid networks. A typical and comprehensive hybrid network composed of a DG power park, dc microgrid, islanded ac microgrid interfaced by voltage-source converter (VSC), and a grid-connected VSC is considered. Mathematical modeling and analysis of the input/output admittances of these entities are provided to evaluate the overall system stability based on the Nyquist admittance ratio criterion. It can be shown that the tight regulation of VSCs introduces incremental negative admittances reflected to the common dc link which significantly degrades the system stability. Therefore, active compensators are proposed to actively reshape the input dc-side admittance of the VSCs so that the Nyquist criterion is satisfied.

Depending on how and when the PEVs are charged, the effects on the power demand will vary. Previous studies have shown that uncontrolled charge of PEVs can cause problems for the distribution system in some areas. This paper proposes an approach to control PEVs charging based on the charging behavior estimated from the demographical statistical data. In this approach, three different charge strategies are designed and the impacts of PEVs charging on the distribution system is assess using standard load flow calculations. A case study using the proposed approach examines the real situation in Gothenburg, a city on the west coast of Sweden. The results from the study show that the impacts on the distribution system due to PEVs vary between different areas. By controlling the charging, the impacts can be reduced but the choice of control methods must be chosen carefully.

Future load profiles have been constructed by adding different EV charging profiles to household loads and solving the power flows to assess the network impacts on various network levels. The results indicate that controlled charging of EVs leads to significant reduction of overloaded network components that have to be replaced, but the impact varies per network level. Overall, in the uncontrolled charging scenarios roughly two times more replacements are needed compared to the controlled charging scenario. Furthermore, it was shown that for the controlled charging scenario the overall reduction in net present value due to energy losses and the replacement of overloaded network components is approximately 20% in comparison with the uncontrolled charging scenario.

Feeder agents in the second layer are assigned to negotiation. The constraints include voltage limits, line current limits, and radial topology.

The main idea is to transmit only when a significant power consumption change occurs. On the other hand, the policy of transmitting only when change occurs may bring a security issue; i.e., an eavesdropper can monitor the daily life of the house owner, particularly the information of whether the owner is at home.

1206,"Demand side management (DSM) is one of the important functions in a smart grid that allows customers to make informed decisions regarding their energy consumption, and helps the energy providers reduce the peak load demand and reshape the load profile. This results in increased sustainability of the smart grid, as well as reduced overall operational cost and carbon emission levels. Most of the existing demand side management strategies used in traditional energy management systems employ system specific techniques and algorithms.

The paper modifies the standard droop method in order to force the generators to share the load according to their available wind power and not just the generator rating. The paper focuses on islanded microgrid application; however, the method is applicable when there is a controlled connection to the main grid via a power converter, and also for HVDC connection.

However, in some applications, such as demand-side management, operation decisions are made based on certain price thresholds. It is, hence, desirable to obtain the ""classes"" of future prices, which can be cast as an electricity price classification problem. In this paper, we investigate the application and effectiveness of several data mining approaches for electricity market price classification. In addition, we propose a new data model for forming the initial data set for price classification. Simulation results for New York, Ontario, and Alberta electricity market prices are provided. Finally, the application of the generated numerical results to a demand-side management case study is demonstrated.",WOS:000325484200021,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Huang, D. L., Zareipour, H., Rosehart, W.

1211,"This paper proposes application of wireless sensor networks in distributed generation. Furthermore, in order to have a reliable communication with minimal end-to-end delay during the event of next hop node failure, the paper proposes a Find Reliable Link (FRL) scheme. Power sharing can be improved significantly in a conventional decentralized power control by correcting the distributed generators reference signals with wireless sensor networks as proposed in this paper. Even a low bandwidth communication among the distributed generators and control center can overcome the system operation challenges posed by network line parameters, failure of distributed generators and power shortage in the system. In order to ensure reliable communication between the sensor nodes or distributed generators and control center, the paper proposes the FRL scheme. The scheme aims to enable the system to make a quick recovery from sensor node failures or link failure due to obstacles thereby reducing the end-to-end delay. The proposed communication scheme is verified by implementing it in Qualnet 5.0. A detail data traffic analysis is presented to demonstrate how reliability is improved in the proposed communication method.

1214,"Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are set to be the defining trend in road transportation for the 21st century. Unfortunately, the process of charging a large number of PHEVs will put a prohibitive amount of stress on conventional power grids. As per current estimates, it will not be possible to satisfy the peak demand of charging millions of PHEVs with current infrastructure. Additionally, to ensure stability of the power grid, the demand needs to be closely matched with supply all the time. This is difficult to ensure in a dynamic scenario like PHEV charging, where it is not possible to predict the load in the future. This problem is further complicated by the introduction of intermittent sources of alternate energy like wind power. This paper proposes an IT infrastructure for managing energy usage of PHEVs. The paper introduces a generalized currency of energy called a token, which entitles its owner to produce or consume a certain amount of electrical energy. Furthermore, the paper propose an IT infrastructure to manage tokens produced by millions of PHEVs and power stations.

The performance of a grounding grid is affected by a number of factors, such as the soil conductivity and grounding rod corrosion. Industry always has a strong desire for a reliable and cost-effective method to monitor the condition of a grounding grid to ensure personnel safety and prevent equipments damage. In view of the increased adoption of telecom and sensor technologies in power industry through the smart grid initiative, this paper proposes an online condition monitoring scheme for grounding grids. The scheme monitors touch and step voltages in a substation through a sensor network. The voltages are created by a continuously-injected, controllable test current. The results are transmitted to a database through wireless telecommunication. The database evaluates the grid performance continuously by comparing the newly measured results with the historical data. Many of the limitations of the offline measurement techniques are overcome.

1216,"In the upcoming smart grid environment many more measurements will be available, which can be locally processed by the so-called substation state estimator (SSE). Distribution substations serve energy to a large set of feeders, each one delivering power to a certain number of secondary transformers. In this context, the SSE may have to deal with a huge network model, comprising several hundred or even thousand buses. Taking advantage of the weak electrical coupling existing among the set of feeders connected to the same or adjacent substations, a two-stage procedure is proposed in this paper to efficiently solve the SSE. In the first stage the overall SE is decomposed into f + s WLS subproblems (f and s being the total number of feeders and substations, respectively), which are then solved in a decoupled manner. The second stage, involving a linear WLS problem, consists of coordinating the solution provided by each subsystem (feeder or substation).

1217,"This paper deals with load control in a multiple-residence setup. The utility company adopts a cost function representing the cost of providing energy to end-users. Each residential end-user has a base load, two types of adjustable loads, and possibly a storage device. The first load type must consume a specified amount of energy over the scheduling horizon, but the consumption can be adjusted across different slots. The second type does not entail a total energy requirement, but operation away from a user-specified level results in user dissatisfaction. The research issue amounts to minimizing the electricity provider cost plus the total user dissatisfaction, subject to the individual constraints of the loads. The problem can be solved by a distributed subgradient method. The utility company and the end-users exchange information through the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)-a two-way communication network-in order to converge to the optimal amount of electricity production and the optimal power consumption schedule. The algorithm finds near-optimal schedules even when AMI messages are lost, which can happen in the presence of malfunctions or noise in the communications network.

1219,"Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS)-based closed-loop power system control faces lots of challenges such as network effects in WAMS communication which include network-induced delays, data packet dropouts and packet disordering, etc. As of now, design of wide area feedback controller robust against those network effects typically relies on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) methods. However, because LMIs methods results in conservative controller and sometimes feasible solution cannot be found although they exist, it is still difficult to implement wide area feedback control in real power systems. In order to overcome those problems, a more practical scheme is presented in this paper for WAMS-based closed-loop power system control. In the new scheme, a GPS receiver is configured at the wide area feedback controller/actuator which can calculate feedback signals' delays by comparing the time differences between their own clocks and time stamps of feedback signals. Then, by using synchronized sampling technology again, trajectories of power systems are extrapolated to compensate those network effects in WAMS communication. Therefore, in the new scheme, hardware technologies (e.g., GPS-based synchronized sampling technologies) instead of complicated LMIs methods are used to deal with network effects in WAMS communication. So the new control scheme can overcome the conservative nature from LMIs methods and can be implemented practically in real power systems.

This extensive study of a complex urban network suggests that: 1) before implementation of smart grid principles, it would be prudent to supplement steady-state analysis with time-domain analysis to avoid problems, such as installation of improperly rated equipment, and improper relay-protection coordination; and 2) EMTP-type programs may be used to conduct the time-domain analysis, despite the enormous number of elements contained in an urban network.",WOS:000325484200030,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Spitsa, V., Ran, X.

1221,"This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) for real-time operation of a microgrid. The proposed operational strategy is mainly focused on generation scheduling and demand side management. In generation scheduling, schedule coordinator agent executes a two-stage scheduling: day-ahead and real-time scheduling. The day-ahead scheduling finds out hourly power settings of distributed energy resources (DERs) from a day-ahead energy market. The real-time scheduling updates the power settings of the distributed energy resources by considering the results of the day-ahead scheduling and feedback from real-time operation of the microgrid in real-time digital simulator (RTDS). A demand side management agent performs load shifting before the day-ahead scheduling, and does load curtailing in real-time whenever it is necessary and possible. The distributed multiagent model proposed in this paper provides a common communication interface for all components of the microgrid to interact with one another for autonomous intelligent control actions. Furthermore, the multiagent system maximizes the power production of local distributed generators, minimizes the operational cost of the microgrid, and optimizes the power exchange between the main power grid and the microgrid subject to system constraints and constraints of distributed energy resources.

In addition, the presented system together with the proposed power management strategy can minimize the effect of newly established zonal dc microgrid to the existing power grid, of which promises a better stability.

1232,"An algorithm for the optimal voltage regulation of distribution secondary networks with distributed generators (DGs) is proposed in the paper. Based on the epsilon decomposition of the sensitivity matrix (inverse of Jacobian) obtained from the solution of the Newton-Raphson power flow problem, a large secondary network is divided into several small subnetworks. From the epsilon decomposition, the range of influence of each DG on the voltage of the entire network is determined. When voltage at particular nodes exceeds normal operating limits, the nearest DGs can be located and commanded to control the voltage. The control action can be coordinated using communications in a small-size subnetwork. The voltage regulation is achieved by solving a small linear programming optimization problem with an objective function that makes every DG to optimize its generation. The algorithm is tested with a model of a real heavily-meshed secondary network.

The latter may be controllable or noncontrollable. This paradigm shift means to switch from a fixed radial operative topology network to a more dynamical configuration, which changes during the day and hour by hour. In this sense, the massive incorporation of new telecontrol and telecommunication technologies allows a dynamic operation in real-time (RT) of distribution networks. In order to achieve an optimal network operation, it is required a continuous RT monitoring, control and economic dispatch by means of a smart distribution management system (DMS). The named system must count on high performance algorithms and RT information systems. This paper presents three very efficient algorithms (in terms of speed, robustness and accuracy), which are: load estimation, ac power flow, and optimal reconfiguration for loss minimization.

The main application of the DSB model is for a fast power-flow analysis of an islanded ADN to enable its real-time energy management and prevent DER capacity violation in between two consecutive optimal power-flow runs. Unlike the existing DSB models, the proposed model incorporates i) the participation of DER units with different control strategies (PQ and PV) in the system real and reactive slack compensation and ii) the DER power capacity limits. Based on a new definition of the ""participating sources,"" the power-flow equations are augmented to incorporate the system real and reactive power slack as state variables.

1247,"As solar photovoltaic power generation becomes more commonplace, the inherent intermittency of the solar resource poses one of the great challenges to those who would design and implement the next generation smart grid. Specifically, grid-tied solar power generation is a distributed resource whose output can change extremely rapidly, resulting in many issues for the distribution system operator with a large quantity of installed photovoltaic devices. Battery energy storage systems are increasingly being used to help integrate solar power into the grid. These systems are capable of absorbing and delivering both real and reactive power with sub-second response times. With these capabilities, battery energy storage systems can mitigate such issues with solar power generation as ramp rate, frequency, and voltage issues. Beyond these applications focusing on system stability, energy storage control systems can also be integrated with energy markets to make the solar resource more economical.

These capabilities allow utility companies to adjust their offerings in a way that encourages consumers to reduce their peak hour consumption, resulting in a more efficient system. In this paper, we propose a method for scheduling a community's power consumption such that it becomes almost flat. Our methodology utilizes distributed schedulers that allocate time slots to soft loads probabilistically based on precalculated and predistributed demand forecast information. This approach requires no communication or coordination between scheduling nodes. Furthermore, the computation performed at each scheduling node is minimal. Obtaining a relatively constant consumption makes it possible to have a relatively constant billing rate and eliminates operational inefficiencies.

Power quality challenges include voltage regulation issues, flicker, and frequency volatility. Operational challenges include the need for extension of the command-and-control infrastructure to millions of devices anticipated on the low-voltage (service) side of the distribution network. This paper presents an advanced grid-tied inverter controls concept designed to address such challenges. This controls concept is based on reproducing favorable characteristics of traditional generators that result in load-following tendencies, and is accordingly dubbed Generator Emulation Controls (GEC). Traditional generators are analyzed with specific focus on such favorable characteristics as inertial dynamics and controlled impedance. Details of GEC are then presented, and its implementation is outlined based on the evolution of conventional grid-tied inverter controls. This is followed by an examination of the system impact of GEC-operated devices. GEC allows DG inverters to perform voltage regulation support, reactive power compensation, and fault ride-through. GEC also allows DG inverters to form scalable inverter-based microgrids, capable of operating in grid-tied mode or separating and supporting an islanded load.

Each of the operating modes has an individually designed outer loop performing the corresponding regulation tasks, most commonly including the ac voltage and the dc voltage regulation. A modified 1 Phi, phase-locked loop (PLL) system is used for system-level operation with both small steady-state error and fast response; and a novel islanding detection algorithm based on PLL stability is proposed to facilitate the transition between grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode.

1257,"Energy trading in day-ahead electricity markets can be highly risky, especially for entities with considerable stochastic energy penetration. This is because of the uncertain energy prices, balancing prices, stochastic energy availability, and demand. In this work, coordinating unidirectional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services with energy trading is proposed to mitigate these trading risks. This coordination is possible due to the recent advances in smart grid technologies. The case of a load-serving entity (LSE) that owns thermal and wind plants, and is obligated to serve a load with a significant number of electric vehicles (EVs) is investigated. The problem of energy trading in coordination with V2G services is formulated as a mixed-integer stochastic linear program. The objective is to maximize the LSE's profits while maintaining its risks within acceptable levels. The conditional value at risk is used as a risk control measure. A case study that compares coordinated vs. uncoordinated EV charging is presented.

Under deregulation, the scope of LM programs has considerably been expanded to include demand response programs (DRPs). Basically, DRPs are divided into two main categories namely, incentive-based programs (IBPs) and time-based rate (TBR) programs. In this paper, an economic model of responsive loads is derived based upon price elasticity of demand and customers' benefit function. In order to investigate the economic-driven and environmental-driven measures of demand response programs, a new linearized formulation of cost-emission based unit commitment problem associated with DRPs (UCDR) is presented. Here, UCDR is modeled as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. The proposed model is applied to determine loads provided by DRPs and schedule commitment status of generating units. Moreover, the optimum value of incentive as a crucial issue for implementing DRPs is derived. Several analyses are conducted to investigate the impact of some important factors such as elasticity on the UCDR problem.

Due to their large quantity and complex charging behavior, the impact of substantial PHEVs charging on the power grid needs to be investigated. Since the charging behavior of PHEVs in a certain regional transmission network or a local distribution network is determined by different uncertain factors, their overall charging demand tends to be uncertain and in this situation probabilistic power flow (PPF) can be applied to analyze the impact of PHEVs charging on the power grid. However, currently there is no suitable model of the overall charging demand of PHEVs available for PPF calculations. In this paper, a methodology of modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs is proposed. The proposed methodology establishes a single PHEV charging demand model, and then employs queuing theory to describe the behavior of multiple PHEVs.

This paper addresses dc microgrid stability under high penetration of tightly regulated power electronic converters; and proposes three simple and computationally efficient active damping solutions that can be implemented to stabilize a controlled voltage-source converter (VSC) interfacing a dc- microgrid to an ac system. The proposed active damping methods depend on reshaping the VSC impedance by injecting internal-model-based active damping signal at the outer, intermediate and inner control loops of the voltage-oriented VSC interface. Small signal analysis is conducted to assess the system stability under different compensation schemes. Moreover, the reshaped source impedance of the VSC interface and the modified voltage-tracking dynamics are derived under different compensation schemes.

1265,"This work presents a two-stage model for the data analysis of electricity consumption. The first stage divides the consumption in two parts: weather- and illumination-related, and residual consumption, where weather-related consumption refers to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Given the hourly total consumption, we obtain the hourly weather-related and illumination-related electricity consumption, and subtract this out to get residual consumption. The second stage of the model is a flexible, agent-based analytical tool that allows disaggregation of residual consumption into a sum of consumptions by different groups of appliances. This tool can be used for a variety of applications including an optimization of demand-side management and/or a development of a set of desirable patterns for schedules of electricity-related activities in households (within an acceptable range of course) in order to minimize negative effects of high peak demand.",WOS:000325427200021,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Hobby, J.

1266,"This manuscript focuses on a novel actively controlled hybrid magnetic battery/ultracapacitor based energy storage system (ESS) for vehicular propulsion systems. A stand-alone battery system might not be sufficient to satisfy peak power demand and transient load variations in hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV, PHEV). Active battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be different than that of the ultracapacitor, which will result in flexibility of design as well as cost and size reduction of the battery pack. In addition, the ultracapacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power and it can be used with high C-rates. Hence, the battery is not subjected to supply peak and sharp power variations, and the stress on the battery will be reduced and the battery lifetime would be increased.

1267,"This paper introduces a new method for calculating frequency at an electrical load in simulations of electro-mechanical transients. The method is designed for simulation studies that require accurate models of sensors such as phasor measurement units and F-Net devices, which measure frequency at locations away from generating plants. These sensors are poised to become critical components in the control systems of electrical power grids, and therefore simulation tools that incorporate accurate models of these devices are essential. The method proposed here corrects two drawbacks of using numerically computed phase angle derivatives to approximate frequency. First, it eliminates spurious spikes in frequencies calculated at loads. Second, it eliminates instabilities induced by the simulator in studies of frequency responsive loads. The proposed method is derived from a simplified model of the generators and loads in an electrical system, but in the final analysis does not depend critically on these simplifications and is therefore applicable to more sophisticated models. The method is demonstrated with the simplified model applied to the IEEE 14 and 300 bus systems.",WOS:000325427200023,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Nutaro, J. and Protopopescu, V.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",22,10.1109/Tsg.2011.2173359,Mar,1949-3053,1,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,frequency control,modeling,simulation,power-system frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,231OS,233-240,15428,Journal Article,Calculating Frequency at Loads in Simulations of Electro-Mechanical Transients,6,Calculating Frequency at Loads in Simulations of Electro-Mechanical Transients,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325427200023,3,2012
1268,"Batteries and supercapacitors (SC) complement one another; a battery has a relatively high energy density but a low power density, whereas an SC has a relatively high power density but a low energy density. In order to offset their opposing limitations, an active battery/SC hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using a dc/dc converter has been proposed. The major problem concerning an active HESS is in how to control the current flow in order to achieve two objectives: the minimization of the magnitude/fluctuation of the current flowing in and out of the battery and the energy loss seen by the SCs. This problem has not been analytically investigated for an optimal solution regarding these two goals. In this paper, we present an optimal energy management scheme for active HESS. In order to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem concerning these two objectives. Observing that the feasibility and optimality of the solution critically depends on the boundary parameters of the problem, we present an algorithm that effectively adjusts the parameter values. The proposed algorithm is based on the multiplicative-increase- additive-decrease principle, which guarantees a feasible optimal solution.

1269,"In this paper, modeling and control system design of a three-phase VSC system are investigated. The linear model and the control design are developed in the stationary-frame. The model shows a highly coupled system along alpha and beta coordinates when using a Delta-Y transformer vs. two completely decoupled subsystems in the case of Y-Y transformer. This issue was often overlooked in literature. The developed model includes the phase shift caused by the Delta-Y transformer to address its effect on the steady-state and the dynamic behaviors under balanced and unbalanced distorted three phase conditions. Linear state-space model of the closed-loop system is developed to study the dynamics and stability of the two configurations. Modal analysis shows that the phase shift introduced by the Delta-Y configuration can reduce the ultimate gain of the open loop system by 62% as compared to the system interfaced using Y-Y configuration. The developed linear model has been simulated inMATLAB/SIMULINK and validated using a detailed switching model in PSCAD/EMTDC under balanced and unbalanced three-phase conditions.

1270,"Present-day urban vehicle usage data recorded on a per second basis over a one-year period using GPS devices installed in 76 representative vehicles in the city of Winnipeg, Canada, allow predicting the electric load profiles onto the grid as a function of time for future plug-in electric vehicles. For each parking occurrence, load profile predictions properly take into account important factors, including actual state-of-charge of the battery, parking duration, parking type, and vehicle powertrain. Thus, the deterministic simulations capture the time history of vehicle driving and parking patterns using an equivalent 10 000 urban driving and parking days for the city of Winnipeg. These deterministic results are then compared to stochastic methods that differ in their treatment of how they model vehicle driving and charging habits. The new stochastic method introduced in this study more accurately captures the relationship of vehicle departure, arrival, and travel time compared to two previously used stochastic methods. It outperforms previous stochastic methods, having the lowest error at 3.4% when compared to the deterministic method for an electric sedan with a 24-kWhr battery pack. For regions where vehicle usage data is not available to predict plug-in electric vehicle load, the proposed stochastic method is recommended. In addition, using a combination of home, work, and commercial changing locales, and Level 1 versus Level 2 charging rates, deterministic simulations for urban run-out-of-charge events vary by less than 4% for seven charging scenarios selected. Using the vehicle usage data, charging scenarios simulated have no significant effect on urban run-out-of-charge events when the battery size for the electric sedan is increased. These results contribute towards utilities achieve a more optimal cost balance between: 1) charging infrastructure; 2) power transmission upgrades; 3) vehicle battery size; and 4) the addition of new renewable generation to address new electric vehicle loads for addressing energy drivers.",WOS:000325427200034,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ashtari, A., Bibeau, E., Shahidinejad, S. and Molinski, T.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V6, Canada",25,10.1109/Tsg.2011.2162009,Mar,1949-3053,1,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,plug-in electric vehicles,power generation peaking capacity,power generation planning,signal analysis,plug,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,231OS,341-350,15431,Journal Article,PEV Charging Profile Prediction and Analysis Based on Vehicle Usage Data,61,PEV Charging Profile Prediction and Analysis Based on Vehicle Usage Data,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325427200034,3,2012

The algorithm is developed to be used by an aggregator, which may be a utility or a third party. This algorithm maximizes profits to the aggregator while providing additional system flexibility and peak load shaving to the utility and low costs of EV charging to the customer.

1273,"The increasing use of power electronics in power systems causes a high injection of harmonic components which can in turn interfere with utility equipment and customer loads. Therefore, the correct estimation and measurement of harmonics have become an important issue. If the power frequency of the signal is steady and near the nominal value, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be used and good estimation performance is achieved. However, there are considerable power frequency variations on isolated systems such as shipboard power systems, micro-grids and smart-grids. When these variations occur there may be significant errors in the estimates using the DFT. In order to deal with this problem, this work presents a novel technique based on demodulation of the power line signal and subsequent filtering for harmonics estimation. The main features of the proposed harmonic estimation technique are: precise and accurate estimation of harmonics of off-nominal frequencies and fast estimation of harmonics (about two cycles of the fundamental component).

1274,"Many alternative fuel vehicle technologies, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are currently being developed. Among the key reasons for their development is the increasing demand for fuel, which has resulted in increased fuel costs and brought attention to resource limitations. Fuel is also directly related to emissions and there is a conscious effort to minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. When evaluating the operational success of these technologies, it is important to consider the energy cycle of the vehicle. Source-to-wheel (STW) efficiency and emissions analysis is proposed in this paper to provide a value for comparing current and proposed vehicle technologies. The STW cycle includes the raw material production stage, transportation and storage stages of energy sources, energy transportation/storage/distribution stage, and finally the vehicle operations stage. The STW calculation is divided into two sections for ease of analysis. They are the cycle from the source of the energy to the vehicle and the cycle from when the energy is delivered to the vehicle to the work done at the wheels. They are referred to as the source-to-vehicle (STV) and vehicle-to-wheel (VTW) cycles, respectively.

Currently the ability to manage the total system is available only through a centralized controller, which limits flexibility, reconfigurability, and reliability. These limitations can be avoided while still providing system level coordination through the use of distributed controls based on local information. All elements of the power system including source, loads, and the network itself have influence, interaction, and coupling to all other elements.

1281,"With high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), stability of the electric grid becomes a challenging task. A greater penetration level would demand a proper coordination amongst the various EVs as they charge or discharge to the grid. Coordination here refers to controlling the charging and discharging patterns of different EVs depending on their individual battery states and the present grid condition. Therefore, a good coordination between EVs is required for making the grid stable. With high penetration of EVs, the vehicle to grid (V2G) concept can be explored where excess energy of the battery can be supplied back to the grid in controlled fashion. Discharging EVs' battery energy to the grid in coordination can make V2G utilization as distributed energy storage. Charging EVs in coordination can flatten the voltage profile of a distribution node.

1283,"Current policies in the U.S. and other countries are trying to stimulate electric transportation deployment. Consequently, plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) adoption will presumably spread among vehicle users. With the increased diffusion of PEVs, lithium-ion batteries will also enter the market on a broad scale. However, their costs are still high and ways are needed to optimally deploy vehicle batteries in order to account for the higher initial outlay. This study analyzed the possibility of extending the lifecycle of PEV batteries to a secondary, stationary application. Battery usage can be optimized by installing used battery packs in buildings' microgrids. Employed as decentralized storage, batteries can be used for a microgrid's power supply and provide ancillary services (A/S). This scenario has been modeled with the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM), which identifies optimal equipment combinations to meet microgrid requirements at minimum cost, carbon footprint, or other criteria.

1284,"Rapid increase in electric power demand, introduction of RPS mandates, and a push towards electrification in the transportation sector is expected to increase power system stresses and disturbances. To tackle these power system issues and maintain high system reliability, it is essential to have information about the condition of assets present on the grid. Presently, due to the absence of low cost flexible grid wide monitoring solutions, complete information of the system is not achievable. This paper deals with the development of a new class of sensors called the smart ""stick-on"" sensors. These are low cost, self-powered, universal sensors that provide a flexible monitoring solution for grid assets. These sensors can be mass deployed due to low cost, need low maintenance as they are self-powered, and can be used for monitoring a variety of grid assets. This paper also presents the details on the network architecture, interoperability and integration, and different design aspects of the stick-on sensor, such as novel energy harvesting techniques, power management, wide operating range, and reliability.

This paper presents a novel equivalent integer linear programming method (EILPM) for the exhaustive search-based PMU placement. The state estimation implemented based on such a placement is completely linear, thereby eliminating drawbacks of the conventional SCADA-based state estimation. Additional constraints for observability preservation following single PMU or line outages can easily be implemented in the proposed EILPM. Furthermore, the limitation of communication channels is dealt with by translation of nonlinear terms into linear ones. Optimal PMU placement is carried out on the IEEE 118-bus test system in different scenarios.

1286,"This paper presents a spatial and temporal model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station located near a highway exit. Most previous studies have assumed a fixed charging location and fixed charging time during the off-peak hours for anticipating electric vehicle charging demand. Some other studies have based on limited charging scenarios at typical locations instead of a mathematical model. Therefore, from a distribution system perspective, electric vehicle charging demand is still unidentified quantity which may vary by space and time. In this context, this study proposes a mathematical model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station. The mathematical model is based on the fluid dynamic traffic model and the M/M/s queueing theory. Firstly, the arrival rate of discharged vehicles at a charging station is predicted by the fluid dynamic model. Then, charging demand is forecasted by the M/M/s queueing theory with the arrival rate of discharged vehicles. This mathematical model of charging demand may allow grid's distribution planners to anticipate a charging demand profile at a charging station.

1288,"Smart grid provides the technology for modernizing electricity delivery systems by using distributed and computer-based remote sensing, control and automation, and two-way communications. Potential benefits of the technology are that the smart grid's central control will now be able to control and operate many remote power plant, optimize the overall asset utilization and operational efficiently. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for the smart grid to handle uncertainties arising from condition monitoring and maintenance of power plant. The approach uses an adaptive maintenance advisor and a system-maintenance optimizer for designing/implementing optimized condition-based maintenance activities, and collectively handles operational variations occurring in each substation. The system-maintenance optimizer generates the initial maintenance plans for each substation with multiobjective optimization by considering only the design or average operational conditions. During operation, the substation will experience aging, control shifts, changing weather and load factors, and uncertain measurements. Residing on each host substation, the maintenance advisor will assess the adequacy of initial maintenance plans; and estimate the reliability changes caused by operational variations on the substation using a hierarchical fuzzy system. The advisor will also alert the maintenance optimizer on whether a reoptimization of its maintenance activities should be initiated for meeting the overall grid-reliability requirement.

1289,"In all areas of engineering, modelers are constantly pushing for more accurate models and their goal is generally achieved with increasingly complex, data-mining-based black-box models. On the other hand, model users which include policy makers and systems operators tend to favor transparent, interpretable models not only for predictive decision-making but also for after-the-fact auditing and forensic purposes. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off between the accuracy and the transparency of data-mining-based models in the context of catastrophe predictors for power grid response-based remedial action schemes, at both the protective and operator levels. Wide area severity indices (WASI) are derived from PMU measurements and fed to the corresponding predictors based on data-mining models such as decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), neural networks (NNET), support vector machines (SVM), and fuzzy rule based models (Fuzzy_DT and Fuzzy_ID3). It is observed that while switching from black-box solutions such as NNET, SVM, and RF to transparent fuzzy rule-based predictors, the accuracy deteriorates sharply while transparency and interpretability are improved. Although transparent automation schemes are historically preferred in power system control and operations, we show that, with existing modeling tools, this philosophy fails to achieve the ""3-nines"" accuracy figures expected from a modern power grid. The transparency and accuracy trade-offs between the developed catastrophe predictors is demonstrated thoroughly on a data base with more than 60 000 instances from a test (10%) and an actual (90%) system combined.",WOS:000325427200015,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Kamwa, I., Samantaray, S.

Operating speeds and the limitations of the components of the load controller in providing primary response are discussed.

1300,"Researchers have proposed that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) performing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) ancillary services can accrue significant economic benefits without degrading vehicle performance. However, analyses to date have not evaluated the effect that automatic generator control signal energy content and call rate has on V2G ancillary service reliability and value. This research incorporates a new level of detail into the modeling of V2G ancillary services by incorporating probabilistic vehicle travel models, time-series automatic generation control signals, and time series ancillary services pricing into a non-linear dynamic simulation of the driving and charging behavior of PHEVs. Stochastic results are generated using Monte-Carlo methods. Results show that in order to integrate a V2G system into the existing market and power grid the V2G system will require: 1) an aggregative architecture to meet current industry standard reliability requirements; 2) the construction of low energy automatic generation control signals; 3) a lower percent call for V2G even if the pool of contracted ancillary service resources gets smaller; 4) a consideration of vehicle performance degradation due to the potential loss of electrically driven miles; and 5) a high-power home charging capability.",WOS:000325427200049,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Quinn, C., Zimmerle, D. and Bradley, T.

1301,"This paper addresses the problem of electricity cost management for Internet service providers with a collection of spatially distributed data centers. As the demand on Internet services drastically increases in recent years, the electricity consumed by Internet data centers (IDCs) has been skyrocketing. While most existing research focuses on reducing electric energy consumption of IDCs at one specific location, the problem of reducing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the present multi-electricity-market environment, where the price of electricity may exhibit temporal and spatial diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing the quality of service (i.e., service level objectives) such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of critical importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost under multiple electricity markets environment while guaranteeing the quality of service geared to the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price. The problem is modeled as a constrained mixed-integer programming and an efficient solution algorithm is proposed.

1305,"This paper develops a modeling and control paradigm for the aggregate charging dynamics of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The central goal of the paper is to derive a control policy that can adapt the aggregate charging power of PEVs to highly intermittent renewable power. The key assumption here is that the grid is able to directly control the charging power of PEVs in real-time, through broadcasting a universal control signal. Using the transport-based load modeling principle, we develop a partial differential equation model for the collective charging of PEVs. We use real driving data to simulate the model and validate it against a PEV Monte Carlo simulation model. Adopting the sliding mode control theory, we then develop a robust output tracking controller for the system. The controller uses the real-time error between power supply and demand as the only measured signal, and attempts to suppress it despite the variation of the population of PEVs on the grid. We examine the performance of the controller using numerical simulations on a real wind power trajectory.",WOS:000325427200054,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Bashash, S. and Fathy, H.

An emerging issue is that a large number of PHEVs simultaneously connected to the grid may pose a huge threat to the overall power system quality and stability. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station.

1308,"To integrate large scale renewable energy sources in the power grid, the battery energy storage performs an important role for smoothing their natural intermittency and ensuring grid-wide frequency stability. Electric vehicles have not only large introduction potential but also much available time for control because they are almost plugged in the home outlets as distributed battery energy storages. Therefore, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is expected to be one of the key technologies in smart grid strategies. This paper proposes an autonomous distributed V2G control scheme. A grid-connected electric vehicle supplies a distributed spinning reserve according to the frequency deviation at the plug-in terminal, which is a signal of supply and demand imbalance in the power grid. As a style of EV utilization, it is assumed that vehicle use set next plug-out timing in advance. In such assumption, user convenience is satisfied by performing a scheduled charging for the plug-out, and plug-in idle time is available for the V2G control. Therefore a smart charging control is considered in the proposed scheme. Satisfaction of vehicle user convenience and effect to the load frequency control is evaluated through a simulation by using a typical two area interconnected power grid model and an automotive lithium-ion battery model.",WOS:000325427200058,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Ota, Y., Taniguchi, H., Nakajima, T., Liyanage, K.

The massive northeastern power blackout of August 2003 and the most recent Florida blackout have both revealed serious defects in both system-level management and device-level designs of the power grid in handling attacks. At the system level, the control area operators lack the capability to 1) obtain real-time status information of the vastly distributed equipment; 2) respond rapidly enough once events start to unravel; and 3) perform coordinated actions autonomously across the region. At the device level, the traditional hardware lacks the capability to 1) provide reliable frequency and voltage control according to system demands and 2) rapidly reconfigure the system to a secure state through switches and power-electronics based devices. These blackouts were a wake-up call for both the industry and academia to consider new techniques and system architecture design that can help assure the security and reliability of the power grid. In this paper, we present a hardware-in-the-loop reconfigurable system design with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination schemes at both local and system levels that would tackle the vulnerabilities of the grid. The new system design consists of five key components: 1) a location-centric hybrid system architecture that facilitates not only distributed processing but also coordination among geographically close devices; 2) the insertion of intelligence into power electronic devices at the lower level of the power grid to enable a more direct reconfiguration of the physical makeup of the grid; 3) the development of a robust collaboration algorithm among neighboring devices to handle possible faulty, missing, or incomplete information; 4) the design of distributed algorithms to better understand the local state of the power grid; and 5) the adoption of a control-theoretic real-time adaptation strategy to guarantee the availability of large distributed systems.

Specifically, in the proposed scheme, the smart meters which are distributed at different hierarchical networks of the SG can first achieve mutual authentication and establish the shared session key with Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol. Then, with the shared session key between smart meters and hash-based authentication code technique, the subsequent messages can be authenticated in a lightweight way.

However, the specific characteristics of the data generated by synchrophasors makes them particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks. This paper presents a set of strategies to protect the anonymity of synchrophasor data against passive traffic analysis attacks. Considering the periodic nature of synchrophasor data, we propose defense mechanisms based on packet concatenation and random packet drops as a countermeasure against attacks that may use the timing as well as data volume information to compromise the network. In contrast to existing defenses against traffic analysis attacks, our scheme can be easily deployed using the current networking infrastructure as it is based on end-to-end principles and does not require any specialized routers.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel hierarchical method to construct large Petri nets from a number of smaller Petri nets that can be created separately by different domain experts. The construction method is facilitated by a model description language that enables identical places in different Petri nets to be matched.

1324,"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems control and monitor industrial and critical infrastructure functions, such as electricity, gas, water, waste, railway, and traffic. Recent attacks on SCADA systems highlight the need of stronger SCADA security. It is important to analyze the security risks and develop appropriate security solutions to protect such systems. However, a key problem is the lack of proper modeling tools to evaluate the security of SCADA systems. As widely accepted in academic and industrial communities, it is impractical to conduct security experiments on live systems. A modeling simulation tool would enable the simulation of SCADA systems with the benefit of testing different attack and security solutions. This paper proposes a simulation tool for building SCADA simulations that supports the integration of external devices and applications.

1325,"Malicious attacks against power systems are investigated, in which an adversary controls a set of meters and is able to alter the measurements from those meters. Two regimes of attacks are considered. The strong attack regime is where the adversary attacks a sufficient number of meters so that the network state becomes unobservable by the control center. For attacks in this regime, the smallest set of attacked meters capable of causing network unobservability is characterized using a graph theoretic approach. By casting the problem as one of minimizing a super-modular graph functional, the problem of identifying the smallest set of vulnerable meters is shown to have polynomial complexity. For the weak attack regime where the adversary controls only a small number of meters, the problem is examined from a decision theoretic perspective for both the control center and the adversary. For the control center, a generalized likelihood ratio detector is proposed that incorporates historical data. For the adversary, the trade-off between maximizing estimation error at the control center and minimizing detection probability of the launched attack is examined.

The potential scenario of simultaneous intrusions launched over multiple substations is considered. The proposed detection method considers temporal anomalies.

1327,"The advent of the smart grid promises to usher in an era that will bring intelligence, efficiency, and optimality to the power grid. Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards.

In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks.

1328,"The smart grid's heavy reliance on cyber resources introduces numerous security concerns. The substantial attack surface presented by the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) along with the dissemination of sensitive data including privacy, billing, and control information will provide attackers with significant economic incentive. In addition, the scale and complexity of the architecture will stress the capabilities of many security controls such as public key encryption (PKI), authentication, and access control. The aforementioned concerns produce a requirement for increased risk management including security models that have the capability to scale to such a complex environment. A security model is introduced to represent various privilege states in a large architecture and evaluates viable paths that an attacker could exploit. The resulting model is used to produce a quantitative information-based exposure metric to evaluate the completeness of implemented security mechanisms. Various applications are proposed to show how the metric can enhance current risk management processes by identifying information dependencies of the deployed security mechanisms.

1330,"Multicast has been envisioned to be useful in many smart grid applications such as demand-response, wide area protection, in-substation protection and various operation and control. Since the multicast messages are related to critical control, authentication is necessary to prevent message forgery attacks. In this paper, we first identify the requirements of multicast communication and multicast authentication in the smart grid. Based on these requirements, we find that one-time signature based multicast authentication is a promising solution, due to its short authentication delay and low computation cost. However, existing one-time signatures are not designed for the smart grid and they may have high storage and bandwidth overhead. To address this problem, we propose a new one-time signature scheme which can reduce the storage cost by a factor of 8 and reduce the signature size by 40% compared with existing schemes. Thus, our scheme is more appropriate for smart grid applications where the receivers have limited storage (e. g., home appliances and field devices) or where data communication is frequent and short (e. g., phasor data). These gains are at the cost of increased computations in signature generation and/or verification and fortunately our scheme can flexibly allocate the computations between the sender and receiver based on their computing resources. We formulate the computation allocation as a nonlinear integer programming problem to minimize the signing cost under a certain verification cost and propose a heuristic solution to solve it.",WOS:000208787700014,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Li, Q.

Providing time-synchronized data of power system operating states, WAMS will play a crucial role in next generation smart grid protection and control. WAMS helps secure efficient energy transmission as well as reliable and optimal grid management.

1336,"Much interest and research have emerged to implement and improve the smart grid. The smart grid is the power infrastructure whose intellectual capability is enhanced with communication networks. In addition to communication networks, a bidirectional flow of both power and information enables the customers to actively participate in the whole procedure of power generation, transport, distribution, and consumption. In this paper, we propose the concept of collaborative customer to combine two or more customers into a single customer community, under which the customers collaborate on a power-sharing to reduce their expenditure for electricity power. However, the collaboration can be easily disrupted in the presence of malicious or selfish behaviors. In order to address the security issue, we present a brand-new security scheme, called the voucher scheme, for securely trading the right on power usage among members of a collaborative customer. When the voucher scheme is enabled, a power customer who wants to use extra power issues a certificate, called voucher that is immune to various security attacks, to a power customer who is willing to transfer its right on power usage to the former customer, so that both the customers can have monetary benefits. We formally define the security model for the voucher scheme and prove that the scheme is secure in the random oracle model. We then present a performance evaluation study to see the effectiveness of the scheme with respect to the benefit of the power-sharing and the robustness of the security.

1337,"Communication networks play a critical role in smart grid, as the intelligence of smart grid is built based on information exchange across the power grid. In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.",WOS:000208787700025,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Wang, X.

We propose a method of estimating the APC in a probabilistic manner. Its probability distribution is obtained from the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, and hence represented with two parameters, i.e., mean and covariance. Based on the probability distribution of the APC, we calculate the power capacity that V2G regulation providers (or V2G aggregators) are contracted to provide grid operators with, called the contracted power capacity (CPC). Four possible contract types between a grid operator and a V2G regulation provider are suggested and, for each contract type, a profit function is developed from the APC and the penalty imposed to the V2G aggregator. The CPCs for four contract types are chosen to maximize the corresponding profit functions.

Due to high vehicular speed, sporadic connection, limited communication range, and large volume of data that need to be transmitted, V2G communications have the crucial requirements of fast authentication and encryption/decryption. This paper proposes a unique batch authentication protocol UBAPV2G that takes into account the characteristics of vehicle communication. The performance analysis shows that UBAPV2G can achieve less authentication delay, less computational cost, and less communication traffic, and security analysis shows that UBAPV2G is strong enough to defend against security attacks.

These systems, often composed of embedded nodes with highly constrained resources, require, e.g., metering data to be delivered efficiently while neither jeopardizing communication nor security. Data aggregation is a natural choice in such settings, where an additional challenge is to facilitate per-hop and end-to-end security as well as a mechanism to protect the valid nodes from exhaustion threats. The prime contribution of this paper is to include into the security design framework issues related to aggregation, wireless fading and shadowing channels, physical layer parameters (such as choice of modulation, packet length, channel coder), medium access control parameters (such as average number of transmissions), routing parameters (such as choice of route).

The operation of the V2G networks is based on continuously monitoring the status of individual battery vehicle (BV) as well as a carefully designed incentive scheme to attract sufficient participating BVs. However, the close monitoring tends to raise privacy concerns from the BV owners about identity and location information leakage, which have not been considered in previous works. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V2G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V2G network into practice. In V2G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protection rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable.

Utilities are becoming concerned about the potential stresses, performance degradations and overloads that may occur in distribution systems with multiple domestic PEV charging activities. Uncontrolled and random PEV charging can cause increased power losses, overloads and voltage fluctuations, which are all detrimental to the reliability and security of newly developing smart grids. Therefore, a real-time smart load management (RT-SLM) control strategy is proposed and developed for the coordination of PEV charging based on real-time (e.g., every 5 min) minimization of total cost of generating the energy plus the associated grid energy losses. The approach reduces generation cost by incorporating time-varying market energy prices and PEV owner preferred charging time zones based on priority selection. The RT-SLM algorithm appropriately considers random plug-in of PEVs and utilizes the maximum sensitivities selection (MSS) optimization. This approach enables PEVs to begin charging as soon as possible considering priority-charging time zones while complying with network operation criteria (such as losses, generation limits, and voltage profile).

The smart grid can have multiple configurations depending on the smart grid operating strategy and system conditions. In smart grids, DG could be operated either grid connected or islanded. Such flexible and variable configuration results in variable fault current levels which could impact the operation of the existing protective devices on the distribution system.

1351,"The arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) is expected to be one of the most essential components in smart grid systems for providing physical security and safety against electrical fire hazards caused by arc faults. As AFCIs are widely deployed as a part of mandatory installation requirements, a hierarchy consisting of multilevel AFCIs has been established, where a portable AFCI is connected serially to an outlet box AFCI. However, this multilevel AFCI structure causes serious problems when the AFCI detects arc faults in the surveillance area of its descendant AFCIs. This can cause de-energizing of the entire area covered by the upper-level AFCI, which may lead to blackouts over large areas. This paper proposes an integrated security framework comprised of physical and logical security measures as a solution for this problem. Firstly, the problem is tackled through communication between the hierarchy levels. Since the proposed system deals with physical security and safety, the communication must guarantee reliable message delivery within the specified deadlines. A controller area network (CAN) is chosen as the communication technology because it provides deterministic message delivery that meets the system requirements. Moreover, CAN has the advantages of verified performance and cost competitiveness through accelerated industrial adoption.

However, overcurrent protection of an islanded distribution system is still an issue due to the difference in fault current when the distribution system is connected to the grid and when it is islanded. This paper proposes the use of adaptive protection, using local information, to overcome the challenges of the overcurrent protection in distribution systems with distributed generation. The trip characteristics of the relays are updated by detecting operating states ( grid connected or island) and the faulted section.

They can also be used for continuous operation of doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines during faults. However, these devices are quite expensive and therefore cannot be used extensively. This paper explores the potential of a low-cost solution that utilizes the reactive power and voltage support capabilities of plug-in vehicles parked in charging stations (SmartParks) so that they can behave as virtual STATCOMs. For this solution, a 12-bus multimachine power system is considered wherein one of the conventional units is replaced by a 400 MW wind farm. Twelve SmartParks are developed and integrated into the test system. First, they are connected to a weak bus in the system and used in voltage control mode. Their performance is compared with a STATCOM of a similar rating. Next, the SmartParks are connected to the wind farm bus, and a coordinated reactive power control strategy is proposed to improve the fault-ride-through capability of the wind farm without exceeding the current limits of rotor and grid-side converters.

The scheduling problem is naturally cast as a Markov decision process. Algorithms to find decision thresholds for both noninterruptible and interruptible loads under a deadline constraint are then developed.

Efficient demand-supply balance and reducing electricity expenses and carbon emissions will be the immediate benefits of these applications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an in-home energy management (iHEM) application. The performance of iHEM is compared with an optimization-based residential energy management (OREM) scheme whose objective is to minimize the energy expenses of the consumers. We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM. On the other hand, iHEM application is more flexible as it allows communication between the controller and the consumer utilizing the wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN). We evaluate the performance of iHEM under the presence of local energy generation capability, prioritized appliances, and for real-time pricing.

In the static approach it is shown that negative secondary control is economically the most beneficial for electric vehicles because it offers the highest potential for charging with ""low-priced"" energy from negative regulation reserves. A Monte Carlo simulation using stochastic mobility behavior results in a 40% reduction of the power available for regulation compared to the static approach. Because of the high value of power in the regulation market, this finding has a strong impact on the resulting revenues. Further, we demonstrate that, for the data used, a pool size of 10 000 vehicles seems reasonable to balance the variation in each individual's driving behavior. In the case of the German regulation market, which uses monthly bids, a daily or hourly bid period is recommended. This adaptation would be necessary to provide individual regulation assuming that the vehicles are primarily used for mobility reasons and cannot deliver the same amount of power every hour of the week.",WOS:000208787500008,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Dallinger, D., Krampe, D. and Wietschel, M.","Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",16,10.1109/Tsg.2011.2131692,Jun,1949-3053,2,Ieee Transactions on Smart Grid,ancillary services,demand side management,electric vehicles,regulation reserves,vehicle-to-grid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,V29zy,302-313,15534,Journal Article,Vehicle-to-Grid Regulation Reserves Based on a Dynamic Simulation of Mobility Behavior,75,Vehicle-to-Grid Regulation Reserves Based on a Dynamic Simulation of Mobility Behavior,<Go to ISI>://WOS:000208787500008,2,2011

1377,"State estimation is a key element in today's power systems for reliable system operation and control. State estimation collects information from a large number of meter measurements and analyzes it in a centralized manner at the control center. Existing state estimation approaches were traditionally assumed to be able to tolerate and detect random bad measurements. They were, however, recently shown to be vulnerable to intentional false data injection attacks. This paper fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks, a special type of false data injection attacks, and analyzes their damage to power system operation in different time steps with different attacking resource limitations. Based on damaging effect analysis, we differentiate two attacking goals from the adversary's perspective, i.e., immediate attacking goal and delayed attacking goal. For the immediate attacking goal, this paper identifies the most damaging LR attack through a max-min attacker-defender model. Then, the criterion of determining effective protection strategies is explained. The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested on a 14-bus system. To the author's best knowledge, this is the first work of its kind, which quantitatively analyzes the damage of the false data injection attacks to power system operation and security.

1378,"Restructuring in power systems has introduced new complexities and difficulties in controlling of these systems. Therefore, new control strategies should be investigated in operation of power systems. On the other hand, communication infrastructure (CI) is responsible for establishing any control strategy. The purposes of this study are twofold: firstly, to design a communication infrastructure for any given power network with determined measurements; secondly, to compare communication infrastructures for centralized and decentralized control strategies in power grids. The comparison criteria are communication network cost, delay (latency), and reliability. In this study, hybrid state estimation (HSE), as one of the most important wide area measurement systems (WAMS), is opted. Communication infrastructures are designed for two different control strategies; centralized and decentralized (multi-area) HSE. These strategies have been investigated in IEEE 118-bus test network. Some new concepts, that help us to compare any two given communication infrastructures with each other, are introduced. Finally, two designed communication infrastructures for these two strategies are compared with each other.

1379,"There is increasing requests for noncontrollable distribution generation (DG) interconnections in the medium and low voltage networks. Many studies have suggested that with proper system planning, DG could provide benefits such as reliability enhancement, investment deferment, and reduced losses. However, without network reinforcements, the allowable interconnection capacity in a network is often restricted due to fault current level, voltage variation, and power flow constraints. This paper aims to address the issue of optimizing network operation and use for accommodating DG integrations. A new DG interconnection planning study framework that includes a coordinated feeder reconfiguration and voltage control to calculate the maximum allowable DG capacity at a given node in the distribution network is presented. A binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) technique is employed to solve the discrete nonlinear optimization problem and possible uncertainties associated with volatile renewable DG resource and loads are incorporated through a stochastic simulation approach.

1380,Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has been proposed as a way to increase the adoption rate of electric vehicles (EVs). Unidirectional V2G is especially attractive because it requires little if any additional infrastructure other than communication between the EV and an aggregator. The aggregator in turn combines the capacity of many EVs to bid into energy markets. In this work an algorithm for unidirectional regulation is developed for use by an aggregator. Several smart charging algorithms are used to set the point about which the rate of charge varies while performing regulation. An aggregator profit maximization algorithm is formulated with optional system load and price constraints analogous to the smart charging algorithms. Simulations on a hypothetical group of 10 000 commuter EVs in the Pacific Northwest verify that the optimal algorithms increase aggregator profits while reducing system load impacts and customer costs.,WOS:000208787400014,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Sortomme, E. and El-Sharkawi, M.

From these relationships, three optimal charging algorithms are developed which minimize the impacts of PHEV charging on the connected distribution system. The application of the algorithms to two test systems verifies these relationships approximately hold independent of system topology.

Our algorithm is a power network adaption of the worst configuration heuristics, originally developed to study low probability events in physics and failures in error-correction. One finding is that, if the normal operational mode of the grid is sufficiently healthy, the failure modes, also called instantons, are sufficiently sparse, i.e., the failures are caused by load fluctuations at only a few buses. The technique is useful for discovering weak links which are saturated at the instantons.

Because of the specific characteristics of the microgrid, such as the resistive lines and the high degree of power-electronically interfaced generators, new power control methods for the generators have been introduced. For the active power control in this paper, a variant of the conventional P/f droop control strategy is used, namely the voltage-droop controller. However, because of the small size of the microgrid and the high share of renewables with an intermittent character, new means of flexibility in power balancing are required to ensure stable operation. Therefore, a novel active load control strategy is presented in this paper. The aim is to render a proof of concept for this control strategy in an islanded microgrid.

In this paper we address this problem, and present a concise overview of several new results on how to construct simplified interarea models of large power networks by using dynamic measurements available from phasor measurement units (PMUs) installed at specific points on the transmission line. Our examples of study are motivated by widely encountered power transfer paths in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), namely, a two-area radial system representing the WA-MT flow, and a star-connected three-area system resembling the Pacific AC Intertie.",WOS:000208787400008,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Chakrabortty, A., Chow, J.

1393,"This paper proposes a wavelet-based method to obtain the characteristics of frequency and voltage derivatives for disturbance analysis. Frequency and voltage derivatives are important indicators to reflect the degree of disturbances and manifest power system dynamics. However, current computational methods for the indicators have noticeable drawbacks with respect to the accuracy. Wavelet transform-based multiresolution analysis (WT-based MRA) is introduced to obtain the characteristics of the indicators by computed maximum wavelet coefficients (WCs). Results from numerical experiments show a superior performance of WT-based MRA over the existing methods. Generation loss and load change as two major types of disturbances are studied to verify the proposed method. The disturbances are simulated in PSS/E for IEEE New England 39-bus system. The relationship of maximum WCs and power variation is discussed.

1394,"This paper presents a novel sectionalizing method for the build-up strategy in power system restoration. Power system restoration is the procedure of restoring power system elements after a partial or a complete blackout. Because of its economic and political importance, different strategies have been developed for a secure as well as fast restoration. One of the most practical and economical is the build-up strategy that includes the process of restoring separated parts (islands) in the power system and interconnecting them afterwards. This paper intends to develop a systematic algorithm for sectionalizing a power system considering various constraints such as black-start capability of generators, power supply-demand balance and independence of islands. Moreover, utilizing the Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS), each island will be fully observable in this method which is a crucial requirement for the restoration process. The New England 39 bus power system is used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm and verify the results.

By aggregating this response, the potential for demand response from 50% of Norwegian households can be estimated at 1000 MWh/h (4.2% of registered peak load demand in Norway).

These requirements are met by a specifically developed PMU, the characteristics and experimental characterization of which are illustrated in the paper. Three of these PMUs have been then used to monitor experimental tests carried out to assess the capability of a urban distribution network to operate autonomously when fed by a local 80 MW combined-cycle power plant.

1400,"Once a fault in microgrids has been cleared, it is necessary to restore the unfaulted but out-of-service loads as much as possible in a timely manner. This paper proposes a novel fully distributed multiagent based load restoration algorithm. According to the algorithm, each agent makes synchronized load restoration decision according to discovered information. During the information discovery process, agents only communicate with their direct neighbors, and the global information is discovered based on the Average-Consensus Theorem. In this way, total net power, indexes and demands of loads that are ready for restoration can be obtained. Then the load restoration problem can be modeled and solved using existing algorithms for the 0-1 Knapsack problem. To achieve adaptivity and stability, a distributed algorithm for coefficient setting is proposed and compared against existing algorithms and a particle swarm optimization based algorithm. Theoretically, the proposed load restoration algorithm can be applied to systems of any size and structure.

Among all the state-of-the-art technologies in building a smart power grid, the phasor measurement unit (PMU) is an important and promising one.

This paper reports an application of PMU data on locating the disturbance source for the low-frequency oscillation that has happened several times in the interconnected big power grids in China recently. The posterior analysis by the Electric Power System Research Institute of China (CEPRI) has confirmed that these low-frequency oscillations are caused by the resonance phenomena. It is urgent to find the disturbance source in case it happens again. However, there have been no systematic and effective methods to locate the disturbance in a very large power system. The trial and error method has been implemented via the digital simulations, but in vain. To overcome this problem, a novel method is developed in this paper to locate the disturbance source with the help of PMUs.

In this paper, we present an autonomous and distributed demand-side energy management system among users that takes advantage of a two-way digital communication infrastructure which is envisioned in the future smart grid. We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services.

However, in many countries these networks still operate in their traditional form, without offering the real-time operational characteristics which are essential for the utilization of the aforementioned practices. On the other hand, due to the extent of urban power distribution networks, as well as the substantial cost of medium voltage equipment, the full upgrade of these networks is in most cases not a feasible option. In this work, alternative options of selective automation upgrade in power distribution networks are offered, corresponding to the desired operational status of these networks.

1413,"Recent research shows that 20%-30% of building energy consumption can be saved through optimized operation and management without changing the building structure and the hardware configuration of the energy supply system. Therefore, there is a huge potential for building energy savings through efficient operation. Microgrid technology provides an opportunity and a desirable infrastructure for improving the efficiency of energy consumption in buildings. The key to improve building energy efficiency in operation is to coordinate and optimize the operation of various energy sources and loads. In this paper, the scheduling problem of building energy supplies is considered with the practical background of a low energy building. The objective function is to minimize the overall cost of electricity and natural gas for a building operation over a time horizon while satisfying the energy balance and complicated operating constraints of individual energy supply equipment and devices. The uncertainties are captured and their impact is analyzed by the scenario tree method. Numerical testing is performed with the data of the pilot low energy building. The testing results show that significant energy cost savings can be achieved through integrated scheduling and control of various building energy supply sources.

1414,"Microgrids are a rapidly growing sector of smart grids, which will be an essential component in the trend toward distributed electricity generation. In the operation of a microgrid, forecasting the short-term load is an important task. With a more accurate short-term loaf forecast (STLF), the microgrid can enhance the management of its renewable and conventional resources and improve the economics of energy trade with electricity markets. However, STLF for microgrids is a complex forecast process, mainly because of the highly nonsmooth and nonlinear behavior of the load time series. In this paper, characteristics of the load time series of a typical microgrid are discussed and the differences with the load time series of traditional power systems are described. In addition, a new bilevel prediction strategy is proposed for STLF of microgrids. The proposed strategy is composed of a feature selection technique and a forecast engine (including neural network and evolutionary algorithm) in the lower level as the forecaster and an enhanced differential evolution algorithm in the upper level for optimizing the performance of the forecaster.

In this paper, wide-area-severity indices (WASI) derived from PMU measurements serve as the basis for building fast catastrophe predictors using random-forest (RF) learning. Given the randomness in the ensemble of decision trees (DTs) stacked in the RF model, it can provide at the recall stage not only an early assessment of the stable/unstable status of an ongoing contingency but also a probability outcome which quantifies the confidence level of the decision. This methodology, which to the best of our knowledge is new to the dynamic security assessment (DSA) of power systems, is also very effective in evaluating the importance of and interaction among the various WASI input features. Our research unexpectedly showed that the ensemble of trees in the RF is very robust in the presence of small changes in the training data and generalize across widely different network dynamics. Thus, the same RF performed very well on a large database with more than 60 000 instances from a test system (10%) and an actual (90%) system combined.

The decision-support tool optimizes energy services provision by enabling end users to first assign values to desired energy services, and then scheduling their available distributed energy resources (DER) to maximize net benefits. We chose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near-optimal schedules within manageable computation times. We improve the basic formulation of cooperative PSO by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles. The improved DER schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated DER scheduling. This is computed by comparing the end-user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all DER, against the costs when each DER schedule is solved separately. This comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs, available DER and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem, or instead, decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations.",WOS:000208787200003,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Pedrasa, M.

1426,"Real-time electricity pricing models can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages compared to the current common flat rates. In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios. Therefore, the deployment of the proposed optimal energy consumption scheduling schemes is beneficial for both end users and utility companies.",WOS:000208787200002,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Mohsenian-Rad, A.

Much of the technology currently in use by the grid is outdated and in many cases unreliable. There have been three major blackouts in the past ten years. The reliance on old technology leads to inefficient systems, costing unnecessary money to the utilities, consumers, and taxpayers. To upgrade the grid, and to operate an improved grid, will require significant dependence on distributed intelligence and broadband communication capabilities. The access and communications capabilities require the latest in proven security technology for extremely large, wide-area communications networks.

1432,"Recently, many utility companies have been adding synchrophasor measurement capability to their systems. Synchrophasors can provide operators with additional information about current system state, and can be used to improve the accuracy of state estimation. Currently, many transmission operators do not have the ability to process, store, and utilize the data from their own phasor measurement units (PMUs) locally; instead, they rely on larger data concentrators located elsewhere. We present a design for a phasor system, called the flexible integrated phasor system (FIPS), to provide a more flexible, lower cost alternative to provide independent system operators and transmission owners ready access to their phasor data.

1433,"In order to design an efficient communication scheme and examine the efficiency of any networked control architecture in smart grid applications, we need to characterize statistically its information source, namely the power grid itself. Investigating the statistical properties of power grids has the immediate benefit of providing a natural simulation platform, producing a large number of power grid test cases with realistic topologies, with scalable network size, and with realistic electrical parameter settings. The second benefit is that one can start analyzing the performance of decentralized control algorithms over information networks whose topology matches that of the underlying power network and use network scientific approaches to determine analytically if these architectures would scale well. With these motivations, in this paper we study both the topological and electrical characteristics of power grid networks based on a number of synthetic and real-world power systems. The most interesting discoveries include: the power grid is sparsely connected with obvious small-world properties; its nodal degree distribution can be well fitted by a mixture distribution coming from the sum of a truncated geometric random variable and an irregular discrete random variable; the power grid has very distinctive graph spectral density and its algebraic connectivity scales as a power function of the network size; the line impedance has a heavy-tailed distribution, which can be captured quite accurately by a clipped double Pareto lognormal distribution. Based on the discoveries mentioned above, we propose an algorithm that generates random topology power grids featuring the same topology and electrical characteristics found from the real data.",WOS:000208787100005,Ieee T Smart Grid,"Wang, Z.

From this and subsequent activities with industry, academia, and other research institutions, the concepts and vision of an interactive and adaptable electricity system emerged; a vision that is now commonly referred to as smart grid. Supported by significant federal investment announced in 2009, the DOE, its national laboratories, and industry partners are now making significant strides in smart grid deployments, demonstrations, and research. An imperative underlying these activities is that they contribute to ensuring the steps taken in transitioning toward a smart grid retain a system with dependable performance to the economy and society it services.

The cost arising from the battery charging and the revenue obtained by providing the regulation are investigated and represented mathematically. Some design considerations of the aggregator are also discussed together with practical constraints such as the energy restriction of the batteries. The cost function with constraints enables us to construct an optimization problem.

1436,"In this paper we assume that time synchronized measurements will be ubiquitously available at all high-voltage substations at very high rates. We examine how this information can be utilized more effectively for real-time operation as well as for subsequent decision making. This new information available in real time is different, both in quality and in quantity, than the real-time measurements available today. The promise of new and improved applications to operate the power system more reliably and efficiently has been recognized but is still in conceptual stages. Also, the present system to handle this real-time data has been recognized to be inadequate but even conceptual designs of such infrastructure needed to store and communicate the data are in their infancy. In this paper, we first suggest the requirements for an information infrastructure to handle ubiquitous phasor measurements recognizing that the quantity and rate of data would make it impossible to store all the data centrally as done today. Then we discuss the new and improved applications, classified into two categories: one is the set of automatic wide-area controls and the other is the set of control center (EMS) functions with special attention to the state estimator.

1437,"Demand response (DR), distributed generation (DG), and distributed energy storage (DES) are important ingredients of the emerging smart grid paradigm. For ease of reference we refer to these resources collectively as distributed energy resources (DER). Although much of the DER emerging under smart grid are targeted at the distribution level, DER, and more specifically DR resources, are considered important elements for reliable and economic operation of the transmission system and the wholesale markets. In fact, viewed from transmission and wholesale operations, sometimes the term ""virtual power plant"" is used to refer to these resources. In the context of energy and ancillary service markets facilitated by the independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission organizations (RTOs), the market products DER/DR can offer may include energy, ancillary services, and/or capacity, depending on the ISO/RTO market design and applicable operational standards. In this paper we first explore the main industry drivers of smart grid and the different facets of DER under the smart grid paradigm. We then concentrate on DR and summarize the existing and evolving programs at different ISOs/RTOs and the product markets they can participate in.

1438,"Certain smart grid technologies can reduce the number of customers affected by prolonged outages, and thereby increase reliability through automated switching to restore service. Such technologies are useful, but reactive in nature, performing their function only after a fault occurs and an outage has been detected. They must presume that nonfaulted feeder sections and alternative feeders are healthy and capable of carrying increased power flow. Research at Texas A&M University has demonstrated that sophisticated, automated real-time analysis of feeder electrical waveforms can be used to predict failures and assess the health of distribution lines and line apparatus. Reliability can be substantially improved by detecting, locating, and repairing incipient failures before catastrophic failure, often before an outage occurs. Requirements for data and computation are substantially greater than for devices like digital relays and power-quality meters, but feasible with modern electronics. This paper provides selected examples of failures that have been predicted by intelligent distribution fault anticipation (DFA) algorithms. The data requirements and processing analysis to detect these failures are discussed. The problems related to full-scale deployment of the proposed system in a utility-wide application are presented.

1439,"Considerable developments in the real-time telemetry of demand-side systems allow independent system operators (ISOs) to use reserves provided by demand response (DR) in ancillary service markets. Currently, many ISOs have designed programs to utilize the reserve provided by DR in electricity markets. This paper presents a stochastic model to schedule reserves provided by DR in the wholesale electricity markets. Demand-side reserve is supplied by demand response providers (DRPs), which have the responsibility of aggregating and managing customer responses. A mixed-integer representation of reserve provided by DRPs and its associated cost function are used in the proposed stochastic model. The proposed stochastic model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) problem. The first-stage involves network-constrained unit commitment in the base case and the second-stage investigates security assurance in system scenarios. The proposed model would schedule reserves provided by DRPs and determine commitment states of generating units and their scheduled energy and spinning reserves in the scheduling horizon.
