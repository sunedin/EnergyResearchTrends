If realized, this could provide reference inputs to proactive control and protection systems which could enhance not only system stability but also operational economics through, for example, more informed ancillary reserve planning using knowledge of prevailing system conditions and stability margins. Performing these predictions in real time is a significant challenge owing to the complex stochastic and temporal relationships between available measurements. This paper proposes a statistical model capable of estimating system inertia in real time through observed steady-state and relatively small frequency variations; it is trained to learn the features that inter-relate steady-state averaged frequency variations and system inertia, using historical system data demonstrated over two consecutive years. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a Gaussian Mixture Model with temporal dependence encoded as Markov chains. Applied to the U.K. power system, it produces an optimized mean squared error within 0.1 s(2) for 95% of the daily estimation if being calibrated on a half-hourly basis and maintains robustness through measurement interruptions of up to a period of two hours.",WOS:000382477600006,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Cao, X., Stephen, B., Abdulhadi, I.

704,,"This paper explores the impact that different network access arrangements have on the capacity factor of non-firm wind generator connections to distribution networks. Active network management (ANM) projects are increasing in application in distribution networks as the need to integrate distributed generation becomes a more serious challenge. An important aspect of ANM is the contractual arrangement of the participating generation developer and network operator parties. These are sometimes referred to as ""Principles of Access"" (PoA) and deals with the rights of the generator when curtailment of generation output is required to maintain the network within its limits. Currently, a Last in First Off (LIFO) PoA is implemented in most U.K. ANM deployments and is the prevailing PoA in the Orkney ANM scheme. The Orkney network is used in this paper as a case study to analyze different PoA and compare the renewable energy capacity factor (CF) which result from these arrangements. The archival value of this paper is in the application of optimal power flow (OPF) to the PoA analysis challenge, in the quantification of the impact of previously identified PoA and in the conclusions drawn on the implications of different PoA choices for ANM schemes at the current early stage of ANM deployment.",WOS:000353640300013,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Kane, L. and Ault, G.

1081,,"Active Network Management is a philosophy for the operation of distribution networks with high penetrations of renewable distributed generation. Technologies such as energy storage and flexible demand are now beginning to be included in Active Network Management (ANM) schemes. Optimizing the operation of these schemes requires consideration of intertemporal linkages as well as network power flow effects. Network effects are included in optimal power flow (OPF) solutions but this only optimizes for a single point in time. Dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) is an extension of OPF to cover multiple time periods. This paper reviews the generic formulation of DOPF before developing a framework for modeling energy technologies with intertemporal characteristics in an ANM context. The framework includes the optimization of nonfirm connected generation, principles of access for nonfirm generators, energy storage, and flexible demand. Two objectives based on maximizing export and revenue are developed and a case study is used to illustrate the technique. Results show that DOPF is able to successfully schedule these energy technologies. DOPF schedules energy storage and flexible demand to reduce generator curtailment significantly in the case study. Finally, the role of DOPF in analyzing ANM schemes is discussed with reference to extending the optimization framework to include other technologies and objectives.",WOS:000329035000013,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Gill, S., Kockar, I. and Ault, G.

1240,,The existence of locally optimal solutions to the AC optimal power flow problem (OPF) has been a question of interest for decades. This paper presents examples of local optima on a variety of test networks including modified versions of common networks. We show that local optima can occur because the feasible region is disconnected and/or because of nonlinearities in the constraints. Standard local optimization techniques are shown to converge to these local optima. The voltage bounds of all the examples in this paper are between +/- 5% and +/- 10% off-nominal. The examples with local optima are available in an online archive (http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/optenergy/LocalOpt/) and can be used to test local or global optimization techniques for OPF.

1296,,"With increasing wind penetration, it is likely that wind power plant will be expected to provide frequency response in support of the power system, in particular some form of inertial response. In these circumstances it is important to accurately quantify the type of inertial response available from wind plant (typically a wind farm) and how it is affected by varying wind conditions. Two different control schemes to provide this ""synthetic"" inertial response are investigated. The benefits of the non-standard control scheme are demonstrated by comparing the response with the conventional ""ideal"" inertial control scheme that exactly emulates synchronous generators in terms of their provision of inertial response. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic approach for estimation of the aggregate inertial response available from a wind farm by using a Gaussian probability distribution to model wind turbulence. The aggregate inertial response calculated in this way has been examined at various mean wind speed levels and has the advantage that it automatically takes into account wind speed variations during the transient event itself.",WOS:000322989900024,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Wu, L. and Infield, D.

Following a brief introduction to the charging characteristics of EV batteries, a statistical model is presented for predicting the EV charging load.

Four scenarios of various combinations of EV penetration levels and charging modes are considered in the study. A series of numerical solutions to the optimization problem in these scenarios are obtained by serial quadratic programming. The results show that EV charging load has significant potential to improve the daily load profile of power systems if the charging loads are optimally distributed. It is demonstrated that flattened load profiles may be achieved at all EV penetration levels if the EVs are charged through a fast charging mode.

Charging such vehicles will impose additional demands on the electricity network but given the pattern of vehicle usage, the possibility exists to discharge the stored energy back to the grid when required, for example when lower than expected wind generation is available. Such vehicle-to-grid operation could see vehicle owners supplying the grid if they are rewarded for providing such services. This paper describes a model of an electric vehicle storage system integrated with a standardized power system (the IEEE 30-node power system model). A decision-making strategy is established for the deployment of the battery energy stored, taking account of the state of charge, time of day, electricity prices and vehicle charging requirements. Applying empirical data, the benefits to the network in terms of load balancing and the energy and cost savings available to the vehicle owner are analyzed. The results show that for the case under study, the EVs have only a minor impact on the network in terms of distribution system losses and voltage regulation but more importantly the vehicle owner's costs are roughly halved.",WOS:000303205500047,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Ma, Y.

A new balanced genetic algorithm (BGA) is introduced that improves the intensification of the solution search procedure by trading-off diversification ability. This facilitates searching for the optimal solution, but also the efficient production of suboptimal solutions for the planner to take into consideration. The features of the BGA allow a multistage planning problem to be solved more efficiently; the BGA can consider a set of expansion plans in an early planning stage in a single run and produce planning strategies required to solve network problems in a later stage along the planning horizon. The overall performance of each plan under different uncertain scenarios is evaluated using a modified data envelopment analysis to assist decisions on which solution to adopt. The approach is applied to a multistage ""greenfield"" distribution network expansion problem considering scenarios for the location of future loads.

2149,,"This paper presents a methodology for modeling and analyzing the load demand in a distribution system due to electric vehicle (EV) battery charging. Following a brief introduction to the common types of EV batteries and their charging characteristics, an analytical solution for predicting the EV charging load is developed. The method is stochastically formulated so as to account for the stochastic nature of the start time of individual battery charging and the initial battery state-of-charge. A comparative study is carried out by simulating four EV charging scenarios, i.e., uncontrolled domestic charging, uncontrolled off-peak domestic charging, ""smart"" domestic charging and uncontrolled public charging-commuters capable of recharging at the workplace. The proposed four EVs charging scenarios take into account the expected future changes to the electricity tariffs in the electricity market place and appropriate regulation of EVs battery charging loads. A typical U.K. distribution system is adopted as an example. The time-series data of EV charging loads is taken from two commercially available EV batteries: lead-acid and lithium-ion. Results show that a 10% market penetration of EVs in the studied system would result in an increase in daily peak demand by up to 17.9%, while a 20% level of EV penetration would lead to a 35.8% increase in peak load, for the scenario of uncontrolled domestic charging-the ""worst-case"" scenario.",WOS:000289904200032,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Qian, K.

2167,,"The problem of minimizing losses in distribution networks has traditionally been investigated using a single, deterministic demand level. This has proved to be effective since most approaches are generally able to also result in minimum overall energy losses. However, the increasing penetration of (firm and variable) distributed generation (DG) raises concerns on the actual benefits of loss minimization studies that are limited to a single demand/ generation scenario. Here, a multiperiod AC optimal power flow (OPF) is used to determine the optimal accommodation of (renewable) DG in a way that minimizes the system energy losses. In addition, control schemes expected to be part of the future Smart Grid, such as coordinated voltage control and dispatchable DG power factor, are embedded in the OPF formulation to explore the extra loss reduction benefits that can be harnessed with such technologies. The trade-off between energy losses and more generation capacity is also investigated. The methodology is applied to a generic U.

The DG contributions to system security provided by U. K.

2349,,"In this paper an analytical method by which the transient stability of an induction machine is maintained regardless of the fault clearance times is introduced. The method can be applied in order to improve the transient stability of a large penetration of low-voltage (LV) connected microgeneration that can be directly interfaced by single-phase induction generators within domestic premises. The analysis investigates the effectiveness of using resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters (RSFCLs) as remedial measures to prevent the microgenerators from reaching their speed limits during remote faults, and hence improving their transient stability. This will prevent unnecessary disconnection of a large penetration of LV-connected microgeneration and thus avoiding the sudden appearance of hidden loads, and unbalanced voltage conditions. The minimum required value of a resistive element of RSFCL for mitigating the transient instability phenomena of LV-connected microgeneration based on the system and connected machine parameters is determined. The analytical method has been validated by conducting informative transient studies by using detailed models of a small microwind turbine with constant mechanical output interfaced directly within residential dwellings by a single-phase induction generator, a transient model of resistive superconducting fault current limiter (RSFCL), and a typical suburban distribution network with residential loads.

Active network management (ANM) will play a major role in this but there is a continuing need to demonstrate the benefit in facilitating connection of new generation without the need for traditional reinforcements. This paper proposes a multi-period AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based technique for evaluating the maximum capacity of new variable distributed generation able to be connected to a distribution network when ANM control strategies are in place. The ANM schemes embedded into the OPF include coordinated voltage control, adaptive power factor and energy curtailment. A generic U.

Results clearly show that very high penetration levels of new variable generation capacity can be achieved by considering ANM strategies compared to the widely used passive operation (i.e., ""fit and forget"").

The voltage step change that occurs on the sudden disconnection of a distributed generator is one of the areas of concern for distribution network operators in determining whether DG can be connected, although there are differences in utility practice in applying limits. To explore how voltage step limits influence the amount of DG that can be connected within a distribution network, voltage step constraints have been incorporated within an established optimal power flow (OPF) based method for determining the capacity of the network to accommodate DG. The analysis shows that strict voltage step constraints have a more significant impact on ability of the network to accommodate DG than placing the same bound on voltage rise.

2983,,"A novel methodology is proposed for the customer security assessment with high penetration of wind power in modern distribution networks. The customer security is quantified through customer damage costs by operating wind farms without standing reserve, which causes an inadequate supply of power to meet loads at some operating conditions. Necessary reserve to mitigate intermittency of wind is quantified through shed load. The ability to estimate a network firm import capacity that can be replaced with a wind plant, which is operated with the necessary reserve, is an added advantage of the approach. Monte Carlo simulation is the prime tool of the assessment, which incorporates linear programming-based re-dispatching of generation and load shedding to eliminate constraint violations. Steady-state analysis is used for the assessment incorporating random contingencies, subsequent tripping, intermittency of wind power, and demand variations. A case study is presented considering a medium voltage island network that has a grid connection, and this is used to demonstrate the customer security assessment integrating uncertainty models and a formulation to extract the impact of intermittency.",WOS:000248352100053,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Jayaweera, D., Burt, G. and McDonald, J.

3024,,"This paper proposes an innovative. way of making a decision to island (or synchronize) distributed generators when operating conditions of a distribution system are varied. Islanding decisions are made when a network undergoes disturbances. In this approach, there is a decision-making mechanism, which samples states of the network operating condition to either synchronize or island in an identified period of time. Decision making is achieved through extended sequential sampling, which manages generator states within specific time periods. The approach can minimize the duration of islanded operation and manage generators' re-connection to the grid. Use of the proposed mechanism and sampling approach offer benefits over conventional relays; incorrect operations due to errors in measurements are reduced because the operational actions are not based on a single decision sample, but instead rely on extended sequential sampling over a number of samples. A case study is investigated using the IEEE 30-bus test system and the results are presented for this new approach.",WOS:000246271100002,Ieee T Power Syst,,"Jayaweera, D., Galloway, S., Burt, G. and McDonald, J.

The constraints imposed by fault levels are converted to simple nonlinear (inequality) constraints, described by variables of the conventional OPF.

In the first stage, operating points of the conventional power plants are determined. The second stage realizes generation from the renewable resources and optimally accommodates it by relying on the demand-side flexibilities. The proposed model is illustrated on a 4-bus and a 39-bus system. Numerical results show that substantial benefits in terms of redispatch costs can be achieved with the help of demand side flexibilities.

Smart grids containing tens, or hundreds, of wind generators require skilled very-short-term forecasts to operate effectively and spatial information is highly desirable. In addition, probabilistic forecasts are widely regarded as necessary for optimal power system management as they quantify the uncertainty associated with point forecasts. Here, we work within a parametric framework based on the logit-normal distribution and forecast its parameters. The location parameter for multiple wind farms is modeled as a vector-valued spatio-temporal process and the scale parameter is tracked by modified exponential smoothing. A state-of-the-art technique for fitting sparse vector autoregressive models is employed to model the location parameter and demonstrates numerical advantages over conventional vector autoregressive models. The proposed method is tested on a dataset of 5 min mean wind power generation at 22 wind farms in Australia.

To enable flexible expansion options to national/international systems, it is suggested to interconnect star points of radial systems using dc/dc converters.

This paper introduces a new protection scheme based on the initial current traveling wave utilizing an improved mathematical morphology (MM) technology, with simplified polarity detection and new logics introduced for meshed networks and feeders with single-end measurement. The proposed protection scheme provides ultrafast response and can be adapted to varied system operational modes, topologies, fault conditions, and load conditions. Only low-bandwidth communication is required to achieve high-speed operation and adequate discrimination level in meshed networks. Simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC verifies both the sensitivity and stability of the proposed protection scheme under different microgrid operational scenarios.",WOS:000342163500005,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Li, X.

9037,,This paper presents a high speed current differential implementation approach for smart dc distribution systems capable of sub-millisecond fault detection. The approach utilizes the natural characteristics of dc differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection times compared to standard applications and hence meet requirements for dc converter protection (around 2 ms). Analysis is first developed to help quantify protection implementation challenges for a given dc system. Options for implementing the proposed technique are then illustrated. Results of scaled hardware testing are presented which validate the overall protection operating times in a low voltage environment. These results show the implementation approach can consistently achieve protection system operating within the order of a few microseconds.,WOS:000342163500048,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Fletcher, S. D.

9043,,"It is generally accepted that if dynamic electricity pricing tariffs were to be introduced, their effectiveness in controlling domestic loads will be curtailed if consumers were relied on to respond in their own interests. The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage.

9046,,"Low voltage direct current (LVDC) distribution systems have the potential to support future realization of smart grids and enabling of increased penetration of distributed renewables, electric vehicles, and heat pumps. They do, however, present significant protection challenges that existing schemes based on dc fuses and conventional electro-mechanical circuit breakers cannot manage due to the nature of dc faults and slow device performance. Therefore, this paper presents an advanced protection scheme that addresses the outstanding challenges for protecting an LVDC last mile distribution network. The scheme takes advantage of advanced local measurements and communications that will be naturally integrated in smart grids, and the excellent level of controllability of solid state circuit breakers. It thus provides fast dc fault detection and interruption during dc transient periods, in addition to achieving fault limitation and fast reliable restoration. The introductory part of the paper quantifies the potential benefits of LVDC last mile distribution networks, and discusses the potential LVDC architectures that best utilize the existing plant. Based on the new LVDC architectures, a typical U.K. LV network is energized using dc and modeled, and is used as a case study for investigating the protection issues and evaluating the new protection scheme performance through simulation.",WOS:000342163500047,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Emhemed, A.

9195,,"With conventional generation capacity being constrained on environmental grounds and renewable alternatives carrying capacity uncertainties, increasingly accurate forecasts of demand are likely to be required in future power systems: highly distributed renewable generation penetrating low voltage networks must be matched to small dynamic loads, while spinning reserves of conventional generation that are required to maintain security of supply, must be reduced to more efficient margins. Domestic loads, likely to form significant proportions of the loads on islanded power systems such as those in remote rural communities, are currently modeled with homogenous and coarse load profiles developed from aggregated data. An objective of AMR deployment is to clarify the nature and variability of the residential LV customer. In this paper, an algorithm for tracking the consistency of the behavior of small loads is presented. This would allow them to be assessed for their availability to provide demand services to the grid. In the method presented, significant changes in behavior are detected using Bayesian changepoint analysis which tracks a multivariate Gaussian representation of a residential load profile on a day to day basis. A hypothetical single phase feeder, representative of an islanded rural power system, is used to illustrate the detected heterogeneity of load behavior consistency.",WOS:000331985300036,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Stephen, B., Isleifsson, F.

9200,,"Generation connected to electrical distribution systems requires reliable and timely detection of loss-of-mains (islanding). Passive loss-of-mains detection relays typically use measurements of parameters such as frequency, phase, and the magnitudes of voltage and current. If a part of the power network becomes islanded and there is a very close match between generation and demand of both active and reactive power, there is a risk that the relay will not be able to detect the loss-of-mains (LOM) event quickly, or perhaps at all. This is the ""non-detection zone""or NDZ. This paper proposes a combination of 2 generator control techniques which allow the NDZ to be avoided even when the generator has significant inertia. Firstly, the natural instability (when islanded) of a grid-connected control scheme consisting of integral and droop controls is recognized and exploited. Secondly, a simple strategy is added which makes occasional small, steady-state adjustments to the reactive power output of the generator. The scheme has been tested in the laboratory and shows that the 2 second detection time required by IEEE 1547 can be achieved, even when an exact match of active power generation and demand is initially configured, and the generator has a significant inertia.",WOS:000331985300007,Ieee T Smart Grid,,"Roscoe, A.

9267,,"This paper presents an evaluation of the main characteristics of two power flow management (PFM) methodologies against a traditional inter-trip approach typically used by distribution network operators. The two PFM algorithms were developed, by the authors, for real-time operation with an aim to implement them in distribution networks with growing penetrations of renewable DG. The first PFM approach is modelled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), while the second is based on an optimal power flow (OPF) approach. These PFM algorithms are deployed on real substation hardware to simulate the monitoring and control of MV distribution network power flows through DG real power regulation. Multiple scenarios are presented to the closed-loop PFM test environment to demonstrate the algorithms ability of detecting and alleviating thermal overloads and recognizing when the constraint has passed. The main objective of this paper is the quantification of the resultant curtailment levels, for the two approaches, which are compared to that of a traditional inter-trip scheme for the same circuit overload duration.

The study compares four semiconductor-based devices for dc fault isolation: series hybrid dc breaker, half bridge and full bridge dc chopper, and LCL thyristor converter. The study considers performance of devices, costs and losses, and also application with larger dc grids. A hybrid dc CB has lowest losses, but the component sizing crucially depends on the speed of fault detection. It is demonstrated that fast communication between various devices in the dc grid is mandatory but might be very challenging. On the other hand, dc choppers and LCL converter component sizing is not dependent on the speed of protection, and there is no need for communication across dc grids. Additionally, they offer the capability of voltage stepping and dc cable power regulation. The LCL converter provides inherent fault current interruption and needs no overrating for dc faults. It also gives better efficiency compared to dc choppers.

9594,,"The characteristic behavior of physically compact, multiterminal dc networks under electrical fault conditions can produce demanding protection requirements. This represents a significant barrier to more widespread adoption of dc power distribution for microgrid applications. Protection schemes have been proposed within literature for such networks based around the use of non-unit protection methods. This paper shows however that there are severe limitations to the effectiveness of such schemes when employed for more complex microgrid network architectures. Even current differential schemes, which offer a more effective, though costly, protection solution, must be carefully designed to meet the design requirements resulting from the unique fault characteristics of dc microgrids. This paper presents a detailed analysis of dc microgrid behavior under fault conditions, illustrating the challenging protection requirements and demonstrating the shortcomings of non-unit approaches for these applications. Whilst the performance requirements for the effective operation of differential schemes in dc microgrids are shown to be stringent, the authors show how these may be met using COTS technologies.
